            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Epistle to the Reader.</head>
            <p>IT hath always (Judicious Reader) among the wisest of men been
esteemed a Task most difficult, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Histories of those Times
wherein the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons chiefly concerned might (yet living) behold their great or
more minute Actions unmasked or displayed to the world; And therefore most have
been, and still are of opinion, That such an Attempt ought not to be made by
any but a Person of so resolute a Temper as might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be swayed by Fear
nor Flattery, nor yet steered by an over-weaning Opinion; for whilst the Biass
runs on the first side men dare not speak even the truth it self; the second
glosses even bad Actions, as if to the World it would make Vice appear Virtue;
and the third represents things not as indeed they were, or were intended, but
as we fondly imagine or conceive them.</p>
            <p>The Task performed by the Learned <hi>Capriata,</hi> Author of the
ensuing History, was not only of this difficult Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but had likewise many
other Embroils and Entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements sufficient to have daunted any less Judicious
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker, so many both particular and interwoven Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of a number of
petty Princes (though all united or relying upon those three great Ones, of the
Church, King of <hi>France,</hi> and King of <hi>Spain)</hi> being sufficient
to create such infinite Entrigues as were not to be cleared or descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed but
by a great and perspicacious Intelligence: And yet hath our Learned Author
waded through all these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, and by taking no less care in clearing
the Causes then describing the Effects of these late <hi>Italian</hi>
Dissentions deservedly gained the name of an Excellent Historian.</p>
            <p>And it was certainly a true and deliberate knowledge of all this
and more that induced the ever to be Honoured <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> (after having made so many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Italian</hi> Pieces
speak <hi>English,</hi> with an Industry sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <pb facs="tcp:53250:3"/> found in the
Nobility of our Nation) to make choice of this, which is now become the
Posthume Child of so Excellent a Parent, and which may look (though there needs
no farther Remembrancer of his never dying Fame) like a new Phoenix raising it
self out of his ashes.</p>
            <p>And surely besides the Excellency of the Composure and Delicacy of
the Stile, he was invited or enticed by Delights far more sublime to the
Translation of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. To find what Causes should engage the Potent
Monarchs of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> in the Quarrels and Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of these little Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and how their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests are
involved or dependent, must needs be pleasant; To trace the Policies of the
grave <hi>Spaniard</hi> and sober <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> accounted Crafts-Masters
in that Art, cannot be less delightful; but to behold such a connexion of
Entrigues, as if the whole Tragedy were rather a Comedy, where the end of one
Act leaves but a greater desire and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what shall succeed in the
next, must needs be the most agreeable of all.</p>
            <p>These, or such like, might possibly be the Motives or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives
of the Earl of <hi>Monmouth</hi> to continue (with a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Soul) to
communicate the Excellencies of Forreign Nations to his own Countrey-men, which
else must have been hidden to all except himself or some few more who by Travel
or Industry might have learnt the <hi>Italian</hi> Tongue; unless some other
Worthy Spirit, like to his, would have undertaken so good a Work, though few
are now found so industriously to prosecute the Publick Good.</p>
            <p>But lest, being hurried into a Discourse that may possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
require a Satyre, I should obstruct my intended brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, give me leave to
assert thus much, (omitting all that I might say of my own Judgment or
Experience) and I think I may do it without <hi>Hyperbole;</hi> That the
History in its Original must needs be Excellent, because the Earl of
<hi>Monmouth</hi> made choice of it to Translate; and the Translation cannot be
ill rendred, because the Earl of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did it, who was Master both
of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Tongues.</p>

  endeavours to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect his design on that side; but meeting with strong
  opposition there also, he is forced to return; and passing again with some men
  over the <hi>Poe,</hi> he tarries with them in <hi>Nizza,</hi> till such time
  as the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> going with the body of the Army into the
  Confines of <hi>Novara,</hi> to annoy that part of the State, may divert the
  Governour from guarding the grand Trench, and leave free passage by that way
  for the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> Who by severall accidents abandoning the
  design, marched with a few men towards the Sea; where getting into a little
  Vessel he passeth <hi>Incognito</hi> into <hi>Lavigiana,</hi> and gets into his

  the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is forc'd to abandon the Trench, and defend <hi>Millain.</hi>
  And going with all his men towards the Enemies Camp, he assaults it in

  Governour seeing the State freed of the Enemies Army, betakes himself, partly,
  to recover the Towns taken by the Enemy, partly, to resent himself on
  <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s State; and having sent what
  Forces he could thither, he proceeds so far, as the Duke who was retired to
  <hi>Piacenza</hi> maintains a siege till such time as, seeing no succour, he is
  forc'd to compound with the Governour. The Warr of <hi>Parma</hi> being
  appeased, the Governour turns upon the Towns in the <hi>Langhe,</hi> which were
  yet held by the Enemy; and having taken some of them, he hears that the Duke
  raiseth Forces in the <hi>Canavese;</hi> he marcheth towards him, and having in

  <hi>Millain</hi> goes to before <hi>Vercelli,</hi> and after a long Siege takes
  it upon Articles. The Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> assisted by the Spaniards and

  Prince; the Governour finding it impossible to bring the succour by that way,

  to the Camp; so as they would have been quickly made to remove, had not the
  Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> who was impatient of delay, made the Governour to fall
  upon the Enemies Trenches, and to relieve him so; which falling out
  unfortunately, and the Governour not thinking himself any longer safe in his
  quarters beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> returns to his quarters upon the Hills, where
  he tarried, assisting the besieged in what he was able, till the City was
  surrendred; which hapned two moneths, and eleven dayes, after the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

                  <hi>FRancis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and
  <hi>Montferrate,</hi> being dead, <hi>Charles Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel,</hi> Duke of
  <hi>Savoy,</hi> pretends the return of his Daughter <hi>Margaret,</hi> Wife to
  the late <hi>Francis</hi> into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> together with <hi>Mary</hi>
  her only Daughter. Cardinal <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> Brother and Successor to
  <hi>Francis,</hi> retards his Sister in Law's return, and keeps his Niece in
  <hi>Mantua:</hi> Hereupon differences arise between the two Dukes; wherefore
  the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> renewing his ancient claim to <hi>Montferrat,</hi>
  which was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by his Predecessors, assaults that State at unawares;
  possesseth himself of the Cities of <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Trino;</hi>
  indeavours the like of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calvo,</hi> but not being able to get the Fort,
  levies people to take it. The Condition of <hi>Italy</hi> is also given in the

  pretences to <hi>Montferrate</hi> is discoursed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and many other Interests
  and Accidents which occurred between the said Duke, and the Court of
  <hi>Spain,</hi> at several Times, and upon divers Occasions.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>ITALY</hi> hoped long to continue that Peace which She had
already injoyed for so many years, when by the unexpected death of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, King of <hi>France,</hi> she was freed of the great
sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of War, which she had cause to apprehend, by reason of the great
preparations of that Kingdom: This hope was much augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when
<hi>Philip</hi> the Third, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> was friends with <hi>Charles
Emanuel,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and laid down those Arms, and dismissed 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:53250:8"/> those men, wherewith he threatened that Duke; so to oppose
the French in the Dukedom of <hi>Millain;</hi> which Duke <hi>Emanuel</hi>
having at the same time made great preparation of Arms, and holding strict
Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence with King <hi>Henry,</hi> made it be doubted that he intended to
trouble <hi>Italy,</hi> and to assault the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> had he
not been interrupted by the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of
<hi>France,</hi> just when he was ready for so great an Enterprise: And the
less it was expected that King <hi>Philip</hi> should let slip the occasion of
resenting himself when the Duke was bereft of his assistance from
<hi>France</hi> by the death of King <hi>Henry,</hi> the more was his goodness
praised, and his mildness pleasing; for not minding what might peradventure
have happened if affairs had succeeded otherwise, he had more respect to the
good of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to his Alliance with
the Duke, then to the desire of revenge; a great incitement to all men, but
more to powerful Princes, when they think themselves injured, not only by their
inferiours, but by their equals: The Kings rage was much miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated towards the
Duke by the great desire which the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> seemed to have
thereof, by the intercession of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the Fift, and by the
efficacious intreaties made with much affection by <hi>Philebert,</hi> the
Dukes second Son to the King his Uncle, who was sent by his Father into
<hi>Spain,</hi> to give satisfaction on his behalf; but the Authority and
favour of <hi>Mary</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> was of no less help herein;
who by the death of her Husband having the Government of her young Son the
King, and being Regent of the Kingdom, did very seasonobly interpose her self
in this Reconciliation: Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>,
though the Intelligence held with the Duke, and the great preparations of that
Kingdom, had caused great Commotions and diffidence in the Court of
<hi>Spain;</hi> yet it not being manifest against whom the Arms and ends of
that King were intended, it so fell out, That his magnanimous thoughts ceasing
by his death, as also the doubts and suspicions conceived in <hi>Spain,</hi> by
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of those great preparations, the same Peace and good corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondency
continued between <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> which (though, if the
King had lived, was very likely to have been disturbed) was never
demonstratively broken; And it making for the Queen to keep peace with
<hi>Spain,</hi> so to shun the troubles and contestations, which her
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the guidance of her Son King <hi>Lewis</hi> his affairs, a
Minor of ten years old, might probably meet with amidst Arms and Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in
<hi>France,</hi> which was yet full of many humours and Fractions, and of so
many Religions; and wherein the wounds and scars of the late civil Wars were
not yet well healed, she wisely chose rather to be aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Duke by
Negotiation then by Forces, which she must have sent into <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
The necessity of her backing the Dukes cause be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made to appear in
<hi>Spain</hi> by reason; and the readiness of her Self and Kingdom also by
some preparations upon the Confines of <hi>Italy;</hi> the King pardoning so
great offences, at the mediation of such Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors; partly admitting of the
Dukes justification, with such dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as is sometimes used by Princes;
he gave order for the disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Army in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
which was designed to have assaulted <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Affairs being thus composed, and Peace being proclaimed, to the 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:53250:8"/> satisfaction of all men, the publick Affairs of
<hi>Italy</hi> were in so good a posture, and so consolidated in a continual
quiet, as there was no signe seen of any the least appearing storm, which could
any ways shake the solid Basis of her peaceful condition, or the tranquillity
of her former quiet; For the French, who were the only, and without all
question, the most powerful means to cause Novelty and Commotions in
<hi>Italy,</hi> being detained by their Kings minority, and busied in the
necessary care of the preservation of the Domestical affairs of the Kingdom,
were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to imploy themselves for the space of many years in foreign
affairs. Whence it was to be believed, that they would not, unprovoked,
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb that peace which had been, with some Anxiety, indeavoured by
themselves, and for their own interests: And the Spaniards, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Masters
of the Islands of <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardigna,</hi> of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples,</hi> and State of <hi>Millain,</hi> did rule over the greatest and
best part of <hi>Italy;</hi> though as being Superior to the other Potentates,
they might easily cause and continue Commotions in her; yet being naturally apt
to preserve peace, and having by the experience of many years known how happy
it was for them to keep the chief place of Authority in <hi>Italy,</hi> by
means of their so ample Dominions, peacefully and quietly, it was no question
but that they would be solicitous in preserving her quiet for the future, as
they had profest themselves to be in the former and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Occurrences. The
Dutch and Switzers adhered unto the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of <hi>Spain;</hi> the latter by
reason of the streight League with the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> whereby they
reaped much advantage, both to the private, and to the publick: And the former
in respect of the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> who were the chief of the House of
<hi>Austria;</hi> so powerful in <hi>Germany</hi> by reason of the many
Adherences and great States which she hath there, and of the Imperial Crown
which hath continued in her by so many successions; by which means those Kings
did not only preserve <hi>Italy</hi> unprejudiced by the Forces of those two
fierce Nations, so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable by reason of their vicinity and power; but did
the better se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the Majesty of their own Empire, and the large Precinct of
their Dominions; and do also keep the Kingdoms of <hi>Spain</hi> in more
security (which are at the present richer then any other Kingdom, through the
immense Treasure which are abundantly subminstred to them by the unexhausted
Mines of the <hi>Indies</hi> and <hi>new World)</hi> by a Fleet of seventy
Gallies, distributed in the Havens of <hi>Spain, Genoa, Naples,</hi> and
<hi>Sicily:</hi> The other Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> divided into unequal
Seigniories, did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reverence, and yield observancy to, so great and so
well grounded a power; the lesser whereof did for sundry respects absolutely
adhere thereunto, and injoy'd quiet under the protection thereof; and the
greater placing the ground-work of Principality upon Peace, minded more the
preservation of their Dominions by counsel, then inlarging their Confines by
Arms; and all of them, though they saw so great a forreign Empire radicated in
the bowels of <hi>Italy,</hi> yet not having for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years been thereby
molested, and therefore accustomed to injoy their own Territories a long time
in a happy and secure Peace, they were better contented to bear with the
condition of the present Times, though upon some disadvantage, then out of a
desire of absolute liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to irritate those Forces against them, whereunto
they were not of <pb n="4" facs="tcp:53250:9"/> themselves equal: Nay, that which better
preserved the Publick peace was, lest, as in former times, Quarrels amongst
themselves, had made way for the Spanish greatness into <hi>Italy,</hi> and
confirmed it there; they might now make it more formidable by affording it
matter of more progress, whereby to augment it self: Therefore all former
strife and contention being forgotten, and all turbulent and ambitious thoughts
being laid aside, they were very intent in quenching all seeds of scandal or
dissatisfaction which might discompose that Union and telligence, wherein the
neer and eminent danger (the truest Ligament of any whatsoever Agreement or
Convention) did keep them tacitely conjoined in the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ence of themselves. <hi>France,</hi> a powerful and
neighbour Country, and Riv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>l to
the Spanish Name out of antient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions, as a stout Counterpoise to the
greatness of the Spanish Nation, did also adde much to the safety of their
Affairs, and did the more confirm the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in his good will
to the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and in his not disturbing nor distasting the
Italian Princes in their antient peacefull possessions. <hi>Italy</hi> being
for the aforesaid reasons thus secure for forreign N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tions, and ballanced within her self, and well
established in peace by the counterpoise of reciprocal apprehensions, both of
the Natives, that by troubling their Affairs their liberty might be hazzard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
and of Forreigners, that the Empire might be prejudiced; every one, and not
without reason, was perswaded, that being now escaped the so terrible Tempest
wherewith she was threatned, she would easily, nay, of her self, settle her
former peaceful condition, and long continue in it.</p>
            <p>But all humane reasons and judgments are easily exposed to even
the sleightest accidents. <hi>Francis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and
<hi>Montferrate,</hi> dyed of an unexpected death about the end of the year
1612. <hi>Mary,</hi> his young and only Child, survived him, whose Mother was
<hi>Margaret,</hi> eldest Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> in which
<hi>Francis</hi> his death, though the main course of common Affairs seemed not
to be much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, (the Bond of common Concord remaining uninjured;) yet
did his death shake the Foundations upon which the Publick Peace seemed to be
so firmly grounded, and occasioned much misery and calamity to
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> and to the neighbouring people, by the Wars which
immediately insued in those parts. The great Rains, fierce Winds, and terrible
Thunders, which happened but a little before in <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> wherewith
the fields were for many days overflowed, to the great prejudice of the ground,
and terror of the Inhabitants, seemed to be a sad Augury of this. These States
fell, for want of Heirs Male, upon Cardinal <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> Brother to the
deceased Duke; Who, though he was acknowledged by all to be the true Heir, and
that the People, Officers, and the whole Court, did with much joy congratulate
his Accession to the Dukedom; yet because it was thought th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager Dutchess might be with
child, he would not as then accept either of the Crown or Title of Duke; but
deferred doing so, contenting himself with the Government of the Dominions,
till he might be sure he was true and Legitimate Heir. And Prince <hi>Victorio
Amadeo,</hi> eldest Son to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> coming not long after to
<hi>Mantua</hi> to consolate the Dowager his Sister, and to bring her back to
her Paternal Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; he desired leave that he might likewise carry the little
Daughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long <pb n="5" facs="tcp:53250:9"/> with him to <hi>Piedmont:</hi> which desire
having been much insisted upon formerly by the Duke, Grandfather to the young
Lady <hi>Mary,</hi> begat not a little commotion in the Cardinal, and in the
whole <hi>Mantuan</hi> Court; who very well knew how such demands strike at the

Whereof they affirmed women were, by the Laws, capable; and that women had more

succeeding therein, past it over to those that descended from her by</hi>
Frederick Gonza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga: <hi>That therefore it ought not to be held a new thing if
that State should now be seen to pass by Female succession into another Family,
which was come into the Family of</hi> Gonzaga: <hi>That Succession, in the
first place, belonged unto the Children, without distinction of Sex, all other
Relations being wholly excluded: That it was thus Ordered by the Civil Law, and
Law of Nature, according to which the Succession of great Kingdoms, yea, even
that of</hi> Spain <hi>was governed: That therefore it was too inhumane a thing
to permit that that Infant, descended from the</hi> Austrian <hi>Blood, Neece
by the Sisters Side to the King, should be brought up with so much danger in
those her so tender years with her Rival; who by excluding her, aspired at the
Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of so great a State: But that it was no less dangerous not to take
such order, as that the succession of</hi> Montferrat <hi>might not occasion
some impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant insuing disorder in</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>aly. The <hi>Italians</hi> thought that these, or the like
pretensions, might make great impression in that Court, when they saw the Duke
of <hi>Savoys</hi> demands were so much favoured in <hi>Italy</hi> by the Kings
State-Ministers; and that they did afterwards indeavour that that Infant should
by common consent of all parties be placed in <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> as in a place
in the midst between the Dukedoms of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Montferrat;</hi>
but the people and Court of <hi>Mantua</hi> were much more troubled, when they
saw greater demonstrations added to so pressing desires: For many persons of
quality being in that City, who we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

distrust that the Duke had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ome
more hidden end: The Cardinal was therefore forced to have a greater care of
the custody of the Child, and to give order that tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Corps de Guard</hi> should be kept round about the
City, and that the most convenient places should be diligently looked unto; so
to obviate any inconvenience which might happen in such a Commotion: 
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:53250:10"/> and the Child being declared, as well in <hi>Italy</hi> as
in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to be Heir of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> a greater
desire was daily found to be in the Spanish State-Ministers, of having
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er either consigned over, or
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posited; which desire could the less be concealed, for that at the same
time, by their means, and in her behalf, the Cause touching the Succession of
that State was studied by some of the best Lawyers, and in some of the
Academies of <hi>Italy;</hi> wherefore not only Cardinal <hi>Ferdinando</hi>
grew jealous, but even those who had a care of his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Affairs, and of
the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> in general: Nor was this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason; for
great were the pretensions which the House of <hi>Savoy</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ad to <hi>Moniferrat,</hi>
against the House of <hi>Gonzaga;</hi> and much strife and contention had
formerly past between the two Families in that Point. It was likewise thought
that the Citadel of <hi>Cossalle,</hi> of a very large circuit, well Garisoned,
and which was very strong, might prove prejudicial to the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> if it should fall into the hands of a Prince who did not
wholly confide in the King; as there were many reasons then to make it be
believed the Cardinal did not: So as, so many indeavours concerning the Child,
afforded rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of suspicion, that if she should come into the Duke of
<hi>Savoys</hi> hands, he might by marrying her to one of his Sons, intend to
adde new claims to that State; so also it was not a little doubted, that if she
should chance to fall into the Kings hands, his Officers might make use thereof
as of a means whereby to disturb the affairs of <hi>Montferrat:</hi> and
because if either of these should happen, it would be contrary to the quiet and
satisfaction of the Italian Princes, they did in private and in publick exhort
Cardinal <hi>Ferdinando</hi> not to suffer that the Child might by any means be
taken out of his power: And the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> Sister to the said
Cardinals Mother, gave order to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Trinello,</hi> whom she
sent Embassadour in Extraordinary upon other occasions to the Pope, that taking
<hi>Mantua</hi> in his way, he should advise the Cardinal not to give way to
the Dukes demands, but to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the fervent indeavours of the Kings
Agents; publickly profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing also, that she would protect him in what
particularly concerned the present Occurrences: She made these her Resolutions
be known to all the Italian Princes, and especially the Duke himself, who by
the Spanish favour appeared to be more then meanly set upon these Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours:
Nor did the Emperor <hi>Matthias,</hi> who was neerly allied to the Cardinal by
his Wife, Daughter to a Sister of Duke <hi>Vicenzo,</hi> the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals Father,
shew himself less favourable in this Cause. The Duke proceeded, from friendly
indeavours, to justifie his demands by the Prerogative granted by all Laws to
the Mother to have the Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of her Children: The Cardinal said, that
it was not, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, lawful for her to carry her Daughter out of her
Fathers Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, nor to withdraw her from the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ight and company of her near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
friends, under the name of Guardianship. He likewise urged the minority of the
Mother, who was incapable of being Guardian to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, she her self being in
need of one by the same Laws which she had alledged. And though this Exception
made also against the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals own Person; yet the Emperor, Supream Judge of
both their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and of both their Estates, confiding in his Integrity, and
judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="7" facs="tcp:53250:10"/> that a Prince was not incapable of being Guardian
to a young Child, who was without any exception judg'd to be capable of the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of two Dukedoms; declared him to be his Nieces lawful Guardian, and
gave him order, that not suffering her to go out of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> he should
not trust her custody with any other: But it was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensions to
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> which, though not publickly owned as yet, was thought to
be the chief scope of this Negotiation; and which, in all mens opinion, was the
hidden fire which inflamed the ones desire, and made the other more diffident.
These Flames breaking out afterwards into so much a greater combustion, by how
much they were at first suppres'd by dissimulation; it will be necessary to
proceed to their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, as well for what belonged to the House of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> as also to the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> who's Guardianship was
that which was only then disputed between these two Princes; so to know the
better what it was that secretly brought this business into many streights and
difficulties; as also whence the so many rumours arose, which were after
publickly given out.</p>
            <p>Montferrat <hi>now in the possession of the Family of the House

against</hi> Charles <hi>of</hi> Savoy, <hi>as her proper and Paternal

since he and</hi> Margaret <hi>did both of them equally descend from</hi>

Female, he,</hi> Charles, <hi>ought by reason of his sex, to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

first, Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>did at her death nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate him</hi> Charles
<hi>the Third, for Heir General; so, as if the succeeding to that State had
belonged to her, since her Father dyed without Issue Male, he inferred that the
right of the same Succession was past to him by the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
institution.</hi> Charles <hi>laid these three ground-works for his universal
Succession to</hi> Montferrat: <hi>To boot wherewith, he laid also a particular
claim to a good part of the same State; which being given by</hi> Jovan Giacomo
Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leologus, <hi>and by</hi> John <hi>his Son, to</hi> Amedeus <hi>the first,
Duke of</hi> Savoy, 1435. <hi>was the very same day given by</hi> Amedeus,
<hi>to those that had given it him from themselves, and for those that should
descend from them on the Fathers side; all which being extinct</hi> (as Duke
<hi>Charles</hi> pretended) <hi>in</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van Georgio, <hi>he said that that
part was, without all dispute, fallen to him, as to the Sovereign Lord. On the
contrary,</hi> Margaret <hi>alledged that the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of</hi> Montferrat
<hi>bolonged to her, as the nearest Heir to her Uncle the last Lord thereof;
and denying that the Heir male should by any legal dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal be preferred
before the next of kin; yea, when the Succession should go out of the Male
Line, she disputed the reality of the Matrimonial Contract urged by the
Adversary: And howsoever,</hi> she said, <hi>that that Contract did no ways
operate to the prejudice of Succession which did belong unto her by other means
then by the person of</hi> Theodorus, <hi>without the Emperours consent: She
said that no heed was to be given to the Lady</hi> Bianca's <hi>Testament, she
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver having had any thing to do in that State, as being excluded by others
of</hi> Paleologus <hi>his male kindred: how much less then could the kindred
on the Fathers side be excluded from inheritance by Will, who had more right
thereunto then the Testatrix her self. Then she alledged that the Donation
of</hi> Jovan Giacomo, <hi>and</hi> Georgio Paleologi, <hi>was null in it self,
and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Nature of the Fee-farm: And moreover, that it was by violence
extorted from the said</hi> Amedeus; <hi>when</hi> John, <hi>eldest Son to</hi>
John Giaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, <hi>being sent to a Festival in</hi> Piedmont, <hi>was afterward
detained Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner there; so as</hi> John Giacomo <hi>was constrained for his
Sons Liberty, and</hi> John <hi>for his own, to give way unto their will, into
whose custody</hi> John <hi>was unadvisedly fallen: And that therefore the said
Donation was revoked 30. years after by a long and solemn Decree which the
Emperour</hi> Frederick <hi>made, Out of which Reasons</hi> Margarets <hi>cause
prevailing, the Emperour</hi> Charles <hi>the fifth, who as Lord, and Supream
Iudge of the Fee, had sequestred the possession after the death of
Marquess</hi> John Georgio, <hi>ordered that it should be freely restored to
her, as lawful Heir to her Uncle; rejecting by name the Dukes three Actions to
the Universal State; but made good the Testament of the Lady</hi> Bianca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to the City of</hi> Cassalle.</p>
            <p>The Dukes pretentions to <hi>Montferrat</hi> were upon these
terms; but that which was spoken of in name of the young Princess had in it
more of shew then substance: For though women, by antient Investment, were
intituled to the Succession of that State, and had really succeeded therein
twice; it was only when there was not, nor did not appear to be, any Male
remaining of that Line. Thus did <hi>Violante</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi>
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit it; but when there was any Male left of the Family, though of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
Branches, the Daughters of the late Possessors were excluded, as they had been
twice before: Thus <hi>Bianca,</hi> Wife to <hi>Charles</hi> the first, Duke of
<hi>Savoy;</hi> and <hi>Ioan,</hi> Wife to the Marquess of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi>
both of them Daughters to the first <hi>William Paleologus,</hi> Marquess of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> came behind <hi>Boniface,</hi> next Brother to their
Father <hi>William:</hi> And the Marquess <hi>Boniface</hi> the second, Brother
to the same <hi>Margaret,</hi> dying without Issue, <hi>Iovan Georgio,</hi> her
Fathers Brother, was preferred in the Possession before her: Nor was she
admitted to succeed in that State, till the whole Male Line of the
<hi>Paleologi</hi> was extinct in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said <hi>Iovan Georgio:</hi> By
which he who is acquainted with the Nature of Fee-farm, and with antient
observance thereof, may easily conceive what the right of pretence was which
that Maid had to strive for suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession in that State with her Uncle: But as

            <p>These were the Negotiations, which being treated of with some

Some youthful desires and inclinations appeared in the Cardinal towards his

wished well to peace, and by the wisest men, who did best understand the

               </gap>t Italian Princes being
usually suspected in the Court of <hi>Spain:</hi> And it was known, that in
that respect the first Marriage of the said <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta,</hi> 
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:53250:12"/> was not much approved of there; yet it was somewhat hoped
that the King would prefer his Nieces good before the other respects; the
rather because that she being totally of the Spanish side, she might be an
excellent means to turn her future Husbands mind, who was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared to
be of the contrary faction: And as the differences con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Child, and
the Dowries, would vanish by this Marriage; so it was thought that the disputes
about <hi>Montferrat</hi> (all former Sutes giving way to this new Conjunction)
would be at least quieted a while, if not quite extinguished: And it made much
for the Duke, at the same time, to Match his Daughter well; and, together with
publick peace, (preserving friendship with the House of <hi>Gonzaga)</hi> to
make use of the present occasion, as of an Honourable pretence to terminate his
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands touching his Niece, and his other pretensions, with some cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit:
wherein being much dipt, it was impossible for him to obtain the one without
the Cardinals consent, and to prosecute the other by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the times: And
yet (so often do Princes minds alter) the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was so
ready, and so well pleased to marry his Daughter to <hi>Francis</hi> then
Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> did not consent to her Marriage now when she was a
Widow, with his Brother who succeeded him in that Dukedom: And the King, who

               </gap> not then well satisfied with
that Match, did not only now consent to it, but desiring it might be effected,
propounded it not long after affectionatly to both of them. This change in them
proceeded (as it usually doth in great Princes resolutions) from the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and mutation of times; But if
we shall sift more narrowly into the occasion thereof, it will be necessary,
that breaking off the Thred of our begun Narration for a while, we look a
little backwards into the ends and designs of their former proceedings; which
though it may peradventure seem to deviate somewhat from our purpose, is
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing requisite to be known, for the better knowledge of several
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, whence the occasion of many important effects rose, which shall be
by us hereafter related; and therefore it will be no lost labour, nor useless,
to winde up that in this place, and upon this occasion, which if pretermitted,
would obscure the Thred of this present Narration; and if divided and recounted
in several parts, would be a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption thereunto.</p>
            <p>The Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whose State lies between the Confines
of <hi>France,</hi> and the Dukedom of <hi>Millain,</hi> get this of good by
the scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof; That being placed between two powerful Kings, of
Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which do disagree; though they be far inferior to either of them in
forces, yet cannot they be not only not so easily opprest by so neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
powers, but receive firmer establishment and security in their Affairs by that
Neighbourhood: For it being dangerous to the affairs of both the Kings, that
either of them should draw nearer the others Confines, by suppressing the Dukes
of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and these Dukes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moreover very fit to be made use of
in such Enterprises as the one King might sometimes attempt against the other,
their friendship is willingly imbraced by them both, and better secured by tye
of near Alliance: And as out of these respects <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King
of <hi>France,</hi> gave his Sister in Marriage to <hi>Emanuel
Philebertus,</hi> Father to the present Duke; and the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi>
the fifth, who was King <pb n="12" facs="tcp:53250:13"/> of <hi>Spain,</hi> wrought it so
as <hi>Beatrice,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
and Sister to the said <hi>Charles</hi> his Wife <hi>Isabella,</hi> was married
to Duke <hi>Charles,</hi> Grandfather to the present Duke; so for the same
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> contracted a more
then custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Union with this present <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> by giving him
his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Daughter, <hi>Katherine,</hi> for Wife, with a Portion of many
yearly Revenues assigned to him in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> to boot,
with great Pensions which were paid unto him before Marriage out of the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> to keep him the more interessed in the maintaining of
those Territories: High aspiring thoughts began then to appear in this Prince,
and much greater then became his Fortune; Ardent desires of new Acquisitions;
greater inclination to war then to peace; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he applied himself to
military Exercises; and just as we read of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that
not bounding himself within the limits of <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi>
he thought the whole World too little for him: It might, peradventure, be
affirmed of this present Duke, That esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself too much streightened
within the Precincts of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont,</hi> he sought to
inlarge his State and Fortune, by the prejudice of his neighbours. This his
disposition was increased by this his Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which like fire in
well-prepared metals, set this young Prince his mind on flame, and made his
hopes the greater; and thinking that the civil wars of <hi>France</hi> made
much for this his purpose, he first assaulted and took <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> which
was possest by the King of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Piedmont:</hi> and entring
into war with those of <hi>Geneva,</hi> he afterwards entred Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into
<hi>Province</hi> and <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> intending to make himself Master of
those Provinces; And if Fortune had smiled upon these his high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, his
hopes led him on so far, as not to think himself inferior to any that pretended
to that Crown; but the Valor, Fortune and Right of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth,
getting the better over all other Competitors, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peasing the Tumults, and
allaying the Factions, possest himself of that Kingdom by right of Succession:
The Duke was forced not only to forego his Enterprises unluckily undertaken in
<hi>France;</hi> but if he would retain the Towns which he possest on this side
of the Mountains, he must pay a very great price for them. In the progress of
these Affairs there therefore arose no sleight accidents, which disturbed the
good Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which ought to have been maintained between the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> and the Duke, by reason of their so near Alliance; for the Duke,
when he first busied himself in the affairs of <hi>France,</hi> built much upon
the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance which he had reason to expect from the King his Father in law;
not so much in respect of his Alliance, as that the things which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook
were of no small help to the Kings self; who at the same time assisting the
Catholick League of the French Princes both with men and monies, against King
<hi>Henry</hi> who was then a <hi>Hugon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t,</hi> made himself Master of many Towns in
<hi>Britany,</hi> and in other parts of that Kingdom; and therefore made his
ends and intentions be much suspected: But though the Father in law might for
those respects be inwardly pleased with his Son in law's Actions; yet wisely
foreseeing how much those Enterprises did exceed his Forces, and the mischiefs
which might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by accrue unto him, he profest the contrary; and seeming
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of the peace and
safety of his Son in law's Dominions, he disswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <pb n="13" facs="tcp:53250:13"/> him
from those Enterprises; fearing also lest by provoking <hi>France</hi> thereby,
he might draw many bad humors into <hi>Italy,</hi> whereby his peaceful
possessions might be disturbed, and the common Affairs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered; And yet
that he might not seem to abandon him, rather then to incourage and foment him
in those wars, he furnished him with forces; but not such as were answerable,
either for readiness or num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to the necessity of the Times; and no
otherwise then with limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they should serve only to defend his own
Dominions, if they should happen (as they did) to be assaulted by the French;
but not to offend or disquiet others: Wherefore the Duke finding the Spanish
Commanders directions contrary to his designs, in his most urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions;
and thinking himself thereby injured, he was much troubled: And as he who sees
himself fallen from high hopes which he had
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to himself, useth to
think it a shame that he hath not compassed his ends, and to believe that he is
deluded more by the will of others, then by his own perswasion; the Duke
esteeming that for so many respects he might freely have promised himself
abundance of help from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, thought he had reason to hold
himself too severely treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him; wherefore beginning to be jealous of the
Kings mind and Magnanim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ty, he
doubted that, (though he peradventure might for his own particular ends be well
enough pleased to see him busied in those wars) indeavouring to keep him in a
moderate condition for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er security of his own affairs in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and that he might depend the more upon him the King; he had
rather held him unfortunately in hand by those weak succours in those wars,
then assisted him to the acquiring of more Dominion and <hi>Grandezza,</hi> as
he the Duke had hoped: and this his dislike was the more increased, when he
found that the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was not afterwards sufficient to include him in
the peace which was afterwards made between the said King and the King of
<hi>France,</hi> without the restitution of <hi>Saluzzo:</hi> The Duke thought
that his Father in law being now very old was the less careful to leave his
Son, who was but then young, in peaceful possession of his State by that
Agreement, for that he had not appeared to solicit his interests; for many
places of much importance being by vertue of this peace restored to the French,
the Duke thought that if his Father in law had stuck a little closer to him, he
might still have kept the little Marquesite of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> which it was
likely King <hi>Henry</hi> would not have stood much upon, having by this Peace
many very noble Towns of <hi>France</hi> restored to him, which were possest by
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the time of war: But the King, who had made
publick profession that he had possest himself of the Towns of that Kingdom, to
no other end but to keep the Hereticks from being Masters of them, with
intention to restore them afterwards to whosoever should be lawfully chosen
King of <hi>France;</hi> covering the necessity of his own interests, which
forc'd him to make that Peace, with the cloke of fair proceeding, seemed as if
the time of his promis'd resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them was then come; since King
<hi>Henry</hi> was declared by all the Orders of <hi>France,</hi> and by the
Apostolick See, to be lawful and Catholick King; and that therefore the Duke
having profest that he had possest himself of <hi>Saluzzo</hi> upon the same
pretences and promises; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nd being
by the same reason bound to restore it, the King as he would not that by the 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:53250:14"/> Dukes interests prevailing over his, that peace should be
disturbed; so could he not without manifest repugnancy allow of that retention
in another, which he did allow unto himself: But because the Duke alledged that
that Marquesite appertained to him of antient right, the King thought that he
had sufficiently provided both for the publick quiet, and for his Son in law's
Indempnity, by obtaining (as he did) that the Dukes pretentions should by the
Articles of Peace be referred to <hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth, who was then
Pope: which Reference when it should be
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the universal Peace was
aftewards to be agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the King of <hi>France,</hi> and him, and
the Duke: But the Pope deferring, or not resolving to decide these differences,
the Duke resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> hoping by his presence, and by his
doing Homage, to make that King favourably to relinquish unto him the
controverted Marquesite.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the whole Spanish Court, were much
trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at this Resolution; fearing lest the Duke, being ill satisfied with
their proceedings, should close with the King of <hi>France,</hi> to their
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice: But their suspicions were vain, as vain were his hopes; for a
setled resolution of re-having whatsoever was taken from the Crown in the late
troubles prevailing in the King of <hi>France,</hi> over all other
considerations, he was not to be moved by any indeavours or artificial offers;
but did absolutely demand the Marquesite or some Territories equivalent
thereunto: And he was so stedfast in this Resolution, as being tempted by the
Duke to assault the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and from thence to proceed to
the getting of the Imperial Crown; the Duke of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to assist him in any
of these, or in any other Enterprise, and to confederate with him, so as he
might enjoy the Marquesite, The King did constantly refuse to do it; so as the
Duke, not being able to obtain any better Conditions, was forced to yield the
Marquesite unto him within a certain limited time (without any prejudice,
notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to his right, (which was again referred unto the Pope) or
else all that part of <hi>Savoy</hi> which lies between the <hi>Rosne</hi> and
the <hi>Lioness,</hi> called the Country of <hi>Bresse.</hi> Thus the Duke
returned to <hi>Piedmont</hi> not well pleased with the King; and not observing
what was agreed upon, the King took <hi>Savoy</hi> immediately from him,
threatening to descend armed into <hi>Piedmont:</hi> And though notice was come
to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> of the Dukes indeavours with the King of
<hi>France,</hi> in prejudice to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the
publick quiet; yet other respects prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon this occasion, over his
anger conceived against the Duke, the King caused a powerful Army to be
prepared in <hi>Millain</hi> for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to
oppose King <hi>Henry,</hi> if (as it was feared) fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into <hi>Italy,</hi>
he should turn his forces upon other Enterprises: But this Commotion was once
again quieted; for the Pope interposing himself, the Duke chose rather actually

bear with his aforesaid Loss. The King, his Father in law, died a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
before his journey into <hi>France;</hi> and a little before
<hi>Katherine,</hi> Wife to the Duke, and Daughter to the King: So as by the

being much a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

fruits of often distastes, which exasperated the minds of both parties, and did
at last totally allienate the Dukes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion from the Court of <hi>Spain:</hi>
For <hi>Philip</hi> the second, as wise a King as <hi>Spain</hi> ever had,
relying upon himself in the Government of so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Kingdoms, satisfied the
Grandees of the Court with honourable usage, not making use of them in publick
Affairs, except of some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ew, in
whom he found the capacity of understanding annex'd to their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of
birth: for other things he chose men more excellent for worth, then eminent for
title or dignity; assisting in the publick Government with incredible
diligence, and sustaining the weight of so great an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire himself, which past
humane judgment; for in him alone did Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and regal Authority shine forth:
His Commands and Resolves were punctu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lly observed by the Natives, and greatly reverenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d by Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>reigners; being by them acknowledged to proceed from
the award and absolute will of so wise and so great a King: Hence it was that
the <pb n="16" facs="tcp:53250:15"/> Duke himself, not being able to avoid them, was
inforced patiently to give way thereunto, though they were oft-times not
answerable to his ends.</p>
            <p>His Son King <hi>Philip</hi> the third succeeded him, a good and
pious Prince; but one who could not intirely inherit his Fathers infinite
wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, neither by reason of his years, (not exceeding the age of twenty
three;) nor of his experience: Therefore the condition of times being changed
together with the Prince; great men grew to be of more Authority with the King
in the Administration of State Affairs; which was more largely, and more
indifferently shared out unto them by him, then by <hi>Philip</hi> the second.
Amongst these, <hi>Don Francisco Scandoval,</hi> and <hi>Roxas,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Lerma,</hi> were highest in favour with the King; upon whose liking all
important Resolutions, as also the distribution of Offices, the Government of
Provinces; and the Crown Revenues, did depend; r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ther as upon a Moderator, then Court-Minister: The eyes
of all men we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e therefore, with
much applause, fixt upon him as upon the chief manager of so great a Monarchy;
Who being of a good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing disposition, and for his understanding
sufficiently capable of so great Imployment, sate long at the Helm of
Government in so great an Empire, not only with Loyalty to the King, but with
general satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction: It is true, that being grown very jealous of his own
Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezza, he diligently studied the preservation thereof; which finding that
he might the more easily do in times of peace, he hated all novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and
neglected no means whereby the Affairs of the Crown might be quietly proceeded
in, both at home and abroad: Nor was it hard for him to do it, the publick
interests of the Kingdom concurring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in many respects; as also the
peoples desire, and the minds of the great ones; who being rich and happy,
loved rather to injoy the publick and their private fortune in peace and
quietness, then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it by uncertain and dangerous war: But the Affairs
of <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly those of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> did depend,
almost absolutely, upon the Authority and Arbitrement of <hi>Don Pierd d'
Azevedo Henriques,</hi> Count of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> a man of high imployment and
great worth; who being sent by the new King to be Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> governed that State long with extraordinary Authority: And
being good both at peace and war, and generally held to be of a military
spirit; seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more inclined to Arms then quiet; he, without altering the
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace, held up the Kings Affairs at so high a pitch, and brought them
unto such reputation in <hi>Italy,</hi> as they were never formerly done by any
Governour.</p>
            <p>The government of Affairs being in this posture, the Duke, though
the new King, forgetting former distastes, had made one of his Sons Grand Prior
of <hi>Castil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

Son of his the like of <hi>Crat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>;</hi> the latter worth 30000 Duckats a year, the other of 100000
Duckats, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually aspire, out of his accustomed pretences and desires,
to the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of his Fortune; which was impossible to be afforded him,
either without lessening the Kings Revenue, or without disturbance to the
publick peace, to which the Government of the Crown was then so much inclined:
And therefore whilst beyond all expectation he found all access to further
greatness blockt up under the new King; <pb n="17" facs="tcp:53250:15"/> he had some
colourable pretence to vent his anger, which by reason of the King his Father
in law's Majesty, he had kept long concealed; for not being of like employment
and Authority in the Resolutions o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that Court, as he had been formerly, he began to complain thereof
with less respect, thinking that it proceeded rather from the State-Ministers
being ill-minded towards him, then from the King himself. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto was added,
that it being necessary to make the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> chief in Court, as
the Arbritrator of the Kings Resolutions; and in <hi>Italy, Fuentes,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> for the relation and executing of things
resolved upon; and not finding himself satisfied with their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, or
pleased in his ends, which did totally differ from their ends and intentions;
and finding sometimes, at least seeming to find a certain ambition in them, and
in other Court-Ministers, which doth usually accompany eminent power, and the
Princes immoderate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, whereby he thought they meant to keep him under, he
could by no means bear with it: He openly exclaimed against them, as if making
use of the Kings name and Authority for the establishment of their own
greatness, they would arrogate unto themselves the more Authority over him, who
was a free Prince, and Cousin to the King; Hereupon anger and ranckor broke
forth between the Duke and the Kings Ministers of State, especially between
him, and <hi>Scandoval,</hi> and <hi>Fuentes;</hi> so as tokens of ardent
indignation appearing in the Duke, and the like in them, for the practises he
had held with <hi>Henry,</hi> to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of that Court, and of the
universal peace, they at last seemed as if they were not able to pay the
Pensions which appertained to him; as if the exasperating him were the only
cure for that wound, for which gentler applications would be too
disproportionate. Their hatred grew the greater, when the Duke demanding his
Pensions of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in law, and after his death, of his Cousin, he resolved
to send his eldest Son, Prince <hi>Philip Emanuel,</hi> with two other Sons of
his, into <hi>Spain,</hi> that they might be brought up in the Kings Court;
upon whom (the King not having as yet any Sons) the succe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>on of so many King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms might probably fall: The Duke
being come with this intent to the Sea side, and having agreed upon the time of
their Imbarking, and upon other things concerning thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Voyage in <hi>Oneglia,</hi> with Prince
<hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> the Kings Lord Admiral; wherein they were to be conducted by
<hi>Don Carlo Doria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Tursi,</hi> and Son to the Admiral, it so
fell out, as <hi>Don Carlo</hi> de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>arting unexpectedly from <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> whether he was come
with the Kings Gallies to Imbark those Princes, he left both their Father and
them much astonished at his unexpected depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: wherefore the Duke credibly
believing that a resolution of such importance proceeded not from <hi>Don
Carlo,</hi> but rather from the Court Ministe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s of State, and particularly from the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> who
for his own interest would be loth to see the Kings Nephews so near their
Uncle; he therefore, and for that the King did not appear afterwards to resent
it, thought himself therein very much injured; and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing resolved that his
Children should pursue their intended journey, he sent them to the Court; where
they were graciously received by their Uncle, and were by his command treated
with all the demonstrations of Honour, and with the Title of <hi>Infants</hi>
of <hi>Spain;</hi> a name which is given to the younger Children of that King:
But on the other side, the <pb n="18" facs="tcp:53250:16"/> States-men, and great ones of
the Kingdom, fearing that it might much prejudice their own greatness, and
their Administration of publick a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, that Authority should be added to those that were so nearly
allied to the King; they did not only keep them at distance from the publick
Negotiations of the Kingdom, but from any privacy with the King; and not being
able to suffer their so much preeminency, they seldom vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sited them, or
discoursed with them, rendring the Grandezza of their condition almost irksome
to them through solitariness: They were honoured only with Titles and exterior
demonstrations; but were not otherwise in any favour or Authority at Court.</p>
            <p>The eldest Prince died not long after, who upon the like occasions
had great disputes with the Duke of <hi>Lerma;</hi> and the rest returned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Italy,</hi> if not displeased with the King, at least but badly satisfied

               </gap>h the Court, as not finding
that countenance and welcome as they thought became their condition: These and
the like accidents, though out of private occasions, and proceeding rather from
the State-Officers, then from the King, wounded the Duke to the very soul, who
was much exasperated by former proceedings; and if he had met with any
occasion, he would peradventure have been willing to have vented his disdain;
but neither the times, nor the condition of his own affairs, corresponding with
his desire of resentment, he was forced to clo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

occasions at last happened, when he least ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected them, as brought those
opportunities home unto him; then which if he had sought after them, he could
not have met with greater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William dalle Marche,</hi> Duke of <hi>Iuliers</hi> and

<hi>German</hi> Princes; who thinking it pernitious for the Catholick Religion,
that those States should fall into the hands of Heretick Princes, contracted a
League in the behalf of the Arch-Duke; and chose the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
for their Captain-General: The two

               </gap> finding themselves too weak

for many years; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently flourishing more in Arms, people, and riches,
then it was ever known to be before; himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of <hi>Spain</hi> and House of <hi>Austria</hi> should grow to a greater

Catholick Religion of those Inhabitants he promised to assist themin the
possession of the controverted States; in whose cause the Protestant Princes of

their Head; they prepared openly to oppose the Arch-Duke: the King perce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ving that from hence great combustions
were likely to arise, applied his mind to much greater designs. Betaking

Arms throughout his whole Kingdom, but also to negotiate new Leagues and Unions
with For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>eigners, he sollicited
many of the <hi>Italian</hi> Princes, to whom he thought the neighbourhood of
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> was either suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious or troublesome; promising them
great Rewards, and increase of Dominions, if by joyning their Forces with him
they would take up Arms in <hi>Italy</hi> against the King of <hi>Spains</hi>
Dominions: The chief of these were the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Savoy;</hi> the former, in respect of the great opinion which was held not
only of their forces and wealth, but of their Counsel and Wisdom: The other,
for the Neighbourhood of his Dominions, and for the vivacity of his military
Spirit, naturally inclined to new Enterprises; as also out of the distastes and
bad satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which he had often received from the Spanish
State-Ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Count <hi>Fuentes,</hi> who though he was very old, and
upon the confines of death, was yet alive, and much feared and reverenced; and
the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Spain</hi> flourished much (as hath been said) under his

notwithstanding, either professing to abhor tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulence and novelty; or fearing
to provoke the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> refusing the first great offers made to them
by the King of <hi>France,</hi> would have no hand in a business of such
moment, which was like to work great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions in the world, not without
danger to their own Affairs: The Duke, who on the contrary, though strangely
scandalized at the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> would not let slip such an occasion
willingly, and was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willing to listen to the Kings great offers;
whereof one was, to marry the Kings eldest Daughter to Prince
<hi>Victorio;</hi> yet calling to mind the long and bitter wars which the Kings
of <hi>France</hi> had made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Father and Grandfather, by whom they were
beaten almost out of all their Dominions: And on the contrary, his recovery,
and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept in long possession of them by the favour and adherence of the
Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> the annual Revenues which he received from thence,
which would upon any the least occasion be taken from him; to boot with the
troubles and wars which he was to undergo by incensing the <hi>Spaniards;</hi>
in all these respects he began to doubt, lest to pass from the one adherence to
the other, would be too dangerous for him, and for his Children, who were, by
so streight interests, and by so near alliance joyn'd to the King of
<hi>Spain:</hi> wherefore not totally exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but keeping the Treaty on
foot with the French, he thought to make use of this occasion as of the means,
whereby retaining his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer friendship with the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but
upon better conditions, he might get a greater esteem put upon himself and his
affairs: Or totally foregoing Union with <hi>Spain,</hi> which he thought would

which having long looked for in vain from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> he could
never attain unto: He therefore demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the Daughters of
<hi>Spain</hi> for Wife to his Son, together with a Portion in Land, which
might serve in recompence for his antient pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences; and other annual Revenues
and honourable places for his other Children; to the end that they might live
in Port and Splendour suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <pb n="20" facs="tcp:53250:17"/> to the Nephews of so
great a King: And to remove the obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and difficulties which he might meet
with in these desires, he thought it necessary to win the Duke of
<hi>Lerma,</hi> and to interest him in these his demands; for when he should
have got him, he hoped he should succeed the more easily in all the rest.
Laying aside therefore all former contentions and emulations,

               </gap>e loaded him (as it is said) with
hopes and mighty promises, which depending absolutely upon his own will, might
bring unusual greatness and splendour upon his Family and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e whatsoever he should demand of the King for his Sons: And at the
same time, keeping on the Treaty of the new League, and his Sons Marriage, in
<hi>Paris,</hi> he hoped that each of these Crowns would grow to such jealousie
by reason of this double Negotiation; as that, the one not to lose him, and the
other to gain him, they might both of them vie who should give fairer
conditions for this Marriage, when it should be hotly negotiated at the same
time in both these Courts: Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Verrua,</hi> a Counsellor who was in great favour with him, and Monsieur
<hi>Iacob,</hi> he sent them both at the same time, the former into
<hi>Spain,</hi> the latter into <hi>France,</hi> where both of them negotiated
their Commissions. The Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> greedily imbracing this occasion
in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> that by assisting to make this Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; so the Treaty of Marriage between Prince <hi>Victorio</hi> and the
Kings Daughter, seemed to proceed on fairly: For though the King would not
Treat of his eldest Daughter, whom he had destined to a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Marriage;
yet not being averse to part with his youngest Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this Match, though
not totally ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

it likely to be speedily concluded; And <hi>Don Phileberto,</hi> the Dukes
second Son, was destined to be made Admiral at Sea; and the Dukes third Son,
the Cardinal, was to be furnished with the ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ef Church-livings which should be vacant in that Kingdom, to a
large proportion. In pursuit of which Negotiation, there were two Gallies
already provided by the Duke in <hi>Italy,</hi> to bring the Prince
<hi>Victorio</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> together with two of his Sisters, that
they might be brought up there with the Queen; yet many were not fully of an
opinion, that this would really succeed: As if the Duke had juggled in this
Marriage with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Spain,</hi> or that he had done it out of cunning to
accelerate the Negotiations in <hi>France,</hi> which were carried on with
hopes of prosperous success, by <hi>Iacob:</hi> For the King, having drawn
<hi>England,</hi> and the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> into the new League, and
giving out that he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ut the
Princes of <hi>Brandenburge</hi> and <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> into full possession of
the Dukedoms pretended unto by them, had already prepared a powerful Army; with
which, and with the Forces of the Colleagues, it was thought that he really
intended war against <hi>Flanders,</hi> and those parts of the Low-Countries
which were under the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> And at the same time he put a
Fleet in order at <hi>Marselles,</hi> with intention to assault <hi>Genoa</hi>
and <hi>Millain;</hi> and offered the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> an Army of 20000
Foot, and 3000 Horse, to be paid by him the King; to the end that the Duke
might enter into the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of
<hi>Millain</hi> with 12000 Foot, and 2000 Horse of his own; which State he
propounded to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> as a surplus of Portion in 
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:53250:17"/> respect of the future Marriage. These practises, were they
either true, or but reported, did no good to the Treaties of <hi>Spain,</hi>
which seemed to be as good as already concluded: for the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> growing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens'd thereat, did not incline any more to the
Marriage of his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> who had cordially
listened to <hi>Verrua</hi>'s proposals, finding that he was not well looked
upon by the Court where the practises held between him and <hi>Verrua</hi> were
known; to shew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self averse to the Dukes interests and intelligence, who was
grown odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Court for the same respects, did all he could to clear
himself thereof: And the whole Court, out of the same reasons, being at the
same time scandalized with the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> he, thinking that he
could promise himself no good from that Crown, and despairing to make any
progress in that Court, quite foregoing any thought of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pursuing his
Affairs there, and betaking himself to the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> he
indeavoured to joyn in League, and to make Alliance with that King.</p>
            <p>Hence it was, (that we may return to where we gave over) that the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the end that he might have greater adherences in
<hi>Italy,</hi> as also that he might interest other Princes in his ends and
designs; married forthwith two of his Daughters (wherein King <hi>Henry</hi>
had a hand) the eldest to <hi>Don Francisco,</hi> then Prince of
<hi>Mantua;</hi> and the other to <hi>Alphonso,</hi> Prince of <hi>Modena;</hi>
which was not done without much jealousie, that the Dukes, their Fathers, did
privately partake in the same ends and designs: And at this very time another
Marriage coming strangely to light, which was very privately treated of in
<hi>Rome</hi> for the Prince of <hi>

<hi>Henry;</hi> it made people very jealous of the Popes Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: This
suspicion reached also to many of the Lords of <hi>Rome,</hi> which by many
A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>guments drawn from their
indeavours and inclinations, seemed to follow King <hi>Henries</hi> party. King
<hi>Henry</hi> was then in greater Fortune, Authority, and Grandezza, then
peradventure any of the preceding Kings of <hi>France</hi> had for a long time
been; he was admired by all Christendom; wherefore part of <hi>Italy</hi> being
full of expectation, other part full of fear, of these so great preparations,
<hi>Italy</hi> was partly inclined unto, and did tremble at the name and
reputation of the French Forces: But to the end that the Differences touching
<hi>Montferrat</hi> might not disturb so great hopes as were promised by this
Conjunction; the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> thought it not good to look too
narrowly into them then, though they fell into consideration in the conclusion
of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with the Prince of <hi>Mantua;</hi> and therefore he thought
it bett<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of that Marriage, leaving those differences unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. On the contrary; the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> finding whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy or Affinity of the
Italian Princes did at that time tend, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to disturb it, I

               </gap>oured, though in vain, that the
same Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages might be crost; but King <hi>Henries</hi> so unexpected death,
having either dissipated the ends, or allayed the jealousies of that so great
Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Duke being afterwards pacified, and joined with the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> and the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi> foregoing the Match with the
Duke, as having, after the Kings death, entertained new Negotiations of a
double Marriage with <hi>Spain,</hi> whereby <hi>Lewis,</hi> the new King of 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:53250:18"/> 
               <hi>France</hi> was to marry the King of <hi>Spains</hi>
eldest Daughter, and King <hi>Lewis</hi> his Sister, (she who in her Fathers
time was intended for Prince <hi>Victorio,</hi> was (also to marry the Prince
of <hi>Spain;</hi> to the conclusion of which Marriages there was no le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t at that time, but the tender years
of those that were to be married; Therefore the King and Court of
<hi>Spain</hi> confiding much more in this new Conjunction, then they had
former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly distrusted the Union of the Italian Princes, and their Intelligence
with the French, did at the same time indeavour that the Marriage might be
concluded between the Cardinal and the Dowager Dutchess; a thing which made
very much for the preservation of peace in <hi>Italy,</hi> and for the new
Union which was agreed on with the King of <hi>France.</hi> On the contrary,
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s intentions seemed to differ ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the
condition of times, from what they were when he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Daughter to the
Prince of <hi>Mantua;</hi> for failing of the Grandez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za which he hoped for if
King <hi>Henry</hi> had lived, by his death, and by the streight Union of the
two Crowns, he did not listen to the new Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his Daughter; for that
thereby his designs of inlarging his Principality by some other means, and the
leaving it greater to his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, then he had received it from his
Ancestors, would be disturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: He saw <hi>Montferrat,</hi> a great State, and
very convenient for him, as lying almost in the bosome of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
furnished but with few forces, and lesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, between the uncertain Succession of the off-spring which was to come,
and his Nieces questionableness therein: He knew how many Reasons he himself
had to pretend thereunto; how much the Dukes, his Predecessors, had laboured to
get it; and having not only had it in his thoughts whilst his Son in law was
alive, but given manifest signs of his desire thereof, he thought the occasion
was now very ripe, and the time fit, to execute his secret designs of making
himself easily Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster thereof, if, when he should have got his Daughter and
his Niece into his possession, he might honest his ends by the Title of
Succession of the Male Issue which he hoped for by his Daughter, or at least by
that of his Niece, who was already in being: and when by shewing those of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> their true Lord and Master, he might either cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
bring them to accept of him for the Protector of their State, and young Duke,
or force them by arms to obey him: Nor were there some wanting who incouraged
him in these designs by fair hopes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of the peoples rising.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guido de Conti di</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George</hi> was then in the
Court at <hi>Turin,</hi> the chief of the Nobility of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> rich
in Inheritances and personal Estate, and powerful in friends and adherents:
This man had not many years ago a Cardinal to his Uncle, of very much esteem;
and who, as it was commonly believed, would have been Pope, had he not been
kept from it (as was thought) by the contrary indeavours of Duke
<hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent;</hi> who, it may be, was jealous to see a subject of his so
highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ed; or resenting the displeasure he had received from him, whilst
being le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Clement</hi> the Eighth in <hi>Ferrara,</hi> which was but newly regained
to the Church, he entred with Sword in hand into the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
touching the difference of Confines; where he did much prejudice to the Towns
neighbouring upon the State of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara:</hi> 
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:53250:18"/> and
though the Count's Predecessors had formerly been raised to great Authority and
Honour, from but mean fortune, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary favour of Duke
<hi>William,</hi> Father to Duke <hi>Vincent;</hi> yet the memory of former
good turns being of less force with the Count, then the prejudice and injury
which he had newly received, he was but badly inclined to the House of
<hi>Gonzaga:</hi> And therefore not thinking himself looked upon by the Duke
according to his quality, and that his ways were narrowly pry'd into, he had
almost given over his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and was retired into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where
he was in no little Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and favour with the Duke; by whom he was highly
graced with the Order of the Annuntiata, and other imployments and dignities;
he being as much alienated in mind from his Prince, as in person from his
Country, out of revenge, and out of hopes of farther preferment, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest he
had much Intelligence with the Inhabitants of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> and promised
much to the Duke in their behalf. The recourse and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which the
Citizens of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and formerly to <hi>Emanuel Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus,</hi>
Father to the present Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> when <hi>William,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> usurping upon their pretended liberties, got absolute
domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over them; and their being still but ill satisfied therewith, gave
more of credit to these his promises: And as the business seemed in these
respects to be easie enough of it self to be effected, so neither did the Duke
want other reasons which would secure him from meeting with any impediments
from elsewhere; for though <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Dukedom of
<hi>Mantua</hi> had formerly been under the protection of <hi>Spain,</hi>
wherefore the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> not taking themselves to the way of Arms,
had only civilly made trial of that of Reason;) yet this protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seemed to

               </gap> in the person of the Cardinal;
for that he having in the Court of <hi>Room,</hi> where he was chosen Protector
of <hi>France</hi> by the Queen his Aunt, exercised that Charge not only with
extraordinary affection and inclination to the French, but sometimes much
distasted the Spanish Agents: He seemed upon occasions to make less account of
the favour and grace of that King and Nation; and though being by his Brothers
death near possessing the States, he thought it neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>able nor safe for him to abet the
Cardinal Protector of <hi>France;</hi> but necessary to preserve the friendship
and countenance under which his Ancestors had for so many years happily injoyed
the Principallity; wherefore he had immediate recourse to the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his wonted protection; he could not as yet
obtain his desire, for the King deferred and protracted the expedition of this
affair, not without much jealousie in the Cardinal and in all his Court;
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke, who was not ignorant of these difficulties, thought he
might probably hope, that that King and Nation, either out of anger to the
Cardinal, or for the safety of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> for which it did
not make that <hi>Montferrat</hi> (especially in respect of the Citadel of
<hi>Cassalle)</hi> should fall into the hands of a Prince in whom the Crown did
not confide; and who having discovered himself to adhere to <hi>France,</hi>
was likely to incline more thereunto in the future troubles, then unto its
adversary: and though, for the aforesaid reasons, the King had doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e cause to suspect the very
person of Duke <hi>Charles Emanuel;</hi> yet (as the desire of obtaining ones
ends makes the means of obtaining <pb n="24" facs="tcp:53250:19"/> it appear more likely
and easie) he peradventure perswaded himself, that many other things would
cause that King, and that Court, not to oppose his intention; the Alliance
which he and Duke <hi>Francis</hi> his Sons had with him, the design which
amidst these troubles the Kings party might peradventure have of securing
themselves of <hi>Cassalle;</hi> the desire which it was probable the King and
his Officers might have of giving him satisfaction, so to avoid giving him
occasion of disordering <hi>Italy</hi> again: and because it made not for the
Kings advantage to satisfie him by the lessening his own Dominions, he thought
that out of all, or out of some of the aforesaid Reasons, the King passing by
his antient, and now doubtful protection of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> ought, at
least, not to hinder him from possessing himself of that State whereunto he had
long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended: Hereunto was added the streight and antient friendship
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke and the new Governour of <hi>Millain;</hi> to whom, as to a
chief Minister of State, the charge of acquainting the Court with the condition
of the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> doth belong: So that as the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and
rigidness of Count <hi>Fuentes</hi> had continually hindred the Duke in
compassing his ends and enterprises; so this mans easiness, and the great
friendship which he profest to have for the Duke considered, it was thought
they would make him more aptto attempt novelties; since he might assist the
Dukes affairs sundry ways, at least till such time as the Duke having possest
himself of a good part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the King might be necessitated
(it being the lesser evil) to suffer him to keep it.</p>

made Governor of <hi>Millain</hi> some Months before, he in his passage entered
into <hi>Asti,</hi> where he was received with great civilities by the Duke,
and much private discourse past between them. In these very Ruptures, Count
<hi>Guido,</hi> who had deserved very well of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
was a great Confident to the whole Spanish Nation; for having fought on the
Kings behalf in the wars of <hi>Flanders,</hi> past several times secretly
between <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Millain,</hi> and had had private discourse with
the Governour of <hi>Inoioso;</hi> wherefore, and for the news which was given
out in <hi>Italy</hi> of great gifts that he had received from the Duke, he was
much suspected in the troubles which insued after between these Princes: and as
out of the aforesaid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons the Duke thought the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
might favour him in this Enterprise; so he imagined upon better grounds, that
he had no reason to doubt the French: For he had found, two years before, by
his own experience, how much that Queen did de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>est war in the Kingdom du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the minority of her Son; and though
her Nephew the Cardinals danger should make her take a contrary resolution, it
was to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that those Forces and those Succours would rather have been
prejudicial then of any help to the Adversary, as those which would 
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53250:19"/> infallibly have made the Spaniards join in favour with the
Duke, against the Cardinall, as against one who did trouble <hi>Italy;</hi> and
who, with little of reputation or safety to the Kings Dominions, did call in
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations, a thing which was much abhor'd by the Spaniards in this
Province: As for the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> he thought them much less able
to disturb this Enterprise; since not any one of them, whilst the King was
savourable unto him, could succour <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which was far distant
from all their Dominions, and every where surrou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed by the State of <hi>Millain, Piedmont,</hi> and by
the River of <hi>Genoa:</hi> He was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise incouraged by many things wherein

esteemed a Prince of great Courage, Saga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And moreover, by his long experience, very well acquainted with the affairs of
the world, and well vers'd in State-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by reason of his Intelligence
held with many Christian Princes: That he was by his natural disposition, by
his long experience in war, so much exercised in Military Affairs, as that he
was not to be equal'd therein by any Prince of those times: The opinion which
was held of his Vivacity and war-like Spirit, practised both in good and bad

            <p>Having considered all these things, and being of a great Spirit,
and full of extraordinary confidence; and incited by an ardent desire of
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging the limits of his Dominions (a thing which over-sways all other
humane affections) being moreover inflamed with indignation for the injury
which he afterwards pretended was done him; they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared greater, and more
secure to him, then peradventure they would prove; they therefore prevailed
more with him then the consideration of any difficulties which he was likely to
meet with in this his resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which either not dreaming of, or not caring
for, he thought it necessary, as it becomes all great Spirits to do, to make
use of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition of times; thinking (as he was wont to say) that
they would be as favourable unto him, as they had been the contrary to his
Grandfather, when by the Decree of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, he
was excluded the possession of <hi>Montferrat:</hi> Therefore neither whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
refusing, nor yet wholly consenting to his Daughters Marriage, he demanded that
she should first come into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and bring her Daughter with her;
and that his pretentions to <hi>Montferrat</hi> should first be decided, under
pretence that he would have no cause of contention left behind him and Cardinal
<hi>Ferdinando,</hi> when he should be become his Son in law.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:53250:20"/> It was not yet three Moneths since Duke
<hi>Francis</hi> his death; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it was not certain whether
the Dowager Dutchess was with child, or no, yet the thought thereof growing
daily less, and the Cardinal being with some resentment incited thereunto by
the Duke her Father, he at last consented that she should return to
<hi>Piedmont:</hi> And he began to take upon him the Government of the State in
his own name, without any consideration of the Child that might be born, and
took upon him the Title of Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> not foregoing that of
Cardinal. The indeavours nor hopes of the future Marriage, were,
notwithstanding, quite given over when the Dowager Dutchess de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted:
wherefore when she was ready to take her leave, she intreated the new Duke,
even with tears in her eyes, that he would give her leave to carry her Daughter
(at least) to <hi>Modena,</hi> that she might be brought up there with her
Sister <hi>Isabella,</hi> where she did rather chuse to live, then to return,
without her Daughter, home to her Father: Upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of her departure,
Prince <hi>Victorio</hi> was again returned from <hi>Turin</hi> to
<hi>Mantua,</hi> and Princess <hi>Isabella</hi> her self from <hi>Modena,</hi>
who joyning in their fervent intreaties with the Dowager Dutchess, they
indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make Duke <hi>Ferdinando</hi> grant her request: The young
Prince could not gain say such Intercessors, though he had formerly refused
many other indeavours to the same purpose: Being therefore overcome by the
intreat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es of these Princes, or
wrought upon by the tears and affectionate speeches of the Mother, he
condescended to a request of so great Importance; but upon condition, that the
Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> should return back his Niece whensoever he or the
Emperour should desire; and that in case her Mother should return to
<hi>Turin,</hi> the Match unconcluded, the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and of
<hi>Modena</hi> should be obliged to send her back to <hi>Mantua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Agreement being yielded unto upon Prince <hi>Victorio</hi>'s
Paroll, if it were not the chief cause, and original of the troubles which did
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards insue, was a great occasion of their commencement; but the Duke of
<hi>Modena</hi> foreseeing how much trouble and difficulty he might incur if he
should meddle in this affair; and how hard it would be for him to keep the
condition stipulated without offending some of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and perchance also
the Emperour or the King, if they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the young Lady, and being
unwilling to enter into Oaths or Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, required of him by the Duke of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> absolutely refused to rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ve her: Wherefore the Dowager Dutchess and the young Prince,
failing in this their hope, returned to <hi>Piedmont</hi> without the young
La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. When they were come to <hi>Millain,</hi> the Governour desiring their
satisfaction, did of himself mediate with the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> that the
Niece might be left with him upon the same conditions; which not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing granted
him, he desired that the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> would oblige him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to stand
to covenanted Conditions; which having at last, but not without the Duke of
<hi>Savoys</hi> urgent pressing, obtained, <hi>Don Diego di Leva</hi> was
suddenly dispatch'd away from <hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to see the
first Agreement executed; but the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s mind was for many
respects already altered; for no small commotion was raised in his Court; nor
were there small complaints made of him for this his so easie consenting to
trust his Niece with others; and the great desire <pb n="27" facs="tcp:53250:20"/> the
Governour had to have her by any whatsoever means out of his hands, made him
look more narrowly into the importancy of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness: It was also said by
many, That when she should be come to <hi>Millain</hi> many would swear Loyalty
to her. Hereunto was added <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar</hi>'s command touching the retention of
his Niece, which peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he had forgot when he promised to part with her:
And that which bore most weight with it was, He thought himself free from his
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, which being made when the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> tied himself to
Conditions in the disposing of her, the Duke having already dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, all
Obligations seemed to be dissolved, which without a new Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could not be
in their full former vigor, by the sole consent of the said <hi>Modena.</hi>
Being therefore become more wary out of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said respects, he would not
ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>in commit the same fault
whereof he thought he was as happily acquitted as he easily had at first run
into, by his good nature, and (as he himself said afterwards) through an excess
of love: wherefore the Bishop of <hi>Diocesarea,</hi> who was in his Court,
being sent to <hi>Millain,</hi> the Duke was not so strict in satisfying those
Princes and the Governour, as that the Bishop, who was a great Confident of the
Dutchess, should appease her anger for this his new denial, by keeping the
Treaty of Marriage on foot: But the Reasons alledged by the Bishop were not
admitted of by the Prince; for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that whensoever the Duke of
<hi>Modena</hi> had accepted of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Conditions the Promise should,
without all question, have been observed to them, he complained freely thereof
in a Letter sent back by the same Bishop; and going with his Sister from
<hi>Millain,</hi> he went to <hi>Vercelly,</hi> where they were much expected
by the Duke their Father. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> thought himself much
injured, that his Daughter, contrary to his will, had been so long detained;
that his Niece was denied him, wherein, he said, the word pass'd to his Son was
bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and hereupon he took occasion, under pretence of just resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to
assault, and make himself Master of <hi>Montferrat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whil'st the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was wholly intent upon this,
the Bishop returned with Authority from Duke <hi>Ferdinando</hi> to conclude
the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, whereof the Governour had the first time given him no small
hopes; and with Commission also to satisfie Prince <hi>Victorio</hi> by word of
mouth, touching the complaints contained in his Letter: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being sent
by the Governour to <hi>Vercell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who would not listen to the two
things concerning which the Bishop was sent, began to press his pretentions to
<hi>Montferrat</hi> hard upon him, and the assignation of his Grandchild,
touching which he had no Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to say any thing: There were at this time
in <hi>Piedmont</hi> between three and four thousand Souldiers listed, part of
those that were raised at the time of King <hi>Henries</hi> death; and were not
disbanded, though the King was pacified with the Duke; and though they had been
often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> to free those of
<hi>Genoa</hi> from the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions they had of them, or to secure the peace
of the Kingdom from the scandals that might thereby arise: Yet the Duke,
appearing willing to dismiss them, feigning sometimes to do so, by sending some
of their Companies out of his State, he concealed the rest as much as he might,
distributing them into several parts of <hi>Piedmont:</hi> At last 
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53250:21"/> when the Duke his Son in law was dead, he had fill'd up

prepared for so sudden an assault; for the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Officers,
and all the Inhabitants, being comforted in expectation of the Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age which
was in Treaty, thought themselves to be in secure peace, and looked for nothing
less then to be assaulted; and so much the less, for that to boot with
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> having been always in the Kings prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereby they
thought they should not be subject to novelties; Duke <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was
also assured by the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> that the Duke of

would be ready to assist him: and under colour of not giving the

Arms were taken up for the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of that State on the behalf of the
Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> to whom he said it did of right belong; for which he
was afterwards banish'd, and brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with other aceustomed punishments, as
guilty of high Treason: The same night the City of <hi>Alba</hi> was assaulted
and taken by <hi>Guerrini;</hi> who having fallen upon the Walls on sundry
sides<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by break of day, with 600. Foot, and a Troop of Horse, threw down
the Gate towards <hi>Tanaro</hi> with a Petard; by which the Souldiers
entering, and scaling the Walls in other parts, they made themselve; Masters
thereof without much opposition, before the Citizens could put themselves in
order to defend the Walls; amongst which the Cavalier <hi>della Motta,</hi> the
chief man of the City, was slain, together with some others: and <hi>Silvio
Via,</hi> Captain of Horse, who kept the Castle for Duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi>
being abandoned, was quickly forced to surrender it: The City was this mean
while miserably sack'd by the Dukes Souldiers; yet women were kept unviolated,
and sacred things un-injured, otherwise then was done in other parts of
<hi>Montferrat:</hi> yet they proceeded severely with the Bishop of that place;
for being violently drag'd from the sacred Altar, where he was upon his knees,
he was ill beaten, and had a Ring pluck'd off which he wore upon his finger;
and being led Prisoner in shamefull manner through the City, he was forc'd to
purchase his liberty with his monies; which when he had disburs'd, he had
notwithstanding a Guard put upon him in his own Palace, and at last forced to
forego the City, and to keep in <hi>Nivello,</hi> a place belonging to the

also; for <pb n="30" facs="tcp:53250:22"/> whom the Prince did suspect were Imprisoned

was intended to be given that very night to <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> was deferr'd

delay their coming to <hi>Asti;</hi> from whence Count <hi>Verrua</hi> parting
the next night with a good number both of Foot and Horse, he sent the Cavalier
<hi>Redortiers</hi> before to fasten a Petard: Some Companies of
<hi>Montferrians</hi> were already gotten into that Town; and yet the Town
being very weak, and abandoned by the Garison, it was taken at the first
Assault, and also sack'd; but greater provisions being requisite for taking the
Castle, which was strongly scituated, <hi>Verrua</hi> returned to
<hi>Asti;</hi> from whence he sent more men and Artillery, and began

               <p>THE Wars of <hi>Montferrat</hi> is continued to be related; as
  also the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Negotiations made by the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> and
  other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Surrender of the Castle of <hi>Montcalvo:</hi> The
  oppugning of <hi>Nizza della Paglia:</hi> Prince <hi>Victorio's</hi> going to
  <hi>Spain:</hi> Orders sent from that Court to <hi>Italy,</hi> touching the
  protection of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Restitution of the Towns that were
  taken. In execution whereof <hi>Nizza</hi> is freed, and the other Towns
  restored to the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi> The War of <hi>Garfagnana,</hi>
  between the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> and the Common-wealth of <hi>Lucca;</hi>
  which being accommodated by peace, the business of <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> is
  reassumed, and divers Negotiations pass between the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and
  <hi>Mantua;</hi> which whilst they are in Treaty, <hi>Spains</hi> final
  Resolution comes touching the quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the security of
  <hi>Montferrat:</hi> Prince <hi>Victorio</hi> returns to <hi>Italy</hi> badly
  satisfied with the King and Court of <hi>Spain.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>WHen the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> had news of these Commotions,
and heard of what had happened in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> they were not a little
astonished; For foreseeing the mischiefs that were threatened <hi>Italy</hi>
thereby, no man could imagine how the Duke had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun that War, to the so great
prejudice of the publick Peace, and to the so great danger of the Common
Affairs: Being much perplexed, they argued, out of circumstances, and by
probabilities, whether it were done merely out of the Dukes own deliberation,
or by participation <pb n="32" facs="tcp:53250:23"/> had, and Intelligence held with the
Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> It was hard for any to perswade themselves, that that
King should consent to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of a State, the protection where of he
had ever sincerely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed; especially since it was impossible this should
happen without causing commotions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and without making way for
Forreign Nations to enter; things totally repugnant to those sound Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
whereupon the safety of his Dominions, and the power of his Authority was so
happily built: But it did no less repugne the total Affairs of his Crown, that
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> should add so rich, and so well peopled a Dukedom to
his Dominions, it being so near, and lying so opportunely for the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> left his Power being thereby doubled, he mig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> have a mind to novelties, and that
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aiming at greater matters, he might bend his thoughts to the
prejudice of the Publick Peace; or at least, if he should keep quiet, he would
be less pliable, and depend less upon the Authority of that Crown. The Dukes
natural Genius made this opinion appear more probable; it being hard for him to
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ine himself within the
boundeurs of his own Fortune; wherefore he had been hardly detained formerly
from shewing the bad satisfaction which was discovered to be in him, and
contrary to the ends of that Crown, and to his last streight Intelligence held
with King <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> which being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by Arms,
and by the conjuncture of Times, had made it appear how much disdain, and the
desire of greater Affair, had prevailed over him; wherefore all augmentation of
Power or Authority was to be apprehended in him. Yet notwithstanding (as men
are naturally easie to believe those things which they fear most) there were
but very few who did not firmly believe the contrary; as not believing that the
Duke would have begun such a business upon his own bottome, whereby he would
have drawn <hi>France</hi> upon his back, and have irritated <hi>Italy:</hi>
They therefore concluded, it was impossible he should have put himself and his
own Affairs into so manifest trouble, unless he had been back'd by that
King.</p>
            <p>This opinion was the more confirmed by the flow proceedings of the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> to extinguish this fire which the Duke had kindled; and
this, in process of time, did so much increase this opinion, as the many
evident demonstrations which the King did by his actions manifest (the which,
the more evident they were, the more were they interpreted to a sinister sence)
were not sufficient to remove it: The more every one did believe this, the more
were they puzzled in finding out the ends which could make that King and his
State Ministers put on such a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution: And as the supposing of this proved
afterwards vain; so of necessity must they be but r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ve concerning their imagined ends. Many believed that
they were permitted this enterprize, to the end that they might by terror of
Arms get that young Lady, which they could not do by Authority or inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>vours: Others reasoning more subtilly, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that
they might willingly foment dissention between these Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, out of hopes
that the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> not being able of himself to defend that
State, should (as he had often formerly indeavoured) change it upon
disadvantagious terms; the greater part whereof he should have divided with the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> out of a desire to make <pb n="33" facs="tcp:53250:23"/> himself
master of the Castle of <hi>Casalle.</hi> Those who discoursed more moderately,
thought, that the Kings State Ministers were willing to see the Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi> reduced to these streights, to necessitate him to have recourse
to their King, to the end that being either favour'd or disfavour'd by him
therein, it might be known how much the adherence of that Crown did redound to
the advantage of the Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi> Those of <hi>Italy</hi> being
agitated by these thoughts, and doubtful what the sequel would prove, they were
not less anxious for fear of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mischief, then uncertain what remedies
to prepare which might be adequate to the eminent danger. The mean while the
Dukes forces caused great commotion and fear in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> where like
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>under the blow was felt, before
the lightning was seen. That State was then unprovided of Arms, Men, or
Ammunition, with a powerful Enemy within the bowels thereof; who had already
made himself master of two of her chief Towns, and was ready to take the third;
and who pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laged many Towns and Villages, abandoned by their Inhabitants, who
yielding to the Enemy, ran readily to swear
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ealty unto him. The Governour,
and Mantuan Officers, surprized at so unexpected an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, were astonished,
thinking no less of their own weakness to defend themselves, then on the Dukes
readiness to offend them, they much distrusted the chief Montferratins, whom
they knew to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with by Count <hi>Guido</hi> against their Prince.
They likewise di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusted the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> by reason of his
dearness with the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> out of the ordinary ambition of
Agents, to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>vantage their Masters
condition, by any whatsoever way: and much more, finding how little his actions
did answer to his preceding promises; when either to appease them, or to
bereave them of necessary provision upon such like occasions, he assured them,
that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> would not move, or if he did, that he would
oppose him in defence of <hi>Montferrat.</hi> Being uncertain therefore what to
do, all things were full of terrour, tumult, and confusion, which was made the
greater by the miserable Country people, and by the inhabitants of weaker
Towns, either assaulted, or exposed to be assaulted by the Enemy; who therefore
to shun the calamities of War, and the excessive cruelty of the Dukes
Souldiers, ran half naked, with their Wives, and Children, into
<hi>Casalle</hi> and the neighbouring parts of <hi>Millain,</hi> filling some
with compassion, and some with grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Lieutenant-General of that part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> to beyond
<hi>Tanaro;</hi> and sent divers other Captains to other places, providing
where he thought it most necessary to do so. And yet seeing the Enemy strong in
the State, and therefore considering the present mischief, before the future
evil; he resolved, though in vain, to have recourse for help to the Governour
of <hi>Millain;</hi> and being resolved to relieve <hi>Trino,</hi> he
indeavour'd to send in 2000 foot thither, who might enter in privately by
night, before it should be surrendered. But as they were passing over certain
waters, (being people taken up here and there, and unexperienced) they were so
astonished at the hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ing of
Gun-shot, as they shamefully turned <pb n="34" facs="tcp:53250:24"/> back, and left the
Powder and Ammunition which they brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the place, in the Enemies
hands. In this so great and sudden per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, the unexpected coming of
<hi>Charles Gonsaga,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> was of
no small moment; who going at that time upon other occasions to <hi>Rome,</hi>
came with two Galleys to <hi>Savona;</hi> where hearing of the Duke of
<hi>Savoy's</hi> March, of the taking of <hi>Alba,</hi> and that divers other
places were besieged, left his journey, and went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to
<hi>Casalle:</hi> It is not to be exprest with what joy and consolation he was
there received by people of all ages and conditions. His Father
<hi>Lodowick</hi> was son to <hi>Frederick Gonsaga,</hi> by <hi>Margaret
Paleologa:</hi> but his elder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

went to <hi>France,</hi> where he served that Crown long, and married the
daughter of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> one of the Peers of <hi>France.</hi>
Who inheriting that State, together with other Territories, and the honour of
Peer of <hi>France,</hi> conveyed them all over to this <hi>Charles.</hi> Who

relief, who was considerable for his quality, for his known valour, and for the
confidence they had in him, by reason of his relation to that State, and to the
Lord thereof: but chiefly for the extraordinary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he shewed, to imploy
his life in their service; and comforted them with unquestion'd succour which
he assured them they should soon receive from <hi>France.</hi> Duke
<hi>Ferdinando,</hi> hearing the unexpected news of the taking of his Towns,
and not being able in so short a time to do much, he betook himself for help to
his Friends, and to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and favour of the chiefest Christian
Princes; particularly to <hi>France;</hi> from whence, both in respect of the
Queen, and of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which he had been so kind, he had as much reason
to expect succour, as he thought he might distrust assistance from
<hi>Spain.</hi> But having received Letters in the very instant of these
ruptures, from <hi>Spain,</hi> of the so long desired protection of that Crown;
though the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> unexpected onset, and the Spanish Agents
proceedings, made him somewhat jealous thereof; yet considering how far distant

Messengers sent to <hi>Millain,</hi> to make the Governour thereof secure the
eminent danger of that State, according as he had promised to do. And to the
end he might prepare for his defence, no less by Reason, then by Arms, and the
favour of his Friends; he also published a <hi>Manifesto</hi> in answer to that
made by the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> wherein amongst other things he complained,
that when he had an Embassadour in that Dukes Court to treat of new alliances
with him, he had assaulted his State unexpectedly by night, contrary to the
Laws of God and Nations; and that having surprized his principal Towns, he had
committed Rapine, Plunder, and all kinds of cruelty against all sorts of
people; no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> pardoning the chastity
of Virgins, nor sacred ornaments, dedicated to the Worship of God; and that he
had also exercised his savageness upon the lives of poor Priests. Then
re-assuming the treaties held with Prince <hi>Victorio,</hi> at his parting
from <hi>Mantua;</hi> he shewed that he was absolved from his word 
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:53250:24"/> gainsaying the reasons alledged by the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> touching his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> by the Authority
of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth's Decree; he added, he had
notwithstanding been ready to do that by the way of friendship, which had been
awarded him by competent Judges; But that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> contrary
to all reason, and contrary to the Institutions of his Ancestours, who had
treated of these differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in a civil manner with the Emperours, had by

the contrary, he did earnestly pray and supplica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

little of good that was intended him from <hi>Spain,</hi> and therefore
despairing of help from thence, he forbore not to express it. The mean while he

1000 Foot; and having sent notice to <hi>France</hi> of his condition, he
expected succour from thence; but for all this his cause was stuck unto by the
Italian Princes; for the Venetians, and the great Duke of <hi>Toscany,</hi>
weighing the importance of this business, and the consequences which might
succeed thereupon, declared themselves on the behalf of the Duke of
<hi>Mantua;</hi> the State of <hi>Venice</hi> resolved to pay a certain sum of

and the great Duke gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves diligently to raise Souldiers for the

his friends, to throw himself into the arms of-the said King, and by exchange
for somewhat of less value, surrender <hi>Montferrat</hi> unto him, which he
could not by any other means keep from his adversary; and so the condition of
<hi>Italy</hi> might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by such a change. A consideration which many
thought might as well have kept the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> from such novelty;
because it would be more inconvenient for him, then for any other, that
<hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> which was as it were in the bowels of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and so very near <hi>Turin,</hi> should be possest by the Spaniards, who by
building Forts in fitting places, might keep him in perpetual subjection. This
Counsel was not therefore generally approved of, whose wisdom every one desired
might at this time have been greater, and that it might have prevailed over his
desire of possessing himself of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> or over his resentment of
the injury he conceived he had received; and that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porizing, according to

               </gap>ed for other opportunities and occasions, whereby he
might have experimented his Title, or his Fortune, without indangering the
quiet of <hi>Italy,</hi> more to his own conveniency, and with less danger to
others. But the news of these commotions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being heard in <hi>France,</hi>
though they caused much trouble there, yet the Queen being resolute not to
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion any alteration in her Kingdom by taking up Arms, after many
consultations, held it best to betake her self to those means by which not many
years before she had composed the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> affairs. She
therefore resolved to assist her Nephew in a civil way: especially since in
regard of the double alliance between her children, and those of the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> from the conclusion whereof a strict union was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and a
firmer friendship then had been formerly hoped for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those two Crowns:
she had just reason to be confident her medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and indeavours would not
prove vain in that Court. But on the other side, for the Kingdoms greater
honour, and the more safety of her Nephews affairs, she gave out that she would
assist him by Arms; and made some preparations, more in shew then reality;
which being afterwards heard upon the Confines of <hi>Savoy,</hi> caused some
jealousie in the Duke; and it may be the news of their coming was not without
some good to <hi>Italy.</hi> This mean while, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
seeing his Counsels favour'd by success, much more then he had reason to hope
for; little apprehending the far-off Forces of <hi>France,</hi> and being
confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Spaniard would not trouble him nearer hand; especially
since Prince <hi>Victorio</hi> was return'd to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> not without
satisfaction from <hi>Millain;</hi> whence he had sent thither, to let the
Governour know, how well it became the King, in point of honour, to resent the
injury that was done him in the persons of his children; Therefore growing
daily bolder, and spreading his sailes broader to the prosperous winds of
Fortune, he advanced farther in the conquest of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> not
punishing those who withstood him, more with Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y Contributions who had willingly
submitted; insomuch as in a short time he made himself master of almost all the
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Montferrat.</hi> Where the Souldiers trampling upon all things both 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:53250:25"/> sacred and profane, made the Inhabitants, without any
distinction of age or sex undergo all the evils and adversities which the
licentiousness, av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rice, and
libidinousness of War could occasion: So as the Dukes name became shortly no
less odious, then formidable; though to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent scandal, and inconvenience,
and to acquit himself of so g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eat
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses, he had caused some of his most insolent Souldiers to be severely
punished. And being incouraged and grown proud by success, and not thinking
that any of the Italian Princes could oppose him in this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, though
they did not approve thereof, he recalled his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour from
<hi>Venice,</hi> and dismist the Venetian Embassadour that was resident with
him, as the Embassadour of a Prince that was his Enemy: Not complaining so much
that the Common-wealth had declared it self to adhere to his adversary, as of
the manner how; because no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours had preceded the Senates Declaration, as
seemed fitting to have been done to a Prince that was a friend: And
understanding at the same time that <hi>Innocenzo de Massimi,</hi> Bishop of
<hi>Bertinoro,</hi> and Vice-Legat of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> who was sent unto him
upon the present Occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with the Title of Extraordinary Nuntio, had
indeavoured some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, with the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> tending to the
favour of Duke <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando;</hi> he forbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e giving him Audience for some days, making use of his conceived
anger as of a pretence wherefore not to listen to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals, and
consequently not to slacken the War by any Treaty of Peace: But not knowing
how, civilly to avoid the coming of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco Gonzaga,</hi> Prince of
<hi>Castiglione,</hi> who was come to <hi>Piedmont</hi> from the Emperour,
though he was unwillingly come to Treat with him, as equally suspecting the
person sent, and the sender, and detesting the occasion of his coming, yet he
resolved to give him Audience in <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calleri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prince had order from <hi>Cesar</hi> to threaten him with an
Imperial Bando, or an Edict of the Emperour against him, unless he should
instantly restore the places he had taken, and forbear further offending
<hi>Montferrat</hi> with Arms, which was a State held in fee-Farm from the
Empire; but the Prince not thinking it a seasonable time to exasperate the
Duke, mitigating his Embassie, and turning the Threat into Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
perswaded him to pursue his pretentions by Law, and not by Arms. It was sore
for the Duke to interrupt this so fortunate way which he was in, and to
withdraw when he was almost possess'd of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: He therefore bethought
himself to take occasion by this present stop, of justifying his Cause, and not
refraining his proceedings, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such Articles, as not being likely to
be accepted by his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, might necessi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ate him to declare a difference in the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and
might consequently win himself more favour from that Crown. His Answer was,
That he was ready to desist from the Enterprise; and referring the whole
difference to <hi>Cesar</hi> and the King, that he would deposite the Towns of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> into their hands, which was no more then to put them
absolutely into the hands of the King, and of his State-Ministers, of whom
<hi>Ferdinando</hi> was jealous, for the aforesaid Reasons, which jealousie was
increased in him by this his Adversaries so great confidence: For
<hi>Cesar</hi> having no Forces in <hi>Italy</hi> would not in likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood make
any use of the trust imposed in him, but by way of colour: <pb n="38" facs="tcp:53250:26"/>
And yet the Prince of <hi>Castiglione,</hi> who was not diffident of the Court
of <hi>Spain,</hi> as the Duke was, was not displeased with the proposal,
espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the present condition of affairs stood: He therefore went for
<hi>Mantua,</hi> believing certainly to perswade the Duke thereunto; but he
found himself absolutely averse; were it either out of the aforesaid Reasons,
or for that <hi>Cesar</hi> had by Letters exhorted him not to admit of any
middle way, without being first fully possessed of all things, or that he began
to be of better hopes, finding that he was favoured by the Venetians and great
Duke, and that he began to find the King of <hi>France</hi> well inclined
towards him.</p>
            <p>In this Interim <hi>Montcalvo</hi> was surrendered to Count
<hi>Guido,</hi> who had pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d upon
it with Artillery, and made many assaults upon it; in so much as those within
finding themselves void of all defence, did at the first Article to surrender,
if they were not relieved within three days: And the Governour of
<hi>Cassalle</hi> having in vain desired but only one thousand Foot from the
Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> to put thereinto; it would without all doubt have
fallen into the Dukes hands within the time prefix'd, had not the Cavalier
<hi>Ottavio Valperga d'Conti di Rivara,</hi> who came out of
<hi>Pontestura</hi> with 500 of his men, got safe into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle; where
leaving men and Ammunition, he went out again the next night, and passing
through the Enemy, with more prejudice to them then to his own men, he returned
to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>om whence he went the day
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: This Relief did for a while delay, but did not totally hinder the
Surrender; for Count <hi>Guido</hi> shut up all the avenues to the Castle by a
continued Trench; and making some Mines underneath the Bulwarks, and beating
down the Parapets, he brought the Enemy to utmost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair; who not being able
to keep any longer upon the Walls, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no hopes of succour,
surrende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed fifteen days after the
beginning of the Siege.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Montcalvo</hi> being taken, there did not any thing remain in
the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ence in the upper <hi>Montferrat,</hi> but <hi>Cassalle</hi> and
<hi>Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stura,</hi> and what the Garisons of those places could defend.
<hi>Pontestura</hi> was not strong of it self; but standing upon the
<hi>Poe,</hi> and very fit for the Enterprise of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> it had been
somewhat fortified at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of these Commotions, and furnished with a
reasonable Garison; which Garison the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> (intending
peradventure to advance <hi>Cassalle)</hi> summoned upon pain of life to
surrender within a short time. Prince <hi>Vicenzo</hi> was at this time in
<hi>Cassalle</hi> with his Mantuans, and the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> was there
also; but fearing lest they should leave the City unprovided, or distrusting
the valour of their men, if in their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to succour <hi>Pontestura,</hi>
they should light upon the Dukes men, who were incouraged by such success, they
would not send to assist it, as was necessary they should have done; but
thought it better to secure <hi>Cassalle,</hi> which was the chief place of the
whole State, and not to haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard those men which were the prime forces that the
Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> could assemble at that time: But on the other side, the
loss being too great which would be had if <hi>Pontestura</hi> should not be
succoured, they got leave of the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> that some
Companies of Spanish Foot should en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er thereinto with the Kings Colours, in reverence whereunto the
Duke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>orbore the Siege: And
thinking that to attempt <pb n="39" facs="tcp:53250:26"/> 
               <hi>Cassalle</hi> would be a
weighty business, and too great for his Forces; es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially since he had
disposed of the most of his men in the Garisons of the Towns which he had
already taken: Therefore altering his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he turned to the lower
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> where the Country about <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi> had not as yet
been touched by his Forces: There was but two Towns therein which could dispute
the whole Dominion thereof with him, <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>San Damiano;</hi>
for the City of <hi>Acqui</hi> was not able to make any long resistance; and
the other Castle of <hi>Ponzone,</hi> which lay towards the Sea, served rather
to guard the Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, then to defend
the Country: And as for <hi>San Damiano,</hi> though it was strongly situated,
and munited with Artillery, and an extraordinary Garison, yet being divided
from <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and invironed by the Territories of
<hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> it was not sufficient of its self to hinder his
advancing. The Duke was therefore content to annoy it with only a few Souldiers
and some Pieces of Artillery, not doubting but that when he should have
pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd himself of the other parts thereabouts, it would fall into his
hands: He therefore went with all his Forces to the expugning of <hi>Nice,</hi>
as that which being placed upon the Frontiers of his Dominions, hindered him
from making himself Master of the parts about <hi>Acqui,</hi> and of all the
neighbouring Country, This is a Town great enough, situated in a Plain,
abounding in Victuals, and capable of a great Garison: The figure thereof is
like a broken Pyramide, by the side whereof a small River, called
<hi>Nizza,</hi> runs on one side, and on the other side the River
<hi>Belbo,</hi> somewhat greater, which serve her for a great Ditch; and these
waters, mingling together a little forwarder, they finish the imperfect Pyramid
of the said Town: The Walls are very old and weak, and as those of the antient
form, for the most part without Flanks or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks; only on the point which
looks towards <hi>Alessandria</hi> there is a Castle with some Towers, but much
ruinated by time; The Basis which looks towards <hi>Piedmont</hi> is of a large
extent; and though it hath neither Rampiers nor Flanks, yet is it munited with
a large deep Ditch: Hither, as to a place upon the Frontiers, and very fitting
for the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciousness and safety thereof, were come the best Militia, with
many Commanders, and persons of good esteem in the neighbouring parts; who,
(the Towns-men not numbred) amounted to the number of 2000 Foot, and 200 Horse,
under the Command of Lieutenant <hi>Castiglione;</hi> who having fortified the
Town in fitting places, and enlarged the Walls with Plat-forms, cleansed the
Ditches, and repaired the Towers, had, with much industry, made it tenable.
Into this place was likewise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered <hi>Antoniotto</hi> and <hi>Carlo,</hi>
Brothers to <hi>Rovere;</hi> the one Commissary of the Militia, and the other
of the States Munition, together with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Captains and Officers of good
condition, and well affected to their Prince.</p>
            <p>Count <hi>Guido</hi> was deputed by the Duke to this Enterprise;
who drawing near <hi>Nizza</hi> with 2000 Foot, 400 Horse, and three Pieces of
Artillery, did immediately repulse 500 Foot, and 200 Horse, who being come out
against him were not able to indure the sight of the Enemy, but retreated
basely, and in disorder to within the Town; wherefore the Count being Master of
the field quartered himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Covent of the Gapuchins, and the Wall
of the Town which <pb n="40" facs="tcp:53250:27"/> looks towards <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and
though he expected more men and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, yet having tried in vain how they
were minded that were within the Town, he began to batter, and making several
Troops of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons go out, he indeavoured to keep the De<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>endants from standing upon the Wall; and to face them
that they might not keep him from quartering there; But their Artillery was of
so small bore, and the Enemies Walls were made so strong by Plat-forms, as all
battery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in vain, as also all Skirmishes, by reason<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the number
of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, who repuls'd the enemies Horse by showers of Musquet-shot
from the Walls and most eminent places; the which they might the more easily
do, for that it being then a very wet season, the Dukes men could not well keep
abroad to fight, nor make their necessary approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by Trenches; for to boot
that it was impossible for them to keep their Matches lighted, or their Powder
dry, they could no sooner digge a Ditch in that ground, which was naturally
moist, but it was present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fill'd up by springs and rain-water, and the
ground became so slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and dirty, as neither man nor Horse could keep their
feet: with which difficulties Count <hi>Guido,</hi> having for many days
wrastled in vain, and the rain continuing still to fall abundantly, he was
advised by many of his men to send his Horse to possess themselves of some
neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, and go with his Foot to <hi>San Marzano,</hi> and wait
till the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther should prove fairer, and till the rest of their expected men,
their Ammunition and greater Guns, might come unto them, which were now kept
back by the floods of waters; that then they might reassume the Enterprise more
commodiously, and with better preparations: But the Count, who valued his
Souldiers trouble and inconvenience less then the loss of reputation, did not
approve of this; wherefore resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, notwithstanding all difficulties, to
continue what he had begun, he plaid upon the Towers and most eminent houses,
by continual batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to beat off the defenders, and keep his men from being
so easily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd from thence, as they were. Not many days after, some more
Souldiers being come unto him, and the rain beginning somewhat to cease, he
made some Troops of Horse pass over <hi>La Nizza,</hi> that they might possess
themselves of a certain Covent, from whence they might easily hinder the
succour which was said would be sent from <hi>Inoisa,</hi> a Town of
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> but <hi>Castiglione</hi> and the other Commanders, who
were always ready to undergo all trouble and danger, having notice of the
precise hour of the coming of the succour, sent out divers Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies several
ways, who skirmishing with the Enemy in sundry places, kept them play till the
succour of Victuals and Ammunition was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd into the Town. The Count
resolving afterwards to oppugne the opposite part of the Town, sent some Horse
to discover the place. Whereof <hi>Castiglione</hi> being aware, though he feld
the trees round about, and placed Souldiers in several passes to keep the Enemy
off, yet could he not hinder him from making of himself master of the Field
there also; for his men no sooner saw the enemy, then basely foregoing their
Stations, they withdrew to within the Walls; so as the Banks and Baracadoes
being there finished, they were at continual skirmishes: Nor did they forbear
making works on the other side, and approaches, and playing continually upon
the Wall, and the inward buildings with <pb n="41" facs="tcp:53250:27"/> the greater
Artillery, which was come at last, and wherewith they threw down the Monastery
of Nuns; and the ruines of the walls and neighbouring houses falling into the
ditches, those without might have made an assault, had not the courage and
readiness of the defendants supplied all wants; who coming out into the ditch,
and facing the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, did daily fight them; and speedily mending the breaches
which the Enemy had made, stood in good order upon the wall, and kept the Enemy
off; wherefore the Count caused a Cannon to be brought to a neighbouring hill,
wherewith he scowred all that tract of wall, and kept the Souldiers from
standing there; and playing upon the wall in another place with other three
pieces of Cannon, he indeavoured to make way for an assault, which peradventure
might have succeeded, had not <hi>Castiglione</hi> secured the wall from the
battery, by raising some Rampiers. Insomuch as though the Enemy was ready to
fall into the Ditch, having been very diligent in bringing on their Trenches,
and made their Scaling-Ladders ready, thinking to give an assault, yet the
breadth of the ditch, and the numbers, and valour of those that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended it,
kept them from falling on. Whilst <hi>Nice</hi> was thus no less gallantly
oppugned by Count <hi>Guido,</hi> then manfully defended by
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiglione,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> came from <hi>Turin</hi> to
<hi>Chirasco,</hi> and having taken order there for the raising of more men,
and for the sending them to before <hi>Nice,</hi> he came to <hi>Alba,</hi> the
more to incourage the enterprize by the nearness of his person.</p>
            <p>On the other part, Prince <hi>Vicenzo,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Nevers</hi> came to <hi>Acqui,</hi> and indeavoured to raise Souldiers,
thinking to relieve <hi>Nice,</hi> and to free it from the danger it was in, by
the daily access of new men to Count <hi>Guido;</hi> and yet they could hope
for but few Souldiers from thence, since almost the whole upper
<hi>Montferrat</hi> was brought under the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and the
Militia of the County of <hi>Acqui,</hi> and of the neighbouring parts, were
(as hath been said) brought for the most part into <hi>Nice:</hi> If these, who
were the flower of the Country, durst not look the Enemy in the face, what
trust could they put upon the rest without, who doubtlesly were but the scum,
when they were to be brought to the sight of the Trencbes, and Cannon, as
necessarily they must be.</p>
            <p>Four hundred <hi>French</hi> were at this time come by Sea,
amongst which were many Gentlemen, and people of good account, who were friends
and adherents to <hi>Nevers,</hi> who at the first hearing of these rumours,
came from <hi>France</hi> to assist him; and being back'd by Gallies belonging
to the Kingdom, came in the Seas of <hi>Genoa</hi> in small Barks, to find him
out, rather as Travellers than Souldiers; for though the State of
<hi>Genoa</hi> had, with an intention of keeping neutral, inclined at the
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of these Commotions not to give passage to 2000 Tuscans, which the
Great Duke had destin'd for the assistance of <hi>Mantua;</hi> yet being much
troubled lest <hi>Montferrat</hi> should change its Lord, at last winked at any
one that should pass privately through her Territories in assistance thereof:
But these people, who came from <hi>France</hi> in haste, not being very well
provided, proved not so advantagious as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the time required,
save only that they gave some reputation to the Affairs of <hi>Montferrat,</hi>
and that witnessing the readiness of that <pb n="42" facs="tcp:53250:28"/> Nation, and the
zeal thereof towards the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> it made the News which was
divulg'd in <hi>Italy,</hi> of the great preparations of that Kingdom, be
believed. And yet the necessary delay which the French succour required, making
their hopes of the reliefe of <hi>Nice</hi> but small, doubtlesly when the Duke
of <hi>Savoy</hi> should have got it, he would have been Master of all this
part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which was all reduced to underneath the Duke of
<hi>Savoy's</hi> obedience, save <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and <hi>Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stura:</hi>
And consequently all men being full of fears and jealousies, they murmured
greatly against the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> that he should so long
suffer so great a violence; that he should so little value the Kings
reputation; he was held to be the <hi>Pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

detestable an enterprise; for how durst the Duke else have dared to attempt a
State which was taken into the protection of so great a King? How else durst he
despise the Majesty of that Crown, and the so neer and powerfull Forces of the
State of <hi>Millain?</hi> Nay, they murmured against the King himself, and the
Spanish Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if they had openly conspired with the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> against the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> in a nick of time when the
King of <hi>France</hi> was not able, by reason of his Minority, to oppose
their designs: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all <hi>Italy</hi> was in a rage; and seeing the
harmony of concord out of tune, and the common safety and publick quiet
disordered, began to distrust the King, and that Nation, whose ambition and
desire of rule was not bounded with <hi>Montferrat:</hi> And as the private men
did not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear expressing their sense and back bitings in Libels, clapt up in
divers publick places, even in the City of <hi>Millain;</hi> so the Potentates
of <hi>Italy</hi> began to waver in their friendship and inclination to that
Crown, and bethought themselves of new remedies, whereby to provide against
those dangers which they thought the safety of the common Affairs might be
subject unto by so great a novelty. But in this fluctuation of minds and
accidents Orders came from <hi>Spain,</hi> which causing much joy, shew'd how
vain their murmurings and bad opinions were of that King and Nation: The News
of these so great Commotions was come to that Court, both from <hi>Italy</hi>
and <hi>France;</hi> and though they fell upon many considerations, yet the
Justice and Equity of the Cause prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before all other respects with that
King and Counsel, as likewise the Peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the not
permitting that any other Princes should grow greater by the oppression of
another; (principal foundations whereupon having always wisely ballanced the
Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> they had also the better secured their own) it was
with extraordinary readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness resolved in that Court, according to the great
and urgent impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of the Pope, and Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
according to the Queen of <hi>France</hi> her desire; that the Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi> should immediately be put into the full possession of whole
<hi>Montferrat.</hi> In conformity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it being known that Prince
<hi>Victorio</hi> was come to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> being sent by his Father to
draw the King and that Court to favour his Cause, he was immediately commanded
to tarry in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> not far from <hi>Barcelona,</hi> and not being
admitted to see the King, to tarry there till restitution of whole
<hi>Montferrat</hi> should be made by the Duke his Father. Which action was of
much satisfaction to all Italians, and <pb n="43" facs="tcp:53250:28"/> shew'd how much the
King and Court of <hi>Spain</hi> were unconcern'd in these commotions. On the
contrary, it was cause of infinite distaste to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he
thinking peradventure that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being not content to
favour his adversary in his sentence; but that out of an ambition of purchasing
the name of a just and uncorrupted Prince, he would not stick to suppress him,
even in his own son, in whom he had placed his final hope; and whatsoever he
was to expect from that Court, which had made him covet that the world might
know he was more in favour with that King, then the other Italian Princes.</p>
            <p>These Orders being come, the Governour was ready to obey them; but
his Orders being very slowly proceeded in, the Swissers not being as yet
arrived, nor <hi>Rho</hi>'s nor <hi>Gambaloita</hi>'s Regiment yet fill'd, and
<hi>Nice</hi> being sorely beset both by day, and night, the Town began to be
out of hope of holding out long; for the relief thereof it was therefore
necessary at the present to make use of almost the whole or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Garrison of
the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> Wherefore <hi>Don Antonio di Leva</hi> Prince of
<hi>Ascoli,</hi> one of the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> who being at that time
in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> was chosen by the King to be Camp-Master
General, was sent thither with six Companies of Light-Horse, (whereof <hi>Don
Sanchio de Salina,</hi> Lievtenant of the Cavalry of the State, was Captain)
with 3000 Spanish Foot, commanded by the Camp-Masters <hi>Luigi di
Cordova,</hi> and <hi>Giovan Bravo di Laguna,</hi> and some few Italians
assembled together by <hi>Lodovico Gambaloita,</hi> which did not in all make
4000 Foot, and 600 Horse, who joyning at <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Vincenso</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who had with them 600 other
Horse, and about 2000 Foot, amongst which were French, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y marched in company towards <hi>Nice.</hi> But the
Duke seeing that his designs were withstood on one side by <hi>Cesars</hi>
command, and on the other side by the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces, and
finding also that <hi>Italy</hi> was against him, and the French much
irritated; and consequently knowing that it was impossible for him to withstand
so many Potentates who were joyn'd together against him in the behalf of the
Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> whom he peradventure had hoped to have supprest, and
undoubtedly to have vanquished at the first push, making vertue of necessity,
resolved to yield to the condition of times, and to give way unto the Kings
will, whose Forces having never formerly withstood, he had not yet a mind to
oppose, nor learnt to be contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: For having endeavoured, and
peradventure not in vain, to make a little delay of the succouring of
<hi>Nice,</hi> rather that he might say he had been Master thereof, then with
intention of keeping it; at last, seeing the Prince of <hi>Ascoli</hi> near at
hand, and <hi>Castiglione</hi> resolute to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, he sent the Count of
<hi>Ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>a</hi> into the Camp, with
Orders to Count <hi>Guide</hi> to remove his men from thence, having
notwithstanding given notice thereof before to the said Prince; to the end that
seeming to do it willingly, meerly out of the reverence and observancy which he
bore to the King, his resolution might not be attributed to necessity, but as
in acknowledgment of the favours he had received. Thus the Kings Forces and
those of the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> drawing joyntly neer <hi>Nice,</hi> Count
<hi>Guido</hi> began to march off; and before he had been gone a mile, seeing
Prince <hi>Ascoli</hi> appear with his Army in order, he, to the 
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:53250:29"/> end that he might march off with more reputation, made his
men halt, and f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

between them, that if the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s men would march off, the
Kings Forces should not meddle with them. Thus Count <hi>Guido</hi> marched
with his men towards <hi>Piedmont,</hi> without giving or receiving
molestation. Though <hi>Nice</hi> were freed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet Arms between those of
<hi>Piedmont</hi> and of <hi>Montferrat</hi> were not laid down; for the Duke
of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s men did not only diligently keep what they had gotten, but
proceeded to take in other places: And on the other side, those of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> being encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the relief of <hi>Nice,</hi> and by
the King of <hi>Spains</hi> appearing for their Prince, being also exasperated
by the bitter injuries received from the Piedmontesans, and assisted by those
of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> drove out the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s
Garrisons, and endeavoured to return under the Dominion of the House of

was up, after a fierce assault he was repulst, and had some of his men slain;
and returning back by the Hills, lost two small pieces of Ordnance, which being
sent with a small Guard by the way of the Valley, were taken by the
Piedmontesans. In this interim 4000 Swissers were come to the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> and <hi>Don Iohn di Castro</hi> had brought 1000 Spaniards
from <hi>Naples;</hi> and the Camp-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters <hi>Gambaloita,</hi> and
<hi>Rho,</hi> had fill'd up their Regiments, so as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour had 12000
Foot and 2500 Horse, ready to send into the Field. There were likewise 13000
Foot, and 500 Horse come to <hi>Mantua,</hi> through <hi>Garfagnana,</hi> and
<hi>Modenese;</hi> a gallant and powerful aid, sent by <hi>Cosmo</hi> the
second, great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> under his brother Prince
<hi>Francisco,</hi> and govern'd by excellent Commanders; who were likewise
accompanied by many of the Tuscan and Roman Nobility; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Duke of
<hi>Modena</hi> favouring the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by reason of alliance,
denied them passage thorough his Territories, which he was ready upon his
Confines to make good with Arms; yet receiving notice from the Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> that it was for the Kings service that those men were to
pass, he was contented not to hinder them; and yet the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
went from his word, and deferring, day after day, to restore what he had
gotten, seemed rather inclined to the contrary; for he daily re-inforced all
the Garisons of the Towns which he was by word obliged to restore; he took more
men into pay; he held intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> with those
Princes who he thought would be desirous of novelties; and therefore more
likely to joyn with him in his cause; either by reason of the ancient emulation
which they bore to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> or being discontented with the
present Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and finally, keeping his men still in Arms against the
Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrians, he intended nothing but preparation for War; wherefore the
Italians who were jealous of any the least delay, began again to waver. The
proceedings of the Spanish Agents increased their suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions, who dealing very
gently with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and carrying themselves contrary to the
conceived expectation of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s orders, were not ready
answerable to the commands they had received; and therefore it was feared, that
by their being armed, they aimed more at the oppression, then protection of
<hi>Montferrat.</hi> For they did no ways impede the Dukes Forces; which (as
hath been said) overran <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> without any respect. And the
Prince of <hi>Ascoli</hi> (who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards boldly impeached to have held
private intelligence with the Duke of <hi>Savoy)</hi> having spent four days in
going with his Army from <hi>Alessandria</hi> to <hi>Nice,</hi> which was but
12 miles, seemed in effect to have consented to that delay, which in resolute
terms he had dénied to do in presence of his Captains, to the Marquess
of <hi>Neviglie,</hi> who was sent to <hi>Alessandria</hi> to stop him. And
after those of <hi>Piedmont</hi> were gone from before <hi>Nice,</hi> he under
pretence that they might return when he should be gone, left a Garison in the
Town with the Kings Colours, which seemed rather to have possest themselves
thereof, then to have freed it. The Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>'s self, after
having mustred the Army, to the end that all things might be fully understood
by him, and by the <pb n="46" facs="tcp:53250:30"/> King, instead of forcing the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> to obey the Kings orders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to abhor <hi>Nevers</hi> his
French men, nor would he suffer the <hi>Tuscan</hi> succours to pass into the
State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and turning to the Mantuan Officers, told them it
stood not with the Kings honour, that their Prince should make use of other
assistance then his. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> thought it somewhat sore, to
bereave himself of their aid who were so readily come from so far of to assist
him, and to put himself absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into their hands which before he had so
much distrusted: especially since thereby he might have highly offended the
Queen of <hi>France,</hi> and have alienated that Nation from him, a strong
curb (as all men thought) to the avarice of the Spanish Ministers, and to the
small inclination which they had to him.</p>
            <p>But since it becomes a man sometimes, in urgent, and great
extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to submit to anothers discretion. Duke <hi>Ferdinando</hi>
finding the French promises and aid to be far off, and uncertain; that the Pope
was free of nothing but good will; that he could make but little use of the
Tuscan succour without the Governours good will, who by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them passage
did not only make them of no uses to him upon the present occasion, but a
continual excessive charge; that the Venetian aid were but weak, and that they
were not only, as the Tuscans, to depend upon the Governours good will, but
uncertain, and not very safe. For the fear being once removed, that the
Spaniards should pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess themselves of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> it made for the
interest of that Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> should make
himself master thereof; to the end that by weakning a neighbouring Prince, a
Potentate might be raised in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> of almost equal Forces to the
State of <hi>Millain;</hi> whom by reason of the far distance of their
Confines, he had not only no reason not to fear, but might be confident, he
might by powerful diversions be a security to him, if at any time he should be
assaulted, or troubled by the Spanish Forces. On the contrary, he saw that the
Spaniards, (of whom he was assured by the Queen of <hi>France)</hi> were
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in this present Insurrection, for ends contrary to those of the
Venetians. Having therefore cast up all things, he knew that he, and his
affairs were so far ingaged, as he must of necessity satisfie those in whose
power it lay either speedily to suppress him, or to raise him up: wherefore he
resolved at the last, much to the dissatisfaction of the Duke of
<hi>Nevers,</hi> to adhere unto them. Which resolution, though it was not well
approved of by the Italian Princes, who thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the safety of
his Affairs; yet it proved afterwards, by the event, good. For the Governour
not being able any longer to delay the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the Kings Commission, and
fearing the coming of the French, which was much more spoken of by all men then
was true; and moreover being desirous to satisfie all the world; and so many
Princes as had conceived ill impressions of him, he compel'd the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> to make restitution, without any further delay. On the other
behalf, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> fearing to be taken between the Armies of
<hi>France,</hi> which he understood were stirring upon the Confines, and the
Governours Forces, which were ready to compel him; and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by
obedience to overcome the King and Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposing that
this his so great and ready liberality would be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensed 
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:53250:30"/> by as great a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>avour, he at last gave way to the
Kings will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereunto nothing did so much induce him (as by way of
comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t he afterwards protested) as
the Governours word given unto him in the Kings name, that his Grandchild
should within a few days be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
unto him: that he would obtain pardon for the Rebells, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for the
losses and expences of the War: and that finally, his pretences to
<hi>Montferrat</hi> should be decided within a short time. And because the
Duke, for his honour sake, hated to deliver over what he had taken, directly
into the hands of his adversary, the business was thus carried; that he should
deliver it all into the hands of the Princes of <hi>Castiglion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> and <hi>Ascoll,</hi> as
State-Ministers, the one of them of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the other of the King of

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
to him that had most right thereunto: that the said Princes should then
immediately assign them over to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as to him to whom
by the Laws they ought to be restored, he having been bere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> thereof. Thus did neither the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
prejudice his own interest, by referring his cause to Justice, nor the Duke of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> who was suddenly repossest of what was his, suffer any damage
or delay, and the Kings Ordinances were obey'd, being alter'd only in
appearance, not in substance.</p>
            <p>The aforesaid Princes went each with an equall portion of men to
<hi>Trino,</hi> where the Gate was thrown open unto them; by which, whilst they
and their people entred, the Dukes Garison went out by another Gate; after
whom, the Kings men went out at the same Gate; who being but then entred, and
making no abode there, left the Town in free possession to Prince
<hi>Vicenzo,</hi> who was entred with those of <hi>Mantua,</hi> immediately
after the Kings men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The like was done three days after by <hi>Alba,</hi>
and <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> and the other Towns of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the
Spanish Garison was likewise taken out of <hi>Nice;</hi> as also the Siege from
before <hi>San Damiano,</hi> which held still for Duke <hi>Ferdinando.</hi> Who
within three moneths after the first assault was meerly by the Kings Authority,
almost without unsheathing a sword, intirely put into possession of that State,
which he had almost totally lost. The Italians were not a little pleased at
this restitution, wherein the King shew'd such celerity and constancy; and as
it is usual with men, when they find themselves freed from what they had long
feared, to run headlong into the contrary affection; so these being long
possest with jealousies and fears, it cannot be exprest how much they admired
the Kings goodness, and magnanimity. Who preferring the justice and honesty of
the Cause before all other respects, would not yield that the assaulted Prince
should be injured. And it appearing to every one, that he had shewed himself in
this action rather to win the good will of those who are possest of States,
then injuriously to become master of the States which they possess, it was
evidently seen and witnessed, that his intention was not to thirst after other
mens possessions, as the more powerful Princes often doe; but rather that he
did abhorre the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly possessing himself thereof, and the Tyrannous
oppression of petty Princes. Jealousies being therefore turn'd into much
confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, all men rejoyced to see examples of moderation in so great a King,
which are so rare and singular in these times. These unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected successes made
it be generally believed that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> 
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:53250:31"/>
being abandoned by all, would have totally given over the begun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize.
But affections deeply rooted in mens minds are hardly pluckt out. He thought
that his so much readiness, and reverence, his so great, and rare example of
observancy and devotion to the King; (whereby he had much confirmed the
Authority and reputation of that Crown both in <hi>Italy,</hi> and elsewhere)
might make him deserve to be protected by his Majesty, at least for the
advantage of his pretentions: which (as he said) he was promised by the
Governour, should soon be composed in a friendly manner. Nor did he confide a
little in his Sons intercession, a Prince of much expectation, well beloved by
the King, and by that Nation, which as much as the Disputes between his Father
and his Uncle would permit him, he seemed to be very ambitious of: and to whom,
to boot with his neer relation in blood to the King, the expectation of his
paternal inheritance might purchase much favour; which being by succession to
fall upon him, he could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that that Court would let slip so
opportune an occasion of making the young Prince always well-affected to that
Crown. Moreover, having been in outward appearance very severely dealt with, he
thought that the King, tempering his past rigour, would favour him the more in
future essentialities. Wherefore the Duke, in hope of some good success by his
Sons Negotiation, withdrew his Forces to within his own Confines, and was quiet
and peaceful; and seeming to confide much in the King, profest to depend
totally upon his Majesty, as the sole protectour of this business.</p>
            <p>In this interim, the war in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which seemed either
to be wholly at an end, or suspended by a tacit Truce, broke ont in great
fervency between the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> and Common-wealth of
<hi>Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> in <hi>Garfagnana,:</hi> which War, the less considerable the
smalness of the affair was (which was but about a few handful of Confines) of
more moment did the fervor and great preparations, wherewith it appeared to be
made, make men think it to be of some moment: as also the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nobles which
flock'd thither from both sides; for the Princes, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonso</hi> and
<hi>Luigi,</hi> the Dukes first and second Sons, had militated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: It was
occasioned at first by some Reprisals of Oxen and flocks of Sheep; from whence
they came to Confiscations and Banishment, and at last to Arms: For the
<hi>Lucchesi</hi> out of apprehension of the great as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance which was sent
from <hi>Tuscany</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> having assembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether almost the
whole Militia of their State, which amounted to 16000 fighting men for the
desence of their Country; the danger and fear of their affairs ceasing,
bethought themselves to make use of them by insesting other mens Territories;
they sent the Mass of their men to prejudice the Duke of <hi>Modenas</hi>
Country, which they burnt, and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously destroyed at unawares, meeting with
no resistance; for the Inhabitants being busie in husbanding their Farms, as in
secure peace, were dispers'd abroad in the Country: And not herewithal
contented, they took some small open Towns belonging to the jurisdiction of the
said Duke: Then making Mount <hi>Perpoli</hi> the Seat of War, they fortified
it in all convenient places, and quartered above 10000 fighting men there.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> being no less scandalized that his
Country <pb n="49" facs="tcp:53250:31"/> should be burnt and destroy'd by the Lucchesi,
sent as many men as he could raise in his own Country, which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>amounted to as many as the enemy
were, under the Command of Count <hi>Hipolito Bentivoglio;</hi> at the sight
whereof the Lucchesi, who before ran over the Country, and laid it waste,
betook themselves to the fortified places: Wherefore the Modenesi having
erected other Bulwarks, and munited other Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, they also fortified their
Towns of most importance; particularly <hi>Castelnuovo,</hi> the Metropolis,
and residence of the Governour of <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fagnana</hi> under the Duke; and
<hi>Mulessana,</hi> a place not far from <hi>Castelnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ovo;</hi> in which
places, lying near Mount <hi>Perpoli,</hi> Prince <hi>Alphonso</hi> kept with
100 Horse and 1000 Foot, to face and suppress the Lucchesi that were fortified
in the Mountains. Divers skirmishes past this mean while, both here and in
other parts thereabouts, with various fortune; wherein there happened nothing
remarkable, save the great obstinacy and fervency where with they fought on
both sides: For the Lucchesi, pretending to be several ways injured by the
frequent molestations which they received from the Modenesi upon their
Confines, thought to provide so by war, as that the Dukes men should for the
future keep themselves within their own Precincts: And the Dukes men holding
themselves to be no less injured then did the Lucchesi, who had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their
Dukes Confines in hostile manner for sleight occasions, which, as they said,
might have been decided by the Civil Law, were mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incensed, and desired
by all means to shew how much they resented the injuries done them; but the
Mountainous Country, which would not suffer them to draw out their men, and
make trial of their Forces, hindred their desire of revenge: And the Lucchesi,
contented with the resentment they had made, kept, for the most part, in their
strong holds, and fortified Towns, not coming out but upon advantagious terms,
nor affording the enemy much occasion to prejudice them: True it is, that 400
Lucchesi having at the sight of Prince <hi>Luigi</hi> abando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a certain
Station, whereby the Modenesi might freely march to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gallicano,</hi>
they were so bold as to make that attempt; especially since that Enterprise
made much for the final end of the War: For <hi>Gallicano</hi> is a large Town,
and of great importance; not only as being the Magazine of Victuals and
Ammunition for the war, but for that if it should be gotten, the Lucchesi would
be as it were besieged in Monte <hi>Perpoli,</hi> and almost in the power of
the Enemy, as not being to be succour'd. There was a strong Garison in
<hi>Gallicano;</hi> which, by reason of the loss of the abandoned Station, was
forthwith reinforced; so as coming forth against the Prince, who drew near it,
they fought a while without any advantage on either side; but 400 Foot coming
in to assist the Lucchesi, the Modenesi were forced to give way, till such time
as being succoured by more men, they forc'd the Lucchesi back into
<hi>Gallicano;</hi> and making themselves masters that very night of a Fort
called <hi>il Pian de Termini,</hi> which served as a Cavaliere to the place,
they did not only keep the Defendants from coming upon the walls, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
through the Streets, but hindered also the carrying of Victuals from thence to
Monte <hi>Perpoli:</hi> wherefore to free themselves from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience,
the Lucchesi built another Fort in a higher place then that which was taken by
the Prince; from whence the Modenesi be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="50" facs="tcp:53250:32"/> infested, the
Prince resolved to beat them from it: He went thither early in the morning with
good store of men, amongst which were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobility, and began to give
a hot assault, which being sustain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with no less servor, the fight continued
four hours; the eminency of the situation, which was secured by Trenches and
Rampiers, making for the advantage of the Lucchesi, from whence they much
indamaged the Assailants by Musquet sho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> who not being able to resist any longer, they began to
run; not were their Commanders, and many Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who with their Swords in
hand would have staid them, nor the danger nor example of their Prince, who
fighting valiantly amongst the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
foremost incouraged them to persevere in the Enterprise, able to stop them.
Many of the Modenesi fell in this assault, amongst which some Personages of
esteem, by what was argued by the spoils which were taken from their dead
bodies by the Lucchesi; but this ostentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on lasted but a while; for this loss
was soon recompensed by the taking of Monte <hi>Fegatese,</hi> a great Town of
the Lucchesi's, which was burn'd and put to fire and Sword by the Dukes men;
who, the Garison run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, entered the Town, and there got good store of
booty, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of Cattel, which were brought thither by their owners, for
grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter safety: Then the Modenesi, seeing how little amends they had made for
the loss which they received at the beginning of the war; and how h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rd it was to wage war with men who
were fortified in high places, they fell upon the Country, which they laid
waste, barking the Trees, and cutting down the Vineyards; in imitation whereof
the Lucchesi, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o after the first
commotion had foreborn ransacking, did yet worse, leaving nothing unruined
which had escaped their first fury.</p>
            <p>The Prince leaving men enough in <hi>Pian de Termini,</hi> from
the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise of <hi>Gallicano,</hi> which appeared every day to grow more
difficult, went with the rest of his men to take in <hi>Castiglione,</hi> a
great Town, and the chief in those parts; whither it was hard to bring relief,
because it was invironed by the Dukes Forces. This place was from the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning furnish'd with a great Garison; and hearing that the Modenesi came
afterwards down from the Alpes, Cavalier <hi>Casare Boconvisi</hi> was sent
from <hi>Lucca</hi> with 200 select Foot, beside; many Citizens, who of their
own accord went along with them; so as these being joined to the test, made up
the number of 1200 Souldiers, besides the Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who were of able bodies,
and ready to defend themselves: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Modenesi carried the greatest
force of war against this place; and began to play upon the Castle gate with
thirteen pieces of Cannon, which within a few days they threw down, together
with a Tower, and a great part of the wall, and had made the way ready for an
assault: But having behind them some of the Lucchesi's Sconces fortified, they
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> going on for fear of being
annoy'd from thence; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore continued to batter the Houses from the
nearest and most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient places, not without much danger and prejudice to
the Defendants; who though they were not safe neither in their houses, nor in
the streets, yet were they not wanting to shelter themselves the best they
could with Trenches and Plat-forms, raised in fitting places, and with deep
Ditches dug behind the Rampiers. This mean time Treaties of Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were not
omitted, which were from the beginning of the war me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diated <pb n="51" facs="tcp:53250:32"/> by the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> at the request of the Lucchesi;
who having to this purpose sent Count <hi>Baldassar Biglia</hi> to
<hi>Modena,</hi> and <hi>Scaramucchia Visconte</hi> to <hi>Lucca,</hi> could
not as yet effect it: But consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering afterwards how much the loss of
<hi>Castiglione</hi> would redound to the dishonour of his King, who had taken
upon him the protection of that Commonwealth, he ordered Count <hi>Biglia</hi>
to go into the Town, to set up the Kings Standard, and to say that he kept the
Town in the Kings name; which being suddenly done, the Battery ceased, and
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards all other offences, by the intercession of the Governour; so as the
treaty of agreement being re-assumed, it was at last concluded upon these
conditions. <hi>That the Confines should remain bounded as they had formerly
been, upon the same occasion, by Count</hi> Fuentes; <hi>and that the place of
this new difference not being comprehended, it should be left to be agreed upon
by some deputed to the same purpose: That the Lucchesi should quit all the
Towns and places which they had taken in</hi> Modena, <hi>and should demolish
whatsoever they had erected upon their own grounds; that the Duke of</hi>
Modena <hi>should do the like; who giving his word that he would not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest
the Lucchesi, who were the first that should disarm, he should likewise dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm
afterwards, and dismiss all his men: That the Commonwealth of</hi> Luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
<hi>should keep no more then their usual Garrisons within their walled Towns,
and a Gentleman which the Governour would send thither to keep them in the
Kings name, who was to restore them to the Signiorie, when all had laid down
Arms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The affairs of <hi>Garafagnana,</hi> wherein the whole summer had
been spent, being thus composed, those of <hi>Montferrat</hi> grew to be
troubled again, and to decline from the good way they were in. The Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> kept still in Arms, and as it were ready to fall upon
<hi>Montferrat</hi> again, hoping by his Forces to make his adversary more
plyable to his pretensions: The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> was therefore forced to
keep many strong Garrisons in <hi>Casalle,</hi> and in other places of most
concernment. Commerce was not only wholly interdicted between those of
<hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but private men proceeded to
continual reprisals, and the Magistrates to the confiscation of such goods as
those of the contrary party possest in their Territories. The Governour was not
permitted to disarm, whilest the occasions lasted which forced him to take up
Arms: <hi>Montferrat</hi> was therefore in continual motion and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension,
being neither in perfect peace, nor open war; and because this redounded to the
great trouble and charge of the Millaneses, and to the prejudice of the Kings
honour, who had openly profest to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect <hi>Montferrat,</hi> many counsell'd
the Governour to send the Army into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to keep it there
till such time as the Duke, to free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self from the trouble of quartering,
should resolve to dismiss his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Forces. The Governour seemed at first
willing to follow this advice; and to this purpose sent first <hi>Don Sanchio
di Luna,</hi> Keeper of the Cittadel of <hi>Millain,</hi> and then <hi>Don
Franceso Padiglia</hi> General of the Artillery into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to
demand Quarter of the Duke for the Kings Army, who bringing back answer in
general terms, and words relishing more of civility and ceremony, then of
substance, or posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, by which it was conceived the Duke was inclin'd to the
contrary; the Governour, dismissing the Swissers, and sending the Spanish Horse
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:53250:33"/> and Foot to their usual Quarters, by a sudden and contrary
resolution, sent Prince <hi>Ascoli</hi> with the rest of the Souldiery to
quarter in <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat.</hi> Who chusing <hi>Villanova</hi> for his
quarters, within four miles of <hi>Casalle,</hi> distributed his men in several
parts of that State; where he kept them all the next Winter, to the excessive
damage of those peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, exhausted already by their former sufferings, and by
the late War. This new, and unexpected resolution of the Governours, renewed
the first jealousies: and the Italians conceiving that the King did not
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed so sincerely as they imagined, began to suspect him more then
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore mistrusting the Spaniards, they began to fear that
the restitution of the Towns in <hi>Montferrat</hi> was but a counterfeit shew,
to lull them asleep, and to keep the French Forces from falling furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously into
<hi>Italy.</hi> All men did firmly believe, that the Spaniards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their
ancient grudge against the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and keeping secret
intelligence with <hi>Piedmont,</hi> did suffer them to keep armed, that so
they might have occasion to oppress that State, under the honourable title of
protecting it, or atleast, to the end that the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> wearied
out with length of negotiation, and Court irresolutions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed by so long
quartering, and agitated by continual fear of their Enemies, and of their
Protectors Forces, might be brought to despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate conditions; and so they might
make themselves masters of that State, without any noise, without fighting, and
without disturbing the peace of <hi>Italy.</hi> These diffidences were
increased by the new, and strange comportments of the Kings Officers, and
Spanish Commanders in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who believing perhaps that their
Kings intention was such, did confirm the general opinion with undoubted
speeches; and as if they were to change condition of Government, they
sollicited the Montferrians, who were weary of so many troubles, to desire the
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Government that they might be rid of their vexations. And ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
actions to their words, they suffer'd their Souldiers to be licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
arrogating much authority to themselves, to the diminution of that Duke, whose
Officers, as being unarmed, were fain to wink at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers things, to avoid
greater mischief; wherefore they became of less esteem amongst the Kings
Souldiers and Commanders, who now see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be chief masters. All men were
likewise scandalized at the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coming of munition for War from
<hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and which was yet worse, that Prince
<hi>Ascold</hi> should give them safe conduct thorow <hi>Montferrat;</hi> he,
and the Governour defending their doing so, partly under pretence of friendship
between the King and Duke, which was not as yet broken; partly esteeming any
provision the Duke could make against what the King ordained touching the
affairs of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> ridiculous; as if it were impossible the Duke
should ever dare to gainsay it. But mens minds were chiefly troubled at the
coming of <hi>Don Alphonso Piemontello,</hi> General of the Horse in the State
of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to demand the young Princess in the
Kings name. With him went not only the chief Officers, and Commanders in War,
to frighten that Prince, and to make him part the more easily with his Niece;
but as if the business were already taken for granted, and that they went
rather to receive then to demand the young Lady, many Coaches were sent along
with <hi>Pie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ntello,</hi> to bring
her and her train <pb n="53" facs="tcp:53250:33"/> to <hi>Millain,</hi> no man doubted but
that this action of the Kings was a strong argument that he was rather minded
to alter, then to compose the present Affairs; For that child was then thought
the chiefest means to work novelty. And besides, that the demanding of her when
<hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> was incumber'd with the Spanish Army was a demand which
argued violence, and seemed therefore contrary to that good inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which
the King had always profest; so much solemnity, and such preparations, made the
Embassie seem rather a protestation, or tacite threatning in case of deniall,
then a simple Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Pimontello</hi> came to <hi>Mantua,</hi> he found the
young child sick; and the Duke not being able to expose her to that journey
without evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent danger, he made use thereof to deny the sending of her, and
not so only, but he also fenced himself by the Emperours Rescript; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he
was prohibited to deliver her up to any one; and yet seeming in general words
to be ready to pleasure the King, he added that in the interim he would send
into <hi>Spain</hi> to treat of this Affair; such a business was not of so
easie disgestion, or so soon to be granted; it being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in that Court by
the Duke of <hi>Savoy's</hi> great importunity, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the fresh
remembrance of his ready restoring the Towns he had taken; by the intreaty, and
pretentions of the <hi>Dowager</hi> Mother, Nephew to the King; by the presence
of Prince <hi>Victorio;</hi> and by the Kings word past to the Duke, by the
Governour of <hi>Millain.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> being therefore to
make use of some one who might be more then usually wise and industrious to
handle a business of such importancy, he trusted the managing thereof to
Monsigneur <hi>Scipio Pasquale di Cosenza</hi> a Prelate much esteemed and
favoured by him. <hi>Who being sent extraordinary Embassadour to the King,
acquainted him and his State-ministers with the merits of the Dukes cause:
desiring that it might not only be taken notice of by his Majesty, as by a just
Prince, by the way of the known Law of equity; but that it might be protected,
defended, and favoured by him, as by a Protector. He added, that to deposite
the young Lady, especially after the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>had taken up Arms,
would be an acknowledgement that that Commotion had been just and lawful; as
also all the other violences and hostilities committed against</hi> Montferrat:
<hi>which besides that it did repugne his Majesties most holy deliberations,
and just De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations; the Duke of</hi> Mantua <hi>could not with honour
adhere thereunto; since it would always appear unto the world, that he had
condescended there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, contrary to all Reason, for fear of being again
assaulted. He then shewed what the Dukes intentions were; he did not conceal
what the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences were which might be the result thereof; he made it be
known how much men were scandalized, how much</hi> Caesars <hi>Decrees, and the
very Laws of Nature were contradicted, if that young Lady should by his
Majesties command be forced to go out of her paternal Country where she was
born, out of the Dominions where she was nourisht, and separated from their
sight and company who were so neer allied to her in blood. He wisht it might be
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, how much it would redoun'd to his Dukes dis-reputation, if his
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty persisting in his demand should make the world see how little he did
confide in his faith and integrity; that it was impossible that he who had been
so ready and so zealous in protecting his Dukes Dominions, would now so highly
injure him in his honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:53250:34"/> These, and other Reasons alledged by the
Embassadour were much seconded by the Queen of <hi>France,</hi> her
pretentions: who sollicited from <hi>Mantua,</hi> made a third in this Affair;
desiring that the young Lady's education might be allotted to her, as to one
neerer of kin to her then the King was, in case the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>
should not be trusted with her. Whereupon the King, were it either that he
approved of the Reasons alledged, or to avoid giving dissatisfaction to the
Queen, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted further pursuing his demand. Many will have it that the King
required this at first, more out of his own genius, and tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to
his Nephews the Princes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> then by any advice of his
Counsellours, or out of any sinister intention to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
and that it not being intrinsecally approved of by any one, no not by the Duke
of <hi>Lerma,</hi> from whom he was seldom wont to differ in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, it had
not its just perfection; it being known, that at the same time when
<hi>Pimentello</hi> was sent to <hi>Mantua,</hi> the answer which that Duke was
to make was suggested to him by the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> and the
manner which he was to observe upon this occurrency, to the end that he might
retain his Nephew. And doubtlesly, the Governour did this by order from the
Spanish Ministers of State, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to moderate the Kings desires by
delays. Many were much troubled to think what the truth of this might be, the
business being spun out at length, and what the issue thereof would be, not
being known.</p>
            <p>During these doubtful proceedings, the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>
fell sick; and there being but little hopes of his recovery, it was feared by
the Italians, that his unseasonable death in these turbulent times might
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten the Spaniards secret designs; for he not having any issue, and his
brother not being likely to have any, his Dominions would fall upon the Duke of
<hi>Nevers,</hi> the next of kin to the house of <hi>Gonsaga;</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
born in <hi>France,</hi> was, for his great adherences, and many possessions
which he had there, esteemed to be more French, then Italian. Nor was there any
that did doubt, but that the Spaniards would rather suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any other
condition, then that a French-man should possess so great a State in
<hi>Italy.</hi> Wherefore all mens minds were possest with fear and confusion,
foreseeing what troubles, and revolutions would insue upon the Dukes death:
which seemed to be confirmed by bad Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and prodigies. For in the same
year of 1613, on the 11 of <hi>October,</hi> there arose a terrible tempest at
Sea, the like to which was never seen, which beginning at <hi>Provence,</hi>
and running along with much terrour, to the uttermost parts of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples,</hi> did so agitate the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustick and Tuscan seas, as entring even
into the Havens, which were otherwise very safe, it sunke almost all the ships
therein, to the great prejudice of the Merchants, and to the terrour of all
lookers on; the same tempest penetrated into <hi>Lombardy,</hi> where it threw
down houses, rent up trees by the roots, and did such mischief as had never
been before, so as many (as it of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>en falls out when men are astonished with amazement) beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n to hold these accidents prodigious,
as so many signs wherewith the heavens did threaten much greater calamity to
come; to these Prodigies were added the troubles of <hi>France,</hi> which
having been quiet till then under the Queens regency, was not a little
disturbed. <pb n="55" facs="tcp:53250:34"/> For the Princes of the Kingdom were not able to
suffer that <hi>Concino Concini,</hi> and his wife, both of them being
Florentines, and the Queens great favourites, should be prefer'd before them in
Authority, and in the conduct of publick Affairs. They were likewise much
troubled at the Kings Marriage with the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi>
fearing lest such an union might tend to the diminution of that Authority which
they by all means indeavoured to arrogate unto themselves in that Kingdom. And
the opposition of <hi>France</hi> being held to be a great curb to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Forces in <hi>Italy,</hi> therefore that Nation being divided within it self,
and troubled with civil Wars, <hi>Italy</hi> remained at the Spaniards
discreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whose ends and designs not being to be withstood by any other
Forces, there was no means left of keeping their King from attempting any
whatsoever novelty, whereby to increase their Kings Empire to the universal
prejudice. The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s self, whose loss was then chiefliest
concerned, seemed more to abandon his own cause then any other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for not
being content to have incens'd <hi>France</hi> against him, and distasted the
Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> by his usage of the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> French;
he seemed to throw himself too much into the King of <hi>Spain's</hi> hands,
and to depend to much upon the Spanish State-Ministers. And this course not
being commonly approved of then, though it proved to be very good afterwards,
he seemed little to mind the eminent danger of his own Affairs. The more for
that conferring the Bishoprick of <hi>Casalle</hi> upon Monsigneur
<hi>Pasquale,</hi> a natural Subject of the Kings, he had also made <hi>Don
Alphonso d' Avalos</hi> Governour over all <hi>Montferrat,</hi> who though he
was an Italian born, and a kinne to him, yet being originally come from
<hi>Spain,</hi> and proses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to be more a Spaniard then an Italian, being
also held to be such a one by the King and his State-Ministers; the Duke seemed
to have but poorly provided for the so turbulent condition of his Affairs, by
these two Elections, at which the Queen and State of <hi>Venice</hi> were much
the more incens'd: who publickly seeming to favour the Duke desired to curb the
Forces and power of his Protector as much as they could; and yet the Queen
being careful of her Niece: Affairs, she sent the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>di Coure</hi>
into <hi>Italy,</hi> a Lord of much authority and reputation, and one who had
with much grandezza discharged the office of several chief Embassies. She sent
him with title of Embassadour in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary for the Occurences of
<hi>Italy;</hi> to the end that treating as well with the two Dukes, as with
the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> and Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> he
might compose Affairs in a peaceable manner. But when he came to
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> he could not see the Duke; who not desirous to treat with
any in this business, but the King, and Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence he
expected much favour, he went a little before the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour came thither, to
<hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> to quiet some commotions which were raised
in those parts. So as the Embassadour passing to <hi>Millain,</hi> and then to
<hi>Mantua,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Venice,</hi> kept in <hi>Italy</hi>
till the beginning of the next year, which was 1614.</p>
            <p>This year produced, at last, effects which shewed the good
intention of the King: and did once more free the Italians of the fears which
they had conceived by the last years successes. For the King having on one side
often comforted the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and on the other side, press'd 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:53250:35"/> much upon the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> not without some
sharpnesse, to the end that each of them willingly laying aside somewhat of
rigour, they might come to agreement: and finding much backwardness in both
these Princes, at last, that he might not be failing to his protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> he resolved to declare himself so, as no man should have
occasion afterwards to doubt his will, nor to be troubled at the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
of his inclination. He dispatcht away Prince <hi>Victorio,</hi> to whom he made
the instrument be given, which contained his final resolution. Which not being
conformable, but rather totally repugnant to his, and to his Fathers mind, the
Prince refused to accept: so as being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with the Court, and as angry as
he durst be with the King, he went by Sea into <hi>Italy. The Instrument
ordained that the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>should totally lay down Arms, that he
should give it under his hand, that he would innovate nothing to the prejudice
of the Duke of</hi> Mantua<hi>'s Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; that he should remit all his
pretences to</hi> Montferrat, <hi>to the Emperour, as to the Supream Iudge:
that he should marry his daughter to the Duke of</hi> Mantua, <hi>and that upon
this marriage all Rebels should be pardoned; and there should be no more
discourse of any damage that had been done by the late War. To this was added,
that if the Duke should refuse to consent to the aforesaid things, the King
would be necessitated to imploy the Forces of his Kingdom in the protection
of</hi> Montferrat, <hi>and to obviate the troubles which might insue in</hi>
Italy.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was highly offended at this, seeing
himself not only wholly fallen from the high hopes which he had conceived, and
hoped to obtain from that Court by his Sons means, of getting part of
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> but also from that reputation which he had thought to have
won, by being so neerly allied unto the King; whilst instead of being
maintain'd by his Majesty of <hi>Spain,</hi> in a business of such concernment,
he was dealt with all as rigourously, as if he had been a stranger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any regard had to his honour, or to tde Kings word, which (as he said) was
plighted to him. Nor was he less distasted to see himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from his
pretentions in the young Lady; wherein thinking that the justification of his
commotion did consist in being the original cause thereof, he was no less
grieved thereat in point of honour, then in point of interest, seeing the ends
mar'd whereunto he aspired, peradventure by the Maidens means. And as
<hi>Pimentello</hi>'s journey to <hi>Mantua</hi> had put him in hopes of
obtaining her, so failing therein, he thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self scorn'd and deluded, and
led on with vain hopes, which he did not a little rescent; the great
obsequiousness which he had shewed to the Kings Authority by his being so ready
to restore, and witnessed so many other several ways, did imbitter his
resentments; as also the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity used to his two Sons at Court; the one
whereof (as hath been said) was to his so much mortification detained for above
a moneth in <hi>Montferrat;</hi> and the other, which was Prince
<hi>Philiberto,</hi> Lord high Admiral at Sea, and who usually resided with the
King, being without any occasion sent at the same time that his brother came to
Court, to reside, and consequently almost confined, at <hi>Porto St.
Maria,</hi> the very utmost Precincts of <hi>Spain;</hi> to the end that (as
the Duke complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned afterwards) he might fall sick in that ill air; and that
being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the contentment of seeing his brother, he might not then
joyn <pb n="57" facs="tcp:53250:35"/> in the treaty of the common affairs. All which things
as he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready past over which much patience, hoping to be at last dealt
with the more advantagiously; so seeing the same method to be held till the
last, he could the worse disgest it. And therefore joyning these, and many
other severe passages together, he could not indure that the world should know
how little esteem was had of him, and how little both he and his Sons could
promise themselves, from their alliance with the King.</p>
            <p>Being thus much disturbed, he, together with his Son, who was come
from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Niece,</hi> went to <hi>Turin:</hi> Where speaking
with the Embassadour <hi>Coure,</hi> who was upon his return for
<hi>France,</hi> it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>g scandalized with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> he would have made
any agreement with the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> by the French Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours
means, only that the King of <hi>France</hi> might have the honour thereof, and
not the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that to that purpose the Popes Nuntio
should go from <hi>Turin</hi> to <hi>Mantua;</hi> by which means the
settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would soon have been had; had not the Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> foreseeing how dishonourable it would have been to the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> that the differences between the Italian Princes should be
adjusted by other means then his, very seasonably opposed it, and wrought so
that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> should not accept of any of the proposed
Treaties. And the same instrument being sent from <hi>Spain</hi> to the
Governour, which the Prince had refused, he (being ordered to do so by the
King) sent it to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the end that he might assent
thereunto: The Duke answered, <hi>That for his part he was ready to disarm, if
the King would do so to; he demanded that the terms and manner of this Action
should be punctually agreed upon: He made some difficulty in passing his word
that he would not injure</hi> Montferrat; saying, <hi>That since he had
foregone all his Holds in that State only to satisfie the King, all men might
be sure, that out of the same respect he would not molest it any more. He did
not consent to remit the differences to be decided by</hi> Cesar, <hi>out of
diffidence perhaps of him;</hi> but said, <hi>notwithstanding he would refer it
to such friends of both sides, who being chosen by the Emperour, might decide
it:</hi> Lastly, <hi>He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that the King should compel him to marry
his Daughter contrary to her own will; but refused not to do it when the common
differences should be decided.</hi> This last Point was moderated by the King,
who explained himself that he had propounded the Marriage as a thing which
might be acceptable to them both, and good for the common quiet, and their
reciprocal friendship; but not that they should be forc'd thereunto contrary to
their inclinations: In all the rest he persisted, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the
first, of disarming; wherein abhorring all conditions or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocalness, the
Kings pleasure was, That if not as Superiour to the Duke in Empire, yet as
incomparably greater in power and extent of Dominion, which made him profess
himself to be Arbitrator of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Moderator of differences
between her Princes, he should abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely lay down Arms: And yet, that if the
difference of <hi>Montferrat</hi> should be accorded, all the rest might
likewise cease; the Governour, not having Force enough at his command to compel
the Duke to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm, according to the Kings appointment; he tryed a new form of
composure between the two Dukes; each of which having at his desire 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:53250:36"/> sent three Deputies to <hi>Millain,</hi> to find out some
means of adjusting dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; divers proposals were made, but all of them so
discrepant, and so far differing from their opinions, as after many days the
business of that confer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nce was
found to prove vain; and at this time Forces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come to the

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Millain</hi> from
<hi>Naples, Germany,</hi> and from the <hi>Switzers;</hi> and the same
directions coming again from <hi>Spain,</hi> that the Decree should be put in
execution, as much at least as concerned the three first Articles; the Deputies
of <hi>Savoy</hi> were given to understand, that the business not being to be
spun out any longer, it was in vain to pursue that begun Negotiation, and that
therefore the Kings Decree must, without any delay, be executed. The Duke
thought himself too imperiously dealt with; and not willing to give way
thereunto, either in respect of his own honour, or out of anger to the King, to
shew himself any whit more obsequious then at first, he betook himself to make
yet further provision for war; and being desirous to take the honourable
pretence of protecting <hi>Montferrat</hi> from the Spaniards, as also to
appease the French, and reconcile the Italians, he published an Order, wherein
allowing Commerce between his Subjects and those of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> he
commanded that none should injure them in their goods nor persons.
<hi>Montferrat</hi> remained therefore for the space of fourteen Moneths after
the first assault, free from troubles of War, wherewith she had been so much
molested; and from the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Quartering, wherewith she had been
much afflicted.</p>

               <p>THe Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> is angry that the King should force
  him to lay down Arms, and to Disband his men; which refusing to do, he is
  assaulted by a Spanish Army, led on by the Duke of <hi>Millain;</hi> who being
  entered by the Vercellese into the Confines of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and
  understanding that the Duke was gone to before <hi>Novara,</hi> returns
  immediately to the State of <hi>Millain</hi> to drive him from thence: Being
  returned, he begins to build the Fort <hi>Scandovalle,</hi> not far from
  <hi>Vercelles.</hi> The Duke retreating to <hi>Vercelles,</hi> desires succour
  from the French, Venetians, and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; many whereof Treat of agreement
  by their Embassadours sent into <hi>Piedmont:</hi> The war continues the mean
  while with the Duke; in pursuit whereof many accidents happening, they come at
  last to a day of Battel near the City: Wherein the Spanish Army being Victors,
  it goes before that City whither the Duke was with-drawn with his men; about
  which the Governour having imployed much time to little purpose; At last peace
  is concluded by the means of Princes Ministers.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Wars of <hi>Piedmont</hi> succeed those of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> wherein the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> sees those Forces
turned against him, which he formerly hoped to have been assisted by against
<hi>Montferrat:</hi> Wherein the Kings good intention contests against the
Dukes anger; the latter being occasioned through hatred and ill will, which the
Duke desired to vent against the Spanish State Ministers, and which he had
conceived upon several occasions; and the other through a singular 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:53250:37"/> example to Puissant Princes, in shewing them how much they
are bound to defend and maintain those whom they have taken into their
protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The present war proceeded from the precedent, as it is often seen
in humane bodies, that one malady draws on another: The Kings Title was the
protection of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and together with the peace of
<hi>Italy,</hi> the quiet and safety of the States which he therein possesseth:
The Dukes pretence, the exempting Kingly Command, the preservation of the
Independency and Sovereignty of Principality, and his necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
against the Spanish Forces; upon which he indeavoured to lay all that odium
which he found to lye commonly upon himself, as being the first Author of the
troubles, accusing the Spaniards of ambition and covetousness to possess his
State. 
<q>Indeed none of right judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could believe that the King,
  who h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>d but a little before
  shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself to be so magnanimous and sincere a Protector of the Duke of
  <hi>Mantua;</hi> which Duke had formerly, upon all occasions, shewed himself to
  be no very good friend to him, should now, without any just Title or apparent
  colour, become a violent usurper of another mans States, to whom he was
  streightly allied by Kindred; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a time when the others great
  observancy of the King, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him, so notably witnessed to the
  world, was sufficient not only to cancel the memory of all past offences; but
  to make him merit the favour and particular protection of that Crown;
  accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the Duke himself had so abundantly professed before: And yet
  though the King was in all mens opinions no ways liable to any such suspicion;
  yet there were those who discoursed variously upon the Kings Command given to
  the Duke, according as men are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously inclined in their judgments. No man
  thought it lawful for a Prince, how much Superiour soever in State or Forces,
  to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand another, who was no subject of his, to disarm, or to prohibit him
  doing what he thought best in his own Dukedom: That other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Dominions
  and Supream power of Princes would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, if under this or that
  pretence, how just or reasonable so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may appear, such authority should
  be granted more to one then to another: That the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> had,
  when they lifted, sent great Armies into <hi>Italy,</hi> not without great
  jealousie to the Italian Princes, who were unequal to them for Forces or
  Dominion: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that was not to be blamed in others, which they had so
  often permitted unto themselves, especially since the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s
  Forces were neither such, nor so great, as to give just occasion of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
  either to the King, or to any Italian Potentate: And that he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already,
  to please the King, readily restored all that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, it was to be
  imagined that he would innovate nothing in the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as he had already
  openly declared he would not do: And that if either the quiet or security of
  his own Dominions, or his Clients (as the King alledged) should oblige him so
  to do, it would be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in such a case, to be ready armed for what
  occasion soever should happen; But that it was not lawful to invade anothers
  Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories by way of anticipation, out of vain suspicions: That this
  pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and this Command was not only without reason, but new, and without
  example; it not having ever been heard or read of that <pb n="61" facs="tcp:53250:37"/> the
  like had been done amongst free Princes, exempt from any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. On the
  other side, the protection of <hi>Montferrat</hi> was plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which could not
  be perfectly made good whilst it was not defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well against the future
  eminent danger, as from the present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury and prejudice: That it is a no less
  trouble to oppress a State with forces, then to ruine it with perpetual fear of
  neighbouring Arms: That therefore the Title of War was no less just and honest
  which was made out of probable fear of being offended, then to remove in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
  received, or to revenge them: That the Duke had given just occasion of
  suspicion some years before; that he would have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to disturb
  <hi>Italy</hi> with his own and forreign Arms; and that the King after
  reconciliation had accused him for being still in Arms, contrary to Article;
  That hence he had the convenience to fall upon <hi>Montferrat:</hi> That things
  continuing in the same posture, and the Duke keeping himself armed without any
  probable occasion, and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding still Intelligence with the French, his ends
  and intentions were much the more to be suspected; and that by what appeared,
  he was but ill satisfied with the King for his no ways pleasing resolves upon
  the present occasion: So as he could not consent thereunto without great danger
  of more novelties; That it was lawful for any one to do what he listed at home,
  wherein none could justly hinder him; but that notwithstanding all men should
  so live and govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as that their neighbours might quietly maintain
  what was theirs without any cause of jealousie: That the King had tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
  long before he proceeded to any such Command, using gentle and respectful terms
  towards the Duke; whereat the very Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who grew jealous
  of the Kings patience, appeared to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved: And that though the King
  had often taken up Arms, yet never without necessary and evident occasion;
  which ceasing, he had forthwith laid them down, without injury to any one, and
  without invading one foot of ground belonging to any neighbouring Prince: That
  the Duke ought to have imitated the King in this example ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in the
  former; since without any war made against him, he had of himself taken up
  Arms: And therefore as the passing a mans word not to offend is accepted, where
  there is necessity of keeping armed; so it is of no weight where that
  consideration ceasing, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to come to execution; which any man may
  indeavour to do by Arms, when no other means hath proved profitable; for to
  keep still in Arms upon the Confines, is a thing too prejudicial to the Prince
  and people, full of suspicion, and moreover subject to the like dangers and
  inconveniencies which are sought to be prevented by keeping in Arms: But the
  Dukes offer to disarm jointly with the Governour, as it answered the major part
  of the opposite reasons, so did it draw the present question to a nearer point;
  for the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects of publick peace, reciprocal security, and satisfaction,
  being in such a case equally to be pleaded on all sides, it was only to be
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, whether the parity of reason which agrees amongst equals, disagree
  amongst unequals: In which ambiguity the Duke was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to accommodate
  himself to the condition of times, and to give way to the will of the more
  powerful, or by defending the liberty and <pb n="62" facs="tcp:53250:38"/> Sovereignry of
  his State, shew by arms what is often seen to happen, That Fortune, Valour, and
  the variety of Humane actions, can equal the disequallity of Forces and
  States.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many, notwithstanding, who approved of the Cause, dissallowed of
the Kings Resolution; thinking that doubtlesly it had been more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and
better done, not to irritate the Duke still more, whose mind was already
sufficiently ulcerated for former distastes, by his appearing now to favour his
adversary so much; nor to press him more, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitate him by new Commands
to the utmost necessity; nay, even to desperation; which forc'd him to resent
the action by throwing off all observance and respect that he might have
allowed him the satisfaction of being somewhat better armed then usual, and to
have dissembled this fervency (as had been done some years before) which
because the precedent and present passages had shew'd, and would shew not to be
profitable; and the continual expence whereof made it daily more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial,
it was to be believed that after having somewhat taken fire again, it would
have quenched of it self; whereas on the contrary, by blowing the coal, instead
of quenching it, they indangered the making it flame higher, and prove more
perillous: But the respect of the Kings Honour and regal Majesty prevailed with
the Kings Council, which being well rooted in the continued peace of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and in the observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy born unto him, even until this present,
by the Italian Princes, and now more confirmed by the Dukes last Obsequies and
reverend carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, had so possest the Spanish State-Ministers, as promising
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves much more then they ought to have done, they did undoubtedly
believe that the Duke would not do otherwise upon this occasion then he had
done formerly, and lately in the business of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> and that
howsoever, any the least appearance of war would be sufficient to suppress any
Commotion whatsoever, and make him desist; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when both
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> being offended with him for his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
assaulted <hi>Montferrat,</hi> did concur in making him look well about him,
and incited the King to make war upon him upon that account. Many lay the fault
of these alterations, in a great part, upon the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>'s
antient emulation and private ambition; who being desire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to take from the
Dukes pretentions, and to abate the edge of his genius, easily forgot and laid
aside the useful consideration of what importance his conjunction would be, and
the good corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the House of <hi>Savoy</hi> with the Crown of
<hi>Spain;</hi> of the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eof the preceding Kings had been very careful, and studied the
continuance thereof: Howsoever, that Court having resolved that the Duke should
give no more occasion of new scandals, but that he should lay down Arms, and
suffer others to live in peace, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Millain</hi> received
order to prepare a sufficient Army to assault him in his own Dominions if he
should resist the Kings resolutions; but to the end that what was resolved of
might be done more justifiably, and with less disturbance to the French and to
the Italian Princes, it was given out, that those Arms were not raised to
suppress the Duke, and that the Kings intention was not to bereave him of any
part of his Territories, but only to possess himself of some places in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ention of
restoring them presently after he should have humbled <pb n="63" facs="tcp:53250:38"/>
himself, and yielded to the Kings demands; They hoped that by car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the
business thus moderately, without disturbing the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
with less jealousie to the Potentates thereof, they might preserve the
authority of the Kings Orders and peace, with advantage and honour to the
Crown.</p>
            <p>But the Duke was otherwise minded; who being exceedingly
exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated at the little account which was made of his interests in that
Court, was ashamed of the obedience that he had shewed thereunto: Being
therefore resolved not to be frighted at the Spanish Threats and preparations,
he prepared sollicitously to defend himself; Nor did he altogether despair to
do it; for though he knew himself very unable to make defence, yet he could not
believe that the French and Venetians, and Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> would
ever suffer him to be supprest, to their own so great inconvenience and
prejudice: Being moreover over-born by his immoderate anger and implacable
hatred to the Spaniards, he in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a despairing manner, minded more his
revenge then the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own affairs: And as men grow most fierce
when they expect the worst of evils; so he aspiring at greater matters, and
promising himself more then he could hope for, undertook to hold Intelligence
with forreign Princes, who emulated the Spanish greatness, by whose favour and
assistance he exceedingly hoped to stir up all <hi>Europe</hi> against the
Spanish Grandezza: He did persist the rather herein, by reason of the Kings and
his Ministers of States inclination to preserve <hi>Italy</hi> in peace; as
also by reason of Orders come from that Court to the States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of
<hi>Italy,</hi> that they should imbrace all occasions to suppress the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
uproar with the Duke, and that he would reserve himself for the last remedy, to
break the peace with him, in case he should grow contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macious; So as thinking,
that come what would come, it might be in his power to keep himself
unprejudiced by war, if he would accept of what now he refused, he thought it
would be more glorious for him to submit to the Kings commands rather inforc'd,
then of freewil; and after he had tryed the fortune of war rather then before
he had looked the enemy in the face: Yet the Dukes distastes were not at first
such, nor so desperate, but that some way of accommodation might have been
found, had not a Letter written by the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of <hi>Millain,</hi> which was divulged by him, made the malady uncurable:
Directions were therein given, <hi>That the Duke should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely disarm, and
that in case he should</hi> not obey, <hi>That he the Governour should
enter</hi> Piedmont <hi>with all his forces, and make him know it behoved him
to obey the Kings pleasure, whose Ministers</hi> (for so it was added) <hi>were
ill satisfied with so many difficulties and such resistance:</hi> He concluded,
<hi>That it was firmly believed, that when the Duke should know this
resolution, he would not forbear observing the Kings Orders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Letter, like a spark of fire in well-prepared materials, made
the combustions, which afterwards ensued, the greater; the Duke being touch'd
to the quick, and thinking that <hi>Lerma</hi> in this Letter shewed no respect
unto him, but that he was therein treated as a subject, did so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test it, as
being much disturbed in mind, and little less then mad, all his indeavours were
to use the greatest demonstrations of resentment, and of disrespect to the
Authority of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he could devise: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <pb n="64" facs="tcp:53250:39"/> did he himself conceal the reason of such combustions; for he was
wont to say openly, that word <hi>Obey,</hi> had made him take up Arms. Thus
words are oftentimes of more force then deeds, and outward demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
offend more then reallities: The Breach began from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation which the
Duke caused to be made to the Governour, when he saw that there was no means of
composition left; wherein, going over the war of <hi>Montferrat</hi> from the
very beginning thereof till the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the places he had taken, he
said, <hi>That he was induced to make that Kestitution out of hopes that his
Niece should have been delivered up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, according to the promise
made him</hi> (as he said) <hi>by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in the Kings name; and that
all Rebels should be pardoned, and losses by war; and under promise also of a
quick and friendly composure of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences touching the State which he
had restored; He complained that he saw nothing made good which was promised,
notwithstanding the many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities made in the Court of</hi> Spain,
<hi>even by the Prince his Son, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been detained there for almost a
whole year, the Moneth being therein computed, wherein he was detained in</hi>
Montferrat, <hi>to his so great mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi> He added, <hi>That as for
the Instrument presented to the said Prince in Court, it was neither answerable
to what was promised him, nor to his just demands; so as he could not in honour
accept it:</hi> Then he proceeded to relate, <hi>How that after the said
Instrument was presented unto him at</hi> Turin <hi>from the Governour, he at
the Governours desire had begun to treat of accommodating differences, and how
that after many debates he was told, that there was no more composition to be
thought of, but to do what the King had ordered: And finally, ripping open what
had been said and replyed in that business, he concluded that the Governour had
not only not made good any of his promises, but had hindered the composure of
differences, which was by himself begun to no other end hat to keep him the
Duke in hand, that the mean while he might have time to prepare for the war
which was already plotted against</hi> Piedmont: <hi>Wherefore he made his
protestation that he would make all necessary and fitting preparations to
defend himself: That he would give notice to the King, and to all Princes,
particularly to those of</hi> Italy, <hi>how ill affected the Governour was to
him and to his family, which was so devoted to the Crown of</hi> Spain; <hi>in
the service whereof both he and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors had so often hazzarded their
lives and fortunes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this time Prince <hi>Philiberto</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi>'s second son, and Lord High Admiral of <hi>Spain,</hi> coming
with the Spanish Gallies into <hi>Italy,</hi> brought 2000 Spaniards, who being
landed near <hi>Genoa,</hi> and bent for <hi>Millain,</hi> he steered towards
<hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Scicily,</hi> where the rendezvouz for the Kings
Gallies was appointed, as those also of other Princes, to oppose the Ottoman
Fleet, which being put from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople,</hi> it was held for certain
that it came to prejudice the Kings Territories, to revenge the loss of 8
Gallies taken the preceding Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn by <hi>Don Pietro di Girona,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Ossona,</hi> a Grandee of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi>
with the Saylors and Shipping of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom led by <hi>Octavio</hi> of
<hi>Aragon,</hi> who lighting upon them at unawares in the Levant Seas, easily
made himself Master of them, and brought them in triumph into <hi>Sicily.</hi>
With these and other people brought from several parts into the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> the Governour had an Army in the field of 1600 Horse and
20000 Foot, 4000 whereof who <pb n="65" facs="tcp:53250:39"/> were Swissers, not being, by
reason of the ancient League, to fight against the Duke, they were put into
several Garrisons in the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and the rest marching
towards the Confines of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the Governour came forth of
<hi>Millain,</hi> on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>August,</hi> with the Standard general,
and went to <hi>Candia,</hi> a Town in the <hi>Novarese;</hi> near to the Dukes
Dominions. Here whilst he was mustering his men, and expected other provisions
for War, he gave order to <hi>Don Lewis Gaeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> who was Embassadour for
the King with the Duke, that he should make his last tryal to bring him to
condescend to the Kings will; and that if he should make any difficulty upon
the manner of disarming, he should promise him that the Governour would pass
his word unto him in the Kings name that he would neither injure him, nor the
Pope, nor the Emperour; and that in case of denial, he should protest, as he in
the sight of God and man did protest, that all the wrongs that should be done
by War, and the effusion of Christian bloud, should be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for his not
having accepted that which had been with so much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son demanded of him; and
that then taking his leave, and according to the Law of Nations, demanding a
safe conduct, he should come to within the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> For the
better justification of the War, the Prince of <hi>Castiglione</hi> went to
<hi>Turin,</hi> to do the like in the Emperours name the Dukes Soveraign
Lord.</p>
            <p>But all this did no good; for the Duke professing that he was much
afraid he should be assaulted in his own Dominions by the Governours
neighbouring Army, as soon as he should have laid down Arms: and that therefore
thinking, or seeming to think, that all caution came short of the danger, and
that his utmost safety was therein concern'd, he could not admit of any offer
which was not consonant to his safety and dignity; and therefore alledging that
the Pope would not accept of his word with an obligation to make it be kept,
and the Emperour had not Forces in <hi>Italy</hi> sufficient to over see the
observing of it, tacitely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Governour for being faulty in his
first word, and that therefore he had no reason to confide the ein: He
therefore concluded that they should joyntly disarm, offering to be himself the
first who should dismiss some of his men; and protesting that he would not have
taken up Arms, had it not been for the Governours threats, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with so
great a strength to suppress him; and that therefore he was now ready to defend
himself to the last: In sign whereof, drawing off his Collar of the Golden
Fleece, he gave it to the Embassadour <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etano,</hi> who refusing to accept
it, he sent it after him to his house, that he might send it to the King; and
though these and many other actions were clear evidences that the Dukes will
was totally alienated from the King, and that he would stand upon resistance;
yet could they not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive many Italians, nor the Governour, and Spanish
Ministers in general, nor m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ke
them alter their opinion; for thinking that being so inferiour a Prince, and so
unable to resist the Forces of the Grown, he would not dare to stand the tryal
of the threatened War, they were of opinion, that having shew'd all the
demonstrations of courage even to the ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y last, he would, at the appearance of the Spanish Arms and
Standards, yield, just as he had done the year be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ore, before <hi>Nice;</hi> and therefore ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>her out of certainty then confidence,
and thinking that it <pb n="66" facs="tcp:53250:40"/> would much detract from the Majesty
and reputation of the Kings Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, if they should by fortifying themselves
seem to doubt that the Duke would assault any of the Towns in the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> they did not care to furnish even the Frontiers towards
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> though they abounded in Swissers; nor did they fear to be
assaulted on any other side.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Venetians approving as then of the Kings
resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did nor at all seem to favour the Duke; but rather persevering in
their former distastes, they appeared wholly averse to his ends and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests.
The Governour resolving to go with his Army to before <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> past
his men over into <hi>Montferrat</hi> by a bridge built upon the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>Sesia,</hi> near to <hi>Villata;</hi> and being come to <hi>Villa
nova,</hi> he went on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> with his Troops in good
order towards <hi>Vercelles,</hi> nine miles distant from <hi>Villa nova. La
Motta,</hi> the first Town in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> yielded forthwith unto him,
and afterwards <hi>Carenzana;</hi> where, distributing his Souldiers in those
places, he quartered that night: But the Duke thinking diversion to be a better
way of defence then oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition; and having what Horse, what Foot, little less
then 10000 in <hi>Vercelles,</hi> of which 5000 French, he resolved to march
into the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> Having therefore made a bridge of boats
over the same <hi>Sesia</hi> which divides his Dominion from the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing out 6000 foot, and 1000 horse, he went with them
and with two field-pieces into the Territory of <hi>Novara:</hi> From hence he
sent 1500 foot, and 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>0 horse,
Commanded by <hi>Calusio,</hi> son to the Count of <hi>Verrua,</hi> along the
River towards the Bridge <hi>della Villata,</hi> with order to burn it, thereby
to bereave the enemies Army of the Victuals and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition which thereby were
brought to them from the State of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain.</hi> He went with the rest
streight towards <hi>Novara;</hi> whither being come about Sun-rising, he
advanced with Count <hi>Guido</hi> and some horse, and appeared upon an eminent
Hill near the City: There were not above 500 men in the Garrison, yet the
Novaresi, betaking themselves presently to Arms, fired a piece of Cannon upon
them: But the Duke, though he saw the Novaresi astonisht at his coming, and the
City wholly unprovided of defence, so as probably he might have hoped to take
the Town, he notwithstanding retreated, and advanced no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were it
either out of the respect which he still bore unto the King (as he afterwards
freely declared) or as others would have it, out of fear of being probably
assaulted by the Spanish Army, which coming upon him nigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>nd,
and finding him engaged in that enterprize with but a few Forces, might easily
have supprest him.</p>
            <p>The Kings Commanders, nay, the whole Camp, when they heard that
the Duke was gone to <hi>Novara,</hi> knew how rare an occasion this would bee.
Don <hi>Alfonso Pimentello</hi> General of the Cavalry, and Don <hi>Iohn
Vives,</hi> the Kings Embassadour to the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who was then
in the Camp, and Cavaliere <hi>Melzi,</hi> an ancient Captain, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good
at Counsel, propounded, That foording immediately over the <hi>Sesia,</hi> by
the advantage of their Cavalry, or by their Waggons, accommodated like to a
Bridge, and leaving a reasonable baggage with the Garrison in
<hi>Carenzana,</hi> or sending it into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> they should go and
cut off the Dukes way in his return; for, said they, one <pb n="67" facs="tcp:53250:40"/>
of two things must needs happen, that either the Duke being belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guered in an
Enemies Countrey, and having no victuals, must yield within twenty four hours;
or that fighting upon great disadvantage, he must needs be a loser, not without
manifest danger to his own person; for he would certainly be taken Prisoner by
the Horse, which were dispersed every where about the Country. This Proposition
being approved of by the whole Council would assuredly have been fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, had
not it been opposed by Prince <hi>Ascoli;</hi> who alledging the depth of the
water, the danger of foording over the Rivers, and the doubt lest the Duke
falling upon them in their passage might much prejudice them, turned the
Governour from this resolution: He added moreover, That it was neither the
Kings mind, nor the intention of the war, that the Duke should be suppress'd,
but only that he should be infested till such time as he should lay down Arms,
and prepare to obey the Kings other directions. He therefore concluded, that it
was by no means fitting to adventure the reputation of the Kings Forces, which
would sufficiently decline upon any the sleightest encounter; and that since
the safety of <hi>Novara</hi> might be cautiously provided for, safe and secure
resolutions ought to be preferred before such as were dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and uncertain.
The difficulty of foording over so small a River, nor the danger of the Dukes
coming upon them, could not alter the Governour from his first opinion; for the
waters were not then very deep; and the Duke being gone that very night for
<hi>Novara,</hi> he could not, no not though he had flown, have hindred their
passage. Yet one mans Authority prevailing over the universal opinion of the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, an opportunity was lost of overcoming, and of putting an end to the
war the very day that it was begun: It was notwithstanding order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according
to the opinion of the Prince himself, that the Army should returne the same way
it had come; that it should go to the Bridge of <hi>Villata;</hi> and that
repassing over the <hi>Sesia</hi> there, it should go to relieve
<hi>Novara;</hi> but with express command to Don <hi>Alfonso Pimentello,</hi>
who led the Van, not to fight upon any whatsoever occasion. The Van had not
well pass'd over the Bridge, when the burning of certain little Cottages was
seen from afar off, and the noise of fighting heard; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 200 Horse were
sent towards that part, to discover what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was, who light upon the
Marquess <hi>Calusio,</hi> who was sent, as hath been said, by the Duke, to
burn the Bridge, and lay the Country waste; and in a skirmish with 200 Horse,
which were sent by <hi>Pimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tello,</hi> he was forsaken by his Cavalry, which
at the first charge were routed, and fled, many of them, together with
<hi>Calusio</hi> himself, being taken Prisoners, and many slain; some of the
Foot, when they saw the Horse run, threw away their Arms, ran away, and were
cut in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the greater part of them keeping close together, and retreating
in good order, made use of the moorish scituation, and of the banks, through
which the Enemies not being able to follow them, they had opportunity to make
head in fitting and advantagious places, and to face <hi>Lodovico Guasco,</hi>
one of the Captains of the 200 Horse, who with his Company of Curassiers
followed them by oblique ways, and was still upon their flanks; and after
having assaulted them more than once, many of his men being slain, and having
his own horse slain under <pb n="68" facs="tcp:53250:41"/> him, he suffered them at last to
get safe into <hi>Vercelles;</hi> and though their number was lessened, yet
they wan more preys, then their horse, which fled at the very first onset,
without making any resistance. This was the first incounter of the War of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the first action that hapned therein. The Spanish Army
went to quarter at <hi>Candia,</hi> a mile beyond <hi>Villata,</hi> instead of
going to <hi>Palestra,</hi> a little higher upon the river whither, they might
better have gone: for being neer the way which leads from <hi>Novara</hi> to
<hi>Vercelles,</hi> it had been a more convenient place to have hindred the
Dukes return. And this would have proved the better, for that the Duke parted
that very night from <hi>Novara,</hi> and returned to the Confines of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and quartered there that night, with his men very weary and
tired with their march the preceding day and night. Here the Governour had
notwithstanding another occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of worsting him, had he been as mindful to
imbrace it, as fortune was favorable in presenting it. For there was neither
river, nor other obsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle between him and the Duke, so as he might
commodiously and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on advantage have assaulted him, there not being above a
mile between the places where they were quartered.</p>
            <p>The next day the Duke fired <hi>Palestra</hi> early in the
morning, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the burning of <hi>Caranzana</hi> the night before by the
Dutch, and went for <hi>Vercelles</hi> without being molested; nothing being
done to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede him in his return. Thus having freed his own State from the
Enemies Army, the very day that it entred thereinto, and revenged the injury he
had received, in the same manner as was done to him, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to
<hi>Vercelles;</hi> where he staid, observing the Enemies proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. The
Governour being returned to the State of <hi>Millain</hi> began presently to
build a Fort, which he raised from the very foundation, in the Territories of
<hi>Novara,</hi> a little distant from the <hi>Sesia,</hi> and not much more
then a mile from <hi>Vercelles;</hi> which in honour of the Duke of
<hi>Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> he called the Fort of <hi>Sandoval.</hi> He gave out, that he
built it to no other end, but to secure <hi>Novara,</hi> in case that when the
Governour should enter again into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> it should be re-assaulted
by the Duke, as in such case he threatned he would do. But the Fabrick being
great, and capable of many men, flanckt by five Bulwarks, and neer upon a mile
in compass, it was not without good ground judged to be a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not begun
for the occurrences of the present War, but of long continuance, and to
fortifie the State of <hi>Millain</hi> on that side at all times from forreign
Armies. For this same thing was almost resolved upon many years before in
<hi>Spain,</hi> though it was not proceeded in, to shun giving of jealousies to
the Italian Princes, and to the Duke, who was then a friend to the Crown. But
now there being a manifest breach, it was thought, as indeed it was true, that
the Kings Officers made use of this occasion, to put their former resolution in
practise. In this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim Prince <hi>Philiberto</hi> return'd from
<hi>Naples</hi> with the Gallies wherein were between five and six thousand
foot, part Spaniards, and part Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans, who being unbarked in the waters
of <hi>Genua,</hi> where he left also most of the Gallies, he went with some
few into <hi>Spain,</hi> being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour'd, and attended, not only as Admiral,
but as the Kings Nephew: but in reality being environed by Spanish Officers,
who were appointed to wait upon him by the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> he appeared
rather to be kept <pb n="69" facs="tcp:53250:41"/> as an Hostage, his Navigation was to no
great purpose; for the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Fleet, which was much less then it was said to
be, after having ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared within sight of <hi>Sicely,</hi> before the Prince
his coming, retreated to <hi>Navarino,</hi> a Haven in <hi>Morea.</hi> True it
is, that <hi>Don Diego Pimentello</hi> who was sent with two good Gallies very
well appointed, to discover them, had the luck to take two of the enemies
Gallies; which being well man'd came also to discover the Christian Fleet; and
lighting upon them about <hi>Navarino,</hi> he stoutly assaulted them, and in a
short space made himself master of them, a Victory which was the more
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for that it hapned almost in view of the enemies Fleet, which was
not above 20 miles distant from where the fight was made. But it is not to be
exprest how all men were amazed, and confounded with wonder in
<hi>Lombardy,</hi> and generally throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> who expected mighty
things from the Governours going into <hi>Piedmont;</hi> when they saw him
return so soon without doing any thing; and as the resolution of returning
would have made some amends, and have repaired the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Kings
Forces, wherein they suffered very much; if fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the enemy, they had
vigourously re-entred <hi>Piedmont</hi> at their heels; so the keeping with the
whole Army, for above two moneths, about the Fort which was erecting, did
necessarily detract from their honour; and so much the more, for that mighty
things being looked for from them, no mean successes would have satisfied
expectation. On the other side, the Duke making less account of the
discomforture given to his men, then of the enemies going out of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> thought the least harm that befell the enemy, a great
comfort to his own affairs. And therefore thinking that at the very beginning
of the War he had made the world see that the Spanish Forces were not
invincible, he hoped that the Italians being awakened thereby, as by a warlike
trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, would the sooner joyn with him, both in Forces, and in intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
against strangers. Therefore not being upon this occasion wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to himself,
but making his cause the common cause, he was well pleased, that divers
writings, and composures should be thrown abroad in <hi>Italy,</hi> but
especially in his own Dominions; wherein stiling him the head, and author of
the recovery of their ancient Liberty, the Italian Potentates were exhorted to
throw off the forreign yoke, by which they had been so long oppress'd. And
still continuing with more fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency the indeavours long before begun in
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> with the Princes who did emulate the
Spanish Grandezza, with the King of <hi>England,</hi> and with the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> he strove to make them joyn with him, that so they might
unanimously oppose that power which did overshadow a great part of
<hi>Europe.</hi> But believing particularly, that the Venetians, the great harm
which would insue unto them by his suppresion being considered, would not give
him over in so great a danger; he therefore having composed the differences
which had been between them and him, touching the War of <hi>Montferrat,</hi>
by the intercession of the Embassadours of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> then resident in <hi>Venice;</hi> he resolved to send
<hi>Iacomo Pissina</hi> with title of Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to <hi>Venice,</hi> to
exhort them upon this occasion to imbrace his cause with their Forces, and the
defence of the common safety, and liberty; who being brought into the Colledge,
may be supposed to have spoken to this effect;</p>

               <q>It is most certain, Serene Prince, and wise fathers, that
  diffidence hath always been the ruine and undoing of friendship; as on the
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, affiance and trust hath always been held the streightest bond to
  keep Princes perpetually colleagued in friendship to one and the same end. The
  distrust that the Duke my Master, joyning with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, conspired
  against the common sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  upon just occasion he took up arms against <hi>Montferrat,</hi> made you
  readily imbrace the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s cause, which was then held to be
  the common cause. Out of this Reason, the Duke my Master, as best knowing his
  own intentions, which he by open manifestoes published to the world, thought
  this Commonwealth more inclined to favour his adversary then him. And that
  therefore constriuing his intentions to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then they have been since
  known to be, by reciprocal diffidence the ancient friendship so long preserved
  between him and this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lth
  hath on the sudden been turned to enmity. Now, since all men may assertain
  themselves, by what hath hapned at <hi>Novara</hi> and <hi>Vercelli,</hi> that
  the Dukes intention never was, nor can ever in the future be, different from
  the common end of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly from that of
  this most glorious Commonwealth; which is, manfully to make good, and
  constantly to maintain the common safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, dignity, and liberty, against the
  common enemies; he therefore hath reason to hope, that past distastes being
  turn'd to as much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the former good correspondency will be
  redoubled; and that in so just and honest a cause, in so useful and necessary a
  War, he may presume to be favoured by the Venetian Forces. For if you did
  re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to patronize the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> against a Prince so
  streightly joyn'd in interest and good will with this Commonwealth, only out of
  fear that he might assault <hi>Montferrat,</hi> with an intention to annex it
  to the Spaniards; how much more ought you now prepare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Duke of
  <hi>Savoy,</hi> whilst he is assaulted by the ambitious Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, for the
  preservation of the publick dignity, by those Forces, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  <hi>Italy,</hi> and which they are the first that do disturb, they indeavour to
  possess themselves of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> so lawfully injoyed by him, and by his
  predecessors; the Spaniards, as all men may see, would be believed to be the
  Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, the Patrons of <hi>Italy,</hi> the Supream Moderator of her
  Potentates; they therefore think it reasonable, that all Italian Princes, as if
  they we e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>so many of their
  Subjects, should obey every the least beck of that King, nay of any of his
  Ministers. And terming the slavery of <hi>Italy,</hi> peace, the obedience
  thereof security: and on the contrary, the freedom thereof, contumacy; and its
  generosity, turbulency of spirit; they by these artifices strive to make
  themselves gracious, and others odious to the people. And now having begun to
  exercise this their superiority, to the no less general prejudice, then to the
  universal loss of reputation, upon the weakest, they will arrogate the like
  over the greatest. They of late commanded the Duke of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> and the
  <hi>Lucchesi,</hi> to lay down arms, and were immediately obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without any
  reply. They now indeavour the like with the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> whom, after
  having secured <hi>Montferrat</hi> from all Hostility, they command to lay down
  Arms, and to disband his Souldiers: <pb n="71" facs="tcp:53250:42"/> and because he keeps
  2000 Souldiers more then usual in his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they threaten him. Was there
  ever known so unjust, and so imperious a command? with what reason does that
  King and that Nation, who, as all men know, are but as of yesterday in
  <hi>Italy,</hi> give Laws to the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who held the Scepter
  of <hi>Piedmont</hi> 400 years, before he was master of one foot of Land in
  <hi>Italy?</hi> will there none then dare to shew their faces, and gainsay such
  insolent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands? shall the generosity of the Italian name be so totally
  extinct, as that all <hi>Italy</hi> shall obey those whom they have formerly
  comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? who sees not that by these beginnings they aim at the reducing of
  the power and liberty of the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> into a Precarious power,
  into a Precarious liberty, depending upon every nod of theirs? but why talk I
  of a Precarious power, of a Precarious liberty, these beginnings tend
  manifestly to the reducing of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> into miserable
  slavery, and to the subjugating of <hi>Piedmont:</hi> nor ceasing here, to the
  making themselves absolute Lords of <hi>Italy:</hi> the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy whereof
  having long fancied unto themselves in Idea, they now begin to try how it may
  succeed, by the suppression of the Duke my Master, and by counterfeiting with
  the other Italian Potentates. And cloaking this their ambitious and avaricious
  thirst with the fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of publick peace, they are no less intent upon
  the usurping of other mens Dominions, then were the Persians of old; who
  aspiring at the oppression of <hi>Greece,</hi> demanded a little water, and
  some few clods of earth, for no other end, but that upon denial they might have
  some colourable pretence to make War upon them, and tyrannical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to subjugate
  them. If then the safety, and dignity of all <hi>Italy</hi> be indanger to be
  ruined, by the abasing of my Master, by the suppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
  will this Commonwealth, contrary to her custom, contrary to the constitutions
  and examples of her Predecessours, stand idle spectators of other mens
  miseries? careless lookers upon the common danger and calamity? shall she
  sleep, and be drown'd in a dull Lethargy, which confesseth that she continually
  watcheth over, and stands sentinel to the common liberty? the Romans did of old
  make War, and sent forth powerful Armies against <hi>Philip</hi> King of
  <hi>Macedon,</hi> and <hi>Antiochus</hi> King of <hi>Asia;</hi> not out of any
  desire of acquisition, or of inlarging their Empire, not out of any hatred to
  those Kings, nor to revenge any injuries received from them; but only to free
  the Grecians from the tyranny of those Princes: but out of Roman generosity,
  which could not suffer that those people, who had been anciently born, and who
  had long lived freed, and masters of themselves, should be subjected by
  barbarous Kings. And yet <hi>Greece</hi> was a Nation far distant from
  <hi>Rome,</hi> much differing from the Romans in Laws, Customs, Language, and
  Religion; so as the Romans needed not to have cared much for their Country nor
  Condition, nor been much moved at their misery, and will you; who represent
  that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and august Commonwealth, to the life, in Wisdom, Actions, and
  much more in generosity of Mind, refuse to assist in the freeing, not of a
  Province, or forreign Nation, but of this, which was anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently the Paincess of
  Provinces, which is your Mother, your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the seat of your Empire, and of
  the Majesty of your Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth? <pb n="72" facs="tcp:53250:43"/> from whose dignity,
  safety and freedom, you reap so much splendor, and security? but, why make I
  use of so remote examples, when there are not wanting those which are fresher
  and more sutable to the times and present occurrences? it is not much above 400
  years since <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly all that which lies between the
  <hi>Apenine,</hi> and the <hi>Alps,</hi> being oppress'd by the Dutch Empire,
  many of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Lombardy</hi> took courage to shake off the yoke of
  that fierce Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so as joyning in League, wherein your Ancestors, having
  manfully for many years made War with <hi>Germany,</hi> which had her foot upon
  their necks, the peace of <hi>Constance</hi> did insue, by which nothing
  remained to the Germans, but the bare name of Supream Empire, and the Italians
  repossest themselves of their so much desired liberty. Shall not that then
  which made so many people, disperst in so many Cities, oppress'd by so severe a

  Chieftains? will it not be able to infuse courage into free, great, and

  afraid of <hi>Spain,</hi> which being without either King or Government,
  drown'd in luxury, and riches, and divided into so many parts, and Regions, as
  that the vastness of its Empire doth counterpoise, or injure it self? should it
  fear to resist that power, against which the Hollanders, who were then but a
  weak people, did rebel, and of Subjects have made themselves freemen, of slaves
  Lords? nothing can appear really dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to generously minded men. The Duke

  this Commonwealth, which to boot with the same Reasons, is incited so to do by

  <hi>Piedmont</hi> will prove, depend upon your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, knowing that the

  will expose themselves, their children, and all that is dear unto them, to
  enjoy that dignity, that golden liberty, whereunto these Skies, and this

  foundations this their vast Monarchy is built. And they losing their courage,

de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar him of, who spoke thus.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>If our opinions had been demanded by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
  when things not being come to an open breach between him and the King of
  <hi>Spain,</hi> he had no need of our assistance, as now being demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when
  the breach is begun, our Counsels may seem superfluous and unseasonable; I
  think our Answer ought to have been such, as if being observed by him, it might
  totally have eased him of the necessity and occasion of making this demand:
  Therefore since we were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it at the first, we must now
  consider advisedly, not what had then been expedient for us to advise, but what
  we are now to resolve upon, not only for our own honour and safety, but for the
  like of all <hi>Italy,</hi> touching our abandoning or adhering to the Duke of
  <hi>Savoy,</hi> assaulted by the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> For I believe you are
  all of opinion, That according to the Rules of civil Government, Princes; who
  betake themselves, sometimes more out of necessity then choice, to side with
  such Interests whereinto others have run either out of hatred or some other
  disturbances, ought to indeavour that greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies may not ensue. I
  believe that the ambition and desire of Government is common to all men; but
  that the Spaniards do more abound in this then others, cannot be denied; and
  that that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which is not satisfied with great possessions which she
  injoys both in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in so many other parts of the world, doth
  still desire the agrandizing thereof by the suppressing of others, is not to be
  doubted: And though hitherto (thanks to the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to the
  great care which is had, that they govern not such States as are not subject 
  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:53250:44"/> to them) they have not obtained their ends; yet in my
  opinion he thinks amiss who believes, that if occasion were offered, they would
  cease from thirsting after other mens possessions: For the Citations sent from
  <hi>Millain</hi> against many Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> when Count
  <hi>Fuentes</hi> was Governour, and which though they do not declaredly concern
  our Common-wealth, do at least tacitly threaten her, are not as yet totally
  extinct, though they be laid aside for the present: And if we may argue from
  smaller things to greater, with what cunning, not to say Authority, have they
  gotten <hi>Finale, Monaco, Pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>mbino, Corregio,</hi> and many other Towns in <hi>Lunigiana,</hi>
  under their Dominion? where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, in my opinion, it is not so much to be
  considered how much for the present the <hi>summa totalis</hi> is concerned in
  those Towns, as the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which they draw after them; and that from
  thence we ought to measure their Intentions and ends, which do not aim only at
  the getting of those little Castles, but at much greater designes.
  <hi>Monaco</hi> and <hi>Finale</hi> curb and command the River of <hi>Genua;
  Piombino</hi> the State of <hi>Tuscany;</hi> how much subjection do the mid-way
  Towns of <hi>Luneg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana</hi> inforce upon both these States? the same may be
  said of <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reggio,</hi> in respect of the States confining thereupon.
  <hi>Porto Longone,</hi> fortified by them by so many Fabricks, almost in the
  face of <hi>Italy,</hi> how cleerly doth it shew the ambition they have, with
  safety to themselves, to bridle this Province; and who doubts, but that as much
  as the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of any of our Princes is lessened, so much the Spanish power is
  augmented, even to our prejudice? Nor is our Common-wealth kept harmless from
  their ambition. How much doth the Popes being set on against us, by so many
  favours, Covenants, and preparations for war in time of interdiction, shew that
  that King and Nation have no good intentions towards us? the continual
  molestations of the <hi>Uscocchi,</hi> fomented by them against us; Our League
  with the Garrisons which they by so many Plots indeavour to oppose; The Fort
  <hi>Fuentes,</hi> built in the jaws of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> to the perpetual
  yoke of that Nation, and to the apparent shame of our League; who sees not how
  much they redound to the suppression of our honour, and of our Affairs? They
  now indeavour to erect new Forts against the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and
  because he will neither acknowledge nor obey his Commands, they assault his
  Dominions; whether with an intention to bereave him of them, or no, I will not
  at this time either affirm or deny; although it may be justly suspected, if not
  fully asserted, by the many preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and great demonstrations made by that
  Nation, and probably feared by their wonted ends; but howsoever, I consider
  that it doth not become the interests nor dignity of our Common-wealth, to
  per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that that Prince should basely submit to such Commands, nor that we by
  abandoning him give possession to that Nation of so abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely commanding and
  compelling the Italian Princes to obey her; for mens thoughts in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>arge themselves by degrees; and the
  greater the things be which they attain, the greater do the ends which they
  pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to themselves grow; and when they have gotten one thing, they think
  they have gotten nothing, which makes them pretend to more advantagious and
  higher things: And in State-affairs, he who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descends in reputation, and at
  the first, must resolve to yield after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <pb n="75" facs="tcp:53250:44"/> to all
  things: Wherefore, questionless, when they shall have forc'd the Duke to what
  they now demand, they will afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to greater matters, which
  will prove a pernicious president to other Princes, and to us our selves, when
  occasion shall serve: And it is to be believed, that in such a case no man will
  care for what shot shall befall us, as justly deserving the same punishment
  which we have suffered others to undergo: But suppose that the Dukes Forces and
  friends shall prove inferiour to the greatness of his Spirit, or that find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
  himself forsaken by others, he either willingly yield to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or power
  of the stronger: or that disarm he, or disarm he not, he shall howsoever be
  supprest; Who sees not what the common danger will be? Who sees not a fair way
  made to that Monarchy which that Nation fancies unto her self? Who sees not
  <hi>Italy</hi> fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to miserable slavery, and into as deplorable a
  condition as ever she was in since the declination of the <hi>Roman</hi>
  Empire? It being then the part of wise Princes, timely to foresee, and to
  provide early against dangers which are not far off, I should think it very
  necessary that this Common-wealth, though otherwise desirous to preserve peace,
  should in some sort or other undertake the Dukes defence; Lest whilst we shall
  stand idly looking upon other mens evils, it befall not us as it befell our
  fore-Fathers, when the Kingdom of <hi>Naplos,</hi> being assaulted by
  <hi>Charles</hi> the Eighth, the State of that Prince was possest and overcome
  before sought withal; who whilst he is in safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and master of the Walls and
  Gates of <hi>Italy,</hi> may give entrance unto strangers, and keep our
  Liberty, and the like of all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> safe both in war
  and peace.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many, and particularly those of the younger sort, praised this
Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which was fortified with so many Reasons; but another Senator, no less
venerable for age then for wisdom, and for his long experience in places of
Magistracy, and Embassies happily discharged by him, stood up and spoke
thus.</p>
            <p> 
               <q>I have always been of opinion, most worthy Senators, That he who
  will advise wisely of weighty Affairs, ought not so much to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
  quality or state of present things, as to consider intentively, and diligently
  to examine things that are passed: Therefore if we will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
  <hi>Italies</hi> condition in former times, I mean, when the Spaniards did not
  domineer here, and shall compare them, without passion or envy, with the
  present times: I believe that all men will join in opinion with me, that
  certainly the present times are to be prefer'd before the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. We have
  seen, (not to speak of more remote times) we have seen, I say, or may conceive
  by History, in what condition <hi>Italy</hi> was, when the French, or Kings of
  <hi>Aragon,</hi> were Lords of <hi>Naples;</hi> when the State of
  <hi>Millain</hi> was subject either to the <hi>Visconti, Sforzeschi,</hi> or to

  Churches Territories, and the <hi>Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>esses;</hi> and turning all things topsy turvy, they forbear not
  through ambition to extend their Empire beyond the Confines of that Kingdom.
  The <pb n="76" facs="tcp:53250:45"/> 
                  <hi>Visconti</hi> of <hi>Millain</hi> did yet worse;
  and the <hi>Sforza</hi>'s succeeding the <hi>Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conti</hi> as well in the
  State as in the lust of Government, kept themselves not within the Confines of
  <hi>Millain</hi> and <hi>Genua,</hi> And so troublesome was <hi>Lodovico
  Sforza</hi> to our fore-Fathers, as being forced to join in League with
  <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, King of <hi>France,</hi> they resolved to drive him
  out of his Dukedom, to the end that <hi>Italy</hi> being freed of that
  fire-brand, they might afterwards so quiet the Nation, and by that means secure
  it from the Kings of <hi>Naples,</hi> as they might no longer fear their own
  safety; and that the King of <hi>France</hi> being brought by their forces into
  <hi>Italy,</hi> and made master of <hi>Millain,</hi> might be the chief
  Protector of their State: What the success of those hopes did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
  prove, I think is sufficiently known to all men; and how the King of
  <hi>France</hi> rewarded that good turn with bitter wars, cruel cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and
  persecutions; For if ever our Common-wealth was near being utterly exterminated
  after the war of <hi>Chioggia,</hi> it was then, when that King, to recover
  <hi>Cremona,</hi> and <hi>Gieradada,</hi> which by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of agreement did
  belong to us, did incite the Armes of Christian Princes against us: and making
  him their head against our Progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, in that great league of
  <hi>Cambraye,</hi> stuck not to assault them with all his Forces; and had been
  the chiefest cause of our ruine, if such a tempest had not been stoutly
  withstood, and prudently repaired by our fore-fathers. Not long after neither
  we, nor the other Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of <hi>Italy,</hi> being able to indure forreign
  Dominion in <hi>Italy,</hi> we joyntly indeavoured to repossess the
  <hi>Sforza</hi>'s in the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> which our fore-fathers did,
  though not without Wars, and infinite troubles: for they did not think that
  either the peace, or liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> could be secure, as long as the
  Spaniards, being masters of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> as they then were,
  should likewise succeed in the State of <hi>Millain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> as the
  <hi>Sforza</hi>'s being afterwards extinct, it was necessary they should do.
  This is the condition of the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> which I term past: Let
  us now come to her present condition; and comparing it with the past, let us
  Judge which of the two conditions be to be chosen, whether that, when the
  <hi>Visconti,</hi> the <hi>Sforza</hi>'s, and the French who counterpoised the
  King of <hi>Aragon</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> or this, wherein the
  Spaniards being masters of both these St<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>tes, are with the moderation of Empire, a counterpoise unto
  them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. I verily believe there is none that will prefer those times
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these, neither in respect of the peace and happiness which we and the
  other Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> enjoy, nor of the security and quiet wherein we
  at the present do possess our States. By means whereof if <hi>Italy</hi> do not
  begin to recover the Empire of the world, yet doth she flourish in all those
  Arts and riches which can result from a continued secure peace. Let us now give
  for granted, that the Spaniards are naturally ambitious, coveting what belongs
  to others; let us alledge <hi>Monaco, Finale,</hi> and four other poor
  Villages, by the masters whereof they were for the most part brought in; put
  what esteem you please upon the Citations of <hi>Fuentes,</hi> and of the
  disturbances occasioned by four Pyrats which molest our Gulf; and let us
  compare these, or other more trivial businesses, and this desire which the
  Spaniards seem to have of Government, to the like as well of Native Princes, as
  For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, <pb n="77" facs="tcp:53250:45"/> who have born sway in <hi>Italy:</hi> Let us
  oppose the Actions of those, to the remonstrances of these; the Citations of
  these, to the wars made by those with Italian Princes, and with our
  Common-wealth; and certainly he must be very stupid who will not wonder at the
  comparison: But unless I be deceived, I see no probable ground, nor any
  conclusive reason of this their so immense ambition, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness of
  dispossessing other men, when I consider the convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of great
  Acquisitions which their Kings have forborn to make, and how civil and liberal
  they have been to the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> this may be witnessed by the
  States of <hi>Florence,</hi> and of <hi>Sienna,</hi> won by their Arms, and
  yielded to the <hi>Medici;</hi> by <hi>Corcica</hi> taken from the French, and
  restored to the Common-wealth of <hi>Genua;</hi> by the free gift of the County
  of <hi>Asti</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and by the recovery of almost
  all <hi>Piedmont</hi> to the same Duke; by the restitution of <hi>Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>
  to the Estensi, and of <hi>Piacenza</hi> to the Farnesi; by the free forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
  of the State of <hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Francisco Sforza;</hi> by the adjudging
  of <hi>Montferrat</hi> to the <hi>Gonzagi,</hi> almost 100 years after the
  <hi>Paleologi</hi> were extinct, and now freed from the hands of the Duke of
  <hi>Savoy,</hi> and so faithfully restored to the Duke of <hi>Mantua:</hi> If
  we be not satisfied with these cle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r and evident Examples, I cannot see what mis-guiding error it is
  which doth incumber us, and makes us argue them to be so covetous of thirsting
  after what belongs to others. I forbear menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning that all our Princes have
  for so many years been undisturbed by this their so great power; nay, how upon
  all occasions they have been succoured by them; and we, if truth may prevail,
  and if the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of benefits received make not the Benefactor odious, as
  we have no just occasion to complain of their nighbourhood, so may we not
  justly forget the benefits received from the Crown, both when
  <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the Catholick sent <hi>Consalv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>

                  </hi> the great to assist us when as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by the
  Turks; and when <hi>Philip</hi> the second concur'd in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred League,
  chiefly in our defence against the Ottoman Empire, wherein he was at double
  expence, in a great preparation of Ships, and Gallies, and in an infinite
  number of fighting men: Wherefore, as I am not informed by what is past, that
  the happiness of <hi>Italy</hi> consists in being governed wholly by her
  natural Princes; so since we mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly perceive that the times, nor our
  minds, are not fram'd for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing of that which we account at present
  the most happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it will be great wisdom, not out of a desire of
  novelty, to break the thread of things which have been hitherto happily spun:
  For what remains, that the Spaniards would secure their own Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>es by build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new Forts, that they
  indeavour to disturb our Vessels; though we may think it unkindly done, yet we
  have no just reason to take it ill at their hands; since they therein do
  nothing but what other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do, and what we our selves have thought fit to
  do in <hi>Friuli,</hi> and elsewhere: Nor hath the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
  reason to complain of those Commands (as he calls them) which are laid upon him
  by the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, whilst it tends to the freeing of <hi>Italy</hi> from being
  continually troubled with her forces, and her neighbours from suspicion of
  no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty; otherwise I see not why the King should not be suffered to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
  his own Dominions, except we will suffer the Duke to keep <pb n="78" facs="tcp:53250:46"/>
  other mens possessions in continual expence and anxiety, and inhibit others,
  after having tried all fair ways to free themselves from it by force; as is
  allowed of by natural and civil reason, even amongst pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate men. Let us
  remember, I beseech you, how much we were troubled at the unexpected assault of
  <hi>Montferrat;</hi> how much all <hi>Italy</hi> was molested thereat; how much
  we our selves did indeavour the comfort of the assaulted State, and the
  acquitting it from so sore and sudden troubles, both by assisting the Duke of
  <hi>Mantua,</hi> and by having recourse to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> And let
  us argue from hence, if the asoresaid alledged may not suffice, what just
  reason, what fair colour we have to oppose the intention of the Spanish forces,
  procured, as I may say, by our selves, for the peace and safety of present
  affairs: What jealousies would there be had of our word and constancy, if we
  should indeavour to oppose the King in a war wherein he hath interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
  himself at our desires; and against a Prince, who being so nearly related to
  him both in blood and concernments, ought to be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, though he had those
  sinister intentions against us and other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as are supposed to the
  contrary: You all know what great offers we did refuse made to us by the King
  of <hi>France</hi> if we would join with him against the Spanish Empire, when
  not m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ny years ago, having a great
  Army on foot, and being confederate with manypowerful Princes, he prepared to
  make war against that Empire: We refused <hi>Cremona, Gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radada,</hi> and all
  the Coast of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which lies upon our Sea, because
  we desired rather to be esteemed peaceful preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of our own affairs, then
  unquiet disturbers of other mens; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we thought it not safe to change the
  certainty of our present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition for specious future hopes, though great
  ones, nor to go out of a happy calm, and enter into a troublesome tempestuous
  sea of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties. And shall the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> make us do that which
  the King of <hi>France,</hi> a King of such power and authority, inviron'd with
  so great Forces, and adherences, could not perswade us to? if we sha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake under pretence of the honour and liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> to
  revenge his private quarrels with the Spanish Court, having been so jealous but
  a little before of his confederacy therewith; if we shall suffer our selves for
  any conceits of his, to be inveloped in a War against a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful King and
  Nation, whose Forces I know not how those who think them so formidable in time
  of peace, should think them so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considerable in times of War, as that to free
  themselves from jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies which they fancie unto themselves in time of peace,
  they dare ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritate them: since we have no reason at the present to be jealous
  of the Spaniards neighbourhood, and since we may probably fear it may prove
  prejudicial, if provoked; me thinks, we should conclude it were not good to
  innovate, or alter the peaceful condition of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent times; and that we
  should lay aside those conceits of <hi>Italies</hi> liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which are so fair
  in appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rance, but in realty very
  uncertain and dangerous; and which, as cates which are most esteemed, are not
  meats to cure a sick person, but poyson to kill him; so peradventure may they
  extinguish those vital spirits of liberty which we now enjoy. And 
  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:53250:46"/> this, in my opinion, is the likelier to fall out, for that
  they cannot be put in execution without much difficulty, by reason of the many
  contests they will meet withall in the bringing about, by reason of the present
  condition of times, and through the disagreeing of our Princes, who as
  formerly, so now, not being able to suffer that one should exceed another,
  would be the first to recall those forreign Nations in, which they now exclaim
  so much against. Nor hath the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who seems now so zealous
  for the common liberty, and to abhor so much the Spanish Empire, been always of
  that opinion. So as it will bee hard for us to secure our selves, but that when
  he shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in his pretentions to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> he may
  afterwards, to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the common liberty, re enter into the former
  privacy, and good intelligence with the King: For these Reasons, most excellent
  Senators, I conclude, that minding the safe Counsels of Peace, we may not in
  wrap our selves in a dangerous War, and in the troubles which may result from a
  contrary resolution.</q>
            </p>
            <p>These reasons did not please such, who detesting the Spanish
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness were much troubled to hear it so asserted; and yet though the Senate
were not desirous that the Duke should be suppressed, lest the Spanish
Grandezza might be thereby more increased, which being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready swoln too high,
they rather desired to see abased; yet the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Spanish Forces
prevailing with them, and preferring their own safety and quiet before that of
others, they considered not as then the contrary reasons, and pitch'd upon this
last opinion; so as looking to be advised by more certain events, and not
thinking the affairs as yet sufficiently in order, nor ripe enough for them to
declare themselves, they held it not good to display their Sails to that wind
which began to breathe from <hi>Piedmont:</hi> True it is, that for the Dukes
better satisfaction, they sent <hi>Rainero Zeno</hi> into <hi>Piedmont</hi>
with title of Embassadour Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, in lieu of the ordinary Embassadour,
who when the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should be reconciled, was to be sent back; to the end
that carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the business with more authority, the Dukes business might
not seem to be totally abandoned by the Commonwealth: And there wanted not
those who argued by the success, that they did not only fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Duke by
private advice and promises, but assisted him under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with supplies. The
Duke obtained not a much differing resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> where he expected better things from the neighbouring dangers,
from the vivacity of that Nation, and from the Kings minority; for the Queen
being assured by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that he would forbear all
hostility in <hi>Italy,</hi> whensoever the Duke would consent to what was
demanded, she was therewith satisfied, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make the Duke yield
to the Kings pleasure, in regard of the interest of her Nephew the Duke of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> in whose behalf this new War was begun: Not listening
therefore to any of the Dukes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires or complaints, she under severe
penalties prohibited all her Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to take pay of him; and yet she also,
for the honour of her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to give satisfaction to the Princes and
Chief Lords of her Count, sen <hi>Charles a' Anghienes</hi> Marquess of
<hi>Rambolliette</hi> to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> Embassadour, to exhort the Duke to
peace, with express commission, that if he should forbear to lay down Armes,
fearing that he might be <pb n="80" facs="tcp:53250:47"/> oppressed afterwards by the
Spanish Forces, he should give him all such assurances as he himself could
desire, and offer him the protection of that Crown, and the Forces of the whole
Kingdom: Such was the publick resolution of that Court which was then governed
by the Queen, who was much inclined to preserve friendship with the Crown of
<hi>Spain,</hi> for the Interest of her own authority and greatness, and for
the quiet and safety also of her Sons affairs, which would be less sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to
troubles and perturbation, by keeping peace, and good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency with his
neighbours. That Court continued in the same mind for some years; though the
King being come to the age of 14, and, according to the orders of the Kingdom,
out of gardianship, took upon him the administration of affairs, and
consequently the Queens regency ceased. For depending wholly upon his Mothers
authority, and advice, the change of Government was for a while insensible, the
name of Governour being only altered. The new Kings first action was to ratifie
the Marriages contracted with <hi>Spain;</hi> and seeming to be desirous to
keep fair correspondency therewith, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had small hopes
of and good from <hi>France.</hi> And though he seemed abandoned of all help
from thence, the Marshall <hi>de Dignieres,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
<hi>Dolphenye,</hi> sent good store of men continually unto him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand. it
not being known whether the Queen did wink thereat, or no; who hearing that
many did murmure that the Duke in so urgent a necessity and danger should be
abandoned, to the great diminution of the Kings authority, and of the Kingdoms
interest, did underhand give way that the Kings resolution should be
countervened; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore besides those that were sent by <hi>de
Dignieres,</hi> many others falling down from the <hi>Alps,</hi> a good number
of that Nation were in a short time found to be in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> By which
the Duke being comforted, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> also
by the promises of other Princes; and being incouraged by the good beginning of
the War (as it is usually seen that enterprizes which at first appear fearful,
grow by degrees less dreadful) he began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide more in himself; and
looking for greater successes, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be intreated to do that which
he bad much reason to desire. So as the words nor perswasions of the French
Embassadour prevailed but a little with him; nor yet those of Monsieur
<hi>Giulio Savelli,</hi> who was likewise sent extraordinary Embassadour upon
the same occasion to <hi>Piedmont</hi> by the Pope. For the Duke persisting in
not composing the affairs of <hi>Mantua,</hi> without having some part of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> given him, and denying to lay down arms, unless the
Governour should do so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; he refused also to refer the differences to
be decided by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, being jealous of him; but he consented to refer it
to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and to the King of <hi>England,</hi> to which
he knew neither the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> would
agree. It seemed therefore very hard to reconcile them; and the less, for that
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> growing bold by the Spanish Armies going out of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and by their lasie entertaining themselves about the
building of the new Fort, not caring much to pursue the War: he thought he was
the more secured from any new assaults. Wherefore sending daily Troops of horse
out of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> which foording over the very River of the
<hi>Sesia</hi> in sight of the enemies Army, which the Governour in the Dukes
absence durst not <pb n="81" facs="tcp:53250:47"/> pass thorow with a numerous and gallant
Army, they dared to insult over the Souldiers which were busied about the Fort,
without either fear or respect, though but by a snatch and away. And the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour being wholly intent about building the Fort, did not only not care
to suppress their insolence, but would not follow the advice of many of the
Commanders, who thinking it bootless and dishonourable to busie the whole Army
about building a Fort, which stood in the Kings own ground, advised to send
part thereof in the interim to prejudice <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where the Duke
being imploy'd about the guarding and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> it was
probable they might make some good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress. But the Dukes affairs, which
seemed to be secure from any ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile act, or at least were not troubled with
any, ran unexpectedly great hazard at home. For the French and Swissers which
were under the Dukes pay, mutinying upon a small occasion, put the City of
<hi>Vercelles,</hi> in defence whereof they were then imployed, in great
danger, and confusion: nor was the danger of a greater sedition small, nor the
Dukes labour less in appeasing it; but being at last quieted, the French, as
who were suspected of novelty and alteration, were distributed into several
quarters about the City. The Dukes resistance being this mean while known in
<hi>Spain,</hi> and what had hapned in <hi>Italy,</hi> contrary to that Courts
expectation, the King and Council were not a little incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, they thought the
Kings honour and authority to be highly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; therefore minding resentment
more then the appeasing of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, they thought it necessary to alter their
first orders, and to take a more severe course in making the Duke acknowledge
the Kings Grandezza, which by his entring into the State of <hi>Millain</hi> in
hostile manner, he seemed to value but a little. They therefore commanded the
Governour and their other Officers in <hi>Italy,</hi> that they should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
no longer against the Duke with such respect as formerly, but with all
bitterness and severity. To which end they gave out orders, and made
extraordinary provisions.</p>
            <p>The Embassador <hi>Vives</hi> was returned from the Camp to
<hi>Genoa,</hi> who having sent some scouts to <hi>Nizza di Provensa,</hi> and
to <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> brought back word, that the Castle of <hi>Nice,</hi>
though otherwise very strong, had only a Garrison of 150 Souldiers in it, and
but little Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition; That the City was safe on the one side from being
injured by the Castle; That the Citizens were but ill satisfied with the
Prince; That the Passes in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which were scituated on steep
Cliffs, might be unexpectedly taken by a few Souldiers, and be by them
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; which being taken, that the Castle and City could not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
and therefore might be easily mastered by any who should go thither with
convenient Forces: They also said, that the Castle of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Franca,</hi> a
spatious and safe harbour, was but weakly walled, guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by 50
Souldiers, and subject to be plaid upon on several sides, that howsoever,
<hi>Cape San Sespiro,</hi> a place commodious to land in, and very neer
<hi>Villa Franca,</hi> might easily be surprised and fortified, as not being
provided either of Guards or Fortifications; he therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed either of
these two enterprises, as feasible, to the King; the rather, for that he being
Master of the Sea, had the whole River of <hi>Genoa,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the
Haven of <hi>Monaco,</hi> for his friends; so as if either of these 
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:53250:48"/> two enterprises should be taken in hand, at the same time
that the Land-Army should enter <hi>Piedmont,</hi> it might be probably hoped
that landing between six and eight thousand men in those parts, they might
easily be effected; or if they should meet therein with any greater
difficulties, it would howsoever be very advantagious to make the attempt, by
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great diversion it would be to the affairs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
The Court was pleased with this proposal, and it was presently ordered to be
put in hand; so as necessary provision and materials were furnished from
<hi>Genua,</hi> by the said <hi>Vives:</hi> and the people which were come from
<hi>Naples,</hi> and those which were shortly expected from <hi>Sicily,</hi>
were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted for that service: but because contrary winds caused much delay,
the Duke had notice of the Enemies design, and fortified <hi>Cape San
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiro,</hi> re-inforced the Garrison of <hi>Nice,</hi> and of his other
Maritime Towns; therefore the Governour, either that he might not irritate the
French, when they should see the places confining upon <hi>Prevence</hi>
as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, and to which they have ancient pretences, or finding the
diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and that they were prevented by the Duke, forewent these their
first intentions, and fell to besiege <hi>Oneglia,</hi> a Town belonging to the
Duke, 40 miles distant from <hi>Nice,</hi> towards <hi>Genua;</hi> wherefore
Prince <hi>Philibertus</hi> being gone for <hi>Spain,</hi> though the Gallies
which were expected with men from <hi>Spaine;</hi> were not yet come, yet
<hi>Don Alvaro Bassano,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> Captain of the
Neopolitan Gallies, went thither with his Gallies, and with those that keep
usually in the Haven at <hi>Genua,</hi> commanded by <hi>Don Andrea Doria;</hi>
in them there were six Ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>politan
Companies, under <hi>Vespatiano Macedonico,</hi> and eight Spanish, under
<hi>Pietro Sermiento,</hi> Camp-master. Oneglia <hi>is a Town di 500 fuochi,
upon the sea shore, having on the east side craggy hills; on the west it is
watered as it were with a little river, beyond which stand some hills, which
entring into the sea make the Premontory, commonly called</hi> Cape St. Lazero,
<hi>her jurisdiction towards the sea lies neer the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and the river; it
extends much further on the land side, having the command of three very
fruitful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> peopled by 60
Villages: besides which there are other two,</hi> Maro, <hi>and</hi> Perla;
<hi>which belong likewise unto the Duke. The place it self, never having seen
the face of an Enemy, is not any ways for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, unless with a Castle built
after the antient manner, and by a Bulwark to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the sea, which serves
rather to keep out Pirates, then to fortifie the Town.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Dukes Commanders and Souldiers being entred thereinto,
they made divers Fortifications there; they drew a trench along the river on
the West side, and a bank of sand along the shore; for it was defended on the
north side by a Country of friends, and on the east by craggy hills. Count
<hi>Lodevico della Moretta,</hi> Marquess <hi>di Dogliano,</hi> commanded there
in chief; who had with him many Captains, and Souldiers, as well of the
neighbouring Valleys, as sent by directions and order from <hi>Piedmont. Sancta
Croce</hi> landed his men on the 19 of <hi>November,</hi> by permission from
the Commonwealth, beyond <hi>Cape St. Lazero:</hi> and though his leave to land
was upon condition that he should not make any they in her Territories; yet
making no account thereof, <hi>St. Crece</hi> quartered himself on this side
the river, and planting his battery there he begun to command the
<hi>Campagnia,</hi> and to remove all imped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The next night he sent some
of his men beyond the river, <pb n="83" facs="tcp:53250:48"/> who after a stour dispute
having gained the further bank, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves masters of many ways which led
unto the walls: and at the same time bringing two pieces of Artillery upon the
<hi>Piazza</hi> of St. <hi>Moro,</hi> to begin the battery from thence, they
beat back above 500 Souldiers from the Trenches and Rampiers which they had
made thereabouts, with loss of only eight assailants, and some that were
wounded. But being there infested by others, who were fortified in some other
houses which stood a little higher, and by certain Mortar-pieces, which were
placed on the Dukes Palace, he turned his Artillery thither-ward, beat down the
houses, and boldly assaulting them, he repulst the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants who were 300 in
number, and pursued them to the Covent of St <hi>Augustini,</hi> whither they
retreated in great disorder. The Covent was immediately inviron'd with
Trenches, which was very opportune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seated for defence of the Town, and was
plaied upon all that night, 400 of the Garrison, who were there, defending
themselves very vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly. This mean while the Gallies lay not idle, but
landing men came upon <hi>Oneglia,</hi> cleared the <hi>Campagnia</hi> with
their Artillery, and beat down the tops of the houses, though that they that
were within indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vored to keep them off with the Artillery of the Castle, and
of the <hi>Basti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which was on the sea side. And landing a great Cannon
between the river and <hi>Cape St. Lazere,</hi> they therewithall slew many
upon the Trenches. Those who were within defended themselves manfully, but
their Ammunition grew low, as was conceived by their so seldom shooting; and a
<hi>Falluca</hi> loaded with Muniton which was sent from <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Franca</hi>
was intercepted by the Gallies, so as they grew daily more and more to despair
of succour. For Count <hi>Guido,</hi> who fell down from <hi>Piedmont</hi> to
this purpose with 200 Horse, and 500 Foot, being necessarily to pass thorow the
Territories of <hi>Genua,</hi> was denied passage. It was therefore thought the
Town would be soon surrendred; and those within had already obtained Truce for
three hours, by means of a Capuchine Friar, seeming as if they would yield up
the Town, but with intention that they might fortifie themselves the better;
for the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers being finished a little before the time of Truce expired,
they let fly a piece of Artillery into the Camp, and gave a furious volley of
Musket shot from the Monastery. On the other side, those without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced
their batteries on many parts, but did no great good thereby, the defendants
making valiant resistance, and killing many of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants. This mean while
the six Gallies came from <hi>Sicely,</hi> and brought with them eight Colours
of Spanish Foot, of the usual Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that Island, commanded by <hi>Don
Diego Piementello.</hi> Which whilst they were landed beyond <hi>Cape St.
Lazero,</hi> the remainder of the former Foot who were quartered on this side,
in the Commonwealths Territories, were sent over the water into the parts about
<hi>Oneglia,</hi> and by means of a Capuchine Fria, a Truce for three days was
again indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, upon condition that if in the interim they should not be
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the Town should be surrendred; but this was not yielded to by
<hi>Sancta Croce.</hi> Whereupon many of the Towns men fearing to be sackt, or
to be put to some miserable ruine, went over into the State of <hi>Genua;</hi>
and 200 of the Country people who were set to guard a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Ditch neer the
Gate, forsook it, and fled away by night. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="84" facs="tcp:53250:49"/> the
Spaniards advancing even to the Church St <hi>Martino,</hi> without any
withstanding, made themselves masters of all the parts that were about
<hi>Oneglia</hi> on the land side; and had they not been hindred by great rain,
and by the river which swells very high in those parts, they would certainly
have ended their work then. But the waters being fallen, those within drew two
pieces of Cannon just over against the Gate of the Town, and by means of the
Capuchine who had past several times before between them and the enemy, they
desired, and obtained leave, to march out with their Colours flying, Drums
beating, with their Arms and Baggage, and with a safe conduct. Whereupon the
Marquess <hi>Degliano</hi> publickly complaining that the place was lost by the
accommodation, and Munition which was afforded by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to the
Kings Commanders, and by giving way to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting of the succour which
was sent by the Duke, went out the fifth day after the landing of the first
men, and with him went out twelve Colours, besides many Towns-men, and others
of the neighbouring Villages, who swearing loyalty to the Spanish Commanders,
tarried in the Country. But Count <hi>Guido,</hi> who was kept, as hath been
said, from relieving <hi>Oneglia,</hi> went into the <hi>Marquesate</hi> of
<hi>Zuccherello,</hi> an Imperial Feudatory which lying between the Dukes
Territories, and those of the Commonwealth, serves as a Gate whereby to enter
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</hi> And carrying Count <hi>Odo Rovero</hi> along with him,
withdrew all that jurisdiction, except <hi>Castello Veccohio,</hi> which was
the Marquess his place of residence, and who was then absent, into his power.
Where though there was neither Ammunition, Artillery, nor Souldiers; yet the
enemy not being able to bring their Artillery thither without much labour; and
500 of the Subjects of the Commonwealth being at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant come into
<hi>Castell Vecchio,</hi> to whom the Emperour had committed the protection of
the <hi>Marquesate,</hi> some resistance was made for some days: yea with the
death of some of the oppugners: but afterwards their Ammunition and succour
failing them, they yielded the Castle upon Articles. But all things were not
quiet in the Valley of <hi>Oneglia,</hi> by reason of the Castle of
<hi>Maro;</hi> whither the Dukes Captains, at their marching out of
<hi>Oneglia,</hi> sent 300 Foot under Cavalier <hi>Broglia,</hi> who having
fortified it, and furnished it well with Munition, it was thought it would be
hard to take, for it was seated between craggy Rocks and cliffs; and from hence
he infested the Towns in the Valley of <hi>Oneglia</hi> with often salleys, and
forced them to pay great contributions; for after having sworn fealty to the
King, he esteemed them Enemies, and Rebels to the Duke. After the taking of
<hi>Oneglia, Sancta Croce</hi> was gone to <hi>Naples,</hi> and return'd from
thence; and had brought with him in his Gallies 3000 Neapolitanes, under the
Camp-master <hi>Thomaso Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassiol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and many other provisions for the enterprize of <hi>Villa
Franca,</hi> which the Spanish Commanders were still bent upon. But the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had always been against it, and by a Secretary which he had late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dispatcht away into <hi>Spain,</hi> had propounded many difficulties to the
Kings Counsel, whereby he had not a precise order to desist from it. It was
therefore resolved that they should go to the taking in of <hi>Maro,</hi> to
the which 3000 Foot, part Neapolitans and part Spaniards, with three pieces of
Cannon, and 2000 other Foot of the Valley of <hi>Oneglia,</hi> 
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:53250:49"/> were sent, commanded by <hi>Iovan Ieronimo Doria,</hi> a
very valiant Commander. <hi>Doria</hi> began the battery immediately; and
having quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beaten down part of the Wall, he ordered an assault to be given
the second night, not only where the wall was broken down, but also on two
other sides, to the end that he might divide the defendants. And that all this
might be done at one and the same time, the firing of a Cannon was the sign of
falling on. But some of the assailants having mist their way, and others been
too slow in coming to the place appointed, only the Spaniards, who were to
assault the Town where the Wall was beaten down, fell on, entred the Town, and
maintained fight a long whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>,
till such time as great stones being thrown down upon them, and beams from the
tops of the highest houses, and out of windows, they were forc'd to retreat,
with loss of two of their men, and 35 who had their heads broke; amongst which
<hi>Emanuel di Luna,</hi> their Captain. The battery continued afterward two
days, on two several parts; when <hi>Doria</hi> finding businesses reduced to
that pass of coming to an assault again, he gave order for it, as before, on
three several parts; which being valiantly performed in all the parts, and the
defendants playing their parts valiantly, <hi>Broglia,</hi> who had taken some
rest by reason of the pains he had taken the preceding night, came from the
Castle to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist his men; but as he was either retiring into the Castle, or as
he was carrying succour to another place where he heard a new tumult, he was
run thorow with a Pike by a Spaniard, by whose death the defendants being
dismaied, they retreared all into the Castle, which they surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred not long
after, upon permission to march out with their Arms and Baggage.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Kings Forces were thus busied in the Maritime parts,
the building of the Fort <hi>Sandoval</hi> went on; and the Nuntio
<hi>Savelli,</hi> and the French Embassadour, laboured, though in vain, to
compose Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. The difficulty lay on the Governours behalf, who, according
to the Kings Orders, would have the Duke to lay down Arms; which the Duke
denied to do, fearing, as he alleadged, the Spanish Forces, if he should do so.
But the Nuntio, and the Embassador, finding that fear to be in effect vain, and
that the Dukes backwardness did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend thereon, but rather upon a desire
of having some part of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> allotted him by agreement, without
which they saw him resolute not to lay down Arms, they framed some
Capitulations, wherein giving him some satisfaction in that behalf, they
obliged him to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm upon the Governours bare word, in the name of the King
of <hi>France,</hi> and upon the promise of the said Governour, that he also
would soon after disband all his men. The Duke was not hereat dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased; but
foregoing his former obdurancy, out of hopes of soon obtaining part of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> he did not insist so much as he had done upon the form of
disarming, and was perswaded to accept of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal. Yet were it either
that the Articles were cunningly contrived, that the Duke giving free consent
to the Article of disarming, wherein the difficulty lay, his fair pretence of
providing for his own safety might be taken way; or that the Governour thought
the Articles repugnant to three points of the Kings Decree, the Governour
refused to accept of them, so as the business was not perfected; the rather,
for that the <pb n="86" facs="tcp:53250:50"/> Governour boasting that he would chastise the
Duke for his having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Kings Dominions in a hostile manner, said he
could not consent to any agreement, unless the Duke should humble himself to
the King, and ask his pardon, for having offended him, by entring his
Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in hostile manner; and therefore although the midst of
<hi>November</hi> was over before the Fort was finished, and the weather
consequently grown very sharp; and though the Army, which was much lessened by
mortality, and by the running away of many, ought to have been brought into
winter Quarters, yet the Governour, being thereunto sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by many of his
Captains, and much press'd by many of the Officers of the Court, who by their
Letters desired very much to see the Dukes contumacy severely punish'd by some
signal action, resolved to go to before <hi>Asti;</hi> for he despaired of
getting <hi>Vercelles,</hi> the Duke being there in person with the greatest
part of his men. This proposal had been several times press'd, even from the
very first beginning of the war, by <hi>Rodorigo Oroseo,</hi> Marquess of
<hi>Mortara,</hi> and Governour of <hi>Allessandria;</hi> who being a Souldier,
and desirous to signalize himself, promised the Governour that he would easily
take it, if he would give him 4000 Foot, and 500 Horse; but the Governour not
giving way thereunto, he grew more fervent therein, when he saw the Duke
busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in building the Fort, hoping that he might get it the more easily, for
that the Duke keeping at <hi>Vercelles</hi> by reason of the neighbourhood of
his Enemies, could not divert him, nor send any considerable Forces to relieve
it. Now the times being altered, and what was more to be considered, the form
and design of the enterprise being varied, the Governour would of himself
attempt it with all his Forces; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaving a sufficient Garrison in
<hi>Sandoval,</hi> and having sent away the Artillery before by the
<hi>Tannaro,</hi> he attempted to come before it with 1200 Horse, 3000 Dutch
Foot, and 4000 Foot more of several Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But the Duke as soon as he saw
<hi>Vercelles</hi> free from the Enemies neighbourhood, leaving his youngest
Son Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> there, with a reasonable Garrison, went with the
rest of his men to the defence of <hi>Asti,</hi> passing over the <hi>Poe</hi>
by a Bridge, which he quickly threw over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Crescentino</hi> and
<hi>Verrua;</hi> and whilst the Nuntio and the Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour entertained the
Governour with divers promises, that they would bring the Duke to disarm,
thereby making him lose much time; the Duke minded the more the fortifying of
the walls, and of other fitting places, for the defence of that City. The
Governours heat was somewhet cooled by the Dukes coming to <hi>Asti,</hi> and
much more by the French, which he knew fell down into <hi>Piedmont;</hi>
wherefore he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Iovan Bravo,</hi> who had already taken up his
Quarters at <hi>Quarto,</hi> a Village nere the City, to retreat back into
<hi>Annone;</hi> and the season grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then to be very sharp and cold, he was
much confused, and found no less difficulty in this Enterprise than in that of
<hi>Vercelles:</hi> He saw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self so far advanced as he could not with honour
retreat; to winter his Army about the City was very incommodious and dangerous;
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn once more b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ck to the
State of <hi>Millain</hi> did too much repugne the protestations and threats
which he had given out; he could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do it without much blame, and
loss of Honour, and without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing subject to many severe reprehensions from
the Court; therefore <pb n="87" facs="tcp:53250:50"/> calling a Counsel of War, he asked
his Field-Officers advice concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the manner, and possibility of quartering
that Winter in the Dukes Country. <hi>Several were the opinions; many were
against, many for quartering there: the former alledged the bitterness of the
season, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and far distance between the places wherein they were to
distribute their Army, the Dukes being present there; who being in a great
City, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving all his men, might sally out and suppress, one
by one, all the places wherein their men should be quartered, before, being so
far from one another, they could joyn time enough in the common defence. They
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concluded, it was better to amend the first resolution, of coming
before</hi> Asti, <hi>then by persevering in the error be subject to the danger
and mischief which might result thereupon. The others pleaded, and chiefly</hi>
Morara, <hi>the chief promoter of the enterprise, the conveniences of the
Quarters by reason of the vicinity of the State of</hi> Millain, <hi>and
of</hi> Montferrat, <hi>from whence provisions might be conveniently brought;
and also the safety there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the Towns of that Country capable to quarter
the whole Army, which being fortifi'd by Trenches would be able to withstand
sudden assaults, till such time as succour might be brought from the
neighbouring places. They mentioned many good effects which might result
therefrom; first, the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the honour of the Kings Forces, which
otherwise would be totally lost; that the State of</hi> Millain <hi>would be
that Winter eased from the charge of quartering; and on the contrary, the
enemies Country troubled therewith: which would be thereby kept from assaulting
the Kings Towns, as they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly had done, and publickly threatned to do
again; that it was probably to be hoped that time might afford occasions of
making themselves masters of the City that very Winter; if the Duke not being
able, (as he was not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be) to keep his men long together without
moneys, they should chance to mutiny, or any other unthought of accident should
fall out. And as for the bitterness of the season, they said it was not now to
be taken into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Army being already in the enemies Country;
and since it differed not much from that when they went from the</hi>
Novarese.</p>
            <p>In this ambiguity of opinions the Governour sent some Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to discover the Country beyong the <hi>Tanaro;</hi> and then going with part of
his men by a Bridge, which he threw over at <hi>Roccad' Arazzo,</hi> he ordered
<hi>Mortara</hi> to possess himself with <hi>Bravo's Brigado</hi> of a Town
called <hi>Zam,</hi> up the River overagainst the City, which being easily
ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, he went against 1000 men which he saw passing in boates over the
<hi>Tanaro.</hi> But they being quickly repassed, and joyn'd with the rest of
the Dukes men, they began to skirmish with Muskets on both side the banks, not
without the prejudice and death of some of both the parties, amongst which two
Spanish Captains, who were shot with a Cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullet from the opposite banke,
where the Duke himself appeared in a red Coat, incouraging his Souldiers,
giving fire to the Artille<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y with
his own hands. The Commanders being returned made their rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions according to
their several opinions. <hi>Mortara</hi> said the Army might be commodiously
quartered there; but <hi>Don Francisco Padiglia,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the
Artillery, <hi>Don Sanchio Salina,</hi> and <hi>Barnabo Barbo,</hi>
Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary-general, who were sent to the same purpose by the Governour, were
of a contrary opinion. And the Governour being sorry that he had come thither,
desired nothing more then a fair occasion to retreat, <pb n="88" facs="tcp:53250:51"/>
which he was offer'd by the Nuntio, and French Embassadour by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of new
Capitulations, conformable enough to the Kings decree, and already accepted of,
and subscribed by the Duke: But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour persisting still that there was
no way left to execute the Kings decree, unless the Duke did first ask the King
pardon for the injury he had done after the decree, all were scandalized at so
proud a pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the French Embassadour told him freely, that it was
not an action fit for a free Prince, to ask pardon; nor was it ever demanded
from the said Duke, when, not many years before, a pacification was made
between him and the King of <hi>France,</hi> though unprovoked, he had not only
assaulted the Kings Territories, but taken some of them; and that the
Capitulation was conformable to the King of <hi>Spains</hi> mind, and such as
the Governour ought not to refuse. At this very time the Embassadour
<hi>Vives,</hi> being sent for by the Governour, was return'd to the Camp, who
before he came from <hi>Genoa</hi> was present at a consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation had between
<hi>Sancta Croce, Don Piedro di Sieva,</hi> Captain of the Sicilian Band,
<hi>Don Carlo Doria,</hi> and the Camp-masters <hi>Don Diego Pimontello,</hi>
and <hi>Don Piedro Sarmiento;</hi> The result whereof was, that it was
absolutely necessary for maintaining the dignity of the Crown, and the
authority of his Majesties Arms, to quarter that Winter in <hi>Piedmont;</hi>
wherewith he acquainted the Governour, who was already more inclined to depart,
then to tarry; he perswaded him likewise by many Reasons to tarry there, at
least till such time as having made some notable resentment, which might tend
to the punishment of the Duke, Peace might be concluded upon honourable terms.
And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Duke seemed to be much perplexed, lest (as he professed) by
the exclusion of Peace, some new breach might insue between the two Crowns,
<hi>Vives</hi> indeavoured to free him from any such suspicion, shewing him,
that by new orders had from the Court, by which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out listning to any
treaty of peace, he was absolutely commanded to keep the War on foot; the
Governour had good occasion to excuse himself to the Embassadors, and to delay
the accepting of the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which were proposed, till new orders might
come from the King; and that the mean while by continuing the War orderly and
boldly, some honourable action might be luckily light upon, which might make
way for the King to enter into a treaty of peace with honour and reputation.
And he added, that otherwise the Duke must needs passe unpunished for the
injuries done unto the King, if the Governour should either immediately accept
of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ace, or
coming out of <hi>Piedmont</hi> without doing any thing, might suffer those
same Princes to apply themselves to the King for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of the same
Capitulations. For in such a case, the King not being able to refuse them,
because they contain the three points pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by his Majesty, he should be
constrained to agree with the Duke, without taking that revenge, or making that
resentment, which he intended to do. Moreover, he said it would be very
dangerous that the Duke, seeing him and his Army retreated, might again assault
the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and infest it with often inroads.</p>
            <p>These and many other Reasons urged, by <hi>Vives,</hi> could not
work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Governour, who was desirous every day more then other to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:53250:51"/> to <hi>Millain.</hi> Wherefore the business being
propounded in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, after a long discussion, two things were at last
resolved upon; the one, not to accept the Capitulations of peace; the other,
that they would go out of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> For the first, they alledged the
precise or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from the King; for the second, the common custom, of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Camps to their Winter quarters in <hi>October,</hi> and in <hi>May</hi>
into the field. And because the Governour had told the Nuntio, and the
Embassadour, that it was necessary to send those Capitulations first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<hi>Spaine,</hi> they desired a Truce in the interim for forty dayes: which it
was again disputed whether or no it stood with the reputation of the retreat,
to give way thereunto. And it was concluded in the negative, because it was
contrary to the Kings orders; therefore the Governour sent the Capitulations
into <hi>Spain,</hi> and having tacitely af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded a longer Truce then they had
expresly refused to do, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Army into the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> after having staid only six days in the Dukes Dominions. So
this second entrance of the Spanish Army into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which was
publickly protested to be made to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise the Duke, had no better success,
nor won no greater reputation then did the first. Nay, at the same time that
the Governour stood consulting before <hi>Asti,</hi> Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi>
went by night out of <hi>Vercelles</hi> with a body of Foot and Horse, and on
the sudden assaulted <hi>Candia,</hi> a Town belonging to the King; and beating
down the Gate with a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard, he put it to fire and sword: and having staid
there all night, he returned safe the next morning to <hi>Vercelles,</hi>
receiving no offence from the Garrisou of <hi>Sandoval,</hi> which was not far
from thence. An action, which though the Duke protested to proceed without any
order from him, and before his son had notice of the Capitulation subscribed by
him, yet it was commonly thought that to revenge himself for this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
assault, and to free his State once more by diversion, he had commanded his son
to do it. The Governour being returned, he made the Duke be by publick
Proclamation declared to have forfeited the Dom nion of the City and Country of
<hi>Asti,</hi> and of the like of <hi>Santia,</hi> by his hostile acts
committed against the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> pretending that those Towns
held in Fee of the said State, and the Bills thereof were publish'd at the beat
of Drum, and fastned in some parts of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try confining upon the State of
<hi>Millain.</hi> Against which Proclamation the Duke made another Edict be
published, wherein denying absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that he held those Towns in Fee from the
Chamber of <hi>Millain,</hi> and that therefore they could not be proceeded
against by way of confiseati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he contradicted the Proclamation, terming it
foolish and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and commanded his Subjects to keep their wonted
loyalty and obedience to him. He afterwards possest himself of some other
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Fee-towns in the <hi>Langhe;</hi> and amongst those some that held of
the Chamber of <hi>Millain;</hi> the Governour not taking any notice the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mieneo,</hi> who going with his Artillery to <hi>Roccaverano,</hi>
it is not known for what cause; and therefore not without wonder to all men, he
had new orders to supersede; wherefore retiring back, the Duke sent 100 Foot to
re inforce the Garrison of <hi>Cortemiglia,</hi> he afterwards took
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zalasco, Gorzegno, Manoxino,</hi> and other Towns thereabouts; this was
the success of the Wars of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> in the year 1614: at the end
whereof the Governour went to <hi>Millain,</hi> to take order for greater
provisions for War the next year; and two Millions of Ducates being come to the
Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of <hi>Genoa,</hi> part whereof was for the Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi>
part for that in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> the Gabels upon Merchandize, and other
things, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to above a third part in <hi>Millain;</hi> The sum
whereof being turn'd into annual revenue, and a good part thereof sold to
particular persons, brought great store of moneys into the Exchequer, which
were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards assigned for the War, which was noised would be great the next
year.</p>
            <p>Levies of men were ordered to be made in <hi>Germany,
Swisser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and in <hi>Lombardy;</hi>
and not herewith all content, the King desired the <hi>Genoeses,</hi> the great
Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Urbin,</hi> Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi>
and the Commonwealth of <hi>Lucca,</hi> to send such men to the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> as either for their own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or by the condition of
obligation they were bound to do; and he did this not so much out of necessity,
as for the honour of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and to shew how much the Princes of
<hi>Italy</hi> did adhere to the Kings party, yea even against an Italian
Prince. The Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were not well pleased to see him proceed
with such a bulk of War against the Duke; for though the defence and protection
of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the preservation of publick peace, had at first
rendred the title and cause of the Spanish Forces less odious; yet since the
end was now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and that revenge was indeavoured, which made them
appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend worser things, they began in respect of the common interest, to
abhor the proceeding; and yet <hi>Urbin, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Lucca,</hi>
preferring the Kings Authority before any other respect, yielded easily to the
Kings request. The great Duke made some difficulty, alledging that being
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to send 4000 Foot and 400 Horse, for the State of <hi>Sienna,</hi>
which he held in Fee from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> to defend the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> he was not now bound to do it, when as the State making an
offensive and not a defensive War, his obligation and tenure thereof was
inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the example being of great consequence, and of greater prejudice:
but reply being made, that that which assaulteth must of necessity also be
defended, his excuse was not accepted of; chiefly since (as it was said) he who
held so great a State in Fee from the King ought not to stand so precisely upon
the words of his obligation. It was therefore agreed, that 2000 Foot should
effectually be sent, which should serve to defend the State, and not to offend
the Duke, and some supplies of money were sent; the Genueses case was
otherwise, who not being requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed
to administer relief out of any obligation, but only by way of fiendship and
correspondency, and for the great Interest which they had in the Crown of
<hi>Spain,</hi> excused themselves upon the necessity they <pb n="91" facs="tcp:53250:52"/>
had to guard their Confines towards <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to keep the Sea and
River open for the passage of the people which came to the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> which Reasons gave satisfaction.</p>
            <p>The Duke was not this mean while idle; for being much incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
by the past successes, and having, after he saw the Governour once more gone
out of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> quartered his men in several parts of the State, he
was wholly bent upon desending himself, and not upon agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He sollicited
the promised assistance of the <hi>Transalpine</hi> Princes, and guessing at
what was to come, by what was past, he grew so confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that as he was wont
to say, his own person was sufficient for half the Spanish preparations: Yet
the fear of the future war grew daily greater, and was confirmed by the
knowledge, that though the King had declared it did not become a free Prince to
ask pardon of another Prince upon the making of peace; and that therefore he
never expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any such thing from the Duke; yet with an intention of
resenting what the Duke had done in his Dominions, he had openly refused to
accept of the last Capitulation subscribed by the Duke: But this fear was much
more increased by the retaining a Post, who coming from <hi>Spain</hi> was
taken Prisoner as he past in a little Barque from <hi>Antibo</hi> to
<hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nale,</hi> and was sent to <hi>Turin</hi> with the Kings and Councels
Letters? the which being opened and Printed, the Duke caused to be divulged
throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> together with other Writings, wherein he justified
his own actions, tending (as he said) only to the defence of his own State,
which is so natural for all men to do, and to the preservation of peace: To
obtain the which, he added, he had not refused any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission which became a
free Prince: And because the Kings Lettess, and those of his Counsel, contained
bitter complaints of what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and sharp reprehensions of the
Governours actions; and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth nothing but fire and threats, charged
him with having trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him with grievous war: The Duke, taking his rise from
their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, fill'd the Papers with grievous Revilings of the Spanish
Nation, blaming the Spaniards without any respect, That under the fair pretence
of peace, they aimed only at the usurpation of his State; and that therefore
the King, refusing the just Capitulations subscribed by him the Duke, did
incite all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> against him, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth all the
usual Garrisons of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Scicily,</hi>
pardoning the most heinous offendors, as if he did proceed with all his Forces
and Authority, against an enemy to Christendom: Nor did the following actions
delay the confirmation of the fear of the future war; for hardly was the tacite
Truce occasioned by the sharpness of the season, ceased, when Arms were taken
up with greater fervor about the end of <hi>March,</hi> 1615.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cordona</hi>'s Spaniards, who were quartered in the Langhe,
were the first that moved; who through intelligence held with those of
<hi>Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavrano,</hi> who were weary of the French Garrison, entered the Town
by night through a hole made in the walls, and slew some of the French, the
rest whereof retired into the Castle, and made themselves Masters of the Town,
and the next day of the Castle, which could not he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the Passes and
Avenues thereunto being anticipately possessed: The Duke being awakened, as one
out of a deep sleep, by the loss of <pb n="92" facs="tcp:53250:53"/> 
               <hi>Roccavrano,</hi>
who had been quiet enough in <hi>Turin,</hi> began to doubt
<hi>Cortemiglia,</hi> whither he presently sent some Regiments of
Piedmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesans, and 800 Switzers; and coming from thence to <hi>Cherasco,</hi>
he furnished all his men in those parts with Ammunition and Artillery: But the
Spaniards perceiving by Letters which were intercepted that Count
<hi>Guido</hi> went to the recovery of <hi>Roccavrano,</hi> and that to that
end the Count was come with some men to <hi>Castine; Mortara,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> being sent to for succour by <hi>Cordova,</hi> who was
anxious of the mustering of men made by the Duke not far from his own and his
companions quarters, sent him 1000 Foot, advising him to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble together all
the Souldiers which were quartered in those parts, lest being assunder they
might be the more easily oppress'd by the Duke: And giving notice of every the
least particular to the Governour, and having after much pressing obtain'd
means, money, and munition from him, whereby to come into the field, he went
from <hi>Alessandria</hi> with 600 Souldiers, five Troops of Horse, and two
field-pieces; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given order to <hi>Ieronymo Pimontello,</hi> and to
<hi>Ieronymo Gamboloita,</hi> to go with a thousand Souldiers which yet
remained with them from <hi>Tortona</hi> to <hi>Castine,</hi> he himself
directed his course also thitherward: Here he thought to muster a body of 5000
Foot, and 600 Horse, all commanded men, and most of them Spaniards; and
confided so much in their valour, as perswading that the Dukes men would not be
able to make head against him, he promised himself secure victory at the first
incounter: <hi>Bistagno,</hi> a Town of above a hundred and more Families,
belonging to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> lies between <hi>Cassine</hi> and
<hi>Cortemiglia;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the rode-way which comes from the Sea, it
is of no small moment for the safety of the usual passage of people, who coming
from the <hi>Ligustick</hi> Sea, pass into the State of <hi>Millain:</hi>
Hither came <hi>Mortara,</hi> lest the place might be prepossessed by the Duke;
and with him came <hi>Pimontello</hi> and <hi>Gamboloita,</hi> with the men of
<hi>Tortora;</hi> and not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Cordova,</hi> who had left his
Brigade in <hi>Spain;</hi> and by order from the Governour, <hi>Don Sanchio
Salina</hi> likewise, and <hi>Caracciolo,</hi> to assist and advise
<hi>Mortara;</hi> whose too great fervour made the Governour appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend some
inconvenience. <hi>Gamboloita</hi> was sent with his men, and some few Horse,
to defend <hi>Monastero,</hi> a place two miles beyond <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagno,</hi> for
the safeguard of <hi>Cordova</hi>'s men, who were to come from <hi>Spigno</hi>
to <hi>Bistagno;</hi> but the Duke thought he had assuredly caught
<hi>Mortara,</hi> and the other Captains, in a noose, when he saw them come
thither with so few men: Wherefore placing the hope of so happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess in
speed, he came out of <hi>Cherasco,</hi> and throwing a Bridge sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over
the <hi>Tenaro,</hi> he past over to <hi>Neviglie,</hi> and came that way to
<hi>Castino,</hi> and so to <hi>Cortemiglia;</hi> where leaving the Switzers,
and a great Garrison under the Commendatore <hi>della Motta,</hi> he parted on
the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> being holy Thursday, towards <hi>Bistagno,</hi>
with 1200 Horse, and about 7000 Foot; and thinking to get thither early in the
morning, and to have taken the enemy at unawares, he marched apace all that
night; but being held play by the Garison of <hi>Vezema,</hi> as he past over
the Bridge at <hi>Bormia,</hi> which is neer the Castle; and having lost some
time the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d the boldness to resist him, he mar'd his designe; for
<hi>Mortara,</hi> having <pb n="93" facs="tcp:53250:53"/> notice of the Kings coming,
whilst he was at Dinner, sent <hi>Cordova</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently away towards his
Brigade, he sent to his men who were quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the neighbouring parts, to
come to <hi>Bistagno,</hi> and getting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately on horse-back with
<hi>Salina</hi> and <hi>Caracciolo,</hi> and followed with a Troop of Horse
with Musqueteers <hi>en Crupe,</hi> he went towards the Hill which leads to
<hi>Cassinisco,</hi> to incounter the enemy; but having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced couragiously,
and placed some of his Musqueteers to defend the Passes, he returned back
immediately to take order for the defence of <hi>Bistagno;</hi> where his men
stood in battel array, ready to receive the enemy; but being astonished at the
great number of men which they saw come down the Hill with the Duke, they
suddenly retired to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the walls of the Town; and having flanked the Gate
with earth, they put themselves orderly in a defensive posture; and Skirmished
all that day and the next night, seeking to keep the enemy aloof off, lest
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near they might throw down the wall with Spades and Pick axes: The mean
time <hi>Salino, Pimontello, Caracciolo,</hi> and chiefly <hi>Mortara</hi>'s
self, though he was then troubled with the Gout, sometimes on horse-back,
sometimes carried in a Chair, went comforting, (providing for what was needful)
and incouraging the Souldiers; in whose assistance the Towns-folk, yea, even
the women, labored with much affection and zeal, though the Duke had sent
Letters before his arrival to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls and Officers of that Communalty;
wherein he professed his only aim was to secure his own State, and to drive the
Spaniards from thence, promising safety both of life and lively-hoods; but
failing in his hopes of taking <hi>Bistagno</hi> by surprisal, he be took
himself to force, and because he wanted great Guns, which were left behind by
reason of the speed of their march, he began to block up the Avenues, so to
hinder relief. He first repuls'd <hi>Gamboloita,</hi> who marching with his men
from <hi>Monastero</hi> would have gotten into <hi>Bistagno;</hi> and not long
after the same <hi>Gamboloita</hi> joining with those who came with
<hi>Cordua</hi> from <hi>Spigno</hi> to relieve <hi>Mortara,</hi> they were
both of them set upon by the Dukes men, led on by Cavalier <hi>Boglia,</hi> and
Monsieur <hi>di Polimia,</hi> as they descended the Mountain beyond
<hi>Bormia;</hi> and after a Skirmish of three hours, they were forced to
retreat towards the top of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and to desist from the enterprise,
having won more praise for their daring, then for Military discipline, and left
about 200 fighting men behind them.</p>
            <p>The news of the danger <hi>Bistagno</hi> was in being divulged
round about, and afterwards throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> turn'd the eyes and
minds of all men upon the Duke; not only for the danger those Commanders, who
were the chiefest of all the Spanish Army, were in of being made pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
and the destruction of the men that were there, but because up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the taking of
that little Town the scattering of all those other men who were quartered in
the Langhe, did depend; who being Ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eran Souldiers, and most of them Spaniards, were thought to be the
sinews of that Militia, and the foundation of the Empire of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t Nation in <hi>Italy:</hi> Moreover
the Duke by his taking of <hi>Bistagne,</hi> would have been master of all the
Langhe, and would not only have been a great hinderance to the succours which
were expected from beyond Sea; but by assaulting <hi>Finale,</hi> or the River
of <hi>Genoa,</hi> he would <pb n="94" facs="tcp:53250:54"/> have freed his own State for
that year from the war wherewith it was threatned, and would have forced the
Governour to have made either his own Country, or that of the friends and
Confederates of the Crown, the Seat of war: He was therefore admired and
exalted, even to the Stars, for his Courage, Counsel, and Conduct; for that
when he seemed to be placed in an abyss of ruine, having such great forces
ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against him, and being so sorely threatened, he rose up more
coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously, and with greater vigour; and had reduced the affairs of so
po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent an enemy into so difficult and dangerous a condition, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
those of <hi>Mortara;</hi> who presuming more then any other Spanish Commander
whatsoever, hath several times vaunted, and particularly in a Letter which he
writ at his parting from <hi>Alessandria</hi> to <hi>Don Carlo Doria,</hi> at
<hi>Genoa;</hi> that he was gone to take the Duke Prisoner: But for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which
doth usually disturb well-weighed designs, looked not with a favourable aspect
upon this the Dukes enterprise; for the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Guns tarrying behind by reason
of the Dukes speedy march towards <hi>Bistagno,</hi> and his being hindered by
the cragginess of the ways, and the deepness thereof, he lost his design; so as
not being able to do any thing of moment with only two small pieces, especially
by reason of the sacks full of earth and straw which the Defendants hung out
upon ropes, <hi>Mortara</hi> had leasure to hold him play till succour came;
which the Duke fearing, and yet being resolved to do his utmost, he came to the
wall with Spade and Pick-Ax, to throw it down; and attempted in the dark of
night to make a furious assault; he at the same time made the Pyoneers
approach, and put for the ultimate tryal of his and the enemies fortune; but
the Defendants being incouraged, by seeing how little effect the Dukes
Artillery did, resisted stoutly here also; For having notice of the Dukes
intention, they were very vigilant in making defence; and did so clear the
darkness with Faggots and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes, which they threw into the Ditch, as they
might see to hit those that approach'd the walls; and so rendered this the
Dukes indeavour vain, as they had done the rest.</p>
            <p>This mean while the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> hearing at
<hi>Pavia</hi> what danger <hi>Mortara</hi> was in, though there was no good
intelligence held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, because <hi>Mortara</hi> was wont to detract
from his actions, and as if he understood the mystery of the Militia better
then the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, pretended to teach him how to fight; and because his much
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity had made the Governour give way to this his going out; yet
howsoever, preferring the publick good, and the Kings Service, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any
private enmity, he resolved speedily to relieve him and the other Commanders
who were in the like danger: He therefore march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with between four and five
thousand Foot, and some Troops of Horse which he had near at hand; and having
sent strict Orders to all Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ains
and Camp-masters to follow him with their men, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with incredible
speed towards <hi>Bistagno;</hi> and being come within three miles of it on the
second day in Easter-week, he lay all that night in <hi>Terzo:</hi> The Duke
the next morning after, which was the fourth day after his arrival, hearing of
the coming of so strong a succour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dis-lodge, and leaving 2500 Foot,
and the Horse on the Plain, he sent the rest of his men with the Artillery
towards the Hill. The <pb n="95" facs="tcp:53250:54"/> Horse and Foot which were left on
the plain followed afterwards by the same way; leaving much Ammunition in their
Quarters, Arms and many sick Souldiers, who were unfit to march, besides 1000
which were slain in the assaults and actions. He departed unmolested, for
<hi>Mortara</hi> being more afraid then was needful would not suffer his men to
go out; and the Governour did not follow him; but coming into <hi>Bistagno</hi>
almost at the same instant that the Duke removed away, and having heard Mass,
advised with his Counsel what was to be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the present occasion: some
of the Captains alledged the disturbance by rain, the narrowness of the ways,
and the difficult passes, which were fit for Ambuscadoes; and wherein they not
being able to make use of all their men, the enemy might with a few men resist
a much greater number; others alledged the weariness of their own Souldiers,
and some hours being past before the Consultation; wherefore they thought the
Enemy was so far advanced, as it was impossible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, it was
resolved, the Governour himself being of the same opinion, that they should not
follow the flying Enemy; a resolution whereby the glory due unto him for so
speedy and seasonable a succour; whereupon the welfare of so many well
deserving Commanders did depend, was turned to as much shame and dishonour; for
he was not only much blamed for letting slip so rare an occasion of victory,
but was worse spoke of, the manner and circumstances of the present action
being considered: some spoke against the way he took by <hi>Acqui,</hi> being
the further about, and worse then that of <hi>Nice;</hi> which was both the
n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>erer, and would also have been a
hindrance to the Duke in his retreat; others added, that to make the Dukes
retreat the more easie, he had forbidden <hi>Don Alphonso d' Avalos</hi> to
advance, who was Governour of <hi>Montferrat:</hi> and who marching from
<hi>Cassalle</hi> with 3000 Montferrian Foot and 300 Horse, had sent some of
his men to the Castle <hi>Palafea,</hi> which being a place upon the way was
very opportune to have detained the Duke, and hindred his retreat; so as when
the Spaniards should have been come upon him, and he consequently taken in the
midst, he must of necessity have been defeated; Others argued some secret
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence held between them, by the Governours lying all night in
<hi>Terzo,</hi> so neer the Enemy, when the besieged were in so great danger;
Nor were there those wanting, who said they had seen Messengers pass and repass
between the two Camps, and thereby, as also by other counter-signs argued that
the Dukes retreat was secured to him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever, it is most certain the Duke
must have received a great blow, had he been quickly pursued, without so much
counsel, and such af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected delays; for his men were in very bad condition, by
reason of their sufferings, and the hunger they had undergone before
<hi>Bistagno;</hi> and fearing to be assaulted, threw away their Arms, and fled
in disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; and on the contrary, the Duke had that very morning within three
miles space, 14000 Foot, and 1500 Horse (those of the <hi>Langhe</hi> being
comprehended) men, who in respect of the Enemy, were fresh, and who had rested
most part of that night; For <hi>Cordova, Gamboloita,</hi> and other Commanders
appeared immediately from the <hi>Langhe,</hi> with all the people of those
parts; as also <hi>Iovan Bravo, Carlo Spinelli,</hi> and <hi>Iovan Pietro
Serbelloni,</hi> appeared that very morning from the State of 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:53250:55"/> 
               <hi>Millain,</hi> with their Brigades, to boot with those
of the Country. <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stagno</hi> being freed, the Governour without looking
further after the Duke, who was gotten but ill-favour'dly with his men into
<hi>Canelli,</hi> tarried divers days in <hi>Allessandria,</hi> waiting for
Men, Ammunition, and Artillery, which he had sent for from several parts of the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> for the enterprize of <hi>Asti,</hi> which he gave
out he would take in hand.</p>
            <p>The Duke, when he had brought his men into <hi>Canelli,</hi> sent
them by degrees into <hi>Asti,</hi> whether he also sent victuals and
Ammunition, for the defence of that City, against which he saw the Governour
bent all his Forces; who parting from <hi>Allessandria</hi> about the fifth of
<hi>May,</hi> tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried six days in <hi>Felizzano;</hi> and going from thence to
<hi>Annone,</hi> the last Town upon the Confines of <hi>Millain,</hi> he went
with his Army towards <hi>Asti:</hi> He had with him between 16 and 18000
Italian Foot, 4000 Spaniards, about 2000 Horse, the <hi>Gens d' Armes</hi>
being therein compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended; to boot with 6000 other Foot, and 500 Horse, which
he had left under Cavagliero <hi>Melzi</hi> in <hi>Sandoval,</hi> not so much
to guard that Fort, as to keep <hi>Vercelles</hi> in jealousie; so as the Duke
being forced to keep it well Garrison'd, was the less able to defend
<hi>Asti:</hi> He had also 7000 other Foot, which he shortly expected from
<hi>Tuscanye, Urbine,</hi> and <hi>Lucca,</hi> by Sea; and those of
<hi>Parma</hi> were already come unto the Camp. At his going from
<hi>Annone</hi> towards <hi>Asti</hi> he divided his Foot into four equal
<hi>Squadrons,</hi> which being led on by four Troops of Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons, the Cavalry
divided into two Squadrons winged the left side towards the <hi>Tannaro,</hi>
the more inward whereof was led on by Don <hi>Alfonso Pimontello,</hi> General
thereof; and the outward by his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Don <hi>Sanchio Salina;</hi> after
these came the <hi>Gens d' Arms,</hi> conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their General the Marquess
of <hi>Este;</hi> the Baggage came after the Squadrons, and the Artillery, part
whereof was also plac'd on the left hand of the Squadrons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The City of</hi> Asti <hi>stands in a plain, at the foot of
some hills, upon the top whereof stands the Castle, joyn'd to the City, of an
ancient shape, as are also the rest of the Walls of the City, which therefore
have not those Flanks nor Rampiers which are used in modern Fortifications. On
the South side the</hi> Tannaro <hi>runs, two Musket shot distant from the
walls; the little hills which run in a large compass towards the North, bending
from thence towards the East, terminate in</hi> Annone, <hi>from whence, like a
half Amphitheaer, they encompass all that plain, between the Rivolea</hi>
Versa, <hi>and the hills of</hi> Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato, <hi>for some four miles space, and
somewhat further, between</hi> Annone <hi>and</hi> Asti.</p>
            <p>But the Duke not at all affrighted at the approach of so great an
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, would, though weaker in Forces, face them; and hating to keep inclosed
within walls would march into the field against them. He had with him about
some 15000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, most of them Forreigners, and chiefly French,
who were come thither, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing their Kings severe Edicts to the
contrary; for the Princes of that Kingdom being desirous of new perturbations
and ruptures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Kings, and it may be, that their King might be
the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrator of Peace and War in <hi>Italy,</hi> sent many men thither,
thinking, that look how many more of their Nation should be in the Dukes
ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <pb n="97" facs="tcp:53250:55"/> both Peace and War should the more depend upon
their Kings Being come neer <hi>Versa,</hi> and having taken up his Quarters
upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bank of the River, where was no commodious foording, save in
two places, he sent Monsieur <hi>de Roason,</hi> with 200 <hi>Lorrain</hi>
Horse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the River, that he might get into some houses belonging to an
Inn called <hi>Corce Bianca;</hi> the first bickering fell out here, between
these men, and <hi>Alphonso Balesteros,</hi> Comissary General of the Kings
Horse, who was sent before with 400 Dragoons to discover the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: This
Skirmish, by the concourse of people on both sides, grew almost to a Battel;
the Duke having sent his Van to relieve his men, and the Governour some Troops
of Curassiers, with the Burgonian Forces, led on by the Baton
<hi>Batteville,</hi> who was also followed by <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fonso Pimontello,</hi>
with his Horse Troop; so as the fray increasing, both sides fought valiantly;
in which fight it hapned, that the Lorrainers who were on the Dukes side, being
cloathed and weaponed like to the Kings Burgonians, did so mingle with the
Burgonians, as passing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known thorow the midst of them, they advanc'd even to
within sight of the Spanish Camp. The Governour advancing towards them bare
headed, thinking they were his men who fled, began, much to his danger, to
reprehend them, and to bid them return and fight valiantly; but they for fear
of death in case they should be known, seeming as if they would return to the
Skirmish, retreated dexterously to their own men, leaving their Captain
Prisoner, together with Cavalier <hi>San Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nero,</hi> and some others. There
died in this Skirmish an Ensign-Bearer of the Dukes, with some others of both
sides; <hi>Balesteros</hi> was sorely wounded, and Baron <hi>Batteville</hi>
sleightly, who, together with his Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians, behaved themselves gallantly
both here, and during this whole Campagnia, and were of great aid to the
Enterprise: Don <hi>Alfonso Pimentello</hi>'s Horse fell over and over with
him, not without great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of death.</p>
            <p>The Skirmish being over, (for the Dukes men retreated to beyond
the River,) the Governour advanced even to <hi>Versa,</hi> and took up his
Quarters there in the face of the Dukes Army; but he sent <hi>Iovan
Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo,</hi> with his Brigade, and some pieces of Artillery, to Quarter upon
the little Hills, for his own more safety, and for the prejudice of the Enemy:
But the Duke having munited all the bank of <hi>Versa</hi> on his side with a
long Trench, which reached from the little Hills to the <hi>Tannaro,</hi> sent
also 2000 Foot to possess themselves of the Hill which was oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to that
where <hi>Bravo</hi> was Quartered; and being mightily well shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on all
sides, and fortified, nor being to be assaulted there without apparent danger
to the Assailants, they began to skirmish from the Hills, and from the opposite
Trenches, with Muskets and Bumbards; but more out of force and fury than out of
any well taken advice, or any great effect. This Skirmish continued two or
three days without any advantage on either side; so as the Spaniards thinking
it a shame that the Duke with so unequal Forces durst confront them, and keep
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self equal to their Army so long, they resolved to advance by the
Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks, intending to fight him both on the back and flanks, in his own
Quarters, and to beat up his Quarters: The Enterprise was committed to the
Prince of <hi>Ascoli,</hi> who whilst he foreslowed the execution there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, 
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:53250:56"/> meeting with some impediments, he afforded the Duke, (who
had notice of all proceedings) leasure to possess himself of other stations,
fitter to hinder, or at least to make the Enemies progress more difficult in
that part: And because it was necessary for the Prince to go by way of
anticipation to the oppugning of <hi>Castiglione,</hi> a little Castle,
scituated upon a little Hill, which being of some consequence was furnished
with a reasonable Garrison, the Duke, for the better security thereof, chose
out about a thousand of his best Musketiers, and sent them under the command of
Captain <hi>Odone Rovero</hi> of <hi>Asti,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>d' Arlo,</hi>
a French man, men of great courage and experience, to possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of,
and to fortifie a certain Hill which stood between the Castle and
<hi>Bravo</hi>'s Quarters; but the Prince going with 4000 Foot, two Troops of
Light Horse, and some Artillery, to take in the Hill, after a long dispute,
wherein <hi>Arlo, Rovero,</hi> and many of the Dukes chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Souldiers were
slain, got it at last by stout fighting, for all that the Duke sent a great
relief unto them by Count <hi>Guido;</hi> from whence turning immediately to
the expugning of <hi>Castiglione,</hi> whether the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers who escaped from
the defence of the Hill fled, he likewise easily took it; for the Governour, to
the end that he by division might the more easily obtain the Hill, having at
the same time sent Don <hi>Alonso Pimontello</hi> to fall upon the Trenches
towards the <hi>Tannaro,</hi> which were defended by Prince <hi>Thomaso;</hi>
the Duke, thinking that he had suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently provided for the defence of the
Hillocks, by those that he had sent thither under <hi>Rovero</hi> and
<hi>Arlo,</hi> went with the body of his Army to assist his Son; so as not
being able time enough to relieve <hi>Castiglione,</hi> the Garrison of that
Castle astonished at Prince <hi>Ascoli</hi>'s great valour, and through the
fearful relations' which were made by the Souldiers who were fled thither,
basely surrendred it, when the battery was scarcely begun: 500 Souldiers
march'd out, who were graciously sent by the Prince to the Duke, not without
the murmurs of the Spanish Army, who by this acquisition remained absolute
Masters of the Colline.</p>
            <p>The Duke not being able to keep any longer upon the banks of the
River, those stations being lost, quitted his Quarters, and retired qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly,
unmolested, to the City; for the Governour, keeping the Army back, contrary to
the opinion of many of the Captains, expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad <hi>Pimentello</hi> to
advance, who already moved with the Cavalry to fall upon his Rere, being
satisfied with taking the Hills, and with having made the Duke forsake his
Trenches, he past with his Army beyond <hi>Versa,</hi> where he tarryed three
days to fortifie <hi>la Croce Bianca,</hi> and some other places thereabouts.
This mean while those of <hi>Tuscany, Urbane,</hi> and <hi>Lucca</hi> came to
the Camp, and the Tuscans were sent to <hi>Sandoval,</hi> that, according to
agreement with the great Duke, they might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed only in defence of the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and the rest tarryed in the Camp. With the addition
of these, and of other Souldiers who came to the Camp, the Army was increased
to the number of 30000 Foot, and 3200 Horse, 400 whereof were sent to St.
<hi>Damiano,</hi> a Town in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which stands on the back of
<hi>Asti,</hi> to keep back the victuals and munition which came from
<hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Captains of the Army consulted how they should assault
the Duke, and expugne the City; and it was resolved to attempt it by the Hills
near unto it, as <pb n="99" facs="tcp:53250:56"/> from a higher and more convenient place,
whereby they promised themselves the shorter and more easie success; for that,
contrary to the opinion of all men, they were neither garrisoned by the Duke,
nor fortified by Trenches, though the slow Proceedings of the Enemies Army had
afforded him sufficient conveniency to do it, and the present occasion did
necessarily require it: Therefore the Governour, leaving <hi>Zerbellone</hi>
with his Brigade to guard the Fortifications made about <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi>
march'd with his Army in three distinct battaglions towards the Hills; Don
<hi>Piedro Sarmiento</hi> led on the first, which was the Van, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of
four brigades of Foot, two Spanish, two Neapolitans; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one was that
commanded by <hi>Sarmiento,</hi> the other by Don <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronimo
Pimontello;</hi> the one under <hi>Thomaso Carecciolo,</hi> and the other
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Carlo Spinelli:</hi> After this went the second battaglion, led on
by <hi>Giovan Bravo,</hi> wherein was his own Brigade, and the other two of
<hi>Cordova</hi> and <hi>Gambaloita,</hi> with some Troops of Horse, according
as the scituation would permit: Between the one, and the other of these were
some Artillery brought, and some carriages of Ammunition; in the reere the two
Brigades of <hi>Ieronimo Rho,</hi> and of Cavalier <hi>Peccio</hi> followed,
with those of <hi>Urbane, Parma,</hi> and <hi>Lucca;</hi> the first com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
by Count <hi>Horatio Carpegna,</hi> the second by Don <hi>Francesco
Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese,</hi> and the last by <hi>Francisco Cenami:</hi> The Horse shelter'd,
as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the left wing of the Foot; the baggage came last, and a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Train of Artillery, with the wonted Guard. In this order did the Army march
early in the morning in a thick mist which would nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther suffer them to
discern the Hills, nor the Sentinels which were pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there to discover them.
The Duke having notice at last by his Scouts of the Enemies March, and finding
that they went towards the Hills, he, though too late, was aware of the
importancy of that station; wherefore issuing immediately with all his men out
of the City, he went to pre-possess himself thereof; which by reason of their
near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness having easily done, since he had not more s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>asonably fortified them, he
endeavour'd at least to arm them, and furnish them so with Souldiers, as the
Enemy should not be Masters of them without much prejudice and effusion of
blood. He therefore, having a mind to give battle, placed six or seven thousand
French on the least Hill, and on that which was farthest off; and talking to
them on foot, he encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged them to fight, proposing unto them the advantage
of the scitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the valour of their Nation, their hatred to the Spaniards,
the glory and great rewards of Victory; and they being come for the most part,
rather to pillage then to fight, it is said, that pointing with his hand unto
the Enemies Troops, he should say to them, give you me those Ranks disordered,
and I will give you the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and all <hi>Italy</hi> in
prey to your valour and worth: For all the Arms, all the Forces that the
Spaniards can put together, being assembled in this Camp, with what other
people, with what other Armies can they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you? with what Arms, with what
Commanders can they bereave you of the reward and fruit of Victory? Then
seeming as if he were called away elsewhere, he excused himself for not
tarrying longer with them: But seeming as if he did totally confide in their
worth, he told them that his presence was more requisite elsewhere; then going 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:53250:57"/> from them, he disposed 5000 Swissers on the Hill called
<hi>Certosa,</hi> where he also placed five pieces of Artillery, with which
scouring the Plain, he also light upon the Enemies Squadrons, and made way for
the Horse, partly on the side of the Foot, partly in the Valley between the two
Hills. The Governour was advanced, verily believing that the Duke would not
stir out of the City; and seeing him, beyond all expectation, encamp'd upon the
Hills, and prepared for fight, he gave order for giving battle, being thereunto
much egg'd on by the entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his men, and by the fervency of the whole
Camp, who desired nothing else. This order being published,
<hi>Sarmiento</hi>'s battaglion, which was the Van, marched towards the Hills,
and through the Souldiers fervour; a little more speedily then they ought to
have done: And as he passed along having discovered some French quarter'd
underneath the skirts of the Hills, some Neapolitanes were sent to drive them
from thence. Here the fight begun; for <hi>Onofrio Muti,</hi> a Roman
Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman and Commiss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ry General
of the Dukes Horse, came in to the relief of the French with a great Squadron
of Horse, which, as if they had abandoned the Dukes party, past over to amongst
the Enemy, crying <hi>Viva la Spagna, Viva la Spagna;</hi> whereby they did so
deceive the Neapolitanes, as coming close up to them, without receiving any
harm, and being by them friendly received, they immediately drew forth their
Swords, and wounded some, slew other some, till such time as being relieved by
<hi>Gambaloita,</hi> who seeing what was done from the second Squadron,
advanced with his men, and forc'd the Enemies Horse to retreat: And at the same
time the Neapolitanes, and the rest of the first Squadron, clambe up by those
streight paths against the thund<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r
of Cannon and hail of Musket-shot, and fighting as they came up the Hill, they
at last got to the Plain, where being back'd by two pieces of Artillery, which
were conveniently placed, they press'd so home upon the French, as beginning
first to wave, and afterwards shamefully to turn their backs, they fled into
<hi>Asti:</hi> The Duke, though in vain, sent Monsieur <hi>Limogione</hi>
Lievtenant to Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> to assist them, that he might set upon
and oppose the Enemy with his Horse; and he himself turning to the Swissers on
the other Hill, on whom all his hopes lay, began to encourage them to make that
station good; shewing them, 
<q>That the first Hill was lost, not through the valour or number
  of the Enemy, but by the cowardise of the French; that they might make amends
  for the shame, and repair the loss: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had an excellent occasion
  to shew how much the Swissers did exceed the French in valour, and to boast
  that it was the Swissers that had preserved his reputation and the state of the
  House of <hi>Savoy:</hi> He therefo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e wished them to make head, and face the Enemy, not only by keeping
  them from that station, but by beating them also from the other which the
  French had so basely abandoned: That he himself would hazzard his life amongst
  them, to whose valour and worth he had trusted his honour, State, and
  reputation; that he was therefore ready to keep with them, and run the same
  fortune, and fighting valiantly with a pike in his hand, either dye there, or
  bear away a plenary and glorious victory from the Enemy: That therefore they
  should fight as valiantly for the defence of that station, as they 
  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:53250:57"/> would do for the very walls of <hi>Turin;</hi> and let
  the world know that the Swissers had not lost the ancient gallantry of their
  Fore-fathers, whereby they had won so many, and so famous Victories, with so
  much glory, wherein he did not in vain confide, nor yet so many other Princes,
  preferring the Swissers worth, in the defence of things of greatest importance,
  before that of all other Nations.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But all these words were spoke in vain; for <hi>Giovan Bravo,</hi>
who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed <hi>Sarmiento,</hi> having this mean while wheeled about with the
se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Squadron on the side of the first Hill, and got upon the second, and
together with him <hi>Gamboloita,</hi> and <hi>Don Alphonso Pimontello,
Limo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gione</hi> could do not only not do any thing of moment; but the Swissers
seeing themselves set on, on so many sides, turn'd their backs more basely then
the French had done, without or fighting, or shewing their face to the
adversary; and though the Duke and Prince <hi>Thomas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> indeavoured to make head with some Squadrons of
Horse, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Swissers; which not being able to do, they themselves
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the coming on of the Enemy, as much as might be; yet his men running
faster and faster away, and the Enemy coming faster and faster on, they were
forced to yield, and to leave five piece of Cannon in the Enemies hands; two of
which being thrown into a ditch towards the City, were by night recovered by
the same Swissers.</p>
            <p>This was that which hapned on the Hills of <hi>Asti,</hi> on the
21<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> wherein though <hi>Sarmiento</hi>'s Squadron fought
more then any of the others, and particularly <hi>Spinello</hi>'s and
<hi>Caracciolo</hi>'s Neapolitans, to whom therefore the praise of the Victory
was little less then wholly due; yet because their too great fervour and fury
wherewith they charged the Enemy was a hindrance to their companions, and to
the Kings other Squadrons, who proceeded in a more orderly, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ary manner, so as they could not come
time enough to the fight; therefore these coming up after the French were
routed, their action was not so advantagious as it would have been, if they had
made a joynt assault; for then doub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>lesly the Dukes men would have been to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally beaten. The number of
the slain (as is usual) is diversly related; yet was it less then was to have
been expected from such a conflict; and no wonder, since they minded flying
more then fighting. The Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politans received some loss, being deceived by the
Dukes Horse, who were they only that may be said to have laid about them, and
to have made some resistance, whereas the Kings Horse did little or nothing;
nor were there many taken prisoners; of the Spaniards the only man of account
that was taken, was <hi>Don Francesca di Silva,</hi> brother to the Duke of
<hi>Pastran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

amongst the Enemy, was woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and died not many days after a prisoner in
<hi>Turin.</hi> Those of quality who fell on the Dukes side, were Monsieur
<hi>di Crepagna,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant Major-General, and six other Captains; on the
Kings side, six Captains and some other under-Officers: Great was the
reputation which the Kings Forces won by these successes, who were brought
ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry low by the former; and very much the suppression of the Dukes party,
whose affairs were hereby thought to be reduced to so low an ebbe, as the news
of the loss of the Battle b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ing
brought to <hi>Turin,</hi> and <pb n="102" facs="tcp:53250:58"/> the Dukes writings, and
things of greatest consequence being sent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, men betook themselves to
such courses, as in times of greatest extremity is usual; they carried the
Jewels and best of the Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houshold-stuff into the Castle; and as if the
Enemy had been before the Walls, the people fell to fortifie them, to furnish
them with Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels, and <hi>Corps de guarde;</hi> and the women clothed in
sackcloth, went bare foot in procession to the Churches, and sacred places of
the City; and yet little was the advantage that was got by the Victory: For
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common custom of War, the Kings affairs did from thence begin
to decline in power, and reputation; and on the contrary, those of the Duke
grew daily better and more glorious; for the conquering Army, which ought to
have run with fervour to the ruine of the City, which was full of men
affrighted, and confused through excessive fear, and which was not likely to
have held out long before so victorious an Army, as was generally confess'd by
all men, did not only forbe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

doing so, but kept idle upon the Hills that they had won, and as if they had
been infatuated with stupidity, busying themselves only in making Trenches, and
in fortifying their Quarters, to defend themselves from the Enemy which they
had beaten; who after some days were passed began the Battery, but so cold, so
leasurely, so uncertain a one, that the Bullets of the Artillery either did not
hit at all, or with very little damage, though the Walls which they plaid upon,
were exceeding weak with age.</p>
            <p>Wherefore the Duke, who was also entred the Town in fear and
astonishment, and saw things in so desperate a condition, by reason of his own
Souldiers confusion, prepared rather to abandon, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, taking
courage at the so slow proceeding of the Enemy, began to hope he might be able
to defend it; the which that he might do with the more honour and shew of
valour, he lodged his men between the Walls and the Trenches, over against
those of the Enemy; and he did not only play upon the Enemies Camp from the
Castle, and from the Bulwarks, and Platforms built without in convenient
places; but sally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often out of the Trenches with store of Musketeers, even
to the Enemies Banks and Works, he molested them continually both by day and
night; and particularly on that part, where, as being most exposed to assaults,
<hi>Giovan Bravo,</hi> and <hi>Lodovico Gamboloita</hi> stood to make de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
who consequently underwent the burthen of all that enterprize. The City was
plentiful in Victuals and Ammunition, which were daily brought to the Duke,
notwithstanding the 400 Horse which were sent to St. <hi>Damiano;</hi> and the
neerness of the same City afforded him convenience not only to quarter his men
commodiously, and under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, but also to refresh them; for dividing his
Souldiers between the Guards of the Walls and the Trenches, and some succeeding
other some in labour, and in rest, they recreated themselves, and getting more
strength by their rest and recreation, they fell with more vigour to their
labour again, and made the longer resistance: and though they were not
over-well paid, yet did they serve in that War with much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and
industry, and were incouraged not so much by the Dukes presence and authority,
as by his civil comportment, which won up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n the Souldiers, whom he accompanied in all their labours and
dangers; <pb n="103" facs="tcp:53250:58"/> To this was added, that he being naturally
liberal to the Souldiers, they knew he failed them not in their pay through
avarice, but impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: so as every one esteeming the cause his own, they
laboured in the enterprize as for their own honour, incited by their hatred to
the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and by their desire of cancelling the fault which they had
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Battel; and they fought the more fervently, for that they saw
the Enemies Army grow the less couragious; Which not being only molested by
continual labour (as hath been said) but afflicted with infinite wants and
inconveniences, and exposed to a thousand hardships in the <hi>Campagnia,</hi>
wasted and consumed miserably away, as ice beaten on by the Sun; for abounding
in Victuals, and in all other refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which was brought them from the
States of <hi>Millain</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,</hi> they grew unruly and
ill-governed, from whence infinite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders did result: they were quarter'd
upon those barren Hills, and without water, the scarcity whereof was very
great, which they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not only for their refreshment, and to keep them
clean, but even to drink: for having none but what was brought on the backs of
beasts from the <hi>Tanaro,</hi> and <hi>Versa,</hi> there was not sufficient
for the Men and Horses to drink: especially the neighbouring Cisterns of
<hi>Certosa</hi> being immediately dried up by reason of the great concourse of
people; and a little rivulet which ran neer their Quarters, through the small
care they had of keeping cleansed from the immundities of the Army, became so
foul and loathsome, as it was of no service: So as the Souldiers were not only
scorch'd up through heat, but fell sick through sluttish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. Moreover, there
being no habitations there, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
save in the Covent of the <hi>Certosa,</hi> the Souldiers for the most part lay
without Tents or Shrouds, naked upon the earth; so as they were burnt by day,
by the Sun-beams which were at that time very hot, and by night distempred by
the blasting Evening-dew, and cold Air. In many places you might have seen the
Souldiers sitting on the ground under the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a bough, fixed in the
earth, thinking it a great refreshment to shelter their heads a little from the
scorching heat of the Sun: they took little care in burying the dead; so as the
air grew noisome through the stink of dead bodies, sickness, and other
pollutions. The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers not being able therefore to bear with so much labour
in War, and inconveniences of body, fell many of them daily sick, who not being
fitted with opportune remedy, and the contagion still increasing, the Camp
within a few days became rather like an Hospital of sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then Military
Quarters: It behoved therefore to send for the Germans who were in the Garrison
at <hi>Sandoval,</hi> to supply the scarcity of people in the Camp, wherein
there were not enough able to supply the Guards, and other usual Military
Duties; the rather for that the Governour having made a Trench to be digg'd
towards the west, by which way Victuals and Ammunion were brought into the City
from <hi>Piedmont;</hi> the Duke being aware of it, caused another Trench to be
made over against it, wherewith he sheltered the way, and on the head thereof
made a Fort be built, from whence the opposite Trench being furiously plaied
upon by the Artillery, the quarters about <hi>la Certosa</hi> were exposed to
assaults: it being therefore necessary, for remedy, to build another Fort
opposite to it, <hi>Thomaso Caracciola</hi> was deputed to <pb n="104" facs="tcp:53250:59"/> have the custody the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eof, with his Brigade of Neapolitans; and these not being
sufficient, for many of them diminished, the Dutch who were come but a little
before from <hi>Sandoval,</hi> were sent thither. The Governour continuing
thus, many days, to oppose the Enemies Army which lay before the City, and
seeming neither willing, nor resolute to assault it; the Souldiers being
oppress'd with so much labour and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience could not be kept from
murmuring, not complaining so much of the effect, as of the manner of the
Governours suffering them, who were willing to fight the Enemy, to be so basely
consumed by suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; and that undergoing a thousand deaths hourly, and
run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning manifest ruine and destruction, he would not suffer them to dye
honourably by assaulting the City and the Dukes Quarters; nor so much as send
the Horse which lay there idle, to divert the enemy from making defence, or to
pillage and over-run <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to keep back the provisions which
were daily brought into <hi>Asti:</hi> Every one there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spoke ill of him,
detracting from his Honour and Reputation, saying, as they were wont, that he
held private intelligence with the Duke, and had no good intentions to the
Kings Affairs: Now that the true ground of these Detractions, as also of what
was alledged in his defence, (for it was variously argued) may be known, it
will be necessary, that leaving the Spanish Army in their difficulties and
trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, wherein it continued till the end of the war, and till the peace was
concluded; that looking a little backwards, we make some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
inquiry.</p>
            <q>    
               <p> The Governour being naturally inclined to proceed with maturi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and safety in all his actions, and therefore professing that he mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the
war not with any military violence, but with Spanish slowness and caution
seemed in all his resolutions to have for his chief end, not to hazzard the
present condition of affairs; and that therefore, as a dangerous Rock to the
Kings affairs, he abhorred nothing more then to make either the Italians or
French jealous that the King would make himself master of <hi>Asti,</hi> and of
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> lest such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

might move too brisk humours, and might perturb the very foundation of the
peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> which was far from the intention of the King or his
Councel to do: These his ends and thoughts, which he from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, for
the justification of the business did not conceal, made him af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>erwards so circumspect and reserved,
as well in the prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the war, as in all his other actions, as the
Duke growing bold thereupon, and fearing the reputation of his forces the less,
did with more courage continue the war; and the Embassadours who mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the

bridle, or spur, to bring him to what they would. The Prince of <hi>Ascoli</hi>
seemed, though with more setled thoughts, to be of the same opinion; to whom
the Duke did much adhere, as to both of them did some of the Commanders, who
being gratified by the Governours failed not to side with him in all Consul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the setting aside of all such respects, as pernicious to the final end of the
affairs, and for the making war manfully: To <pb n="105" facs="tcp:53250:59"/> him did the
most of the Captains in their hearts incline, and openly the whole Army; who
were scandalized at the Governours so great circumspection; the Governour and
the Prince were much nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd in this disposition by the Negotiation of
peace, which was hotly trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ed of
in <hi>Spain, France,</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> For the King of <hi>France</hi>
having sent Monsieur <hi>de Silleri</hi> with a stately Embassie to carry his
Presents to his new Spouse, and beginning to grow jealous of the Governours so
great preparations against <hi>Piedmont,</hi> had given him Commission to treat
efficaciously with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> touching the manner of composing
the Dukes Affairs; from which composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, after the said Dukes hostile
actions, the King and Court of <hi>Spain</hi> seemed to be much averse; That
King and Court were loath to yield to the King of <hi>France</hi> his desires,
thinking them too much mis-becoming Kingly dignity, nor suiting with such
threats and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations: They were yet more troubled for the examples sake;
thinking that to agree with the Duke, without some preceding just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment,
and due revenge for the hostility, and little respect shewn, would be too great
a detriment to the Authority and Reputation of the Crown. The Dukes necessity
in defending himself pleaded for the other side; which being permitted for a
free Prince to do, did not only mitigate the name of the offence, but the
offence it self; As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the continual desire of preserving <hi>Italy</hi> in
peace, which contrary to all expectation was now disturbed by the effusion of
so much Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian blood, to the so great prejudice of the people, and not
without danger of <hi>France</hi> her being interessed therein: The respect of
Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred likewise between the King and Duke; so as the King being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
that the resentment should not only be finally forborn, but all satisfaction
for the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ended interest, by
reason of the intercession of his Son in law, his conjunction of blood, and the
peace and quiet of Christendom; it was agreed that the Duke being always
understood to observe the said three Points which were proposed from the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the war, he should be freed from the molestations of war: But to
the end that all things should be proceeded in with the dignity and reputation
of the King; and that the Duke should not be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be pertinacious, as he
seemed to be, and to refuse the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; it was agreed upon, That the King of
<hi>France</hi> should by his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour intimate war to the Duke, if he
should refuse to accept of the aforesaid three things; and that on the
contrary, if the Duke should accept thereof, and that this acceptation should
be brought in writing by the French Embassadour to the Governour, it might be
as an express Command from the King, that forbearing all hostility in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> the Army should immediately retreat: That things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus
composed, without the medling of any of the Kings Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or their Articling
any thing with the Duke, it should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted in <hi>Spain</hi> as a form
of composition suiting with the Kings greatness and Majesty; the Dukes bare and
ready acceptance serving for a full amends and satisfaction for what was past:
That the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was made acquainted with this Agreement by the Embassadour
<hi>Rambollietto,</hi> when he was in <hi>Felizano;</hi> and that fearing the
danger that might insue unto the Duke by so gallant an Army, he should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort 
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:53250:60"/> him to desist, to the end that the peace which was almost
conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, might meet with no disturbance: He gave him, together with this
advice, a Letter from <hi>Don Inego de Cardevas,</hi> Embassadour for the King
at <hi>Paris,</hi> wherein he gave him notice, That the King of <hi>France</hi>
had given order to <hi>Ramboglietto</hi> to denounce war in his name to the
Duke, if he should not accept of these three Points: And it not being to be
believed that the Duke would gain-say the pleasure of these two Kings; who, as
if they were both one, proceeded with joint Counsels; the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>efore the Governour, since the occasion of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
did not deserve that for it the Kings Affairs should be longer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed, did
prefer safe peace before long and dangerous war; and thought itsuffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ent to shew war unto the Duke, rather
then to make war upon him; and that it would suffice to come to some honourable
acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him, rather to make an honourable peace, then to damnifie him: In
token whereof he moved but slowly from <hi>Felizzano</hi> to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none,</hi>
and did likewise proceed but slowly for six days about <hi>Versa;</hi> as

                  </gap>riage of war, and of the manner of expugning
<hi>Asti;</hi> hoping, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, that the apprehension of the neighbouring
Army, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours intercedings, and the fear of having war intimated to
him in the King of <hi>France</hi> his name, might prepare him for conditions
of peace; so all things might be with much honour appeased, without any danger
or hazzard to the Kings Affairs; That this might, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, also be the
cause that when he had got the Victory, he was contented with the Dukes
retreat, and proceeded no further: And that thinking that he being superiour in
forces, and victorious, he might willingly listen to the urgent and efficacious
protestations of the French Embassadour, who acquainted him that the King did
not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend he should proceed with loose Reins to oppress the Duke, assuring
him also that the Duke being overcome in battel could not but accept of the
conditions of Peace; as the Embassador, mingling hopes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises day by day
with his protestations, assured him it would succeed.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This is that which is pleaded in the discharge and defence of the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Orders given, which are unknown, which were secretly sent to the Governour from
the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which it behoved him to govern
himself; for it was then tacitly murmured amongst many, which increased
afterwards in fame and opinion, and was constantly and universally believed;
That the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> to whose severity the reason of these
Commotions was chiefly attributed, seeing how much contrary to his expectation,
and contrary to the Kings affairs, they increased; and fearing lest the
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbance of peace, and the Dukes alienation, might at long running ruine
his own inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ests, did streightly
charge the Governour, that set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting side all other respects, he should wholly
mind composition and reconciliation with the Duke, and that he was precisely
commanded to sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> neither then nor afterwards so certainly manifest, as that they
were able to quench the pregnant suspicions which were formerly had of him:
Therefore the contrary opinion of those did generally prevail; who a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>guing either out of self-emulation; or
out of a sinister impression of <pb n="107" facs="tcp:53250:60"/> his actions, said; That
none of the Kings Orders could be so precise or limited, especially the far
distance being considered, but that they were to be varied according to the
variation of affairs; nor that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours hands ought to be so bound up,
as that he might not make use of his forces according as time and occasion
should require: Nor that any Negotiation of peace should with any reason so
much impede the heat of war, as that the progress of the latter should be lost
or slack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, in respect of not disturbing the uncertain conclusion of the
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; They made no account of the apprehension of future evils, as being
vain and not consonant to these times; for the Governour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a
well-experienced Army on foot, commanded by the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of these
times, and provided with all things fitting for war; which received greater
force and reputation by the assistance of divers I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

moved: And howsoever, what sinister action, said they, could ever happen, which
would not be less then the prejudice which would result from the disbanding of
that Army, which being kept on foot, was able to repair all inconveniencies;
and which being disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed did inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which were so much feared; therefore, said they, it behoved the Commander in
chief to know the condition of his own forces, to make use of them to his best
advantage, by streightning and assaulting the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and by keeping him so
molested, as that he might desire, covet, nay, account it a great favour, to
obtain a secure peace; which assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly is always most advantagious to those
who are most against it: That all Commanders and Generals had always govern'd
themselves so, and that by so doing they had reaped great advantage, honourable
condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and much reputation to their Princes affairs; but that to keep
idle within Works, to sit quietly under Pavillions, and to expect that the
enemy should be inclined to peace; to suffer themselves to be wheeled about by

confidence, to make him the prouder and more bold, to alienate him from
Articles of peace, to make him backward and harder to consent to that which he
finds to be so much indeavoured by his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary.</p>
            <p>These and the like things were spoken of throughout
<hi>Italy,</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Camp. at all assemblies of men, who not knowing
the final ends of Princes and Commanders, and of the Reasons which make them
ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or which keeps them from doing so; and less knowing what would have
happened if they had done according to their intentions and discourses, do
often arrogate unto themselves to the prejudice of other mens reputations, the
censuring of humane actions, even as if the heart of him that governs, or
future events, were apparent to the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

what pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, will not permit of his judgment in the truest and most equitable
ratiocination, to him who shall be pleased and satisfied with his pains: 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:53250:61"/> it is most certain that the Governour, in the general
opinion of men, made himself suspected of having at the first, instead of
extinguishing, disloyally nourish'd that fire, the suppression whereof if he
had more indeavoured, he would have shut up the mouth of detraction, and have

his King, and together with his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation wherein he suffer'd very much,
have preserved the Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which beginning from the first to bow did

            <p>But that we may return to where we left; whilst the Army wasted,
as hath been said, the indeavours of peace were not given over by the Agents of

for the disbursing of a hundred thousand Ducates to the Duke, at

they being desirous to abate the Spanish grandezza, were not wanting in
sustaining him, and shoaring him up, to the end that he might resist him who
thought to suppress him. So all these Princes being thought privately to blow
this fire, it was imagined that their Embassadours, who Negotiated the
business; did not proceed therein with sincerity, unless it were the Popes
Nuntio; for both their manner of treating, and form of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, was
sufficiently different from that reallity which in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance they did
profess: and contrary to the great confidence, and good correspondency between
the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France:</hi> the French Embassadour having

               </gap> the intimation of War, being consequently able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the Duke
by the latter, and to force the Governour by the other: so as he was the chief
Arbitrator of all that Negotiation, the rather for that the French Souldiers
and Captains, who fought on the Dukes behalf, depending upon his command, he
might at his pleasure make them forego their Arms, and bereave the Duke of the
greatest part of his Forces; and though by orders from his King he was to be
careful <pb n="109" facs="tcp:53250:61"/> of the reputation of the Spanish Crown, and to
give satisfaction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and as a good servant to so great a King ought
not to suffer the peace to be concluded otherwise, for the example which it
would be to all greater Kings; and being trusted by the Barons of
<hi>France,</hi> was chosen by the Queen to be imploy'd for this end at the
Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> yet the Authority and common desire of the Princes of
that Kingdom; wherein they differ'd from the King in point of keeping
friendship with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> prevailing more with him: as also
peradventure the French humour, naturally averse to the name of Spaniard, he
made less account of the Kings command: which was the chief cause of all the
inconveniences which befell the Spanish Army. For doubtlesly things would have
gone otherwise, if he had punctually observed his Kings directions immediately
after the Victory upon the Hills: but whilst under pretence of not exasperating
the Duke, he proceeded sometimes too favourably with him, and sometimes
approving of his jealousies, he feared that by intimating War unto him
<hi>Piedmont</hi> might be made a prey to the Victorious Army, much to the
Kings prejudice; and that therefore he temporiseth with the Duke, wherein he is
fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor'd by the English and Venetian Embassadours: the Duke knowing what was
done, fenc'd himself on one side with subterfuge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, and on the other side assaulted the
Enemies Trenches, and faced him: and on the contrary, the Spanish Army (as hath
been said) mouldred away; and the weaker they grew in Forces and Men, the Duke
had the less mind to come to an agreement; and consequently standing harder
upon the advantage of Articles, propounded delays, and greater difficulties;
and hoping to get the better at the last, had a greater desire to fight; and
venting his conceived hatred against the Spaniards, aspired at glory, by the
total Victory of so invincible an Army; and the Embassadours, who would spin
the thread of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

they were resolved to do, held the Governours in hand with efficacious promises
of peace; the conclusion whereof being from day to day defer'd, and they the
mean while delighting to see the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series of the Spanish Army, they delaied so
long, as finding it at last reduced to so great weakness, as that it was not
able to fall upon any enterprise, they began to treat of new conditions; which
together with the three particulars of <hi>Madrid,</hi> contained many other
things of satisfaction to the Duke. Thus was the Capitulations of peace made,
upon the beneath written terms and agreement.</p>
            <q>    
               <p> That the Duke should disarm effectually within one moneth; and

should not offend the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Dominions, and that his
pretentions should be discus'd in the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Courts of Justice. On the
contrary, the French Embassadour promised that the Rebels of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> should be pardoned, and be fully restored to their Goods,
Honours and Offices: that he should be protected by <hi>France,</hi> in case he
should be molested by the Spaniard, contrary to what was agreed upon; to which
purpose, express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was given in the Kings name to Marshall
<hi>Diguere,</hi> Governour of <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> and to the other Governours
of Provinces confining <pb n="110" facs="tcp:53250:62"/> upon the Dukes Territories, that
immediately, without expecting any orders from the King, they should succour
the Duke, in case the Conventions should not be agreed upon: that the Swissers
and Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons should be restored to free Commerce in the State of
<hi>Millain:</hi> that the places taken by either side should be restored: that

               <p> That the French Embassadour should desire the Duke to draw a

Governour, and cause him to quit his quarters and to retreat to <hi>Croce

the rest of the Souldiers out of the City: and the French Embassadour promised,
that on the same day that that should be done, the Spanish Army should march

Embassadour, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter such effectual laying down of Arms, the Governour
should so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of the Kings Army, as neither the Duke, nor any other Prince
of <hi>Italy,</hi> should thereby have any cause of jealousie; and that the
King of <hi>France</hi> should ratifie the agreement within twenty days. All
these Articles and Conventions were reciprocal between the Duke and the French
Embassadour, who bound himself in his Kings name; which King took upon himself
the whole business, and obliged himself to see whatsoever on his side, or by
the Spanish Agents, abundantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; For what remained, there was no
mention of any submission to be made by the Duke; only in the preamble, amongst
the Reasons which moved him to peace, he alledged the desire he had to witness
to the world the obsequence, and particular devotion which he had always
profess'd to bear unto the King. These Articles were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Kings name, that they should immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forego the Dukes service and return
to <hi>France,</hi> whither he would follow them the next day; which certainly
he would have done, if the Nuntio had not opportunely interposed his Authority;
who going se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times between him and the Duke, and earnestly intreating
them not to let the almost concluded peace be disturbed, obtained that the
Embassadour should tarry and give leave to the Duke to bethink him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self better,
and to reflect upon the danger and necessity of his affairs, which would grow
to a bad condition, if the French, who were the chief sinews of his Army,
should mutiny as they seemed to be already in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to do; or foregoing his
pay, should be inforced suddenly, and in so ill a crisis of time, to abandon

Embassadour, he not without much indignation, was at last brought to subscribe
the Articles of peace; but upon condition that the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be kept
in the Nuntio's hands, to be by him assigned over to the Embassadour when he
should receive another from him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Governour of <hi>Millan</hi>
should sufficiently bind himself in his Kings name, to observe what the
<hi>French</hi> Embassadours had promised on the Kings behalf: the Duke being
desirous that it should be rather cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with him on the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> behalf, for that he knew he for his reputation sake abhorr'd to
do it: He was also satisfied herein, though contrary to the capitulations of
<hi>Madrid,</hi> and to the intentions of the two Kings, yielded unto by the
Embassadour of <hi>France,</hi> and by the other Embassadours, who were
desirous that Peace might be concluded the most that might be to his advantage
and honour; and therefore the Embassadour of <hi>France</hi> having written to
the Governour, (who was now reduced to a state rather of giving then of
receiving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of peace) and having obtained sufficient assurance from
him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, the business was at last totally agreed. Whilst these
things were a concluding, or were rather held to be totally concluded; the Duke
not being yet satisfied with venting, nor with resenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, went out of
the City by night with a great number of his valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Souldiers and
Capta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ns, and assaulted the
enemies Trenches: He hoped to find them unprovided, by reason of their great
sufferings, and negligent out of their hopes of the near conclusion of peace,
which made him desire to make great slaughter, and notably to resent his
conceived injuries; but he failed in his design; for the Governour having
notice thereof, re-inforced the Trenches with Garrisons, and gave the chief
care thereof to <hi>Gamboloita</hi> and <hi>Bravo;</hi> who managed the
business so well, as they forced the Duke to retreat, with the like prejudice
which he had plotted against the Enemies. The Duke lost in that affault by
night above 200 of his best and valiantest Souldiers, besides many Commanders,
and persons of note; and had the Governour (as some of his men thought) sent a
good body of men out of the Trenches, who might have fallen upon the Assailants
on the Flank, not any of the Dukes men might have escaped scot-free; and the
Duke himself, who was affirmed by many to be there pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ent, would have run

               </gap>anger of his person; Wherefore
the Governour was for this action also much blamed, ill spoken of, and detested
by the whole Camp. The next morning, which was <hi>Iune</hi> the 23<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, and the
34 day after the Bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>l, upon 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:53250:63"/> the Hills, peace was proclaimed, and was the very
self-same day put in execution, for as much as was then requisite; wherein the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour was fain to pass by two things also: which though small in
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet of no small consideration in point of honour: the one, that
the Dukes Souldiers, who went to throw down the abandoned Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, should
kill 200 of the Enemies Souldiers who were found sick there, the Spanish Army
being in a manner present, who were not all of them gone from their quarters;
the other, that the Governour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring his removal for that day, in respect
of the scarcity of Carriages, as also of the multitude of sick persons, and of
many other impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the French Embassadour not admitting of any excuse,
nor gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving way to any one hours delay, forced him to dislodge immediately,
protesting, and that resolutely, that otherwise he would make the Souldiers
return who were gone out of the City, and that revoking the command to the
contrary, he would permit the French to tarry and continue in the Dukes
service. Thus meerly through their fault who govern'd the Kings Forces, not
only the enterprise of <hi>Asti,</hi> but those others that proceeded had but
bad success; and not conformable to the greatness of preparation, to the
threats and imagined resentments, Thus the Governour rather inforc'd, then
willingly, and rather as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, then conquerour, went out of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> sufficiently dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed both in Forces and Reputation, who
was entred thereinto but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days before with a flourishing and gallant
Army, and glorious and triumphant for the Victory he had obtained.</p>

intent of the war, yet the Duke not being so hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled as at the beginning of
the war they firmly believed he should be, the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> thought
the King was not lightly wounded in his honour, and more then untouched in that
veneration and respect which the I alians had wont to bear him. The Spaniards
were therefore ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally much unsatisfied, that the fruit of so many threats,
and of so great preparations, should end in a peace so little advantagious for
the King, and purchased by the Governour with so little reputation, and wi h
reciprocal promises and obligations, and wherein there were not terms befitting
the Majesty of that Crown, nor suiting with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and Grandezza
thereof: They were yet more troubled that the French, who were formerly
laboured to be kept from having any thing to do with the affairs of
<hi>Italy,</hi> should upon this occasion prove to have not only maintained an
Italian Prince who had made insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the Kings Authority, but had
taken upon them to be the mediators of peace, exercising that arbitriment in
the managing and concluding thereof, which the Spanish Nation pretended did in
<hi>Italy</hi> belong only to their King: They were likewise vex'd to consider
that one sole protestation, one bare intimation of the French Embassadour,
whose King had no footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> should be of more consideration to
make the Duke accept of conditions of peace, then the authority and forces of
their King, bent with such fervency against <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and as they did
inwardly, but ill resent the Dukes total alienation, so could they hardly well
digest that such a separation should be confirmed by a tacite League, contract
d before their eyes between the Duke and the Princes who had subscribed the
Peace; amongst the which, that the Venetians did not particularly keep from
obliging themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King, was a thing which had not yet been
practised by any Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Spaniards had so deeply

against their Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

executor of such scandal, and of the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> as the Authour
thereof, was detested both in <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> Nor was it
thought by any one that the King would ever ratifie the Articles of that Peace:
All which considerations, though they were of power enough with the King and
his Council, and made them very much doubt what to do; chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Decree; but being not a little offended with the
Governour, (the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> not being able to sway against the
general sence of the Court, nor keep himself from the punishment which was
ready to fall upon him and the Governour) <hi>Don Piedro di Toledo</hi> was
chosen to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him in his place; and he was sent for into <hi>Spain;</hi>
and in demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of greater dissatisfaction <hi>Don Piedro</hi> to go with
all possible speed for <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Don Piedro</hi> had always, and upon all occasions, been very
free in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving upon publick affairs, and very zealous for the publick good,
and not depending upon any ones authority, shew'd very singular

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in what belonged to the
publick Dignity: Wherefore he had won a general opinion, that neither any
respect of the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> nor any private Interests, which
(setting aside those of the King) had much furthered the Dukes affairs, should
be able to remove him from this resolution: He was therefore thought both by
the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil to be one who would sute well with the present condition
of affairs, and such a one who might easily reduce the affairs of the Crown in
<hi>Italy</hi> to their former condition and reputation: But things being
brought to that pass, as they could not be repaired either without great
maturity of counsel, or without extraordinary valour in War, this choice
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not a convenient remedy for the malady; for when <hi>Inoiosa,</hi> in
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the agreed upon Articles, laid down Arms, and afterwards offer'd
himself to be the first who should restore what was gotten in the preceding
War, it was not agreed upon in express words, that the King was to lay down
Arms, but it was only said, that the Governour should so dispose of the Kings
Armies, as neither for state, nor time, the Duke, or any other Prince should
have reason to be jealous thereof; nor, though the Duke had commanded upon pain
of great punishments all forreign Souldiers to depart his Dominions, did they
really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; <pb n="116" facs="tcp:53250:65"/> for many French, under the name of

under the name of Swissers, by reason of the conformity in their apparel and
speech, kept concealedly there, whereof it was held t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

all were true which was pretended against the Duke) were sent by him into some
parts of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> far from the Commerce of Forreigners, and
unfrequented by them; so as the diligence of those that were sent by
<hi>Inoiosa</hi> into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont</hi> to certifie the effectual performance
of the Treaty of peace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but vain: And many of the French Commanders kept
publickly in <hi>Turin,</hi> some by reason of sickness, some for their own
affairs, and others under colour of being the Dukes particular servants. And
yet <hi>Inoiosa</hi> being desirous that the peace made by him might be
perfected, and to le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

little as he could in the power of his successour, when he heard w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>at relation his Spies brought back, he
without any more ado dismiss'd his Swissers, and the Regiments of the Italian
Princes, and reforming the Spanish Companies and Lombards, which were much
diminished, he cashiered likewise many Captains and Officers, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>educed his men to a much lesser
number; and not to come short of the Duke in his forwardness of restoring such
places as were taken, he gave order to the Governour of <hi>Oneglia</hi> that
he should be ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the first notice given to quit the Town; who therefore
began to send away some Artillery and Ammunition. But the face of affairs
alter'd at the coming of his Successour, whereof as soon as <hi>Inoiosa</hi>
had notice, he went from <hi>Millain,</hi> and not tarrying to see his
successour, he went with two Gallies into <hi>Spain,</hi> richer in moneys
which he had gotten in his Government, and by the War, then in any glory he had
gotten in the last actions: whereof to excuse himself he gave out that he
carried with him particular orders which he had received from <hi>Spain,</hi>
(meaning those of the Duke of <hi>Lerma)</hi> and the opinions of many of the
Council of War in <hi>Millain,</hi> according to which he professed he had
govern'd himself upon all occurrences. When he came to <hi>Spain,</hi> he was
by order from the King confined in <hi>Alcala;</hi> where his cause being tried
by Justice, and the Judges who were deputed by the King to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine his actions
not agreeing in their sentence, he at last, after some moneths space, was
admitted to see the King, and was acquitted of all imputations. It was thought
by many, that the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>'s favour stood him in much stead, who
besmeared himself sufficiently in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing his liberty, for the doubt
conceived, lest by his depression, who was a creature of his, his own
reputation might be concerned; especially for that he doubted lest many of his
rivals might use all their indeavours to have him condemned, rather out of a
desire to lessen his the Dukes authority and grandezza, then to see the guilty
person pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished for his misdemeanors: but though his Grandezza, till now
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, did also in these affairs surpass his corrivals; yet envy
increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon these occasions, and the gate to murmure being opened, he
began from this time to decline, and fell afterwards totally. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> what remained, though he in words profest the observance of the
treaty of peace, yet there appeared many signs which shewed he was otherwise
minded; for being naturally zealous of the Kings dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he, even with
injurious words detested the actions of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour; of whom having
received ill impressions, he in his actions and countenance appeared every day
to be more and more offended, and broke often out into spiteful speeches
against the Duke, even to the telling him he would in a short time reduce him
to nothing: and that he was very certain that the Kings affairs, especially for
what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd him the Duke, should be otherwise handled under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
then they had been. It was also observed that as he sailed above the City of
<hi>Nice,</hi> when he passed from <hi>Antibo</hi> to <hi>Finale,</hi> he
shewed no friendly intention, not resaluting that Fort with shot according to
cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom: being moreover visited by the said Duke by way of Embassie, as

               </gap>an Princes are wont to visit
new Governours, he did not answer with equal civility, till delay had made it
unseasonable; and being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd by the Duke to have all places restored, as
soon as he should have laid down Arms; he answered that the Duke ought first to
do all that he was obliged by agreement to do, before he should pretend to the
observancy of any thing agreed upon. He moreover rejected <hi>Claudio
Marini,</hi> who in the King of <hi>France</hi> his name desired him to disarm;
telling him, that he was no legitimate person for that King: so as the Duke and
all <hi>Italy</hi> were not a little doubtful of his intentions; which for what
he afterwards manifested, was not to break the peace at first, nor yet to keep
his Army idle; for he was by the King forbid to do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their of these; but, were
it either for the greater preservation of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in disarming he would seem
to do it of his own good will, and not as being bound so to do, or at the
request of any other, or that he had really any such injunction from
<hi>Spain,</hi> or that he was moved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

private glory, he delay'd the execution of the agreement; not without hope, as
appeared af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, so to better the Kings conditions. It was notwithstanding
believed that he had a mind to bring the Duke to lay aside the Articles of
<hi>Asti,</hi> and to humble himself of his own accord unto the King, into
whose hands if he would totally put himself he should be rece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

anticipately: but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions begun at the same time in other parts of
<hi>Italy,</hi> between the Emperour, and the Archduke of <hi>Grats,</hi> in
one part, and by the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians in another, afforded him more reason of
justifying his designs; For the Kings Agent, holding for certain that the
Commonwealth had made War upon those Princes, out of a desire to bereave the
house of <hi>Austria</hi> of many Towns which it possesseth in <hi>Friuli,</hi>
and of the Havens of <hi>Istria</hi> and <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> they thought
themselves bound to maintain them, not only for that the Arckduke was brother
to their Queen, and of the Kings family, but for that by their possession of
those Havens they did for ever shut up the entrance from any German succours,
which upon occasion might be sent into the Kingdom of <hi>Naples.</hi>

the Kings affairs, that they his Ministers should be unarmed, idly expecting
the event of those differences wherein the King was so much concerned: the
Governour adding this no less just (as he termed it) then necessary reason to
the rest, and therewithall refusing the Dukes demands, alledged that such
accidents had hapned as forced him to keep more strongly armed; nor that there
could be any pretence made, but that the King might lawfully re-arm upon new
occasions, though he had been bound by those Capitulations to disarm.</p>

hoped that by making the Duke despair of reaping his pretended fruit by those
Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whereby he might boast that he had once been able to make the

resolutions: This the Governours hope was likewise confirmed by the occ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of the two Crowns which was contrary to his ends, which he had already
endeavoured, and had disbursed moneys largely to such as having a hand in the
business might trouble those Marriages; so as being still able to do so, their
Majesties had little reason to look upon his Affairs with a favourable eye: The

Reasons for not disarming, effectually repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in that Court by Don

and consequently the opposition of that Crown being taken away, he was sure
that the Duke, being desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of such a leaning stock, and his Forces being
consequently lessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might be put upon great necessities, and that
submitting himself to the Kings pleasure, he would agree to any thing, without
talking any longer of <hi>Asti,</hi> or of the Capitulations made there. The
Duke then understanding at last, that the Governour desired one might be sent
unto him, with whom he might treat touching the Common oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences, gave order
to Count <hi>Iohn Battista Soleri,</hi> who upon other occasions was destined
Embassadour to <hi>Venice,</hi> that pssiang by <hi>Millain</hi> he should hear
what should be said unto him about that business; and he sent the Senator
<hi>Lodovico Zoello</hi> along with the said Count, to the end that the Count
passing on to <hi>Venice, Zoello</hi> might bring him the Compendium of the
business: These being gone to <hi>Millain,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour propounded
Propositions to them, not only very satisfactory for the Duke, but made also
many promises of advancing the Duke

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:53250:67"/> of the said Capitulations, if the Duke should tenaciously
stick there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; they were therefore desired to exhort the Duke to write unto
the King in conformity to what he had proposed; but the Duke being fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
of any Spanish hopes would not give way to the Governours allurements,
esteeming them so many baits to make him fall unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily from that Glory which
through so much trouble and danger he had atchieved; to the end that throwing
himself dishonourably into the Kings Arms, and indiscreetly estranging himself
from the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and protection of those Princes who had subscribed the
Peace, he might the more easily be brought into his former condition by the
Kings Ministers of State, with little hope that the same Princes should resent
his injuries another time, if upon this occasion he should so sleightly have
foregone their favour and Authority: Resolving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to undergo whatsoever
misfortune, rather than to do what he would not consent unto whilst he had the
Enemies Army upon his hands, he absolutely denied to forego the Capitulations,
or to make any submission; but pretending that the King was bound by the
Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to disarm, he said it was the Embassadours intentions who made them
that he should do so, though, for his Majesties greater honour it was expressed
with more circumspection; and notwithstanding, being desirous that he might not
thereby receive any prejudice in compassing his chief end, which was, that that
Army might be disarmed, he was content to write a Letter, wherein <hi>not
saying any thing which was not worthy of himself, as a free and independent
Prince, and without parting from the Capitulations at</hi> Asti, <hi>he with
great respect excused himself for what had happened; and laying the fault upon
the late Governour, he added, that by this means he hoped he should keep
himself in his Majesties former favour, desiring him to preserve him therein in
the same degree which he and his children out of so many relations pretend
unto:</hi> This he sent to the Governour by <hi>Zoello,</hi> with a flying
Seal, with order that he should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it him when he should engage himself
by express word, that he would dismiss himself within a certain prefixt time:
But this Letter was neither received by the Governour, nor sent into
<hi>Spain;</hi> for it did not please him, who desired it might have been
written more humbly, and so as that it might have prejudicated the
Capitulations; or else thinking that the Duke by that Letter might get a
promise of effectual disarming, he did not think the prize equivalent to the
demande, nor the bargain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ble to the condition of the present times; therefore shewing the
Duke the necessity he had to keep his men in Arms, by reason of the war in
<hi>Friuli,</hi> and offering to restore the places that were taken, and giving
him his word in the Kings Name that he would not offend him, he kept from
disarming: He added also, that the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> would not listen to
the pardoning of Rebels; and, as if the King of <hi>France</hi> had done more
than he had power to do, in promising that without his consent, he seemed to be
prejudiced in the rights of his Principality; so as having sent the Marquess
Don <hi>Iohn Gonzaga</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that that point
might be left to his free will, that King professing, that he though himself
not bound by the Articles of that Peace to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and that he would not, nor

Jurisdiction in that State which he had obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged <pb n="121" facs="tcp:53250:67"/> himself
to protect: And therefore the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> being therein encouraged
by the new Governour, to whom he was near al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied; and being moreover desirous
that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> might reap no good by this peace, he did not
only constantly deny the pardoning of Rebels, which he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e remainder of Count
<hi>Guido</hi>'s goods, and confiscating those of the rest who he pretended to
be Rebels, he also put some of his Subjects to death, for having served the
contrary party in that War.</p>
            <p>But the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who could not be satisfied neither
by the Kings word, nor by the restitution of places taken, which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
offer'd him, without the effectual difarming of the Kings Army; seeing that no
good was yet got by the peace of <hi>Asti,</hi> but some vain promises, by
which he had suffer'd himself to be perswaded to lay down Arms, and to consent
to other of the Kings demands; having now lost all hopes of obtaining his
intent of the Governour, as if he had run the danger of being again assaulted
by the Spanish Army, and being inforced to send some Souldiers and Ammunition
to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> that he might thereby move the Princes
who were bound to observe the Capitulations; to which betaking himself, he did
not a little exclaim against the not observance of what was agreed upon under
their Authority, and replying to the Governours oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and difficulties,
he complain'd that all this proceeded only from his not submitting himself
unworthily to the King, and by renouncing the Articles covenanted, from not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>erding himself from their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and from his not undervaluing their Authority and Dignity, who were the
Arbitrators and Moderators thereof; and putting all men in mind, but
particularly the French, how prejudicial it would be to their King, and to the
honour of <hi>France,</hi> that the Regal Name and Authority should be
cancell'd from the Conventions of peace, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd by all means to make
them to get them to be maintain'd and made good, promising that for his part he
would refuse no pains, would not forbear for any expence, would not be afraid
for any loss or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but would adventure his own person, his sons, and his
State, and whatsoever he held dear in this world; that the glory of that King
and Nation, in having preserved his State unto him, and in the Kings ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
interposed himself as an Arbitratour in compounding the affairs of
<hi>Italy,</hi> should not be turned into as much shame and dishonour,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hy not being able to maintain
them; but though he could promise himself but little from the King of
<hi>England,</hi> by reason of the far distance of his Country, or of the King
of <hi>France,</hi> for the aforesaid reasons, yet had he a new occasion to
hope well in the favour of the Venetians, who, being entred (as hath been said)
into a new War with the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> were necessitated for their
own Interests to assist him, so to secure themselves from the Spanish Forces,
whilst they were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by him the Duke, and diverted from their
Dominions confining upon the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> And since this War
began just at that time, and had much connexion with that of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and because it hapned in <hi>Italy,</hi> it is proper to our present History,
and it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that taking it from its original, it be described by
us equally with that of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and distinctly related.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:53250:68"/> The Venetian for some hundreds of years
since pretend to the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of the Adriatick Sea, now called the <hi>Gulf
of Venice,</hi> and have long maintain'd it more by the authority of a powerful
Fleet, then by any ground of ancient concession or just title; by virtue
whereof inhibiting many neighbouring people the freedom of Navigation, they do
not suffer them to transport their Merchandize freely through that Sea into
forreign parts, nor that any such be brought from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign parts to their
Havens and Shore: And as it makes much for the advantage and grandezza of that
Commonwealth, that the Inhabitants of the Gulf, and Forreigners who sail
through it do not only put in at <hi>Venice,</hi> and pay a great tribute to
the Commonwealth, and that the said Inhabitants provide themselves with things
necessary from that City; so on the contrary, it redounds to the prejudice of
the same peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, not to be able to make use of their own Sea without paying
Taxes, nor carry that wherein their Country abounds through it to other parts,
nor furnish themselves with necessaries from elsewhere; for the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are
wont to send forth some Gallies to guard that Gulf, and do not only seize on
such Vessels as sail for other parts, contrary to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition, but
confiscate the Merchandize, and strangely molest the Masters and Passengers.
The neighbouring people and Princes did always gainsay these pretensions,
complaining that the use of the Sea, which by the Law of Nations was free to
all men, was interdicted them by this Commonwealth; and how that she used more
respect to those that were more powerful: But those of <hi>Trieste</hi> did
always repugne, and those of ancient <hi>Liburnia</hi> were more contumacious
then they, who are now called Sclavonians, who, as being members of the Kingdom
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> are under the Archduke of <hi>Austria,</hi> and they have
always questioned it, and debated it with the Venetians, not without the tacite
knowledge of their Princes, who being busied in more weighty Wars with the
Turks, and not-being able either by forces, or by endeavours to alter the
Commonwealth, thought it at last to be their only remedy for that sore, to
bring into those parts some of the people of <hi>Croatia,</hi> who were
commonly called afterwards Uscocchi, Croates or Cravates, a fierce and
couragious people, and who valued not life; who being there as a thorn in the
eyes of the Commonwealth, might to the best of their power make good the
liberty of Navigation upon those Seas to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e Archdukes Subjects. To these, instead of stipend, Pyracy was at
first permitted, but only against the Turks, as common Enemies, and F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es to their Prince; abusing which
permission against the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans Vessels, or being willing to treat them alike
(for the Venetians per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted them) they afforded the Commonwealth reason of
complaint; which not prevailing, they resented the injury so far, as they
resolved to extermine that whole Nation; professing that so to do, was not
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary for freeing the Gulf from Pyrates, but also, as they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
to provide that the Turk being irritated by the Uscocchi's or Croa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es's injuries might not send powerful
Fleets into the Gulf, not only to the danger of their Dominions, but to those
of other Princes which they possess upon those Seas: Thus making their own
cause com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, the Commonwealth began of her self alone to provide
against it; and endeavouring more to remove the effect, then the cause 
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:53250:68"/> of the malady, they went against them, and began to
prosecute them as Pyrates and publick Robbers; who being already much increased
in number (for many driven thither by the barrenness of their Countrey, and
allured by the profit of pillage, and many banish'd vagabond Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and
particularly such as were Subjects to the Venetians, flock thither as to lawful
prey of great gain) and growing much more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful by their numbers, and more
cruel by reason of the losses they had suffer'd by being persecuted by the
Commonwealth, they were very cruel in their Piracy throughout that whole Sea,
and in all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Havens and Islands; and coming sometimes even to
within a few miles of <hi>Venice</hi> her self, they took Vessels even almost
in her sight; insomuch as they grew so terrible to Navigators, and so dreadful
through their cruelty, as the Commonwealth, without the Archdukes trouble or
expence, began to make trial of those sufferings which she had formerly
indeavoured to make the neighbouring people undergo; and as they could hardly
suppress their insultings with the Venetian greater Vessels, the yareness and
multitude of Boats wherewith they scoured up and down in several parts being
considered; as also the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of their friends Country, whither they fled
when chas'd by the Venetian Vessels, and the condition of the Sclavonian seas
and shores, which being full of Rocks and narrow Channels made by the many
lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Islands and Flats, are scarcely navigable for greater Vessels; so did
the agreements and stipulations often made between the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth and the
Archduke stand them but in little stead; for though the one promis'd to keep in
the <hi>Cravates;</hi> and the other to leave the sea open and free, neither
party being willing to prejudice the main of their pretentions; they inserted
some clause or other in the close of each convention, whereby leaving the
controverted point touching the liberty of the Gulf undecided; ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ther the difference between those
Princes was composed, nor yet were the promises made, and agreed upon between
them kept; the point of freedom of Navigation put off to another time, and the
permission of free Commerce at sea, as it had been formerly had, being
incompatible: which incompatibility occasioned the one the mean while to
pretend unto, and the other to prohibit the freebooting of the
<hi>Uscocchi</hi> or <hi>Cravates:</hi> they being long accustomed to pillage,
and urged by poverty, and necessity to live from hand to mouth, which they were
not able to do but by rapine, the Covenants agreed upon must needs be broken,
and the Gulf must necessarily remain subject to the former molestations. The
Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth finding no more ready nor opportune remedy, began to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that to extirpate the evil, as they said, by the roots, that whole Nation
should be removed from the Maritime parts. But this meeting with many
difficulties, at last in the year 1612. an agreement was come unto, almost of
the same contents, and with the same clause of reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation as before, between
the Emperour <hi>Mathias,</hi> to whom the places inhabited by the
<hi>Croats</hi> belonged, and the Archduke <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> to whom the
Emperour his Cosin-german gave the Government thereof, he being the next
neighbour Prince to that Country, on the one pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t, and the Commonwealth on the other; which that it did
not long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s it ought to
have done, the Venetians according to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:53250:69"/> upon
the <hi>Uscocchi</hi> or <hi>Cravates</hi> ravenousness, and upon the Archdukes
dissimulation, and that of their Officers, who were well enough pleased to see
the Commonwealth continually molested on that side. But they complain more
particularly that a Galley of theirs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken by the <hi>Uscocchi</hi> or
<hi>Croates,</hi> after that agreement, whilst it lay in one of the Havens of
<hi>Sclavonia,</hi> it was carried to <hi>Segna,</hi> a Town be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the
Emperour, and that the Galley-slaves being there set at liberty all the rest
were slain, and barbarous cruelty was used upon the de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d Corps of <hi>Veniero</hi> the Master of the Galley;
the Archduke not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting so abominable an excess committed not against
private men or Vessels; but against the publick Barques and Officers. The
Austriant, on the other side, laying fault upon the prohibition of Navigation
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually pretended to by the Venetians, and stifly maintained contrary to
the Capitulations, gave their Reasons for the fact which they had committed,
and which they did not deny: affirming that some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences being known
between people that were under the Turkes, and under the Venetians upon the
Confines of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth did resolve not to meddle
therein openly, but thought it better to make use of the <hi>Uscocchi</hi> or
<hi>Cravates,</hi> naturally enemies to the Turks; and that privately
furnishing them with moneys, they egg'd them on underhand against the Turks,
not so much within land, as upon the sea shore.</p>
            <p>But when not only the complaint of this fact came to the Court at
<hi>Constantinople,</hi> but also the Commonwealths underhand dealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
the Commonwealth could find no better means to free her self thereof, then by
coming to some sudden severe demonstration; and that therefore some of the
<hi>Croats</hi> Barques being gone by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary of <hi>Dalmatia</hi>'s
express license to sack <hi>Popono</hi> and <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

returned home with their prey, they were unexpectedly fallen upon by some of
the Venetian Souldiery in the Island of <hi>Liesina</hi> where they had touch'd
in their passage, after they had eaten friendly with them in company, that
leaving there great part of their prey, and 200 of their men slam in the
scuffle, the rest escaped away by flight, and returned home, who did so move
the kindred and friends of those that were slain, and generally the whole
Nation, as hasting to their Barques, they went to resent the injury: and that
lighting by chance upon that Gally, they took her, and there vented the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Commissaries sent to <hi>Segna,</hi> to see justice done; but that
understanding the truth of the fact, and no body appearing on the Commonwealths
behalf to make complaint, they proceeded no further: but howsoever the matter
went, the breach was occasioned upon this occasion; For the Commonwealth being
more mindful of revenge then of complaining, as if all their Articles and Law
had been violated, they began presently to forbid Commerce by Navigation to all
the Archdukes Subjects; and placing many armed Boats in the Gulfe of

of Intelligence they assaulted the Fort of <hi>Carlobago;</hi> but meeting with
greater resistance, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd with the loss of 200 Souldiers, and
their Captain: the People and Officers on both sides being hereby more
incensed, they began inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changably to disturb each others Confines, rather by

coming to an open breach; making inroads, firing Houses, and destroying the
Countries; and some towards the Law began to publish defamatory Edicts, and to

of above 600 of them, and of their General <hi>Mario Gallo da Ossimo:</hi> and
the Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and rest who were in the scuffle, had much ado to save
themselves, by getting into the Galley, under the shelter of the Artillery
which was shot from thence. After which Victory, the Vice-general, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
some of the Souldiers, and of the <hi>Uscocchi,</hi> to over-run
<hi>Istria,</hi> where they did much mischief, he himself with some of his men
entred the Territory of <hi>Montfalcone,</hi> and destroyed all things by fire
and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine: but the Commonwealth, whom the successes of <hi>Piedmont</hi> had
peradventure made apprehend the Spanish Forces less, in respect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they
had for born to come to an open breach with the Archdukes, and had therefore
still formerly been contented to suffer and to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize, resolved now to do
so no longer, but to shew their resentment by open war. A resolution which
though as it was publickly said, the gravest and wisest Senators were far from;
who foreseeing the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, would not have willingly seen the
Commonwealth imbroil her self in that war; yet the heat of the younger sort
prevailing, which was fomented by one more ancient Senator, who to win favour
from the meaner Citizens adhered to the more general Vote; the greater opinion
overcame the better, as it sometimes happens amongst multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes; and though
the Towns and places, from whence the <hi>Uscocchi</hi> came to pillage,
belonged (as hath been said) to the Emperour, and above a hundred miles from
<hi>Friuli,</hi> yet because they were govern'd by <pb n="126" facs="tcp:53250:70"/> the
Archduke <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and that the said <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was bound
for the behaviour of the <hi>Uscocchi,</hi> the Venetians complain'd that he
winked at their Piracy, or atleast did not inhibit them, nor punish them for
it; and would not only assault, and make war upon that Country from whence
their prejudice came, but also upon that part of <hi>Friuli</hi> which belonged
unto the Archduke: thinking that the only way to provide a salve for this sore,
was to molest the patrimonial Territories of that Prince. They therefore
ordered <hi>Pompeo Giustiniano</hi> to goe into <hi>Friull</hi> with six
companies of paid Foot, which were destined for <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia;</hi> and he
carried thither also many other Souldiers, most of them of the meaner sort of
those parts; and making the rendezvouz at <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Udine,</hi>
he commanded them to go against the Archdukes Country: <hi>Francisco
Erizzo</hi> govern'd <hi>Palma,</hi> and the Militia of that Province, but
<hi>Giustiniano</hi> was to govern the war. Having assembled together about
1200 Horse, and some seven or eight thousand Foot, he at unawares entred
<hi>Friuli,</hi> and possessing himself at the very first of many of the open
Towns, he also took and fortified <hi>Medea, Meriano, Chiopris, Romanso,
Cormonso,</hi> and <hi>Vilesso,</hi> the chiefest Towns belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the
Archduke, and distributed his men therein: At the same time the Territory of
<hi>Monfalcone</hi> took up Arms, and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths Souldiers took
<hi>Sagra,</hi> one of the Archdukes Castles on the other side of the River,
over against <hi>Gradisca,</hi> and munited it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Country from the
troubles it might receive from <hi>Gradisca.</hi> The War being thus begun
against the Archduke, and footing being got in the Archdukes Country, the
Captains in the Camp, and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators in <hi>Venice,</hi> began to aspire
unto greater things. The two chief Towns, and of most consideration, were
<hi>Goritia</hi> and <hi>Gradisea;</hi> the former, which is as it were the
Metropolis of the Archdukes Country on this side of the Mountains, is situated
beyond <hi>LIsonzo,</hi> at the foot of the Alpes, which was by the Antients
called <hi>Giulie,</hi> very strongly situated, and defended by a Castle hard
to become at: The other lies lower towards <hi>Palma</hi> and <hi>Udine,</hi>
upon the right hand of the <hi>Lisonzo;</hi> which washing the walls thereof on
the East side, serves it for a Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, and it is secured on the other three
sides by large and deep ditches; The passage over the River made against the
expugning of the former, as also the danger that the Souldiery being too far
entred into the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Country they might be molested, and peradventure much
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, if <hi>Gradisca</hi> should remain behind them on their backs in
the enemies hands; and the expugning of the other was withstood by her Fort,
and by her being easily relieved by the succour which might ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

               </gap>ally the Archdukes men being incamped, as they were, on
the left shore. Between these two lay the third less difficult en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>erprise of <hi>Lucino,</hi> a great
Town on this side of <hi>Lisonzo,</hi> in the mid'st between <hi>Goritia</hi>
and <hi>Gradisca,</hi> near the stone-Bridge which leads to <hi>Goritia;</hi>
neither so strong, nor so easily to be succour'd as <hi>Gradisca,</hi> as lying
somewhat farther from the River, and not so far within the Archdukes Country,
as <hi>Goritia.</hi> Commissary <hi>Erizzo</hi> resolved therefore to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
it, and sent <hi>Giustiniano</hi> thither with some men, who took it, and
sack'd it, meeting with no resistance, and quit it the same day, as not 
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:53250:70"/> thinking it a safe place to

               </gap>arry in; but nothing was so great
a hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to the Venetians, nor did so much detain their resolutions, as
the want of experience, discipline and valour, in their men; the greater part
whereof being unorderly, who being by force taken by the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates from
their houses and imployments, kept the Campagnia un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly, and did
unwillingly serve in those exercises whereunto they were not bred up nor
accustomed, nor led unto by their genius: So as their Captains not being able
to rely upon them, they were not only kept from attempting new enterprises, but
from bringing them into the field, or imploying them in any Action.</p>
            <p>The whole Arch-Dukes Country being therefore by reason of these
Commotions up in arms, and <hi>Adamo,</hi> Baron of <hi>Trautmistorfe,</hi>
being sent from <hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Friuly,</hi> who was General of
<hi>Croatia,</hi> and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Emperours Guard, and who though but
young, yet of try'd valour, was made the chief in this war by the Arch-Duke,
with Title of Captain-General: He had also brought along with him between two
and three thousand Veteran Souldiers, long trained up in the wars in
<hi>Hungary;</hi> and Garisonizing such places as were fittest to hinder the
enemies progress, he often-times scoured the Campagnia, assaulting to some
purpose the Venetians Stations, and men, who not being able to stand before the
Dutch, were sometimes shrewdly beaten: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Common-wealths Commanders
were forc'd to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within their Works till they were furnished
with better Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; True it is, that <hi>Daniel Francol,</hi> coming out of
<hi>Gradisca</hi> with some few Horse, was taken in an Ambush that was laid for
him, and with some 30 of his men was slain by some Troops of the
<hi>Albanesses;</hi> and <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando Scotto,</hi> who had the custody of
the County of <hi>Monfalcone</hi> rout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some of the Archdukes forces who were
come to plunder and infest that Country, and made them retreat into
<hi>Goritia:</hi> But the Common-wealth, which entered into this war with more
servour then preparation, began to meet with many great difficulties; for
having in all former times made use of paid-men in their Militia, as being more
useful and less suspitious to that Government, they had made less esteem of
their natural subjects; and according to the condition of those ages, when the
Militia of <hi>Italy</hi> served any Prince under famous Commanders, she, as
being richer, and abounding more in monies then any other Prince, had better
conveniency of furnishing her self with the valiantest Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ers, and most experienced Commanders;
by whose means and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour she made notable atchievements, and signal progress
on <hi>Terra fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma;</hi> augmenting her State, and bringing it to that
Grandezza which now she injoys: But now the condition of times being changed,
the Italian Militia being reduced under the command of their natural Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and Forreigners depending in a great part upon the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and
House of <hi>Austria,</hi> the Common-wealth found her self to be at the same
time deprived of her natural forces, and totally unfurnished of Forreigners:
Wherefore indeavouring to get Souldiers and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, she found not so much
difficulty in getting them from amongst Italian Princes, from the Switzers and
Grisons, as to get passage for those that came to serve her out of
<hi>France</hi> and the Low-Countries; the former not being willing to
disfurnish themselves of <pb n="128" facs="tcp:53250:71"/> their best Souldiers in so
turbulent times; and the others being loth to deprive themselves of the
Commerce of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

this not being sufficient to serve their needs) they betook themselves to

thence, at great rates, as many men as possibly they could: And for their last
refuge, these not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, they were at a very great charge in taking a
Regiment of 4000 Hollanders into pay, who were to be brought by shipping to
<hi>Venice;</hi> which provisions being couragiously ordered, and executed with
no less expence, and even to the end of that war constantly, and by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
consent increased; though they witnessed the unanimity of their minds, and the
readiness of that Government to uphold the publick dignity and enterprises
resolved upon by publick Authority; yet so great a scarcity of Souldiers did
not only prejudice the conceived re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Venetian power, being so
necessitated at the beginning of the war to borrow mony of Forreigners; and not
finding much that way, to ingage her self to her own Citizens, in little more
then one year, for above a Million of monies, did not a little lessen the
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which was commonly held of their publick Treasure, which was held to
be the richest of all Italian Princes; though to preserve their credit they
gave out that they would rather spare the publick monies, even at the greatest
need, and at the present take up at interest from private men, then by wasting
it when they might make use of other mens monies, be forced afterwards to
depend upon the will of others; which though it was not then believed, was
afterwards proved to be true by the event; For the Common-wealth having had
many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of vast expences in this war, yet she, contrary to the opinion
of all men, found means to supply all the necessities which came upon her, with
the publick monies; wherein she was never found to withdraw from not only what
was necessary, but from what was useful or fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for any whatsoever
difficulties, or want of ready monies; and it was affirmed by those who were
well experienced in their affairs, that the Common-wealth upon this occasion
spent above 14 Millions of Duckets: True it is, that their Taxes and
Impositions were very great throughout the whole State, which grew thereby much
indebted; and that all that not sufficing the whirepool of war, they ran her in
debt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for more then eight Millions.</p>
            <p>These were the preparations for the war of <hi>Friuli;</hi> but
not being able otherwise to provide against the danger of the Spanish forces
upon the confines of <hi>Millain,</hi> they did it by making a

many provisions which they furnished them withal, they lent him great sums of
mony; to the end that persisting still in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of not laying down

they might keep him so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, as he should not be well able to assault

noised abroad that <hi>Castiglions</hi> French men were raised to assist the
Venetians, not the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> And though these provisions, by
reason of delay, could not ease the present need of <pb n="130" facs="tcp:53250:72"/> the
Camp; for it was said that powerful aids were preparing in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> by
the <hi>Germane</hi> Princes, to assist the Archduke; yet the Common-wealths
Army being somewhat increased, the Senate, that it might not lye idle, but that
it might attempt somewhat worthy of the Forces and honour of <hi>Venice,</hi>
ordered it to go and expugne <hi>Gradisca.</hi> This place was governed by
Count <hi>Richard Strasoldo,</hi> and by him fortified; and though Captain
<hi>Iohn Peirino,</hi> a Walloon, was entered thereinto with 300 Curassiers and
Dragoons; as soon as the enemy drew near it, General <hi>Trautmistorft</hi>

Souldiers and Citizens with promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of daily succour, he left
<hi>Peirino</hi> there, in whose valour he did much confide; and went out
himself with the Curassiers that he had brought with him, to make use of them
in the Campagnia, and to imploy them where it was necessary elsewhere.</p>
            <p>The Common-wealths Commanders went to the taking in of

therefore bringing much earth thither in Carts, they sate down before it; and
having raised some Banks they planted the Battery on four sides with 24 p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the which they sent many Pyoneers thither, who whilst they indeavoured to
perfect the work with their Spaces and Pick-axes, (for they met with Quarries
of stone) the defendants were not idle, but shot continually into the Camp,
whereby they did much mischief; ran to and fro, and made diligent reparations

resolved to fall upon them by night within their own works: Issuing therefore
out a little before day, and finding the Souldiers lye disorderly asleep in the

into great disorder, and returned to <hi>Gradisca</hi> loaded with prey, having

of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <pb n="131" facs="tcp:53250:72"/> Musket, some of them ran away, and
return'd into the Camp, some threw themselves upon the ground; nor was it
possible for the Souldiers to make them rally for any threats, or blows which
they could give them; and such was the consternation of their mind, as many
chose rather to dye basely by the hands of their own Serjeants and Captains,
whilst they endeavoured to make them advance, then to hazzard the uncertain
danger of an honourable death; nay it was said that many of them dyed out of
meer fear: It was impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the assault; for none of the Souldiers
durst advance; and the first ranks or files were so shun'd, as whereas in other
places upon occasion of bickerings or assaults, they are much endeavoured by
the valiantest Souldiers, and not obtain'd without much favour, none could be
hired to do so here. This mean while the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> and
the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> out of their alliance to the Archduke, and of the
trust which the Commonwealth imposed in them, had begun some Treaty of Peace,
not without the Emperours consent; who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to see these differences
composed in a friendly manner, was not displeased with the interposing of these
Princes: But the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> having received express Orders
from <hi>Spain</hi> to assist the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke, sent <hi>Don Sanchio di Luna,</hi>
Keeper of the Cittadel of <hi>Millain,</hi> with many Souldiers and Artillery
to the Confines of <hi>Bergamo</hi> and <hi>Crema;</hi> wherefore the
Commonwealth fearing what might ensue thereupon, admitted the Governour into
the Treaty of Peace, who having to this purpose sent <hi>Don Andrea
Manriques</hi> to <hi>Venice,</hi> demanded in the Kings Name that they should
desist from oppugning <hi>Gradisca;</hi> and they find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily more
difficulty in the Enterprise, by reason of the continual succour which could
not be kept from thence, willingly honested the occasion of the necessity they
saw they were in, of either desisting with little honour, or of continuing the
Enterprize with little hopes, and less advantage, by the present colour of
complying with the Kings desires: So the Army rise from before
<hi>Gradisca</hi> on the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day after they had sat down before it, and
retreated to their former Quarters of <hi>Cormors, Meriana,</hi> and
<hi>Medea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The endeavours of agreement were afterwards re-assumed, and
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers proposals made, not only in <hi>Venice</hi> by the Popes Nuntio and the
Agents of other Ministers, but also in the Emperours Court between Cardinal
<hi>Clesell, Cesars</hi> chief Agent, and <hi>Giorgio Iustiniano</hi> the
Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Embassadour, but all to no purpose; for all agreeing in the
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal point of providing for the business of the Uscocchi, they disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
in the manner how. The Archduke, who thought himself un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justly assaulted by the
Venetians, would not listen to any thing before he was first put into
possession of all that had been taken from him: The Commonwealth on the
contrary would not give way to any restitution till the Uscocchi were driven
out of the Gulf, wherein they insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more then they had done at first,
demanding not only the expulsion of their Chieftains alone, as they had done at
the beginning of the War, but (that they might dig up the mischief by the
roots, as they termed it) the total extirpating of that Nation, and of the
other ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd men who were joyned with them; and they persisted so much
thereupon, as they did not only refuse the resigning of the Towns 
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:53250:73"/> which they had taken, as was proposed by the Pope,
together with a suspension of Arms till such time as the business of the
Croates should be agreed upon to their satisfaction; but neither would they
accept of the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>'s word, given them in the Kings
name, and the security offer'd them by the Pope, that they should be satisfied
in that point, as soon as what had been taken should be restored; and the
provision therein was such, as not only the Chieftains, but those that were
expelled the Commonwealth should be driven out. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians alledged for
their obdurancy herein, that the Commonwealth had been several times fed with
such words and promises to no purpose; which being but badly performed
afterwards, they seemed to have just occasion to persist stifly in keeping what
they had got, as a pledge or pawn at least of the total extirpation of the
Pirates, by them pretended unto: which demands the Austrians thought very
unreasonable, who argued by this their so great tenacity that they aimed more
at being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of what belonged to others, then at the purging their Gulf of
Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. The war continued therefore in <hi>Friuli,</hi> with greater forces,
and preparations, but with but small progress made by the Venetians: much
succour came to the Archduke from <hi>Germany,</hi> part at his own charges,
part at the Emperours; and several valiant and well experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced Commanders
were sent him from other Princes: as Count <hi>d' Ampierre,</hi> the
Commandatore <hi>Coloredo,</hi> the Baron of <hi>Lelile,</hi> and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Standardi,</hi> amongst others there came 4000 Foot and 500 Horse, all
select men raised at the King of <hi>Spains</hi> cost, and sent into

               </gap>e Lord, and vigilant in
publick affairs; and to whom the King committed all the charge and provision of
succour which he contributed to the Archdukes service. General
<hi>Trautmistorft</hi> not thinking it now any longer time only to make
excursions, but to keep the Field and face the Enemy, past over
<hi>Lisonso</hi> with his Army, took up his quarters under <hi>Luciniso,</hi>
intending to fall upon the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians quarters; whose valour he so little
valued, as he cared not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie himself: The Venetian Commanders had
notice of the weakness of his Works, and of the Enemies negligence in
fortifying themselves: and thinking it a fit occasion to prevent being
offended, they resolved to assault them unexpectedly by night. The Venetians
Camp was no less re-inforced then the Archdukes, with Souldiers raised in
<hi>Terra fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, Sclavonia, Albania</hi> and <hi>Greece:</hi> and having
alter'd their Officers, they had made a new form of Government: in stead of
<hi>Barbarico,</hi> three Commissaries were sent to the Camp from <hi>Venice:
Antonio Pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

were resolved upon by the Votes of two: the Council of War being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

assisted the three <pb n="133" facs="tcp:53250:73"/> Commissaries with their advice, and
gave their opinions, but had no Votes: the execution of what was resolved upon
belong'd to <hi>Iustini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ano,</hi> as Camp-master, which he ordered under the
Commissary-General, guided the Directions, and directed the intended
Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises.</p>
            <p>The enemy being then to be assaulted within his Quarters,
according to the resolution already taken, <hi>Iustiniano</hi> disposed of the
Army into several Squadrons; the first assault fell to <hi>Trivigiano</hi>'s
share with his Albanesse, and to <hi>Horatio Baglioni</hi> with his Brigade and
some Corsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; the former on the west-side where the Hills ended; and the
others on the south-side towards the Campagnia. <hi>Trivigiano</hi> took some
works far from the enemies Quarters, kill'd the defendants, and past no
further; but <hi>Baglione</hi> at the same time, which was day-break, forcing
the first Port of the Rampiers, and having seiz'd on the Court, found a stiff
dispute at the second; for the Austrians, awakened at the noise, ran in to the
defence; and had not some Corsicks come to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, he had undoubtedly
been slain, as many of his men were: A gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t on-set was also made on the other side; which though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be prosperous at first, yet the assailants were forced to give back; the
same befalling them as did those that made the assault at the Raveline before
<hi>Gradisca,</hi> who fought more valiantly, and received more harm from their
friends who were upon their backs, then from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>r enemies who were before them; for the former being
timerous and fearful, stood crouching, and many of them lay grovelling on the
ground, who firing their Musquets low slew the best of their own men. The
Venetian being returned without having done any good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to
<hi>Mariano,</hi> had no be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

success in the assault which they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afterwards to give to the Fort
<hi>Stella,</hi> built by the Austrians on the other side the River in form of
a Cavalier, against those of <hi>Sagra</hi> and <hi>Fogliano,</hi> held by the
Venetians; for <hi>Pietro di Vasques,</hi> a Spaniard who was Captain there,
fore-knowing the enemies resolution, put his men quietly in a defensive
posture, and repulss'd them, with the death of above a hundred of the
assailants: The loss which the enemy recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved was increased by a great
mortality in the Venetian Camp, which beginning with their horses, came
afterwards to their men; for the stench of the dead horses being intollerable,
the air grew so infected as it begot dangerous diseases; whereby the Camp was
reduced to so small a number, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

if they had been then assaulted by the enemy, it would assuredly have been
totally defeated: A danger whereat the Common wealths Commanders were much
troubled, the courage and gallantry of the enemy especially being considered,
and the little esteem which the Austrians made of their men: But they were

<hi>Udine,</hi> by Captain <hi>Antonio Manzano,</hi> and by Captain <hi>Daniele
Antonini,</hi> of the same City, who when they had past the River drove the
Dutch out of <hi>Austriaca;</hi> and did not only recover the booty which they
had taken, but moreover, took much Merchandize which they found in
<hi>Austriaca;</hi> and entring further in, burnt <hi>Malborgeto</hi> and
<hi>Trivese,</hi> two neighbouring Towns: nor had the other Commissary
<hi>Erizzo</hi> less for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate success, who advancing towards
<hi>Chiavaretto,</hi> together with <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigiano</hi> and his
<hi>Stradiotti,</hi> and a good strength of Foot led on by <hi>Iovanni M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

little praise of <hi>Trivigiano,</hi> to whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the whole honour thereof
is due, he being the first that came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the first that did manfully
assault it. The taking of <hi>Chiava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto</hi> was succeeded by the like of
<hi>Luciniso,</hi> the Austrians having aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned it, who going to recover
<hi>Chiavaretto,</hi> repast over the <hi>Lisonzo:</hi> which when the
Venetians knew, they marched immediately thither; and possessing themselves
easily of the Town, which was but weakly guarded, they in a short time made
themselves masters of the Castle, situated upon the top of a Hill: where after
three days stout resistance, the defendants were forc'd to yield for want of
water. The like did those of a certain Fort called <hi>la Trinita,</hi> built
by the Austrians, a little higher: to these happy successes was added the
taking of <hi>Fara,</hi> a small Castle between <hi>Luciniso</hi> and
<hi>Gradisca,</hi> which being plaied upon by the Cannon, yielded upon
Articles; and <hi>Baglione,</hi> a valiant Colonel, was sorely wounded before
it. Thus did the affairs of the Venetians alter in <hi>Friuli:</hi> but they
were not idle the mean while in <hi>Istria</hi> and <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> for
<hi>Marcho Loredano,</hi> Commissary in those parts, and <hi>Benedetto da
Leze,</hi> Commissary of Horse, as they scoured the Country, met with several
incounters, wherein having the better, they took many prisoners, and slew many:
and some Galleys going to <hi>Antignana,</hi> after having plaid upon it long,
they took it upon Articles; and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>erwards scouring along the Coast of <hi>Pessino,</hi> they put it
to fire and sword; and <hi>Iovanni Iacomo Zane,</hi> Commissary of
<hi>Dalmatia,</hi> went to before <hi>Segna;</hi> but for want of provision
durst not attempt it; but turning to <hi>Mosconiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> after having plaid
upon it two days, took it: <hi>Berses</hi> upon the bank of the River, and the
Fort of <hi>Sirissa,</hi> over against the Island <hi>Pago,</hi> through the
Garrisons discord, fell also into the Venetians hands.</p>
            <p>But not long after the Austrians being become masters of the field
in those parts, by the multitude of men that came in to assist them, they ran
all over with much terror, burning and ruinating all the Country, and the
Venetians Subjects: the affairs of which States be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan sore to go less in
reputation, all mens eyes being bent upon <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy,</hi> where the war
grew hotter between the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> and the Duke. The Duke

               </gap>ety, nor the honour of the King, who by reason of his years, was
incapable of knowing how much the sustaining of <hi>Piedmont</hi> concerned the
safety of that Court. Wherefore these having sent Monsieur <hi>d' Orfe</hi> to
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> to the end that his assisting the Duke in the name of the
Confederates, he might incourage him, and give him reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they also made
open demonstration in <hi>France</hi> that they would savour the Dukes affairs
by all the means they might. But in effect their whole ends tended to bring
about their own interests, whereunto the union of the two Crowns being
contrary, they found no better means to break it then by pressing the affairs
of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being busied in
<hi>Italy</hi> might be less able to assist their King; and yet the King and
Queen, were it either to take away this occasion of complaint from the Princes,
or that they had a real value for the observance of the Treaty, the execution
whereof they never had forborn to indeavour, though in a moderate manner, as
becomes Princes really united, they always found the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to allow of the Dukes
disarming, as legitimate, and forward to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Governour, that disbanding
his Army he might readily, and without difficulty or delay observe the residue
of the Treaty: not so much for that the peace of <hi>Italy</hi> was there
desired, as for that the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> who was interested in
<hi>Inoioso</hi>'s defence, and thinking that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custom of
Courts, he was bound to make good his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would that all exceptions being
laid aside, the peace of <hi>Asti</hi> should by all means be executed, and
made good. But were it either that those orders were not over precise, or were
peradventure so express'd, as that they left a power in the Governour to do
therein according to the condition of the present times and occurrences: or
that the Duke thought he could not execute them, in consideration of the new
acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and preparations for war, as well on the Dukes behalf, as on the
Venetians: or else, as some would have it, that he had so involved himself in
the thought thereof, or had ingaged himself so deeply, that the Duke should by
his means be brought to humble himself to the King, and that the Capitulations
of <hi>Asti</hi> should be cancelled, as that he thought he could not in honour
do less, he did not much care to see them performed; many were of opinion that
as the aforesaid orders proceeded not from the Kings nor his Councils mind, but
from the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>'s meer will, whose excessive authority, grown
odious to the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> began to decline (as hath been said)

<hi>Piedmont,</hi> so were they not punctually observed, nor much 
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:53250:75"/> valued by <hi>Don Pietro;</hi> for he thinking that the
Grandezza and Majesty of the Crown lay now upon his Shoulders, which he thought
had not been very carefully sustained by the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> out of
private respects; was not well pleased that <hi>Lerma</hi> preferring his own
affairs before those of others, unless it were <hi>In<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>iosa</hi>'s, whom he detested should
abandon the publick cause: which he professing himself to be very zealous of,
was ready to repair; wherefore not openly gainsaying the Kings commands, but
execusing himself upon the Venetians new occasions, upon the Dukes new
commotions, and upon the strange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of the French, he did as it were
by force draw the Court to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to his opinion. Hereunto was added, that he
not being able to per swade himself but that the past disorders had been
occasioned through his predecessours fault, and tacite Collusion, he took it
for granted, that when the Duke should see himself assaulted by a powerful
Army, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by himself, who proceeded really, and would assault
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> with all the true rules, and rigour of war, should out of
excessive fear, yield, and humble himself unto the King: he therefore being big
with vast conceits, promised by Letters written to the Court, that he would
bring him under, without almost once unsheathing his sword, and without
breaking the peace of <hi>Italy,</hi> by his demonstrations only, and by his
preparations: and that undoubtedly he would repair the publick dignity, and
that he would easily reduce affairs into their former condition. Which hopes
being greedily conceived, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he should be able to make that
Court slacken their former orders, and permit more freedom to him in conducting
the publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, according to his own mind, and according as times and
occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons should serve: but howsoever affairs went there (for the more
inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate occasions of this new commotion appeared too observe and too
repugnant within themselves, and peradventure were no less unknown to the
Officers through whose hands they past, then to the people who only minded the
effects) it is certain, that the Duke either took, or the Governour gave him
occasion of re-assuming those Arms: which being naturally given to war, he had
unwillingly laid down; from the wresting of the meaning of the Capitulations of
<hi>Asti,</hi> from the dispute about their execution, and from the rigorous
p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>etentions about the point of
honour between the Duke and the Governour. Wherefore the Governour seeing him
busie in preparing for a new war, and being himself no less desirous to set it
on fire, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>en the Duke thinking
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly to bring him lower, and to subdue his Forces, he began to prepare
an Army not inferiour to that of the preceding year: he took order for men in
<hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Burgony,</hi> in <hi>Swisserland,</hi> and in the
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples;</hi> he disburst moneys to fill up the Brigades of
<hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> and to raise new Foot in the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> so
rather as it were out of sport, and out of a fained shew, then out of any
deliberate will, war was again begun by him who was able to have quench'd the
fire thereof: which afterwards breaking forth in earnest, and contrary to his
opinion who caused it, was the occasion of much prejudice, and ruine to the
people of <hi>Lombardy.</hi> And as the first war was not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed
the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>'s war, so this upon better grounds was called
<hi>Don Pietro di Tolledo</hi>'s war. The troubles of <hi>France</hi> were at 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:53250:75"/> this time reduced to such terms, as the King being neer
the Princes Forces with a powerful Army, the business had like to have been
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by a Battel. But the King and Queen choosing rather, even upon
disadvantagious terms, to forbear shedding of civil blood, and to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
affairs, then to get the Victory by the ruine and destruction of the Kingdom,
and by the common danger, were not against According many things by way of
Negotiation, even contrary to their wills and authority: <hi>Whereof two were
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>iefest; the first, that the
principal State-ministers should be removed from their Offices; in whose places
others of the confiding Princes should be put; the other, that the King should
swear to make the Treaty of</hi> Asti <hi>be observed.</hi> Wherefore the King
understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what orders the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had given to the
Governour, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Lodovico Mangia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Millain,</hi> and sollicit the execution of that Treaty. <hi>Who being come
to</hi> Millain, <hi>and having spoken with the Governour, desiring him in the
Kings name that he would become more pliable, and prosecute the begun execution
of that Capitulation with all sincerity, received this answer; that the Kings
Army was much lessened by the dismission of the Swissers, and of those of</hi>
Tuscany, Urbane, Parma <hi>and</hi> Lucca, <hi>and by the death and running
away of the</hi> Lombardy <hi>Regiments: that the King was not obliged to
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arme by the Articles of</hi> Asti, <hi>and lesse upon new occasions to
reassume Arms; that notwithstanding he the Governour had, for the intire
observancy of the Capitulations, offer'd the Duke reciprocal restitution of
what had been taken; which the Duke had refused: and that not relying upon the
words of two so good, and so great Kings, who offer'd to secure him from the
Forces of the State of</hi> Millain; <hi>he contrary to the said Capitulations,
had detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed most of his men in</hi> Piedmont, <hi>and therefore given new
reason of jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies: and that notwithstanding, he the Governour offer'd again
the proposal of restitution, and promised not to offend him, if the Duke would
resolve to observe the Capitulations intirely: and that if he should refuse to
do this, he the Agent might witness this to the King, to the end that he might
be fully satisfied of the new preparations made by the Duke, and of what he
should hereafter do; and that he might plainly see, that he the Governour would
proceed with such authority and reputation as became his King, without
obviating the peace.</hi> The Governour gave this answer in writing to the
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and made the same be given to the King by the Duke of
<hi>Montelion</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> who writ him word back, that the King had
approved thereof. But the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> &amp; the other
confederates seemed to understand it otherwise, whose authority by this new and
advantagious agreement was then very great, and got ground upon the King, who
by reason of his tender years was not yet constant in his Counsels and
Resolutio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s. They therefore agreed
to send an Embassadour into <hi>Italy,</hi> and made choice of <hi>Philippo di
Bettune,</hi> a nimble-witted Gentleman, and well experienced in the affairs of
<hi>Italy,</hi> where he had been Embassadour many years with the Pope from the
King: his Commission was to find out the Governour, and press him to the
perfect performance of the Treaty. This mean while all things inclined daily to
a manifest breach in <hi>Lombardy;</hi> for new seeds of troubles being already
sown, the Duke arm'd strongly, and so did the Governour; the Duke threa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ned to reassume the war in
<hi>Montferrat</hi> by reason of the Duke of <pb n="138" facs="tcp:53250:76"/>
               <hi>Mantua</hi>'s backwardness to pardon the Rebels: the Governour would
quarter his men in that State, not only to defend it from the Duke, but also
that he might be the readie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>at the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> fearing to be assaulted neerer hand,
and as it were at his own doors, might lay aside his thought of assaulting
others. But the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> refusing to receive forreign Souldiers
into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> storm'd thereat, and
chiefly the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who from a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ore assailant, being become a
jealous Protector of that State, did not only exclaim against it, for his own
interest, but, to raise suspicions of the Governour, and of the Spanish Court,
and to make them be ill thought of by the Italians; and renewing the ancient
jealousies, he gave out, that under colour of defending and protecting
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> the Governour did fully intend to usurpe it; and the Queen
Mother exclaiming much against it in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> commanded absolutely that it should be forborn. At this time the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> increased in reputation, it being given out that the
French Embassadour came in favour to him, who, as it was said, was sent from
the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and from the consederates, who managed the
affairs of that Court as they listed, and seemed to adhere sufficiently to his
cause; not was the tacite League between him the Duke, and the Commonwealth of
<hi>Venice,</hi> of less consideration; which being formerly kept secret, grew
now to be manifest. The King of <hi>England,</hi> and many other Protestant
Princes of <hi>Cermany,</hi> who seemed to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>avour him, confirm'd him in his
belief, that being upheld by so many, and so potent Princes, he might withstand
the violence which was thr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>atned
him; and this opinion was increased in many men by the coming of Embassadours
at this time to <hi>Turin</hi> from the King of <hi>England,</hi> and from some
German Princes: but (that which did out do all other appearings and seemings)
Marshal <hi>de Deguieres</hi>'s coming into <hi>Piedmont</hi> made all men
wonder, he having been long held to be one of the best Commanders in
<hi>France,</hi> and one who took the Dukes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs very much to heart, and
more an enemy to <hi>Spain</hi> then any other French-man: this man, though he
came in a peaceful posture, and unarmed, as it were to be a superintendent over
the French Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour's Negotiations, and privately to inform himself whether
things were in that dangerous condition as the Duke related them to be: yet the
good correspondency which was held between him and the Duke, and his continual
assisting him; his being nominated in the Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Asti,</hi> to
see all things perform'd; and much more the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire which he and the
other French-men seemed to have of maintaining and backing the Duke upon this
occasion, so to lessen the Authority of the Spaniard in <hi>Italy;</hi> made it
appear manifestly, that if the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour should persist resolute in not
disarming he would call the French Souldiery into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who were
said to be ready at his beck upon the Confines of <hi>Italy,</hi> and prepared
for <hi>Piedmont.</hi> His coming there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not only much countenance the
Duke, but all the Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours future Negotiation: and the Duke being very
vigilant, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy witted, and accustomed to consort the disposition of his
genius with outward demonstrations, made much use of this present occasion in
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>asting of his own Forces, and of
the assistance which was promised <pb n="139" facs="tcp:53250:76"/> him, and which he hoped
for: wherefore receiving the Marshal with excessive, and unusual honour, and
with singular magnificence, and keeping close at very private Counsel with him,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e seemed to repose much
confidence in him, not pretermitting any term of honour and liberality to make
to himself propitious, particularly such, who being intimate with the Marshal
might further most his ends and his desires: but these so many demonstrations
did more prejudice then further the conclusion of the agreement; for the
Spanish Ministers of State being very much troubled at the King of
<hi>France</hi> and King of <hi>England</hi>'s inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing themselves in the
affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> did very much dislike, nor could they tollerate the
Capitulation agreed upon in <hi>France,</hi> wherein the King swore unto the
Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the other confederates, that he would cause the
Articles of <hi>Asti</hi> to be performed; and the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours and Marshals
coming to see them executed, and the new preparations which were said to be
made in <hi>France;</hi> for <hi>Italy</hi> being hereunto added, they thought
that the French did arrogate that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to them in <hi>Italy</hi> by
rigour and threats, which the occasion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of times, and much
easiness of the preceding Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> had procured unto their
King; and that the Venetians and other Princes, did by declaring themselves to
adhere unto the Duke, pretend to have an eye unto their Crowns authority: so as
if the power and dignity thereof were therein too much concerned, they thought
themselves the more bound to resist what so great a union of wills did
threaten, for that the danger was greater, that if they should give way, it
might be esteemed they did it out of fear of the French Forces. A respect which
if it penetrated deep into any one, it must needs make a deeper impression in
the Governour; as in him who being come into <hi>Italy,</hi> wholly inflamed
with exalted thoughts, who had put himself in a posture of restoring his Kings
authority to its former condition, would have been too much failing to himself,
and to the opinion which he had generally won, if he had gone less in any
thing, then what he had at first so openly profest; and it would have been
basely done by him, it seeing his affairs grow worse and worse, he had not
indeavoured by all possible means to sustain them: and if he had not been the
more solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous in providing for war, by how much his enemies bravadoes were
the greater. Therefore to boot with the moneys which he had already disburst
for raising of men; that it might be seen he durst she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> his face, and to make them jealous who did almost
already openly threa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>en him, he
sent some Forces to the Venetians Confines, and to the Confines of
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and as if he would assault the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Venice</hi> (for the effects
of their League with the Duke appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed daily more and more) he gave order for a Bridge to be made over
the <hi>Adda.</hi> Whereat though the Commonwealth were much troubled, yet
having a great scarcity of men at that time, the Senators not being able to do
more were forc'd to commit the defence of that part of the State to the people
of the Country.</p>
            <p>Whilst the Governour was thus busied in making preparations eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
where, the Embassadour, after having staid some days at <hi>Turin,</hi> came to
<hi>Millain;</hi> the substance of whose Embassie was, <hi>That the King had,
by reason of the accidents which hindred the laying down of Arms, used 
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:53250:77"/> many indeavours to the Duke, and given him his word to
secure him from the extraordinary Militia of the State of</hi> Millain; <hi>but
that the Duke not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewithal satisfied, the King, out of his great
desire to publick peace, and by the obligation which was upon him by the
Articles of</hi> Asti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>did
desire him that he would prosecute the disarming which was begun by his
Predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors; to the end that the restitutions of the Towns might be come to;
and the execution of other things appointed by the peace:</hi> To this
proposal, which was given in in writing, the Governour replied in a long
discourse gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven also in in writing; wherein by a methodical Narration of all
things that had occur'd from the beginning of the war of <hi>Montferrat,</hi>
to the peace made at <hi>Asti;</hi> he inferr'd, <hi>That the King had done all
things for the protection and security of that State, to which he was much
sollicited by the Queen of</hi> France; <hi>That the King was not bound by the
Treaty of peace to dismiss, no not so much as one man; and that the Duke had
only at the beginning given satisfaction in this point, but that he had
afterwards open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countervened it by the many novelties attempted against</hi>
Montferrat, <hi>by his new Levies of men, and by his League lately concluded
with the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans against the House of</hi> Austria: <hi>So as the King was
in all acceptations free from the Articles of peace; That the Duke refused the
security offered him by the words of two so great Kings, not out of any doubt
or distrust, but in favour to the Venetians; and that therefore the King
of</hi> France <hi>was no longer bound by the Capitulations to favour the Dukes
hidden ends: He concluded with offering readily to observe the rest of the
Articles, if the Duke would observe them punctually on his behalf; and with
passing his word again in the Kings name, not to wrong him; But as for laying
down Arms, he confest freely it was impossble to do it by reason of the
Venetians new Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions; And finally, he entered his Protestation, That if
the Duke should refuse this, and should withdraw from reciprocal restitution;
the King should remain free from any whatsoever obligation, since he had
abundantly satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by the abovesaid offer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the substance of the Answer given to the French
Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour, who at his going from <hi>Millain</hi> was earnestly desired,
That as a good servant to his King, who was by affinity so nearly join'd to the
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> he would use the best means he could to appease the
Duke; and disposing him to make good the Treaty, keep him from favouring the
Venetians, whose ends were only to usurp the Arch-Dukes States, who was a just
Prince; and this the rather, for that the Duke might be sure he would thereby
irritate the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards whom he had reason to proceed
with all manner of respect; and that therefore taking the word of both the
Kings, he should not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the anger of the whole House of <hi>Austria</hi>
against him, wherewith he the Duke was so much interessed both by alliance, and
in so many other respects: The Embassadour promised he would do so; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therewith obtained a Suspension of Arms for the whole moneth of
<hi>August,</hi> which was then began, he went to <hi>Turin;</hi> where he was
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at a Diet in <hi>Moncallieri,</hi> between the Duke, the Marshal, and
the Venetian Embassadour, who was admitted thereinto under pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ence of making him acquainted with
every thing; but in effect, because that Common-wealth which is naturally of
her self sparing in spending, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving till now b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>en more liberal in words and promises, then in deeds,
the <pb n="141" facs="tcp:53250:77"/> Duke and the rest of that Cabal, thought it now a
very fitting time to make use of her troubles and danger to make hercontribute
a great sum of mony which they pretended to from her; and therefore the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Answer and offers being heard, the Duke began to listen to the
proposals, seeming to be thereunto inclined rather for want of monies, whereof
he and his State were much exhausted, then out of any desire or inclination to
abandon the common Cause: The French Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, under colour of being a
peace-maker, assisted him in his drift; and the Marshal more then he; who being
to be the head of the French suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, was to share deeply in the Venetians
money; and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that it was impossible for <hi>Piedmont</hi>
to sustain so great a war as was threatned her, otherwise then by the Sword of
<hi>France,</hi> and Purse of <hi>Venice;</hi> he minded the Duke that he could
build but little upon the former if he should fail of the other; But the
Common-wealth, which saw affairs were so far proceeded in, as it was impossible
to come to any atonement; especially the fiery nature of both parties being
consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; little valued the threats which were made under the colour of
necessity; and knowing whether these counsels, and this sudden incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to
peace tended, did not at all fear being left alone to bear the burthen of the
war; and so much the less, for that the Duke was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy envelloped in many
difficulties, and was already by his demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions so far ingaged in war, as
it was impossible, at least very hard, for him to draw back his hand: Wherefore
she seemed as cunningly to be inclined to a composure of affairs, which she was
as much desired to do as the Duke was by the Archduke, and by the other
Princes; and it was in her power to obtain it upon very honourable terms:
wherefore the Duke, hoping that the Negotiation about peace would be a perfect
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote against the Venetians Tenacity, gave order that the Treaty should be
had in <hi>Rome</hi> with the Pope; who for this and for other affairs sent
<hi>Alessandro Lodovisio,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Bollognia,</hi> into
<hi>Lombardy,</hi> under the Title of Nuntio in extraordinary, that by his
Authority he might stop the Governours forces; who growing every day hotter
against the Duke, was gone from <hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Pavia,</hi> to hasten
on the war the more; which whilst he threatens openly on this side to
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> yet he plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it privately on that side where it might be
worse for the Duke, as least suspected by him. The Duke of <hi>Nemours;</hi> a
French Prince, of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s blood, and the nearest to the
Ducal Line next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the children of this present Duke; upon whom, that Line
sailing, the States of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi> were to divolve,
was for some years past not well satisfied with the Duke, upon occasion of some
private Picque; wherefore he had not succoured him at all upon occasion of the
last troubles of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> but seeing new Commotions now about to
arise from the Capitulations of <hi>Asti,</hi> he laid aside all past enmity
and rancor, and offered to serve him in that war freely of his own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with
4000 Foot, and 500 Horse: The Duke accepted the offer, and monies were disburst
unto him in point of pay; and he was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his men in
<hi>Piedmont</hi> according to his promise: But his antient hatred and desire
of revenge prevailing over his new Reconcilia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion; or his ambition and desire of Reign over his conjunction in
blood and his obligations, he closed with the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi>
who gave <pb n="142" facs="tcp:53250:78"/> him both men and monies; promising to assault
<hi>Savoy</hi> with the same men wherewith he was to have fallen into
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> which when taken, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to acknowledge it as held in
perpetual Fee from the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Governour listened to this
offer, that he might weaken the Dukes Forces by diversion; and therefore
sending mony to <hi>Nemours,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ordered Monsieur <hi>di
Disse</hi> to pass into <hi>Savoy</hi> in assistance of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise with
6000 Foot, and 400 Horse, which were raised by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in
<hi>Burgony:</hi> And <hi>Nemours</hi> promised moreover that divert Princes
and great Lords of <hi>France,</hi> who were his friends and adherents, would
likewise come thither upon this occasion: Nor was it to be doubted but that the
Duke being thus assaulted would have been mightily troubled; he not having
forces sufficient for two sore war<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> made upon him at one and the same time; in <hi>Savoy</hi> by
<hi>Nemours,</hi> and in <hi>Piedmont</hi> by the Governour: But a Letter
written from the Governour into <hi>Spain</hi> freed him from this so near and
so important danger; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the complotting of this business was intirely
contained, which were it by chance, or by the craft of some of the Governours
servants, came to the Dukes hands, and afforded him opportunity to prevent what
was plotted against him: Wherefore sending Prince <hi>Victorio</hi> away in all
haste to those parts; he also gave order to Monsieur <hi>di Lanz,</hi>
Governour of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to secure himself as speedily as might be of
<hi>Nissi</hi> and <hi>Remigli,</hi> places which lying upon the Frontier of
<hi>Savoy</hi> towards <hi>Burgony,</hi> served as a gate to let in, or to keep
out, the Governours men who were to enter by those parts under <hi>Diffe.</hi>
This Order being rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily executed by <hi>Lanz</hi> rendered <hi>Nemours</hi>
his business vain; for he, seeming as if he were coming with his men into
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> but indeed turning upon those Towns, was repulss'd by the
Dukes men: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forced to retire more inward towards <hi>Chiaromonte</hi>
and <hi>Cleramonte,</hi> his men out of meer necessity of livelihood and
maintenance, fell to sack the neighbouring Villages: whilst <hi>Nemours</hi>
kept idle in those parts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that the forces of <hi>Burgony</hi> should
have come and have joined with him; but it was in vain to expect that; for
<hi>Nissi</hi> and <hi>Remigli</hi> hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Duke, and the Governours
of <hi>Lyons, Dolpheny,</hi> and the Dutchy of <hi>Burgony,</hi> discovering
themselves forthwith to be for the Duke; and soon after all the Princes of
<hi>France,</hi> moved thereunto out of consideration of the great prejudice
which might thereby insue unto the Kingdom, if the Spanish Forces entering into
<hi>Savoy</hi> should more inviron the Confines of <hi>France, Disse</hi> could
not get to joyn with <hi>Nemours:</hi> And <hi>Albertus,</hi> Arch-Duke of
<hi>Austria,</hi> who, as Lord of <hi>Flaunders,</hi> and of the Low Countries,
governed the County of <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony;</hi> though he made use, for the most
part, of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Militia, and of the Spanish
Officers, in the Government of those Provinces, yet would he not by any means
be brought to assist or consent unto that Enterprize, were it either that he
was unwilling to disturb the Peace between his men and the States of
<hi>France,</hi> or for that that enterp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of his Wives, than he did the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>'s designs; nay,
giving severe Orders to his Officers in <hi>Burgony,</hi> that they should not
countenance <hi>Nemours</hi> in any sort, nor receive his men, he was
aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by all at the fairest of his play: So the violence of that storm
began suddenly to pass over, which, whilest it hover'd in the Air, did much
alter the Dukes Affairs, which continued troubled for many moneths; but for all
this he did not give over the defence of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where having
Garrisonned the Towns of <hi>Asti</hi> and <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and made Count
<hi>Guido</hi> Governour of the forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

moneths before from the Castle of <hi>Millain,</hi> where he was kept close
prisoner, Governour of the other; he caused a Bridge to be made over the

<hi>Asti</hi> and <hi>Vercelles</hi> being thereby joyned, they might more
easily relieve one another in case they should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted; and having sent
the remainder of the pay to <hi>Castiglione,</hi> and the other Commanders who
raised men for him, he staid expecting him: The Governour did the like in
<hi>Pavia,</hi> but with more fervency; where breathing forth nothing but fire
and sword, and being impatient of any the least delay, he hasted provisions,
that he might go into the field; and giving out that he would be all
<hi>August</hi> with his Army upon the Confines of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>

               </gap>ted and spurr'd, in which posture he
used then to go thorow the City, that it might be seen he was in a readiness to
march; and the Nuntio desiring a short suspension of Arms, he would not grant
it, saying, That he was come too late: But all things were not so ready for
going to the field as the Governour could have desired; for neither were the
Swissers come from their own homes, nor were the Dutch come into the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny draught-horses for the Artillery, and many Arms
which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from <hi>Germany</hi> for the use of the Army, were not
yet come: Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution therefore not answering resolution, and businesses not
proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on so fast as was expected; nay, new difficulties arising every
day, the Governour began to slacken that vigour of mind wherewith till now he
had with some violence been transported; and beginning to know the difference
between saying and doing, he found also that the bad success of the last War
was not wholly through his Predecessors fault: His courage was also cooled by
the bad success of the business of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which was the chief
ground-work of his designs; wherein, to boot with having spent above 300000
Ducats, he had also consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Marquess of <hi>Disse</hi> his whole Regiment
of Burgonians, which had caused no less diversion to him than to the Duke: He
was not a little scandalized neither, that the enterprize should be thought to
have miscarried through the wickedness of his men, corrupted by the Dukes
moneys; for his chief Secretary was imprisoned as guilty of having 
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:53250:79"/> made the Letter written unto the King come unto the Duke
of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s hands; and though nothing could be proved against him, he
was rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented: He was likewise detained by continual remembrances from
the Court, that he should rather break off, than imbrace any new occasions of
new ruptures; finding those Ministers of State more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to preserve that
Authority and Greatness which they received privately, and the Crown publickly,
from the tranquillity of peace, then to advance it by perturbation of affairs:
chiefly when he called to mind that the Duke being desperate, and
extraordinarily exasperated, not caring into wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> danger he ran, seemed to desire nothing but tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults,
and alteration of affairs, which was contrary to the Crowns in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in
<hi>Italy.</hi> Of which opinion some of the State-ministers of the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> seemed also to be; those chiefly who out of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
friendship to the Marquess <hi>Inoiosa,</hi> and for good turns received from
him, thought it suited more with his reputation, that either the peace made by
him should be perfected, or else the new war prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate. And as, for
the aforesaid respect, moneys were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in <hi>Spain,</hi> so some
State-ministers of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> not going along with the
Governour in his opinions and ends, but opposing as much as they might such
provisions, and resolutions as were to be made, caused diffidence in him in his
Counsels, and impediments in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what was resolved upon:
wherefore he who was almost surrounded with Competitors, consulting in things
of weightiest importance only with <hi>Vives,</hi> who was then his Confident,
communicated nothing to the rest save sleight and ordinary affairs; whereat
they thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves injured did the more willingly thwart his Counsels
and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions.</p>
            <p>The Embassadour <hi>Bettune</hi> returned about the end of
<hi>August</hi> from <hi>Turin,</hi> who professing that he had used all his
best indeavours to make the Duke bear all due respect to the King, and to the
house of <hi>Austria,</hi> brought with him in the Kings name a middle way for
composure of the present differences. <hi>Which was, that the Treaty of</hi>
Asti <hi>should be made good, with the reciprocal restitution of all places
taken away; that it might be lawful for them both to keep armed, with
reciprocal word of not offending each other till such time as it should be
fully accorded within a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain prefixt time, in which interim the whole
Treaty might be fully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and that the Governour should abstain from
injuring the Venetians, whilst the King should indeavour the composure of those
differences by his Embassadours, sent to the Emperour, to the Archduke, and to
the Venetians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Proposals were debated in full Council; where it fell into
consideration, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> if (the Duke

               </gap>e Proposal only so far as regarded the affairs of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and turn with the Army against the Venetians, so to divert
them from the war of <hi>Friuli;</hi> or whether, if the said Proposals should
not be allowed of, they should assault <hi>Piedmont:</hi> it was said for the
first part, that the war <pb n="145" facs="tcp:53250:79"/> against the Venetians was the
chief cause of retaining, and afterwards of increasing the present Army, that
it might seem sufficient for the Kings honour to seem to lay down Arms, as the
Duke had done, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of effectually doing so; and the King of
<hi>France</hi> having by the Dukes word, secured those of <hi>Spain,</hi> that
<hi>Montferrat</hi> should not be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, whether the King (especially when
the Duke should have past his word again, not to innovate any thing to the
prejudice of the State of <hi>Millain)</hi> might dissemble and keep still in
Arms, so to keep from making war upon him, which would not be so easily
decided, because he was daily succoured by men from <hi>France:</hi> that
therefore it was more expedient, to secure affairs with the Duke, to assault
the Venetians Towns, to bereave them of all defence, and so to assist the
Archduke by diversion. But they were much troubled left the Duke, when he
should see the Kings Forces go against the Venetians, might think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
free, and might assault the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> according to the
Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Confede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>acy; and this
the rather, for that the Marshal being at the same time gone for
<hi>France,</hi> with speech that he was to return sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly armed, the Duke
was gone to <hi>Creseentino,</hi> where having built a Bridge (a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> hath been said) over the
<hi>Poe,</hi> he did not only prepare for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, but drawing neer the
Confines of <hi>Millain</hi> did fortifie at <hi>la Motta:</hi> where having
also thrown a Bridge over the <hi>Sefia,</hi> a River which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides his State
from that of <hi>Millain,</hi> he gave evident signs that he would be the first
who would pass over with his Army, which begun already to be numerous. To
remove these doubts, the Embassadour was demanded, whether his word past, of
not offending, would serve, if the Kings Forces should march to the prejudice
of the Venetians; and he answering, that he had had no speech thereof with the
Duke, the other opinion prevailed, that war should be made upon
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> though <hi>Don Giovan Vives,</hi> who was got into great
power with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and was commonly thought either the Author, or great
Fautorer of the renewed war, seeing the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> averse from
war, and for the aforesaid Reasons, the Governour weary, or grown cooler
therein; or peradventure to keep the fault from being imputed to him, if any
inconvenience should happen by the war, which the Duke was advised against,
giving his opinion openly in writing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Governour to accept of the
Embassadours offer for what concern'd peace with the Duke, and that setting in
the Frontiers of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont</hi> 7000 Swissers, and 10000 other Souldiers,
did exhort him to assault the Venetians State with the remainder of his Army,
which was 13000 Foot and 2000 Horse, molesting it, till such time as they
should restore to the Archduke what they had taken from him in that war.</p>
            <p>But this advise being neither accepted by the Duke, nor allowed of
by the rest, nor yet the Embassadours new Proposals, this answer was given the
Embassadour: <hi>That his Propositions were not answer able to the

that letting the season for the Field pass over, the Kings Forces might become

and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in putting the resolution which was put on in execution; for the
Embassadour not ceasing to give them hopes, and almost assurances that the Duke
should promise not to move, no not though they went against the Venetians, he
did not obtain his chief end, which was to keep them from providing for war;
for the Governour sent Orders to

               </gap> that were already upon the
Venetian Confines, and to the rest of the Souldiery that was in the State, that
they should speedily march into the <hi>Novarese,</hi> whither he said he would
send the Artillery and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition the next day. But whilst he laboured both in
body and mind about making these preparations, he fell into an Ague; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
before he was wholly free, he made himself be carryed upon a Bed, on the third
of <hi>September,</hi> to <hi>Candia,</hi> where he told the Nuntio, and the
Embassadour, both which he had dismist, he would wait the Dukes final
resolution: he staid some days there, paying out moneys to the Souldiery which
came unto him from several parts: and making a Bridge over at <hi>la
Villata,</hi> he intended to pass over there with his Army, into
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> and from thence to where the Duke should be, or whither he
should like best. He had here in a short time a flourishing Army, not only in
respect of the number and valour of the Souldiers and Commanders, but for
Artillery, Ammu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

worth to those of the Duke, who keeping still at <hi>la Motta,</hi> with no
contemptible forces, had with him, as fame gave out (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he used to keep
up the reputation of his own forces;) 25000 Foot and 2500 ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and 2000 Horse, which were held to be the flower and sinews of his Army:
between 8 and 9 thousand French; as many Savoiards, Swissers, Walloons,
Piedmonteses and Provencials. And though the differences of <hi>Savoy</hi> were
not yet composed, and that he knew he was to be faced with a more implacable
Enemy; yet egg'd on by the fiercenss of his spirit; and fed with hopes that
neither the French, nor Venetians would suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to perish; and perhaps
arguing the Governours future actions from his former, did not wholly distrust,
but that after the first onset the war would not continue in the same fervour
as it seemed to begin, he seemed little to fear the Enemies threats: so as
instead of sending back the Embassadour with the acceptation of the conditions
of peace, he made his Horse go to <hi>Langosco,</hi> a Town within the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> and sent Souldiers to take <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and to burn
<hi>Murano,</hi> and other places in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> upon pretence that
provision, passage and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was there given to the Enemy; and sending some
Shallops down the <hi>Sesia,</hi> loaded with Powder, and artificial fire, so
ordered as that it should play when it came to the Bridge made by the
Governour, and break it; whilst he being not far off intended, when the Bridge
should be broken, to fall with his Horse upon the Garrison, which were upon the
head of that Bridge towards <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and cut them in pieces: but
the Shallops being kept back, the design failed: so as the Dukes Horse
appearing on the River bank, there hapned a small skirmish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

little harm was done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thus the second War of <hi>Piedmont</hi> began from
the drawing neer of two Armies: which was not occasioned through any
differences, or State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretentions, not for any fresh injuries done or received,
nor by any new commands to the Duke that he should lay down Arms; but if the
truth were known; it proceeded on the Dukes side, from his ancient rancour, and
from his desire thereby contracted, of venting himself in any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
manner, in abating the Spanish Grandezza; and on the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours behalf; from
the bad success of the late War, from the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations concluded with small
satisfaction before <hi>Asti,</hi> and from a desire to abolish them, and

               </gap>e actions; and to establish the Kings affairs in <hi>Italy</hi> in
their former condition and honour. But if we shall mark the outside of things,
this war had no other title, unless it were, that the Duke pretending the
Governour should dismiss his Army, he not doing it, did contrary to the same
Capitulation reassume Arms, and joyning in League with the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans would not
abandon his Confederates (by whom he was so little assisted in the former war
of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and by whom he was so appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently wrong'd in that of
<hi>Montferrat)</hi> nor disarm upon the security of both the Kings words, nor
yet promise not to molest the Kings Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:53250:81"/> 
               <q>These wars, and the ends and motives of these Princes, was
  va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously discoursed of: some praised the Duke for his faith, valour and free
  spirit; and cried him up even to the Stars, as if he had been a new
  <hi>Marcellus,</hi> who had taught that the Spaniards power, which was held
  unconquerable, might be resisted: he was therefore estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a seasonable
  defender of the Venetian Commonwealth, and the generous Protector of the
  Liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> was detested,
  as one that studied novelties, and was no way zealous of the publick peace:
  others who attributed the Dukes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution to an over contentious mind, to an
  immoderate hatred con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived against the Spaniards, and to a too excessive
  desire of suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the authority of that Crown, imputed unto him an unquiet
  spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that he was a greater friend to turmoils, then to quiet: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause,
  to the prejudice of peace, and of the security of <hi>Italy,</hi> he had let in
  forreigners into the bowels thereof, to the peoples so great loss, to the so
  great effusion of blood, and to the so apparent danger not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himself,
  but to the contaminating of that little of sound or wholsome which was yet left
  in <hi>Italy.</hi> But they wonder'd not at the Duke, by reason of his warlike
  humour: the wisdom of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Senate was the more common subject of mens
  discourse; why they who were so profest friends to peace; (a thing so good for
  their Commonwealth, by means whereof they had so long continued to be thought
  rich and powerful, and for which the safety and grandezza of <hi>Italy</hi>
  seemed to be upheld by them;) why they (I say) should suffer themselves to be
  ingaged in war with the Archduke, for unnecessary and trivial things: in which
  war, to boot that they might be sure the German Princes and King of
  <hi>Spain</hi> would interest themselves, they should, to the prejudice of
  their reputation, make known the utmost bounds of their Forces; which proving
  short of what they were ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally thought to be, and not being such as that
  they were able at one and the same time to contest against the Archdukes and
  King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces, they should be inforced to run the same fortune
  with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and in a business of such weight and
  concernment depend upon his award and inclination, who if he should continue to
  disagree with the King might secure their affairs, and by agreeing might make
  them run great danger; many could therefore have desired that they had either
  been more circumspect in their resentment, or that after their first resentment
  they had used their wonted moderation in their Counsels; whereby their ends,
  hatreds and desires being tempered, they might have given way to the fair
  conditions which were present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer'd them; if for no other end, at least
  not to justifie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints which were made against the Commonwealth, as if
  she had moved in this, not to free the Gulf of Free-booters, but out of a
  de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of possessing her self of the Archdukes Dominions; and much more, to
  obviate the trouble and dangers which might result to her, to the Duke, and to
  all <hi>Italy</hi> by such commotions and troubles.</q>

of <hi>Spain,</hi> he feared he might hazzard not only the safety of the
States, but even the honour of that Crown for which he had been so hot in
taking up Arms: He was confounded at the disagreement in opinion of his men; he
suspected those who desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to be more cautious and circumspect, proposed
dangers and difficulties: He thought those rash, who incouraging him unto the
war, promised him assured victory; and having neither art nor expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in
the administration of war join'd to his natural judgment, he was altogether
perplex'd and irresolute in betaking himself to what was best for him to do,
and in chusing the best of many proposals made by his Commanders: The so great
number of those of various Nations who fought under his Banners added to his
anxiety; especially the Dutch, more numerous and fierce then the rest, and
consequently the harder to be govern'd according to the military Government:
That in proportion, the number of the Spaniards being but few, upon whom the
safety of the Empire leaning, it totter'd; the dissatisfaction of those of
<hi>Millain,</hi> who to boot with their former grievances, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready weary
of the present war, and attenuated by the former: And being invironed on all
sides by Forreigners, his thoughts were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd, not only with the
uncertainty of Battel, with the dissolving of his Army, and with the casualties
of war; but with the uncertain Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of his Officers, the mutinying of
Souldiers, the rebellion of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the peoples inclinations, the favour of
the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon the success of things, the hatred
of those of the Nation to the dominion of Forreigners; and finally, whatsoever
may happen to the prejudice of security in great commotions by the variety of
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Diving deep into such considerations, and considering truly how much
the placing the quiet and safety of affairs upon the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a Die was
a business which fell very short of all that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which the Duke pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ended unto; he began by practice to
know how wise and salutiferous their counsels had always been who had thought
the peace of <hi>Italy</hi> to be the surest foundation of the Spanish Empire:
He therefore began to call to mind the Instructions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:53250:82"/> which he had continually had from the Court; which as
being contrary to his then fervour, he valued but a little; and as if it had
been in his power yet to put on new resolves, he weighed the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of
affairs now when it was time to fight, as he had formerly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them when
it was time to make peace, with fiery thoughts bent upon war: So as having paid
the Souldiers, and made up his Musters; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, and not knowing what to do,
to the great admiration of all men, and to the great dislike of the
field-Officers and Army; he was like <hi>Cesar</hi> upon the Banks of
<hi>Rubicon,</hi> not being able to resolve of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving from his Quarters for
fear of worser commotions; yet at last his Souldiers perswasions prevailed, and
particularly <hi>Vives</hi> his Reasons, upon whose Authority he much relied;
so as he resolved to pass over the Sesia, and to go against the Duke: And
<hi>Ferdinando Mesia Gomes,</hi> Sergeant-Major of the Army, was a great
occasion thereof; who see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Governour so perplex'd and unresolved, said
roundly unto him, <hi>I will uphold, it though I were as sure to dye for it as
those who go to Preach the Catholick faith in</hi> England, <hi>if this Army do
not this day pass the River, the honour of the Spanish Nation will be here lost
with perpetual infamy;</hi> They therefore past over into <hi>Montferrat</hi>
by the Bridge at <hi>la Villata,</hi> on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi>
1616. that they might from thence enter <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> the more
commodiously, but otherwise resolved then before; for whereas before <hi>La
Mortara</hi> was to have entered by the way of <hi>Asti</hi> with 6000 Foot,
and 500 Horse; and with the Foot Militia, and <hi>Ales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandrian</hi> and
<hi>Tortonesse</hi> Horse; and Don <hi>Alphonso d' Avolos,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> with 3000 Foot, and 300 <hi>Montferrat</hi> Horse jointly
with him; and Don <hi>Pedro</hi> with the rest of the Army by the way of
<hi>Vercelli,</hi> presuming that the Duke, constrained to divide his Forces,
would be the weaker, and unable to stand against him in the field; now, his
mind be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ng altered, he went with
all his joint forces against the enemy: And therefore being past over the
Bridge he intended to quarter his Army between <hi>la Motta</hi> and <hi>Villa
Nova,</hi> to the end, that at the same time when the Van, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n were the best Souldiers and most
experienced Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in the Army should assault the Duke, who was intrench'd
at <hi>la Motta;</hi> the Reer should possess themselves of <hi>Villa
Nova,</hi> and drive out the French Horse which were Quartered there; But the
Duke prevented this designe; for lying in Ambush in a field of very high corn
that was on the left hand of the way as you go from <hi>Villa Nova</hi> to
<hi>la Motta,</hi> he assaulted some fore-runners and Musqueteers of the Van,
as they past over a little wooden Bridge which crosseth the way; which
happening unexpectedly and on the sudden, caused some confusion in the Spanish
Army; wherefore many of the Commanders advanced with part of their men; amongst
which were <hi>Gamboloita, Bravo, Prior Sforza,</hi> and the Prince of
<hi>Ascoli,</hi> who shewed much valour upon this occasion: By the coming in of
these the Skirmish increased, and held equal on both sides for the space of
four hours; for besides that the Cavalry was come in to assist the Duke from
<hi>Villa Nova,</hi> the situation proved likewise advantagious for him; the
Spaniards not being able by reason of the narrowness thereof, to make use of
all their Force.</p>
            <p>But at last the Assailants being much prejudiced by four pieces of
Artillery placed upon a little rise, they were forced to give back, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving 
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:53250:83"/> four Troops of Horse and two Bands of Musketeers on their
backs to make good the retreat, which was notwithstanding not done without some
disorder. There fell in this first conflict between four and five hundred of
the Dukes Foot, about sixty Horse, besides many that we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e wounded; of the Kings side about fifty, and as many
wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; amongst which <hi>Almarante delle Canarie,</hi> Son to the Prince of
<hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coli,</hi> and <hi>Lodovico Gambaloita,</hi> who having received a
sleight wound in the head with a Musket, before it was well cured died of other
disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to the general grief and dammage, being held by the Kings
Commanders to be of an approved valour, and good at Counsell. Many thought that
if the Duke had suffered the Van to pass, and had given upon the Battel in the
midst, which was weaker and more impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he had occasioned more loss and
disorder; and on the other side, that if the Governour had sent a Squadron
beyond the Rivulet which was on the right hand, and assaulted the Duke on the
Flank, he had not only hindred his retreat, but totally d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>feated him. But humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does not always foresee
what is best; and in actions of War con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, danger, and too much
forwardness, blind the Understanding, and disturb Reason. The Governour lay all
that night with the Army in the place where the Battel was given, and the Duke
in the Trenches of <hi>la Motta,</hi> which he abandoned the next day, and
causing <hi>Villa nova</hi> to be burnt, and the Country thereabouts, as well
his own as that of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> he retreated with his Horse, which was
come from <hi>Villa nova,</hi> into <hi>Assigliano,</hi> neerer
<hi>Vercelles,</hi> in great haste, for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assaulted, to his
disadvantage, in the Fields of <hi>Carenzana;</hi> but his fear was vain; for
the Governour growing more wary by the last un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected assault, and fearing
lest he might be drawn into those dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers into which the Duke did not much
care to precipitate himself, thought it became him to be the more circumspect,
by how much he found his Adversary to be the more adventurous; so forbearing to
pursue him, and possessing himself of <hi>la Motta,</hi> and
<hi>Carenzana,</hi> and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter some Cannon shot, of <hi>Stroppiana,</hi> he
tarried there some days, being detained by the rain; and on the contrary, the
Duke being incouraged by the Governours circumspection, sent his Horse into a
plain, between a certain wood and <hi>Stroppiana,</hi> to the end that
insulting there he might incourage his men, who were not a little dismaied; and
giving mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest signs of undauntedness and valour, might redeem the loss of

               </gap>: Nor did his resolution
prove unlucky; for though when it was given out in the Spanish Army, that the
Duke came on with the gross of his Army, the Battaglions were set in order, and
the Horse were ready to sally out upon him, yet the whole matter being quickly
known, the Prince of <hi>Ascoli</hi> with Spanish caution ordered, that every

upon a bank at <hi>Mortara,</hi> from whence they might commodiously defend

the midst of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Montferrat,</hi> over against <hi>Verrua,</hi> a
Town which though seated up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the opposite bank belongs notwithstanding to the
Duke; so as the River which comes from the Territories of <hi>Turin,</hi> and
enters immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately into <hi>Montferrat,</hi> running all along the length
thereof, would be Navigable from the State of <hi>Millain</hi> to that City,
were not the Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation hindred by its being inclosed between <hi>Verrua</hi>
and <hi>Crescentino,</hi> as between two hedges; so as Victual nor Ammunition
could not be brought to the Spanish Army, if it were to enter into
<hi>Piedmont</hi> by <hi>Montferrat,</hi> unless they should be first masters
of one of these two places; They making much for the conveniency and
inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the Armies advancing, the Governour resolved to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
master of them: he therefore marched from <hi>Stroppiana,</hi> going a little
above <hi>Costanza,</hi> but in so little good order, as certainly if the Duke
had known it, and would have hazzarded, he might undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have cut the Reer
in pieces, which march'd at a good distance from the Body of the Army: but the
great advantage in Forces which makes Commanders sometimes careless, suffers
their errours sometimes also to go unpunished: they might easily have gone in
one days march from <hi>Costanza</hi> to <hi>Crescentino;</hi> and the
Governour might doubtlesly have gotten into it, and made himself master
thereof, it being but weakly garrison'd, if he had march'd directly on. The
Duke knew the danger, and apprehending it, thought it necessary to be
prevented: but the resolution was far more easily taken, then exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: for he
who will go from <hi>Assigliano</hi> and <hi>Ruisecco</hi> (whither the Duke
coasting along the Spanish Army was come) will get into <hi>Crescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,</hi>
must either pass by the Enemies Army, or else must go far about, and as it were
by a bow, on the upper side. The Governour then who march'd in a direct line,
must either come before <hi>Crescentino</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke, or incountering
him in his march, must fight him upon great advantage: the rains moreover were
at this time very great; and many gullets of water which cross'd the way by
which the Duke was necessarily to march, being swollen by the rain, were almost
not to be past over, especially by the Foot; but necessity made that possible
which seemed impossible; and Fortune, which is often a friend to cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
resolutions, did miraculously favour the Dukes aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>irs in this so difficult a case; for having sent his
Baggage and other incumbrances to <hi>Vercelli,</hi> whither he feigned to
retreat, he suddenly went at the first watch of the night from
<hi>Ruisecco,</hi> and being cover'd by the darkness, and by the rain which
poured down, he march'd till day with incredible speed; and having past over
all the gullets of water, being therein assisted by his Horse, he got at last a
little after day break to <hi>Crescentino,</hi> weary

lessen'd in his numbers, by the tedious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <pb n="154" facs="tcp:53250:84"/> of the

way, only that he might have better quarters for his Army that night. So as not
going by a line, as he ought to have done, but marching in a semi-circle,
contrary to where the Duke went, he lost not only the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of getting
into <hi>Crescentino,</hi> but of a signal Victory: when the Van went early the
next morning from <hi>Trino,</hi> it might see the Dukes Reer two miles before
entring into <hi>Crescentino;</hi> and having no order to fight, did not
ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ult it. This action of the
Dukes was really very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and singular; whether you consider the boldness
of the resolution, or the diligence of the execution, or the happy success
thereof; but chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>fly, if you

               </gap>irs which would have hapned if
<hi>Crescentino</hi> had been lost. The Governour having lost this design went
towards <hi>Livorno</hi> and <hi>Bianza,</hi> two Towns of the
<hi>Canavese,</hi> not above two miles distant one from another: in which march

<hi>Francisco,</hi> son to the Embassadour <hi>Vives,</hi> prisoner, whose
Horse, as he advanced somewhat before the rest, fell, and he himself was sorely
wounded in the neck; and some carriage of the chief Commanders fell also into
the Dukes hands. The Duke suspected that the Governour would go from
<hi>Bianza</hi> &amp; <hi>Livorno,</hi> to <hi>Chivasso</hi> a great Town in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> upon the back of <hi>Crescentino;</hi> wherefore he caused a

Enemies A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

before their eyes, Towns of <hi>Montferrat</hi> neer the <hi>Poe,</hi> together
with almost all the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vese;</hi> and gave order to the Cardinal, his
son, to go from <hi>Turin,</hi> and take <hi>Vulpiano,</hi> a place not far
from that City; and those of <hi>Lauriano</hi> and of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Sebastian</hi>
killing his Keeper of the Castle, he put them both to fire and sword: thinking
that if those people were not made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the others would not forbear to
do the like upon any sleight occasion. Thus miserable <hi>Montferrat</hi> being
exposed to the Dukes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, was in the midst of the Enemies and of the
Protectors Forces, affor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ing
quarter to the latter out of good will, and to the former out of fear: nor
durst the people thereof for fear of severe punishment, which was duly executed
upon them, move or anger the Duke, who by rigour had made the way as open to
him there, as through his own S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ate: the rains continued still, and the season was very bad for the
F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eld; so as the Governour could
not only not attempt any of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises suspected by the Duke, but being
by the rigidness of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lie idle some days in <hi>Livorno</hi> and
<hi>Bianza,</hi> began to want Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. He resolved therefore to go to St.
<hi>Germano,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Inurea,</hi> weak Towns, but
capacious, and of fruitful Territories; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the Duke would either
go, or not go, from <hi>Crescentino;</hi> if he should go, he would be in
manifest danger of being routed, his men being much lessened<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so the
Governour proving victorious, might have free way to advance without any
opposition, and attempt whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <pb n="155" facs="tcp:53250:84"/> enterprise; if he
should not go out, he might easily take those two Towns; which when he should
have done, the whole Country on this side the <hi>Dora</hi> even to
<hi>Vercelli</hi> would be at his disposal; where he might not only quarter his
Army commodiously all the succeeding Winter; but the City of <hi>Vercelli,</hi>
as being cut off from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and excluded from any succour, would
without any danger or effusion of blood fall that Winter into his hands. The
design would have been more easily effected, then discoursed, if continuing the
same begun ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution he he had persevered in the same mind; or if the
Governour making use of the occasion, and of the good success of Victory which
he got afterwards, had prosecuted it with the like vigour; for the Army being
gone from <hi>Livorno</hi> and <hi>Bianzo,</hi> and in his passage taken
<hi>Santia,</hi> a Town that is now open, and of no moment, but formerly famous
for having resisted the Spanish Army, when it was fortified: and leaving 4000
Dutch there in Garrison, rather to free himself from the fear of their
numerousness, then out of any need of keeping it garrisoned, the Governour went
with his Camp to St. <hi>Germano;</hi> where the Garrison having withstood the
battery a while, yielded on the third day: and the Duke having burnt
<hi>Bianza,</hi> for that having dared to resist him, one of his best
Commanders was slain before it, he went to <hi>Vinarie,</hi> a place which
stands on the way as you go from <hi>Trino</hi> to St. <hi>Germano,</hi> from
whence he hindred the Enemy from Victuals, without abandoning
<hi>Crescentino,</hi> or bereaving himself of that refuge, and hoping that his
men would be constant in defending St. <hi>Germano;</hi> he hoped to make the
Governour rise from before it for famine; wherefore to incourage the
defendants, and let them know that he was come, he tarried there and fired his
Cannon, but all in vain; for at the same time that he came to the
<hi>Vinarie,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Germano</hi> surrendred; where at the Duke was so

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as he put the Governour
thereof to death, because he had yielded the Town to the Enemy, having promised
to hold it out much longer. And yet the Governour keeping three days in St.
<hi>Germano</hi> had such sca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>city
of Victuals, as even his chief Commanders were fain to feed upon dead horse
flesh; for the Duke keeping his station kept the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from Provision; and the
Governour who detested fighting resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to move from thence. But at last,
inforc'd by famine, or for shame to see himself as it were besieged, he left
<hi>Antonio Mastrillo, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racciolo's</hi> Serjeant-major, in St.
<hi>Germano</hi> with 500 Foot, and marched towards the Duke:
<hi>Castelmerlino</hi> stands between <hi>Crescentino</hi> and <hi>le
Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie,</hi> a very little towards which the Army marched, out of a double
end; that they might without disturbance receive Victuals there from
<hi>Trino,</hi> and to keep the Duke from Victuals, who being excluded
<hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centino,</hi> by the loss of that place, would be brought into the
same streights whereinto he had a little before brought the Enemy: and
therefore moved by his disadvantage he marched to give battel: to avoid the
which, when the Duke saw the Enemy coming, he marched towards the Abby of
<hi>Lucidio,</hi> thinking to get beforehand into <hi>Crescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino:</hi> but he
could not march so fast but that the Spanish Van fell upon his Reer;
notwithstanding which skirmish the Duke march'd on, till being overtaken by the
night he was forced to lodge that night in the said Abby; and the Governour in
some small Cottages not far <pb n="156" facs="tcp:53250:85"/> off, where the Souldiers
being famish'd for want of Victuals at St. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano,</hi> suffer'd also
very much by cold that night. The next day the Duke not being able to march so
early as he intended, by reason of some hindrances, and not having with him
above ten or twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, and about 1200 Horse, he pursued his way in
this manner: the Artillery and Ammunition was placed in the Van, the Baggage in
the middle; on the left hand, where there was more field-room, the Horse; on
the right hand, where it was more wooddy, the French Foot Regiments; led on by
<hi>Chricchy</hi> and <hi>Orfe;</hi> the Reer, led on by Count <hi>Guido,</hi>
was mixt of Italians, Piedmontans, and Savoiards, and it had in it the best
Souldiers, and most experienced Commanders of the whole Army; and the Country
through which they march'd being full of bushes, Count <hi>Guido</hi> placed
Musketeers in some of them, to the end that they might keep the Enemy from
hindering them in their march; if these Musk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>teers should be assaulted, they were to retreat to oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r bushes which were on their backs;
and thus to continue the fight that they might hold the Enemy play as long as
possibly they might. When the Governour knew what way the Duke marched, he
resolved to pursue him; and sending part of his Cavalry before with 1800 Foot
<hi>en Croupe</hi> to assault him on the Reer, he himself followed after with
the rest of the Army: those who march'd before had much ado to drive the
defendants out of the bushes; yet overcoming them at the last, they got up to
the Reer; for the Dukes Van being come to some narrow p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ssages, kept the rest of the Army from advancing, so as
he could not get to <hi>Crescentino</hi> without disturbance, as he hoped to
have done. The Reer being assaulted made their part good against the Enemy; and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending themselves honourably for a while, did not only resist them with
advantage, but repulst them: the Battaglions of the Spanish Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were this
me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n while advanced, led on by
<hi>Gironymo Pimontello,</hi> and <hi>Gironymo Rho,</hi> who though they saw
that their men who were beaten back by the Dukes Reer could hardly keep the
field, yet having no precise order, and the Governour being two miles behind,
they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to fight bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>
slowly: when Don <hi>Alphonso Pimontello,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour <hi>Vives,</hi>
and Cavalier <hi>Melzi</hi> coming in, and not being able to indure that their
men should be beaten for want of help, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Captains of the
Battaglions to fall on, without expecting any other orders, assuring them that
the Governour would approve thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>: by whose words and authority being inheartned, the Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glions
charged furiously, and routed the Dukes Reer, who not able to withstand so
fierce a shock, gave back; and at the same time Count <hi>Sults,</hi> not
expecting any orders, assaulted the French Regiments with his Dutch furiously
on the Flank; whose fear the Duke foresee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was come himself unto them,
earnestly exhorting them to stand fast, to keep their ranks, and incouraging
them to fight: but words prevailed not where valour was wanting:
<hi>Cricchi</hi>'s Regiment made some resistance; but <hi>Castiglions</hi>
Regiment which was led on by <hi>Orfe,</hi> not daring to look the Enemy in the
face, much less to stand the fierce and close assault of the Dutch, threw away
their Arms shamefully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they came to blows, and ran: and if instead of
pursuing them the Dutch had fallen on upon the main body of the Battel, the 
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:53250:85"/> Dukes Army had not been only discomfited that day, but
wholly routed.</p>
            <p>This success had the Battel of <hi>Lucedio,</hi> which lasted for
the space of five hours; wherein there fell not above 100 of the Kings men, and
about as many were wounded: Of the Dukes party there was above 400 slain, and
above 1000 sorely hurt; amongst which 15 Captains, and one French Collonel: The
Governours men took eleven Foot Colours, and three Horse Ensignes; and many of
those who fled were miserably slain by the Country people of
<hi>Montferrat:</hi> So as though there were not many that dy'd by the Sword in
the Conflict, there were but few that kept with their Colours, or who retreated
with the Duke into <hi>Crescentino;</hi> whither the Duke being gotten, he was
very diligent in assembling them together who were dispers'd abroad, and had
aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him: Nor did his ill fortune cease here; for the Marquess of
<hi>Mortara</hi> entering the <hi>Langhe</hi> with 2000 Dutch, with Cavalier
<hi>Pecchios</hi>'s Brigade, and with the Alessandrian and Tortonesse Horse and
Foot, took <hi>Canelli, Cortemiglia, Calosso,</hi> and other neighbouring
places; there being none to withstand him in the field, nor to defend those
pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: And not long after Don <hi>Sanchio di Luna</hi> took
<hi>Gattinara,</hi> and other neighbouring places, with the men of
<hi>Millain,</hi> and block'd up the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to <hi>Vercelli</hi> on that
side; which City, being invironed by the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories of <hi>Montferrat</hi>
and <hi>Millain,</hi> and being streightned by the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the new Fort
of <hi>Sandovalle, Trino,</hi> St. <hi>Germano,</hi> and <hi>Gattinara,</hi>
was as it were besieged. A Gally was also parted from <hi>Genoa</hi> toward
<hi>Monaco,</hi> with monies for Monsieur <hi>di Boglio,</hi> a Lord of many
Castles between the Confines of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> who having
always for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly adhered to the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> began upon some new
distastes to waver in his former friendship; and having at present entertained
new intelligence with the Governour, promised to infest the Dukes Territories
on that side; who, the affairs of <hi>Savoy</hi> not being yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, had
his Dominions molested on five sides, himself being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely routed in the
field, and having lost most of his men: And that these so sad accidents might
be accompanied with very sad circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> who
was the only prop and stay of the Dukes affairs, was some few days before, by
order fromthe King, accused to be guilty of high Treason, and imprisoned in
<hi>Paris;</hi> so as the Government of that Court being altered, wherein the
Duke did confide; and the Princes of the Kingdom, who were his friends, being
alienated from the King, they raised men to provide for their own affairs; and
filling <hi>France</hi> with civil wars they could not only not succour the
Duke in this his so great distress; but many of them who were come from
<hi>France</hi> desired leave to be gone, being drawn either by their own
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests, or for that they hoped for better entertainment there. The common
opinion was, That the Duke being thus prosecuted by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune would not be able
to bear it, and less able to withst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nd so great a violence; and that therefore being dejected in mind,
and out of hope of ever making head again, he would lay down Arms, and
indeavour some kind of peace: And yet, though over-laid, not overcome with such
an accumulation of evils, and so great adversity; he, with a couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mind,
was not daunted nor dismaid amidst so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ny misfortunes: <pb n="158" facs="tcp:53250:86"/> For relying upon

<hi>Mortara, Luna,</hi> or <hi>Boglio</hi> could do against his lesser Holds,
which being lost by war would be recove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed by peace: So as he began forthwith to make new
Rampiers and Bulwarks about <hi>Crescentino;</hi> But on the other side,
holding it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to allay that fortune by industry, and by cunning to lull
those Forces asleep which he could not possibly then withstand, he procured
Monsieur <hi>Lodovisio,</hi> (who of an Archbishop was then made Cardinal, and
continued in the same Nuntiature) and the French Embassadour, should go to the
Governour and treat of peace: He sent along with these some discreet Gentlemen
and Officers, as followers of the Embassadour, to the end that they might pry
into the enemies ways, and into the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders intentions; And also that
making the Rout to seem greater by their speeches, they might cunningly make it
be believed that the war was at an end; and that the Duke not being able to
resist any longer was reduced to such a condition, as he could no longer refuse
any conditions of peace; which he knew the Governour would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace more
willingly then war: But there needed not so much cunning; for <hi>Don Pietro di
Toledo,</hi> who was already weary of war, and heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the noise of
Drums and Trumpets, and was therefore desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of repose, wanted not those who
either for that they thought it made for the Kings service, or (as it was
afterwards laid to their charge at Court) out of secret intelligence held with
the Duke, advised the Governour to use his victory moderately, telling him,
<hi>That the French were overcome, and the Duke so weakened, as he could no
longer hold up his head; so as he must be forced to consent to any whatsoever
conditions: That therefore he ought to proceed very warily in hazzarding the
affairs of the Crown in</hi> Italy; <hi>if by unseasonable prosecuting the war
he should once more draw the French over, and make a change in the minds of the
Princes of</hi> Italy; <hi>who though they might be content to see the Duke
receive a blow, yet not being able to see him totally ruined, it was to be
believed they would easily resent it: That as the Dukes suppression increased,
the envy, hatred, and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies of other Princes would increase; That
therefore it was a wise advice, To be content with an indifferent Victory, and
not to lose what was already gotten, out of a desire of getting more: That he
had been sufficiently victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in so short a time, sufficiently triumphant;
and that now there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no more for him to do, then answerably to the
Kings mind, to secure peace upon such conditions as might be tolerable to the
Duke.</hi> The Prince of <hi>Ascoli</hi> was t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e chief, nay, only Authour of this; a fatal Counsellor, that the
Duke being reduced to great extremities might have opportunity to raise himself
up again. This Prince being till then much suspected by the Governour, for the
power and streight intelligence he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had with <hi>Inoiosa,</hi> by
these his flattering speeches got into great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with the Governour; and his
counsel was afterwards the more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by the Cardin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ls and Embassadours coming to the Camp, and by the

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es spred abroad in the Army
by the Dukes Spies: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governour being tickled to hear himself
stiled Triumphant and Conquerour, would no longer listen to <hi>Vives</hi> his
counsel, nor that of others, who weighing the state of affairs better, and the
Dukes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, thought it necessary to pursue the victory, and not to afford
the <pb n="159" facs="tcp:53250:86"/> Enemy time to breathe: they told him that a good war
was the best way to come by a good peace; but all this was to no purpose. The
Cardinal and the Embassadour came to Don <hi>Piedro</hi> at <hi>Tricerro,</hi>
and desired him that he would let them know his intention touching the
composing of the present affairs. Don <hi>Piedro,</hi> in a haughty manner,
like a Conquerer, answered, that they were to discover what the Duke was minded
to do, and then to acquaint him with it: they therefore returned to
<hi>Crescentino,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Chivasso,</hi> whither the Duke
having found the Governours inclination to an agreement was come: under
pretence of well considering the state of affairs, he spun out the Treaty at
length, to the end that he might the mean while find where that storm would
fall, and that he might have the longer time to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the proceedings of
such Princes as were his friends, in whom the remainder of his hopes lay; for
about this time Monsieur <hi>de Verdon</hi> was come to him from
<hi>France,</hi> being sent by the King and Queen of <hi>France,</hi> to
acquaint him with the Prince of <hi>Conde's</hi> imprisonment; and perhaps to
keep him their friend, in this so great commotion of the Kingdom, and to
promise the favour and assistance of the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> In
<hi>Savoy</hi> things were in a way to composition; for <hi>Nemours</hi> being
abandoned by all assistance, and shut up with his men by Prince
<hi>Victorio</hi> in barren Rocks, where they had not whereof to live, and
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also restrained by <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Burgony,</hi> was forced to
yield-to the composition which Monsieur <hi>le Grand,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Burgony,</hi> did then interpose himself on the Kings behalf, wherein he
was accompanied by Monsieur <hi>di Lazai,</hi> Privy Counsellor to the King:
and those commotions being appeased, the Prince was infallibly expected with
many Souldiers. Marshal <hi>Deguieres</hi> was also expected with a great
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance both of Foot and Horse, who was very diligently preparing for his
journey; and <hi>Boglio</hi> being become a Client of the Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ad newly
taken him into its protection, had refused moneys from <hi>Spain,</hi> or to
hold intelligence with the Spaniards: <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara</hi> who was entred the
Langhe with much fervour, having placed almost all his Souldiers in Garrisons
in the places which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and not being able to keep the Militia of
the Country any longer together, was grown cooler; so as betaking himself to
pillage the fields, and neighbouring Towns, he minded more enriching himself,
then making war; and the Venetians, whose affairs declined in <hi>Friuli,</hi>
fearing that when the Duke should be quite overthrown, their turns would be
next, began to be more open-handed, and to disburse mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys more freely for the
recruting of his Army; and did moreover oblige themselves to pay unto him a
certain sum of money during the war, which as they say, was 8000 crowns a
moneth. The Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby incouraged began to reassume his former State,
and to stand with the Governour, not only upon what was necessary, but even
upon punctillios of honour; wherefore after having kept the Cardinal and the
Embassadour some days with him, and not being willing nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that any
overtures should proceed from him, suffer'd them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Governour,
who was then in <hi>Trino,</hi> to whom, not by way of any order from the Duke,
but as it were of themselves, they told him in substance, though in good and
handsome terms; <hi>That if he <pb n="160" facs="tcp:53250:87"/> would go with his Army out
of</hi> Piedmont, <hi>they thought by what they might learn by the speech they
had had with the Duke, that being desirous of peace he would cashier all the
French, save such as were his own domesticks; always provided, that both the
Kings would pass their words to him, that he should be kept undempnified both
in life and State; that he would be the first that should restore what had been
taken, if he might be secured that the like should be immediately done to him,
and that the Governour would dismiss all the Dutch, Swissers, and some Troops
of Horse: And in the last place, in their Princes name, they demanded his
paroll for the Venetians security, whilst the King by his Embassadours should
treat of composing differences with the Archduke.</hi> Conditions, which, to
say the truth, were sufficiently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious for the Articles of
<hi>Asti,</hi> and such, as had the Duke been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious, he could not well
have demanded better; yet the Governour answered moderately enough: <hi>That
the King did not alter his mind by success, who did not aspire after the Dukes
Dominions, but only by War to secure peace in</hi> Italy; <hi>and therefore
offering to restore immediately what had been taken, when the Duke should have
done the like, he demanded that the two Dukes should set down their differences
in writing, and refer the decision thereof to the Emperour, passing their words
reciprocally not to offend one another: That the Duke should disarm totally; in
point whereof he offered to stand to what they should say in the names of the
Pope and of the King of</hi> France. <hi>This being observed, he promised to
free the Dukes State, and to retreat with his Army into the State of</hi>
Millain: <hi>He denied that the King was bound by the Articles of</hi> Asti
<hi>to lay down Arms, and therefore denying absolutely to enter into the like
obligation, he added, that when</hi> Italy <hi>should be in peace, the King,
who aid abound in his own natural Militia, would need no Forreigners. He
consented to pass his paroll for the Dukes indempnity, but not for the
Venetians, in whose affairs, as not being comprehended within the Articles
of</hi> Asti, <hi>he said, the King of</hi> France <hi>was not to intermeddle;
and that therefore this was no place to treat thereof, nor had he any
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to do so.</hi> It was hard in effect for the Duke, whilst the Enemy
was armed in his own Dominions, to lay down those Arms which he had with such
resentment re-assumed, as not able to endure that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour should keep
armed in the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> And on the other side, it might seem
strange, that the Governour who was entred <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> with intention to
make the Duke lay down Arms, should suffer himself to be treated as if he had
been overcome, by leaving the Duke in Arms, and going cut of <hi>Piedmont</hi>
just when he was possess'd of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: And therefore both of them standing
pertinaciously not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to what was proposed by each other, it was
thought to be impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to perfect the business; it was requisite therefore
to cut this knot in two with the Sword, which seemed to be so hard to untye by
Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But the Governour, who abounded then in Forces, wanted will; and
the Duke who wanted Forces was very willing; and the Cardinal and Embassadour
keeping the Treaty on Foot, and giving continual hopes that they would return
with more moderate proposals, suffered not the Negotiation to be broken
off.</p>
            <p>The Duke this mean while fearing the Enemies Forces every day less
then other, and his hopes of approaching aid encreasing, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
sufficiently assured of the Governours no great inclination to fight, 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:53250:87"/> and of the desire he had to return to <hi>Millain;</hi>
and being encouraged by the many disorders which he knew was in the Enemies
Army, would not go a jot less from his first demands; but sharpening his wits
about the interpretation of the Articles of <hi>Asti,</hi> he pretended that
the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians were therein comprehended, at least under that head, where it
was provided that the Kings Forces should not cause jealousie in the Italian
Princes; he therefore demanded that the King should be bound to secure them.
This mean while two moneths past on without any action, though the weather,
which had been very bad till the battle of <hi>Lucedio,</hi> turn'd to be
extraordinarily fair, and therefore very fit for the field; in which time had
not the Negotiation of peace, or the Governours backwardness, fomented by the
advice of others, slackened and almost taken the edge from off the Kings
Forces, they would certainly have made important progress, and the Duke might
peradventure have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to such conditions as he could not be brought unto
by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal nor Embassadour: In which time the Spanish Army being no less
wearied in mind through idleness, then in body by labour and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, did
diminish very much, many of them daily dying, many run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away; for the
Countrey round about was desolate, and not able to feed them, and the horse
were fain to go daily ten miles for forrage, and after so many mile returning
were very much weakened: The Heads of the Army disagreed in opinion, and were
not only unsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied one with another, but all of them were much displeased
with the Governour, whose authority grew to be as little valued by the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders as by the common Souldiers; so as all Military Discipline be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
given over, all obedience lost, and all respect, all was full of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and
confusion: To this was added the want of monies; for the Army having been at
vast expence, none came from <hi>Spain</hi> where the War was abomina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed; nor were those of the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Millain,</hi> who were already exhausted, able to furnish
sufficient for the daily present need; and <hi>Don Piedro</hi> himself expected
nothing more then that the season, contrary to the natural course of Winter,
should alter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming less cold, might afford him a fair pretence to
retreat. On the other side, the Dukes affairs increased in reputation; he
received plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of money from the Venetians, and abounded in men; for Prince
<hi>Victorio</hi> having at last composed the affairs of <hi>Savoy</hi> had
brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 5000 Foot into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and 600 Horse; some whereof
were his own, some belonging to <hi>Nemours;</hi> and Marshal
<hi>Deguieres</hi> was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther already come thither, or being come out of
<hi>Dolpheny,</hi> was ready to come; and all the whole people of <hi>Piedmont
(a singular example of the Subjects duty to their natural Prince)</hi> flocking
diligently thither, were most ready to succour him; so as the Duke raised like
another <hi>Auteus</hi> from his mother Earth, was grown more vigorous then at
first; and being superiour to the Governour in Horse, was Master of the Field.
At last <hi>Don Piedro,</hi> who was better pleased with peace, though upon bad
conditions, then to continue in the danger, trouble, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of War,
seeing the Dukes obdurancy, and thinking he should have done enough, if in the
conclusion of the Peace he should have excluded the power of <hi>France,</hi>
had at last, though too la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e and
in vain, recourse to the Cardinal; to whom he profess'd he was ready to
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <pb n="162" facs="tcp:53250:88"/> businesses with the Duke by his means, in any
whatsoever man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yea even with passing his word for the Venetians security;
and therefore desired him that he would return to the Duke, and bring back with
him the final conclusion of Peace: A thing which being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards known did
not a little incense the King, and the whole Court of <hi>France.</hi>
Wherefore the Embassadour, by particular order from the King, demanded that the
Governour should send an Embassadour in extraordinary to <hi>Paris;</hi> where
the Kings aim was, that the whole business of Peace might be carried on by his
own proper interest. But the Duke, under pretence that he would not alter a
tittle of the Articles of <hi>Asti</hi> without the consent of the Princes who
did intervene therein, excused himself; and so the Treaty of Peace broke
totally off, to the small liking of the Cardinal and Embassadour, who seeming
little pleased with the Governour, gave over the Treaty, and return'd, the one
to <hi>Turin,</hi> and the other to the Charter-house at <hi>Pavia:</hi> And
the cold coming on, and the earth wholly covered with snow, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
resolved to return to the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> having notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
fortified St. <hi>Germano,</hi> and left <hi>Thomaso Caracciola</hi> there with
his Brigade, and distributed part of the Army into <hi>Trino, Pontestura,</hi>
and other Towns of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> not without the Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi>'s consent, who being then come to <hi>Casalle</hi> could not
refuse it: He more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over gave order to the Dutch at <hi>Santia,</hi> that they
should abandon that Town, and burn it, to the end that the Enemy might not
possess him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of it. He returned afterwards about the beginning of Winter
with the rest of his Army into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and with his
Horse, which did not amount to 700, worthy to be commended rather for his good
inclination to keep up the honour and grandezza of his King, than for any happy
success, which he himself marr'd by his so many ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolutions; it being most
certain, that not being able to behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self as victorious, he afterwards
allow'd the Duke field-room enough to treat with him as Conquerour: Being
retreated he quarter'd the rest of his Army in the Towns of <hi>Lomellina,</hi>
and he himself went to <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza,</hi> near the <hi>Poe,</hi> where
re-assuming his warlike mind, when it was now no longer time to do it, he
thought the Spring was too long a coming on, which he much desired, that he
might once more (as he publickly professed) re-assault <hi>Piedmont</hi> more
vigorously, and with greater resolution: But he forbore not this mean while to
streighten <hi>Vercelli,</hi> hoping that by the falling thereof into his hands
this Winter, it might open the way unto him the next Spring to greater and more
important Enterprizes which he had designed. The Prince of <hi>Messe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano</hi>
was Master of a small State beyond the <hi>Sesia,</hi> between
<hi>Vercelli</hi> and <hi>Gattinara,</hi> even almost in the Duke of
<hi>Savoys</hi> mouth, and as the neighbourhood of greater Princes is always,
if not troublesome, at least suspected by those who are lesser; the Prince of
<hi>Messerano</hi> out of both these respects was not well satisfied with the
Duke: Being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to free himself from the Dukes continual molestations,
and to keep from worse, he treated with the Governour to put himself into the
King of <hi>Spains</hi> protection, and upon certain conditions to receive a
Spanish Garrison; which conditions, together with the desired prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
being easily granted him, by reason of the great opportunity 
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:53250:88"/> which was thereby had of approaching nearer, and of
streightening <hi>Vercelli</hi> more; therefore the agreement being made, the
Prince was presently required to receive in the Garrison: But he proceeding
cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, would not admit of them till such time as the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> had allowed the conditions; and whilst expedition from
<hi>Spain</hi> was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slowed, the Duke got a hint of the business; so
thinking prevention to be the only remedy against so eminent a danger, he sent
Prince <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorio</hi> in the <hi>Christmas</hi> holy-days with 5000 Foot
and 1000 Horse, to secure himself of the Principality. The Town of
<hi>Messerano</hi> yielded presently to the Prince <hi>Victorio;</hi> for the
Princess of the place, her husband being absent, fearing lest the Town might be
burnt, and she and her seven children slain, surrendered the Town upon certain
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. He went then to <hi>Gattinara,</hi> and having plaid upon it with
his Artillery in vain, he was forced to quit the Enterprize, either out of
sickness which besell himself, or for that he heard the Governour was gone from
<hi>Valenza</hi> to <hi>Romagnano</hi> intending to relieve it. Being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to <hi>Messerano,</hi> and forced to tarry there a while by reason of his
sickness, he sent a French Captain with a great many both Horse and Foot to
attempt <hi>Creppacuore,</hi> a place of the same Principality; whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the
Princess was fled, and had received in a Spanish Garrison of 1000 Foot under
the Sergeant <hi>Francisco Bernardine Vertua;</hi> from whence the French being
after a sleight assault beaten back, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to certain Cottages not
far off; where whilst they thought themselves secure, they were unexpectedly
surprised by Don <hi>Alphonso Pimontello;</hi> who falling upon them
couragiously with some Foot and Horse in those Cottages, routed them, and slew
200 of them, and took 200 more prisoners, together with their Captain: The
Prince being recovered resolved to make the same attempt of
<hi>Creppacruore</hi> with a greater force and with more men sent unto him by
his Father; the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whereof (it being invironed with steep Clif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s and high Rocks) proved very
difficult by reason of the inconvenience of bringing Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non thither; and yet
he went with 8000 Foot, and 400 Horse, and taking the places round about it,
and particularly such from whence it might be relieved, he began to skirmish
with them that were within from a Hill, which being very near and very high,
commanded the Town; and the Cannon coming the next day he began the Battery;
and having made a sufficient breach he fell to an assault, which he did with
such violence, as those within abandoned the Town without making much
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, and retreated to the Castle; which being presently plaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by
four pieces of Cannon came to composition: But some diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences arising
touching the performance of Articles, the Battery was again begun more
furiously then before and from a more fitting place; Prince <hi>Victorio</hi>
being not a little incens'd, who thought himself mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Captains
cavelling; the Battery continuing some days still more bitterly, the defendants
not trusting to their forces, yielded up the Castle on condition the Princess
and her childrens lives should be saved, and that the Garrison should be
permitted to march out only with their Arms, but without bullet, powder or
match; which whilst all was faithfully performed, two Barrels of powder fell
unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on fire, and burnt many of those that had surrendered, and many
who <pb n="164" facs="tcp:53250:89"/> for fear threw themselves over the wall, could not
escape their fate; the rest who escaped the misfortune, went to the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> being convoyed by four Troops of Horse, according to the
Articles of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; where <hi>Verrua</hi> being condemn'd to dye, suffer'd
for having defended the Town no better.</p>
            <p>The Governour knowing by experience that his men might long make
good the Town, had sent Don <hi>Sanchio di Luna</hi> with succour to
<hi>Creppacuore,</hi> who finding the passes well fortified, and not being able
to come to <hi>Creppacuore,</hi> the surrender whereof he heard not of, without
worsting them, he began to intrench himself within Musket shot of Prince
<hi>Victorio</hi>'s Fortifications; and whilest he was discovering the Sconces
there happened a sleight Skirmish, which afterwards increased by the coming in
of men of both parties, wherein, whilest Don <hi>Sanchio</hi> fought valiantly,
advancing with a Pike in his hand, he was shot with two Musket bullets, and
fell down dead immediately; and <hi>Carlo di Sanguine,</hi> Camp-Master to a
Brigado of Neapolitans, was taken Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, together with a Nephew of his, one
Captain being sla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n, and another
taken prisoner, the Kings men retreated to within the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers, and afterwards
hearing the Town was surrendred, retreated to the rest of his men: But the
Marshal <hi>Deguieres</hi> being at last come to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with about
8000, (what Foot, what Horse,) amongst which were many of the <hi>Gens d' Arms
des Ordonnances</hi> of the Kingdom, who carried the Kings own Ensigns; the
Duke increasing in power and reputation, since it appeared that the King of
<hi>France</hi> adhered unto him with display'd Banners, was not idle; being
become superiour in Horse, he over-ran the Country, and, without meeting with
any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, was Master of the Field; hearing of the taking of
<hi>Messarano</hi> and <hi>Creppacuore,</hi> he being desirous to do somewhat

opposition save what was made by <hi>Mortara</hi> in the Langhe, who had hardly
men enough to Garrison the places he had taken: The Duke therefore commanded
Count <hi>Guido</hi> to go with all his men from <hi>Asti</hi> to <hi>San
Damiano,</hi> where he, and the two Princes, <hi>Victorio</hi> and
<hi>Thomaso,</hi> and the Marshal <hi>Deguie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> met, with a great train
of Horse, Foot, and Artillery; and having presently possess'd themselves of the
hills, and placed 24 Bombards in several convenient places, they began a
furious battery on four sides of the Town, wherein there were no Souldiers,
save such as were of the common people of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> under Captain
<hi>Andrea Prand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

slain by the fall of a house which was beaten down: The Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers being left
without a Commander, whilest they ran with more cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage than order to defend
the place which was assaulted, left the rest of the Town unprovided of defence;
which disorder the Captains of the French Horse perceiving, they commanded
their men to light immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately off horse back, and to mount the walls where
they were left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded, wherein succeeding, with little labour and less loss
they took the Town, which they afterwards miserably plundered, and used
cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty upon the Defendents, who, a little before the Enemy entered, had
either agreed, or were ready to agree upon surrender of the Town on Articles to
Count <hi>Guido,</hi> who assaulted the Town on the other side. <hi>San
Damiano</hi> being taken, the Duke gave order that the Walls should 
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:53250:89"/> be sleighted, to the end that if they should come to
restitution, the State should be bereft of that Fort, which was as a thorn in
his eyes.</p>
            <p>The Governours of <hi>Montferrat</hi> and <hi>Allessandrio</hi>
were this mean while come to <hi>Alba</hi> with 8000 Foot and 700 Horse,
intending to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>San Damiano;</hi> but hearing that it was surrendred,
and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that the Duke might fall upon <hi>Alba</hi> next (which being
weakly walled, and but badly furnish'd with Ammunition and Victuals, they
thought it was not tenable, and therefore went from it;) and leaving
<hi>Ieronymo Rho</hi> there with his Brigade, and 500 Montferrians, those of
<hi>Alessandria</hi> returned home, and the others to <hi>Cassalle:</hi> and
not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were gone, <hi>Ieronymo Rho,</hi> by order from the Duke
of <hi>Millain,</hi> who was loath to hazzard the Kings Forces and honour in
the defence of that Town, went with his men to <hi>Felizzano,</hi> having
dismantled the Castle of <hi>Neviglie</hi> in his passage, to the end the Enemy
might not take it: in whose place 400 Dutch of <hi>Soltz</hi> his Regiment were
sent thither, and 500 Foot from <hi>Casalle,</hi> much too small a Garrison for
the circuit of the Walls. The Duke seeing it abandoned had his eye presently
upon it, thinking to take it; and making himself first master of many places in
that Country, drew neer it: Count <hi>Alerame St. Georgio,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of
<hi>Alba,</hi> was very diligent in repairing the Walls of that City, where
they were weakest, and in most danger, and in making all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary provisions
for defence; and finding afterwards, that the Duke being gone with some Forces
from <hi>Barbaresco,</hi> to discover the situation of that City, and the new
Works which he had made; he sent some Souldiers to possess themselves of a
certain high pass, which stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way whereby the Duke was to go; which
they did, and as soon as they saw the Dukes men come to discover, they
skirmished stoutly with them; and the skirmish lasted a long while, with
variety of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and prejudice on both sides; after which the Duke returned
to <hi>Barbaresco,</hi> and sent Count <hi>Guido</hi> to take in <hi>Alba,</hi>
with the French Foot, and <hi>Cavagliere Guirini</hi> with those of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> each of them ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with them eight pieces of Artillery,
and 800 Horse, who coming before the Town, raised Batteries on two sides, and
began to play up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Walls: those who were within were not wanting in making
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they diligently repaired the Walls wheresoever they were beaten down;
and made out many bold sallies, not without some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and assaulted the
Enemies Works: but at last, their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being wasted, many of their best
Souldiers being slain in skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, and in defending the Walls, they began
also to want Victuals; and seeing no hopes of succour (for Don <hi>Pietro</hi>
being inferiour to the Duke in Horse would not only not expose his men to the
danger or being lost, but had long before sent for them back that did defend
it) they were forced to surrender, leaving the City upon honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
in Count <hi>Guido</hi>'s hands, who received it in the Dukes name, the twelfth
day after the Siege: at the same time <hi>Mortara,</hi> not thinking himself
able to resist the Dukes Forces; hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Governour thinking it too unworthy a thing to suffer the Duke
to over-run the Country thus victoriously, and that he should so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:53250:90"/> abandon it, and should suffer the chief Towns of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> to be taken, and plundered, which State he had so often
profest to protect, and for the occasion whereof he had been so much troubled,
and had chiefly begun the war; he indeavoured to provide against it by some
means or other: he assembled all the men he could in <hi>Alessandria,</hi>
which amounting to about 14000 fighting men, he sent them to
<hi>Feliz-Zano;</hi> and the Duke fearing <hi>Asti</hi> entred thereinto with
his men: but finding that the Governour had soon distributed his men in
<hi>Alessandri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> and <hi>Tortonese,</hi> he with his Souldiers, and with
the French Horse, suddenly assaulted <hi>Montiglio,</hi> a great Town in
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> and having made way enough for an assault with his
Artillery, the Towns-men finding themselves not able to resist him, and fearing
the Town might be plundered, they surrendred it upon Articles. But the French
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard a certain whisper at their entring into the Town (as the Dukes
Captains pleaded in their excuse) the Town, contrary to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, was
miserably plundered, and put to the sword. Thus <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat</hi> was
exposed to troubles occasioned by her friends, who without defending her laid
her waste; and was likewise exposed to be injured by the Enemy, who without any
compassion ruined her: in which vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cissi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

said the Governour indeavoured to prejudice, by altering the Treaty of Peace;
yet the common opinion was, that the Dukes fair speeches, and extraordinary
favours, he being naturally apt to win the love of all men, the Venetian Gold,
Military Courage which was yet very powerful with him, and the desire of
abating the spanish honour in <hi>Italy,</hi> were of power to work upon him;
and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being come he stuck no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

for that not knowing whither to turn himself better, his coming might not be
thought to have been altogether vain; or for the aforesaid respects, to shew
some resentment against the Duke of <hi>Mantua:</hi> so as he made himself be
felt, and kept the Spanish Forces short and low whilst he was in
<hi>Italy:</hi> yet <hi>Thomaso Caracciola,</hi> Captain of the Garrison of St.

<hi>Victorio</hi> and <hi>Thomaso</hi> thither, who resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not to fall upon
that place, because they saw it was provided with a good Garrison, and with an

many sailies out of the Town, and did so molest the Enemy, as by little and
little he brought most of them to their end: moreover, he streightned
<hi>Vercelles</hi> yet more, by taking sometimes the Victuals which were sent
thither. True it is, that <hi>Clausio</hi> did sometimes cry quittance with
him; for he being ready upon warning, and having learnt that a Convoy of
Victuals and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition went with a Guard of 150 Foot, and 50 Horse commanded

Trenches, resisted for two hours space: yet being over-powered by number, most
of his men were cut in pieces, <hi>Gambacorta</hi>'s self sorely wounded, and
taken prisoner, and the Convoy remained absolutely in <hi>Clausio</hi>'s
hands.</p>
            <p>Thus the war in <hi>Piedmont</hi> varied, from the beginning of
<hi>September,</hi> till the beginning of the next Spring, in the year 1617.
before which time the Marshal fearing to lose his Government of
<hi>Dolpheny,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending much more the anger of the Court, returned

all the Princes and Officers of the Kingdom, who being herewith very well s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

were very ready to obey him: the Mother being removed from her Son, she being
much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Spaniards, and the Princes who were friends to the Duke
being taken to the Court instead of her, the Duke had much reason to hope for
better things, both from the King, and from the Forces of the Kingdom;
wherefore he began to care the less for the Governour, who having gotten new
men, and disposed of them in several places, threatned to enter
<hi>Piedmont</hi> the next Spring. But the Venetians were not idle this mean
while in <hi>Friuli:</hi> when the Austrian Army had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned

<hi>Gradisca:</hi> which being the harder to be taken by reason of the new
Fortifications, the Venetian Army gave over the thought of taking it by force,
and betook themselves to the Country which lies above <hi>Luciniso,</hi> to the
end that succeeding therein, they might draw neer <hi>Goritia:</hi> and because
the Enemies Army might be an impediment to this, which lay beyond the River,

this side, and to carry away much prey; as did likewise the Garrison of
<hi>Gradisca;</hi> they therefore did all they could to prevent this mischief
by building Forts, and making Trenches on their side the bank; they then

For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications: which the Venetians being desirous, as it was necessary, to
take, they resolved to build a Fort on some elevated place on this side the
River, from whence they might play upon the Tower, and the Bridge: and
<hi>Iustiniano</hi> being gone with some other Captains into those parts, to
discover the rises thereabouts, carried with him a good <pb n="169" facs="tcp:53250:91"/>
strength of men; between whom and the Archdukes men, who were come to defend
the Bridge, a skirmish began on both sides of the banks; which though it were
to little purpose, yet the Venetians were prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereby, who left their
Camp-master <hi>Iustiniano</hi> there, being shot through the reins with a
Musket-bullet, and was carryed to <hi>Luciniso</hi> where within a few hours he
died. Count <hi>Martinengo</hi> succeeded in his place, but not being able to
discharge it by reason of his great age, Don <hi>Iohn de Medici,</hi> Bastard
Son to <hi>Cosmo</hi> the first, great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> was chosen
with the Title of Governour General; he was an old Commander, and had
discharged places of chiefest imployment in the wars of <hi>Flanders</hi> and
<hi>Hungary,</hi> wherefore his Authority was great.</p>

Fort, as they had intended; wherefore they sent <hi>Martinengo</hi> with some
forces to get footing in a little Hill which <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niano</hi> had made

Captain <hi>Fur,</hi> a French man, to prepossess it; between whom and
<hi>Martinengo</hi> there happened a fierce Skirmish; to the which fresh
succour coming in from the other side, the Venetians were forced to give back,
and to leave the Hill in the Austrians pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; who presently built a Fort
upon it, which from the multitude of Chessnut Trees that were there they called
<hi>the Fort of the wood,</hi> or <hi>of Chessnuts:</hi> And the Venetians
built another Fort on a higher Hill, from whence, with two Cannons and a
Culvering they broke down the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Wherefore the Venetians, finding the danger, fell immediately to fortifie it,
and put therein a gallant Garrison. At last General <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dici</hi> came to
the Camp, who presently fell to order such things as he found out of order: And
afterwards being very desirous to do some thing which might be worthy of his
name, and of the expectation which <pb n="170" facs="tcp:53250:92"/> was had of him, was
much vex'd to find that things were not prepared for his designs. He found out
daily more and more the corruption of Military discipline, which was fomented
by the avarice of some of the Venet an Captains and Gentlemen, Officers of the
Common-wealth, who being more intent to inrich themselves then to fight, gave
too much license to the Souldiers, contrary to military rules: He was yet more
distasted, for that being by the Common-wealths Letters Patents to be superiour
over all except the Commissary General, he found at first the execution thereof
in the Camp difficult: Amidst which diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties the enemy sent Monsieur
<hi>de la Foglia,</hi> a French Captain, with a Troop of Horse beyond the River
against some light-Horse which guarded a ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>tain Trench upon the Bank of <hi>Lisonzo;</hi> and both sides being
succour'd, the Skirmish grew almost to be a Battel; wherein
<hi>Trautmistorft</hi> passing over the River, and <hi>Trivigiano</hi> coming
with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men from <hi>Luciniso,</hi> the business was manfully disputed; but
the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net ans light-Horse not being able to resist the solid order of the
Dutch Horse, whilst they would have retreated did so confound themselves with
their Curassiers which were on their backs, the one and the other of them were
charged and chased quite thorow their own Foot which were come in to their
succour; who were therefore wholly disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own Horse, and slain by
those of the enemy. In this scuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle many Corsicks were slain, and Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Iustiniano,</hi> was taken prisoner; and <hi>Giovan Dominico da
Ornano,</hi> a very valiant Corsick Commander: Nor was this the worst; for the
Venetians who retreated, not thinking themselves safe in the Trenches of
<hi>Luciniso,</hi> were minded to get into the Castle which was above, had not
some Commanders stoutly withstood them, who keeping their own men several ways
from running, and particularly by shutting the Gates upon them, hindered their
flight, incouraged them, and making them stand, preserved those Quarters and
<hi>Luciniso,</hi> which otherwise had been abandoned, and left in the power of
the enemy; who fearing the Artillery of <hi>Luciniso,</hi> repast back over the
River, and went to their wonted quarters, having lost but few of their men,
though their Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and Matradas were sleightly wounded; and <hi>Foglia,</hi>
who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced too <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Though <hi>Trivigiano</hi> shew'd great courage upon this occasion, yet did he
deserve to be reprehended by the Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary and by <hi>Medici,</hi> for having
ingaged himself and so many others in that action of his own will, and without
their knowledge. The sickness still increased in the Camp, which made the
Souldiers still run faster away, and especially those of the Country; and the
best Souldiery were yet more consumed by Skirmishes: Wherefore the scarcity of
men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Commissary and
<hi>Medici</hi> indeavoured, by all the means they could, to perswade the
Switzers and Grisons that were in the Camp to fight against the Archduke; which
they, being prohibited to do by the League which they have with the House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> had not as yet done; having only served as Garrisons to
defend such Towns as were possess'd by the Common-wealth: which having at last
obtained, it increased their numbers for a while, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1500 in number;
but it made their scarcity of men greater soon after; for the Grisons Country
being for this respect prohibited more <pb n="171" facs="tcp:53250:92"/> strictly from
having any commerce with the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> the chief Rulers
amongst the Grisons, that they might have that Decree revoked, recalled all
those of their Nation home who were in service for the Common-wealth; and
forbad passage through their State to all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners who went to serve the
Venetians: By this increase <hi>Medici</hi> ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to surprise St.
<hi>Martino</hi> in <hi>Crusca,</hi> especially knowing how few there were
there in Garrison: He therefore departed about midnight in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good order
from <hi>Vipulciano,</hi> where he had mustered those who he intended for that
enterprise, and got before day near the Castle; but a certain whisper arising
amongst his men, and a small light being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in the Castle, the
Souldiers fell into so horrible dread and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion as they immediately ran
away shamefully without being pursu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which <hi>Medici,</hi> lighting off

Lando</hi> came to the Camp, who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Priuli</hi> in the place of
Commissary-general; who seeing that the whole success of the war consisted in
taking <hi>Goritia,</hi> and that this was not to be done without passing over
<hi>Lizonso;</hi> he first built some Forts, and made some Trenches about
<hi>Gradisca,</hi> to hinder excursions, and then bethought himself how he
might pass over the River: And both he and <hi>Medici</hi> holding it
impossible to pass over between <hi>Goritia</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disca,</hi> by
reason of the enemies opposition; they learned that there was a certain Bridge
over the Channel of <hi>Ronzina</hi> which was but weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly guarded; and though
it were very hard to get thither, they being to pass through the enemies
Country, and yet harder to fall down by the <hi>Ronzina</hi> into
<hi>Goritia;</hi> yet thinking they should have done much if they should pass
the River, they would put it to a trial: Which that they might the better
effect, they resolved to assault the enemy in six other places, to the end that
being assaulted in so many other places at once, they might not be able to keep
them from passing over the Bridge at <hi>Ronzina;</hi> which designe though it
were very well laid, and for the most part well executed, yet had they not good
success therein, except at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Floriano,</hi> which was taken by Count
<hi>Nicholo Gualdo</hi> by a Petard; and which being upon their backs, and not
far from the Fort of the wood, whereat the Common-wealths Commanders aimed, it
was presently fortified and furnished with a strong Garrison. <hi>Lando</hi>
and <hi>Medici</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten from this enterprise, and despairing to be
able to work their end, which was to pass over the River, they hoped to effect
it by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther un-thought of way: The passage over the River was not
interdict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed underneath <hi>Gradisca;</hi> for the Territories of
<hi>Monfalcone</hi> lying on this side the Bank, the Venetians were masters of
it as well by antient right as having newly won it by the Sword; but the
passage though it was easie in this part, was to little purpose; for he who

               </gap>om the County of <hi>Monfalcone</hi> to
<hi>Goritia</hi> must pass over the Mountains anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently called
<hi>Giapedi,</hi> and now <hi>del Carso,</hi> which beginning from
<hi>Lison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> more below <hi>Luciniso,</hi> and running in a continual Line
even to the Sea, do wholly divide these two Counties: Mountains which are
hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridly rough and craggy, and not esteemed passable by an Army; at the bottom
whereof, towards <hi>Goritia,</hi> runs the <hi>Vipao,</hi> a River which falls
into the <hi>Lisonzo,</hi> over against the River <hi>Fara;</hi> which though
it be <pb n="172" facs="tcp:53250:93"/> lesser then <hi>Lisonzo,</hi> yet though <hi>del
Carso</hi> should be past over, they must meet with the same difficulties, and
be opposed by the enemy who were incamped not far from thence; so as these
difficulties being thought not to be overcome, it was always held desperate to
attempt <hi>Goritia</hi> by this way; But it being found by some conjectures at
this time, that the Mountains were not so rough and craggy as they were
imagined, Marquess <hi>Oratio d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>l
Monte</hi> was sent to make the discovery; who having made all necessary
diligence brought word back that there were some places by which they might
bring their Artillery, and avoid the other difficulties. The Commissary and
<hi>Medici</hi> being overjyo'd at so good news, out of hopes of good success,
resolved by all means to pass over the River beneath <hi>Gradisca;</hi> and
passing from thence over the <hi>Carso</hi> to go to the besieging of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oritia:</hi> But necessary
preparations for the effecting it were not answerable to their hopes and
desires; the scarcity of Souldiers still increased, partly by death, partly by
run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away; and particularly those of the Country, who were never in the
Camp but upon the pay-days; many of the Grisons, hearing the command of their
Superiors, were already gone, and many were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiered for having been too
insolent, and having caused sedition in the Camp: The Hollanders delaied their
coming still, and a Regiment of 4000 French which the Duke <hi>du Mayne</hi>
should have brought to <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uli</hi> at the Common-wealths cost, were kept
back either by reason of the new troubles in <hi>France,</hi> or by the Grisons
Decrees: To this was added, that being to go beyond the River to attempt an
uncertain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, (which the newer it was, was the more difficult and
dangerous) they could not abandon the Country on this side the River which had
cost them so much pains to get, and so much money to fortifie: So as to divide
those few that were in the Camp, was to hazzard the loss of what was certain,
to go, with much danger to themselves, to get what was uncertain: The hopes of
new supplies were but few, by reason of the times, which brought the
Common-wealth into great streights; for the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> Rout at the
Abby of <hi>Lucedio</hi> happened but a little before, which made them not only
disburse good store of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to recruit him, but also to provide experienced
Souldiers and Commanders upon their Confines towards the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> lest they might be probably assaulted on that fide: So as the
Venetian Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was fain to delay the enterprise of <hi>Carso,</hi> and to
expect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hollanders, which was thought could not be long: This
new enterprise met also with much difficulty by the coming of new supplies from
<hi>Germany</hi> into <hi>Friuli,</hi> whereby the Austrian Camp was increased;
and there was a speech of others that would shortly come: The Common-wealths
troubles were also infinitely multiplied by the new-taken resolution of
<hi>Pietro di Girona,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ossuna,</hi> and Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of
<hi>Naples;</hi> who, either seconding the Kings intention had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
himself to side with the Archduke; or out of his particular hatred to the
Venetians, had rigg'd up Gallies and Gallioons in the Haven at <hi>Naples,</hi>
giving out that he would send them into the Adr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>atick Sea, not only to assist the Archduke by
diversion, but to hinder the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth in the possession which they
pretend unto of the said Sea, and to trouble their Maritine Traffick: And
though the same courage <pb n="173" facs="tcp:53250:93"/> of mind appeared to be amongst
those Conscript Fathers amidst so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny troubles and adversities, wherewith
persisting in their first generous resolution of maintaining the publick honour
and of freeing the Gulf from Pyrats, they prepared to resist this new tempest;
and therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bare not to provide abundantly for all necessaries in all
requisite parts; yet naturally considering the little good they were likely to
get by the war, and the prejudice which might thereby result both to the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and to private men; and moreover foreseeing the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment dangers
threatned to their Common-wealth by the State of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> and by the
Kingdom of <hi>Naples;</hi> they grew somewhat less obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and desired that
the formerly broken Treaty of agreement might be reassumed: But it was no less
hard for them to find the means how, then to compass their end with
satisfaction; for all the Princes being weary with the last Negotiations, by
reason of the Common-wealths backwardness to restore what had been taken, not
any of them cared to intermeddle therein: And they could get nothing from the
Pope (who they thought would not be inwardly displeased here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t) but words and generallities; nor
could they confide much in the King of <hi>France,</hi> by reason of the vast
troubles of that Kingdom: They therefore thought it the less evil to have
recourse to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> which they had formerly so much
suspected; and which by the Declaration made by the King in the behalf of the
Archduke, and by the men who were paid by him in this war against the
Venetians, was little less then their declared enemy; But by reason of many
things formerly done by the Common-wealth, which were ill taken by the King and
Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and which made them desireous to lessen the
Common-wealths good opinion of her self; they oftentimes refused the pressures
made by <hi>Pietro Gritti,</hi> Resident in that Court for the Common-wealth,
who desired in the Common-wealths name that some composition might be come
unto; But the King and Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> having been always against having
war in <hi>Italy,</hi> and more particularly now out of many respects; the
Duke, imbracing the present occasion, began to close with the proposals made by
<hi>Gritti</hi> in the Common-wealths behalf, and very affectionately desired
the effecting of them: But the Duke of <hi>Oss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>na</hi> forbore not for all this to pursue his enterprise; for he
abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the Venetians more then any other Spaniard did; and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
put seven Gallioons in good order for fight, and furnish'd them with all
warlike Ammunition; which (to begin the war which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended against the
Venetians) he sent into the Gulf, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Francisco
Riviera,</hi> native of <hi>Granada;</hi> who from a private condition had by
his own worth, and by the Viceroys favour, raised himself to no small
greatness. The Common-wealth forthwith arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out two Galliasses, and seven
Gallioons, and gave the charge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to <hi>Lorenzo Veniero;</hi> and to
these they added 18 lesser Gallies, which they were wont to keep to guard the
Gulf and the Seas of the Levant: They set <hi>Iusto Antonio Belegno,</hi>
Commissary over the Gulf, to be chief over all these; who whilst he was on his
way towards <hi>Ragusa,</hi> where he understood the Neapolitan Gallies were;
<hi>Riviera</hi> advanced with five of his Vessels within sight of the Isl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the City began to play upon the Fort with some of his Cannon, 
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:53250:94"/> and upon some Houses which were not far from it: and not
seeing any one appear he retreated upon the coming on of night toward
<hi>Calamotta</hi> and <hi>Sabioncella,</hi> Towns of <hi>Ragusa;</hi> where
joining with the other Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, he took a Ship which went from <hi>Ragusa</hi>
to <hi>Venice:</hi> He staid some days thereabouts; and hearing that
<hi>Bellegno</hi> was coming on with very advantageous forces, he steered
unpursued towards <hi>Puglia,</hi> and came safe from thence to
<hi>Brindisi:</hi> It was the common opinion of all men, that <hi>Bellegno</hi>
might have fought him if he had pleased; and that upon sleight pretences,
tarrying sometimes in one place, sometimes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had delayed time,
and permitted him to return; It is not known, notwithstanding, whether he did
this of himself, or by his limited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions; for though the Common-wealth
seemed to be very much displeased with his proceedings, and therefore removing
him from that charge, placed <hi>Veniero,</hi> Captain of the Galleoons, in his
room; who in Consultations had appeared to be more forward and couragious; yet
because they gave him other imployments and dignities not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it was
thought that this resentment was one of the Venetians wonted pieces of cunning;
who laying the weakness of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions to the fault of their Officers,
do at the same time, without haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding their own forces, cover the publick
diffidence, and maintain the reputation of their Militia; nor do their Officers
hold themselves thereby insured, who being contented with the tacite applause
of the wisest Citizens, and with the tacite praise which is given them for
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving discreetly carried on the publick fortune, do so love their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as they care not for having the fault laid upon them which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise would
redound to the publick bad success; being sure that when the wonder is over
they shall be largely rewarded with other honours and dignities.</p>
            <p>The Crabates growing bold upon the nearness of the Neapol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

allowed them in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> flock from home in great
numbers; and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gulf with much terrour, took much pillage, and took
many Vessels even upon the City shoars; and afterwards carrying their prey into
<hi>Puglia</hi> and <hi>L'Abruzzi,</hi> sold them safely; and whither they
safely fled when chased by the Venetian Vessels; In so much as the greater
Traffick of Galleoons, and the lesser commerce was in a short space brought to
a bad condition in <hi>Venice. Veniero</hi> being afterwards gone with two
Galleasses and seven Galleoons to <hi>Brindisi,</hi> he indeavoured to draw out
<hi>Riviera,</hi> who lay there with his Gallies, to Battel; who not having
rowing Vessels, and the wind being contrary to his coming out, did not refuse
<hi>Veniero</hi>'s Challenge, but put it off till a fitter time: whereupon

getting into the Gulf entered the Channel of <hi>Corsola,</hi> and from thence
to <hi>Liesina;</hi> and being content with this generous offer, appeared no
more upon those shoars: The Fleets afterwards increased; for the Viceroy
providing new Galleoons, both in <hi>Naples</hi> and in <hi>Sicily;</hi> and
assembling the Kings Gallies together, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>epared others at his own cost, that he might send them altogether
to prejudice the Venetians; and growing daily more angry and more incens'd, he
threatned to assault the very Town of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> with his whole Fleet;
and adding all possible demonstrations to <pb n="175" facs="tcp:53250:94"/> his speeches,
he gave out that he would go himself in person to <hi>Brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disi,</hi> the more
to encourage and hasten such preparations: Wherefore the Common-wealth growing
fearful, armed more Galleoons, and put more Gallies and Galleasses to Sea; and
ordered also that all the Gallies which sail upon those Seas, and upon the
Levant Seas, should join in opposing the Spanish Fleet: But the Common-wealth
which abounded in Ships, in Galleasses, and in all other warlike preparations,
was in a great want both of men for their Oars and for fighting; for those
people, and those parts who were formerly trained up in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, and
therefore good at Sea affairs, from whence the Venetian greatness had its rise
and increase; being now accustomed to Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick imployments, and not having
seen an enemy for many years, were grown imbased by idleness: nor were they
better provided of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders; for the Gentry being given to such Arts as
peace produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, had not of late years valued the Militia, except what was
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime.</p>
            <p>The Commonwealth being therefore upon these terms, and fearing the
Viceroy's threats and preparations, whose Fleet they knew did much exceed
theirs both in stout Souldiers and experienced Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, had much ado to
provide for necessary defence, whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ein they were to coin much money, and to be at excessive expence:
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore falling immediately to raise monies by many Taxes and Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and also assembling all the Tradesmen of the City, who were pick'd out by lot
according to publick Orders, a certain number of them were commanded to serve
either for themselves or for others in the Fleet. Thus having furnish'd a good
many Rowers out of the dregs of the people, and Clowns of the neighbouring
Villages, they furnish'd the Fleet also with many Troops of the Land-Militia,
who being found to be unfit for Land-Service, little good could be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from them in Sea affairs: And because the Senate were afraid of
<hi>Veniero</hi> the Governour of the Fleet's animosity, they left him his
first charge over the Galleoons, but made <hi>Iovan Iacomo Zane,</hi> a grave
and discreet person, chief of all the maritime affairs, with title of
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary, but with authority of Captain General; who putting to Sea many
days after with those Vessels which were in a readiness at <hi>Venice,</hi>
went to <hi>Liesina,</hi> where the general rendezvouz was for all those
Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels which were to serve in that Fleet; to the end that from thence, as
from the Centre of the Gulf, he might discover what ways the Enemy steered, and
oppose them and their designs; part whereof appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

part of the Viceroys Fleet was led on by <hi>Don Pietro di Leva</hi> under the

the Viceroy; who being angry that they had not fought, sent express Orders for

multitude of Guns which she carried was fit, as those who were skilful in that
Profession said, to stand the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault of a whole Fleet. The Venetian Gallyes
were very well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of Rowers, yet but badly furnish'd with fighting-men;
for of 22000 persons which were in the Fleet, there were hardly 3000 who were
fit to manage Arms; being come within sight one of the other, and the Kings
Fleet having given sign of Battel by shooting of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and having loosened
the Cables wherewith the Galleoons were fastned to the Gallyes, the winde,
which till then had been good for them, changed immediately; and turning
exceeding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>air for the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Fleet began to blow with a strong gale against the Spaniards; and the Galleoons
being fallen off from the Gallyes, sailing some here, some there, were
immediately dispers'd; whereupon the Spanish Commanders, and all the Souldiery,
though by the same wind they might have tack'd about, and have escaped so great
a danger, yet cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage prevailing over fear, they still kept their Fore-Castle
towards the Venetian Fleet: yet being astonish'd at this their enemies so great
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they were much troubled, and almost brought to despair of safety:
fearing to be suffocated with the smoak of their own, and of the Enemies
Cannon; and to be drown'd and stifled, without being able to fight, at the very
first shock: but the neerer they came the more they saw themselves free from
that danger; for <hi>Zane</hi> after a while withdrew into the Haven, and lost
the opportunity of an assured and full Victory; to <hi>Veniero</hi>'s great
vexation, who being fallen a l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ttle off with his Galleoons, that he might with a better wind fall
upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, expected that <hi>Zane</hi> should advance, or give the sign
of Battel; to which purpose he had sent a Long-Boat to him: but seeing him
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw into the Haven he followed the General, and put into the same Haven
with his Galleoons, leaving a great Tartana behind him, which fell into the
Enemies hands. The Spanish Fleet being driven by the wind went upwards towards
<hi>Zara,</hi> and staid that night not far from <hi>Liesina:</hi> the next day
being forc'd by the wind to coast a long beyond <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> it light by
chance upon ten Gallyes, and two great Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Barques; whereof two, which
are called <hi>Maone,</hi> and the two Barques were fraught with ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>y rich Merchandize: the Spaniards
presently pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued them, for at first sight of the Enemy they fled; seven of
the yarest of them, by the advantage of night, recovered <hi>Zara</hi> from
whence they were come; the two which were loaded with Merchandize, and the
Barques, and another Vessel fell into <hi>Leva</hi>'s power, but no men in
them, for they had all escaped to land, but the Vessels were loaded with
Merchandize, and Moneys, to the worth of above a Million of Ducates. Captain
<hi>Antonio Chiurano</hi> was greatly to blame in this, who not valuing the
Enemy, and trusting more then became him to do in the Commonwealths Fleet, was
not only negligent, as if he had sailed in secure peace, but thinking himself
derided by a Fisher-man, who told him how neer the Enemy was, caused him to be
put in prison; and not long after some Barques were taken, loaded with M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Victuals for the Army, which being retreated to <hi>Liesina,</hi> and not
daring to stir from thence suffer'd the Enemy to rove

               </gap>reely over all those Seas.</p>
            <p>It was commonly said that Commissary <hi>Zane,</hi> when
Consultation was held by the Captains and Officers, whether or no they should
make use of the present occasion, and taking the advantage of the wind, fall
upon the Enemy; that after he had by his Authority and Reasons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted
their opinion, he at last drew an express command out of his bosom from the
Senate, whereby he was absolutely forbidden to give Battel, no not upon any
whatsoever advantage; and truly the Commonwealth having so powerful an Enemy so
neer at hand, who publickly threatned to assault the City; and the loss being
beyond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison greater which they should have received, if they had been
beaten, then any advantage that could have redounded to them by Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; and
that being able of her self to maintain the Empire of the Sea against that
Enemy, who they knew could not trouble them long; it suited well with their
wisdom, to prefer wholsome and sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e resolutions before such as they were not certain should prove
glorious; and that it became them not to hazzard that Fleet upon the
uncertainty of Battel, which being the only defence of that City, ready to be
as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, and which being the greatest strength that they could then put
together, was thought the only foundation of the Venetian Honour and Empire:
which could not probably waver so long as that Navy was safe; so if that should
be lost, would infallibly draw after it great mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and little less then
the utmost danger of the Commonwealths safety: and the danger appeared so much
the more probable, for that, doubtless, as if they should fight at a distance,
the Venetian Fleet by the advantage of the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r Guns would have much vexed that of <hi>Spain;</hi> so if they
should come to close fight, the Venetians being badly provided of defendants,
would have been easily worsted by the Spaniards: the want of Order and Military
Discipline in the Venetian Fleet was also to be confidered; for never a one of
the Masters knew what their place was, nor what upon such an occasion he was to
do; there was no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Wings, nor Squadrons; but the whole Fleet was
one great body, mis-shapen and confused; and therefore unable to move, and more
troublesome to its self, then formidable to the Enemy: but it was no less
considerable, that when contrary to the afore<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aid probable Reasons of the Venetians being worsted, they should
have had the upper hand, the victory must needs have been got by much loss, and
effusion of blood: in which case, if the Turkish Fleet should have come, and
have found the Venetian Fleet weakned, and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish beaten, might it not
have come up even unto <hi>Venice;</hi> and without any contestation, or
opposition, have done what the Spaniards threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? it was therefore in this
respect thought that it became not the Commonwealth, to expose her safety to
the certain danger wherewith she was t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

indangered by this conflict; for of the two Fleets, which being both joyn'd
together make but a proportionable Bulwark of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, against the
Maritime Forces of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, when <pb n="177" facs="tcp:53250:96"/> one
of them should have been discomfited, and the other weakened; Christendom would
not have had Forces sufficient to withstand the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomans</hi> Fleet, if it
should have come against it: and therefore many strengthning their Reason, and
fixing their Thoughts higher, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that sudden and unexpected change of
wind to a great miracle, and acknowledged it to proceed from Gods Divine
goodness; yet they proceeded in <hi>Venice</hi> (according to their usual
custom) against Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary <hi>Zane,</hi> as they had done against
<hi>Bellegno,</hi> sending for him back to <hi>Venice,</hi> taking his place
from him, and proceeding hotly by Process against him; and yet after some
moneths he was acquitted by a great number of Vote<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

success of the Fleet, and the loss of the Mahouns, caused great commotions in
<hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice;</hi> the rather for that false news being brought some few days
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of the conflicts, and of the vistory gotten by the Venetian Fleet,
great Feasts and Triumphs were made by the Nobility, who believing that report
could not contain themselves in rejoycing, and congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and the Common
People following the example of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliry fell into excesses, even such as
were scandalous: they ran tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuously in great numbers to the Spanish
Embassadours Palace; and mingling opprobrious speeches with their shouts and
out-cries, they had almost fallen to injurious actions: and elsewhere they hung
up the Portraicture of the Viceroy by the feet, and after many scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and
abusive speeches, set it on fire: but the truth being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards known, the
Commonwealth was much afflicted, both in private, for the loss of the Mahouns,
of so great value; and for the continual damage suffer'd by the Croates; and
was much astonished and confused in the Publick, for the loss of their ancient
Reputation, and for fear lest the Spanish Fleet, according to the Viceroys
threats and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, might draw neer their Washes, and assault their City.
They knew not what courses to take, which might suffice to remove the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
danger; but finding them all to be short, and unproportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they
complain'd of the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> who being chosen by them to be a
pacifier of the differences between them and the Archduke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of making
peace, had proved so bitter an Enemy; suffering them to be under hand so
injuriously dealt with by his Minister, without any respect had to the
friendship which was publickly profest between them; and yet the King, who did
not desire that the Treaty of Peace which was by him reassumed should be
disturbed; preferring kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness before revenge (for they had injured him, by
assisting the Duke of <hi>Savoy)</hi> and peace before whatsoever victory; as
soon as he had given way to the Commonwealths desire, of interposing himself in
the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent differences; commanded the Viceroy (being much press'd so to do by
the Commonwealth) to send for the Fleet back from the Gulf; and that his
command might be the better observed, he sent Orders to Don <hi>Pietro di
Lieva,</hi> to ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eat immediately
with his Fleet without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the Commonwealth into the Tuscan Sea; and as
good luck would have it for the Commonwealth, the Kings Orders came to Don
<hi>Pietro</hi> when he was not far from the Venetian Washes, and when the
Venetians, as finding themselves in greatest danger, did exclaim most against
the King; wherefore Don <hi>Pietro</hi> (having had some inkling of 
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:53250:97"/> the Turkish Fleet) that he might not be inclosed between
two Fleets retreated; and leaving the Galleoons at <hi>Brindisi</hi> came,
according to the Kings command, into the Tuscan Sea; not without much grief to
the Viceroy, who not having yet vented his anger would, contrary to the Kings
command, continue the War which was begun.</p>
            <p>Thus was <hi>Venice,</hi> when she least thought of it, freed from
the very neer danger of being assaulted; but she fared no better in the Wars of
<hi>Friuli;</hi> for the Captains of the Army, that they might not lye idle
whilest the Hollanders delayed their coming, attempted the Castle of
<hi>Cestnuts,</hi> and a Town which was a great one, and near it, upon the
banks of <hi>Lisonzo;</hi> hoping that when they should have taken those two

<hi>Goritia;</hi> which when they should have got, the Enemies Army would
neither have been able to have kept the Field, nor to defend <hi>Gradisca,</hi>

leaving people with sufficient provisions, and Orders to defend it, he returned
to <hi>Luciniso:</hi> The others being gotten neer the Fort began to streighten
it on two sides, hoping verily to take it; for there being only eighty Foot in
it, badly provided either with Victuals or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal to fight, they by signs
gave notice of their necessity to those of their side, wherein they could
hardly be provided by the Austrians; for besides that the Venetians were
numerous, and in <hi>Piuma,</hi> and about the Fort, and were able to increase
their numbers, by reason of the neighbourhood of those who were in

Bridge which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strians had built upon long-boats, and had carried the long
boats along with it; and the rain continuing, it was impossible to pass over
<hi>Lison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo;</hi> it was therefore hard and dangerous to relieve that Fort,
but more hard and dangerous to abandon it: yet at the last, the Austrian
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, of two evils chusing the less, resolved to adventure a few men,
for the safety and preservation of all: they therefore planted two Batteries on
their shore side against <hi>Piuma,</hi> to keep the Enemy from fortifying, and

Country-people call <hi>Zocchi,</hi> whereinto the Souldiers got; and holding
by a long-rope which was thrown over the River, did by a few at a time get over

being not at all dismaid, tied certain bundles toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and throwing them

fled without stopping, till they came to <hi>Luciniso:</hi> whose example was

to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missary <hi>Nicolo Contareno,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Forscarini,</hi>
with sufficient Forces to Guard the Country, and with excellent Orders to be
put in execution in due time. They caused a Bridge to be privately cast over

below <hi>Gradisca,</hi> by which <hi>Lando, Medici,</hi> and <hi>Erizzo</hi>
past over into the Country of <hi>Montfalcone,</hi> with 5000 Foot, and about
800 Horse, which being joyn'd to <hi>Nassaw</hi>'s Hollanders, and to other
Souldiers who were muster'd there, were divided into four Squadrons, according
to the ways by which they were to march: Commissary <hi>Lando,</hi> though he
desired, and was resolved to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at this passage, was notwithstanding
perswaded by <hi>Medici</hi> and the rest, who to shun adventuring the publick
dignity in his person, forc'd him to tarry in <hi>Montfalcone,</hi> where he
might be more serviceable in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king order, and in making provisions for the
Enterprise: <hi>Erizzo</hi> was to be ready with a flying Squadron, to come in
and assist where any need, or sudden accident should require: <hi>Cosimo di

<hi>Carso,</hi> went by the first way, neerest the Sea, and furthest from
<hi>Lisonzo,</hi> with 800 Foot; and being come to <hi>Dobre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> he
presently took it, and for more security, began to fortifie it: <hi>Oratio
Balioni</hi> went by the next way with 1500 Foot, four small pieces, good store
of Pioneers, and Ammunition for War, Count <hi>Ferdinando Scotto</hi> going
before him with some Horse-Troops to scoure the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to make
discovery: he took St. <hi>Michele,</hi> which afterwards when
<hi>Baglione</hi> came thither was diligently fortified: By the third way went
Count <hi>Nassaw</hi> with the Hollanders, waited on by some Troops of Horse,
and some pieces of Artillery, who coming to the Town called St.
<hi>Martino</hi> in <hi>Carso,</hi> took it; then going to the Fort which is
called <hi>delle Donne,</hi> at the third shot, he took it upon Articles; not
long after he did the like to the Fort Imperial, a little lower, and neerer
<hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonzo,</hi> which commands the River, and was therefore of great
concern, in keeping succours from <hi>Gradisca.</hi> Only <hi>Giovan
Martinengo,</hi> who led on the fourth Squadron, and to whose share it fell to
bring on the Artillery, and to advance by the way which lay neerest the River,
met with a rub; for being to take the Fort <hi>Stella,</hi> which was upon the
way over against <hi>Gradisca</hi> and being come so neer it; as he began to
make Trenches for Battery, two companies of Swissers and Grisons, being afraid
without any occasion, began to Mutiny; which Mutiny passing into those of other
Nations, they began all to wheel about, and to run, <hi>Martinengo</hi> not
being by any means able to stay them; and Commissa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Erizzo</hi> coming
in, he had much ado to perswade them to turn back, and carry off the Artillery
which they had abandoned, and which, had they made the least delay, had fallen
into the hands of those of the Fort. <hi>Martinengo</hi> retreated to
<hi>Sagra,</hi> and sending the Artillery from thence to St. <hi>Michele,</hi>
he fortified himself at St. <hi>Nichola Medici,</hi> not being bound to keep
any one place, discharged the Office of a General, and ran sometimes to one
place, sometimes to another, incouraging, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for, and ordering all
things which appertained to the March: the same night, to the end that the
Austrians being assaulted in several places might have the less conveniency to
oppose the passage of <hi>Carso;</hi> some of the Commonwealths Galleys drew
neer <hi>Dulcigno,</hi> a great Town belonging to the Archduke in the Gulf of
<hi>Triesti,</hi> and playing upon it with their Artillery did it much harm:
and on the other side of <hi>Lisonzo, Trivigiano</hi> coming from
<hi>Luciniso,</hi> according to <hi>Medici</hi> his Orders, at mid-night with a
great many Horse, came to <hi>Lisonzo;</hi> and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that was lodged on the other side; and a little lower, neer <hi>Fora,
Francisco</hi> and <hi>Carlo Strasoldi,</hi> who had the same Orders, being
come to the River side, and not seeing any appear against them, but finding by
counter-signs that the Venetians had luckily overcome the Mountain, they boldly
entred the River, which was somewhat more swollen then usual; and coming to

belonging to Commissary <hi>Contereno</hi>'s self, and the other to <hi>Giovan

them and of the enemies Rampiers: The Austrians were sufficiently astonished at
this strange and unexpected passage, as well over the Mountains as over the
River; and forgetting their former Generosity grew into great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; and
doubtlesly, if the Venetian Commanders had proceeded on with the same fervour,
they would freely without any opposition have gotten to the Walls of
<hi>Goritia,</hi> being only three miles distant from the bottom of
<hi>Carso;</hi> whereof, by reason of the great terror they were in, they might
without much ado have made themselves masters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horatio Baglione</hi> was aware of this so rare occasion; who
with many reasons and reitterated perswasions exhorted <hi>Medici</hi> not to
let it slip; but <hi>Medici</hi> being very cautious and circumspect would not
be advised by him: And whilst he fore slowed the business upon the descent of

proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; whilst busying himself in making of Trenches and Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
for the safety of his Quarters, he plaid the part rather of a Cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor then
of a Dictator, he let slip the occasion; for the Austrians argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this the

long after <hi>Maradas</hi> with more men; and they fell forthwith to fortifie
it, and to surround it with plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms: Here ended the success of that passage;
for the Austrians ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fortified <hi>il Pallagio,</hi> flank'd <hi>il
Barco</hi> with Ravelines, and munited the Banks of <hi>Vipao</hi> with new
Works; the Venetians found another <hi>Gradisca</hi> to besiege, and another
<hi>Lisonzo</hi> to overcome, on the other side of <hi>Carso;</hi> about which
they entertained themselves to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose till the Peace was concluded.
Many Batteries, many Attempts, many Skirmishes, were made by both parties, with
variety of Fortune; which since they made nothing for the main of the war, will
be super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to relate, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>radventure irksome to read: The end of the business was, that the
Venetians could never drive the Austrians thence, who had always the better,
not only in defending <hi>il Barco</hi> and the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but also in relieving
<hi>Gradisca,</hi> which the Venetians could not, by any means they could use,
obviate. General <hi>Trautmistorft</hi> dyed in the defence of <hi>il

of his own men, he stood upon a Raveline which

be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing <pb n="184" facs="tcp:53250:99"/> to war; but of a Genius more given to
Skirmishes and petty actions, then to the main enterprises; and therefore
deserved rather to be esteemed a good Souldier then an excellent Commander; for
being always provided of excellent Souldiers, and having to do with a weak and
undisciplined Army, and which was moreover continually macera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed with sickness, he could never
totally overthrow them; So though he was always assailant, and had always more
the better in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate actions, yet he seemed to be always more for defence
then offence: And the Venetians, who were continually losers, seemed in general
to be victors; having always carried the war into the enemies Country, without
losing any thing they had gotten, and always advancing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what towards new
Acquisitions: Many laid the fault of this, not upon the Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

men, and of necessary provisions for war; others imputed it to his being too
prodigal of his own life, and spacing of his Souldiers lives; others laid it to
the secret orders of the Emperours chief Officers, corrupted by the Venetian
Gold: But howsoever, he being well esteemed of for his great valour both by the
Emperour and Archduke, his death did very much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

either have left their service, or they for their own greater satisfaction
would have tried-first the others fortune; and this was whisper'd to be

himself indefatigable in labour, ready for danger, and would have won much
glory in that War, had he not through the immortal malice he bore to the
Spaniards, obscured it by a piece of cruelty committed by him upon a Spanish
Knight, who being brought prisoner before him, while the Prisoner submissively
bowed unto him he thrust a Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into his breast, and slew him. The affairs

Souldiers, and some Captains: for the rest, they spun it out till the
conclusion of the peace, which was made not long after with much advantage to
the Venetians, according to the custom of that Commonwealth; which though she
be good at Counsel, comes short of other Princes in matter of the Militia; and
therefore since she is not fortunate in War, makes peace upon more honourable
terms, by Negotiation; but because the Siege and taking of <hi>Vercelles</hi>
preceded that peace, it will be necessary, that returning to the affairs of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> we first relate the progress of that War, in the beginning

               </gap>s<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers under <hi>Don Antonio Caraffa</hi> Duke of
<hi>Matalona,</hi> in all 1800 Horse, <pb n="187" facs="tcp:53250:100"/> which were sent
him by the Duke of <hi>Ossuna;</hi> who being no less desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to maintain the
grandezza and honour of the King against the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, then anxious for the
affairs in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> had spared neither for cost, trouble, nor
diligence, to keep up the Glory of the Spaniard, and the Kings Authority, in
its ancient splendour. Besides these there were expected 1000 Curassiers and
6000 Walloon Foot from <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> who came quickly: The command of the
Horse was given to <hi>Iovan Ieronimo Doria;</hi> the Foot were divided into
two Brigades, the one was commanded by <hi>Gulielmo Verdugo,</hi> the other by
<hi>Gulielmo di Quen.</hi> The Lombard, Neapolitan, and Dutch Brigades, being
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited with new men, were almost gotten to their former number; so as those
that were there already being computed with those who were shortly to come, the
Army consisted of about 25000 Foot, and of 5500 Horse; a gallant Army, and fit
for whatsoever Enterprize. A Council of the chief Commanders being therefore
called, he ask'd their opinion touching the whole business, and touching
carrying on the War against the Duke: The opinions were three; the first, that
the Towns of <hi>Montferrat</hi> should be recovered, since the defence of that
State was the principal end of the present War; and for that when they should
be recovered, the Army, in case the Peace should not be concluded, which was
closely negotiated, might easily go to the expugning of <hi>Turin;</hi> or if
peace should be concluded, it would redound the more to the Kings honour; for
that the possession of what was taken being got by War, the Duke should not
have the honour of restoring them: The second, whereof <hi>Mortara</hi> was
Authour, was, that <hi>Asti</hi> should again be attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: The third, that
they should go to the taking in of <hi>Verrua</hi> and <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centino,</hi>
with intention to keep succour from <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and to open a
commodious way for entrance into <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The last not appearing so
difficult as the taking of <hi>Asti,</hi> and more honourable then to keep so
great an Army about the recovery of a few inconsiderable Castles, was approved
of by the greatest part of the Council, and so resolved on. <hi>Don Ieronimo
Caraffa,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Montenegro,</hi> a man of great power, long
vers'd in the Wars of <hi>Flanders,</hi> was thought to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of this
opinion; who being sent from <hi>Spain</hi> the Winter before to be assistant
to <hi>Don Piedro di Toledo</hi> in Council, succeeded the Prince of
<hi>Ascoli,</hi> who was sent for back to Court, and he commanded the whole
Army by title of Camp-master General, though under the name of the Governour:
So as it being noised that they went to <hi>Cres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centino,</hi> the Souldiers
and Captains were wholly bent thereupon; but the Governour who had resolved
otherwise in private with <hi>Montenegro,</hi> feigning to go from
<hi>Pontestura,</hi> where the Army then was, to <hi>Crescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,</hi> and
changing the Garrison of S. <hi>Germano</hi> in his passage, faced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and
sat down before <hi>Vercelles</hi> so unexpectedly, as four Troops of Horse
which were gone out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Vercelles</hi> to discover the Enem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, falling upon the body of the Army,
were kept from re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into <hi>Vercelles,</hi> by a flying Squadron which
were advanced by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way; so they returned
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and dispers'd to the Duke; and
some other which could not save themselves by running were some of them sla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, some taken Prisoners. Marquess
<hi>Clausio</hi> was Governour of this place, which was sufficiently well
victuall'd, yet but ill provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <pb n="188" facs="tcp:53250:101"/> of Souldiers, and
worse of warlike Ammunition; for they had been much wasted in the business of
<hi>Messerano</hi> and <hi>Creppacuore;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governour knowing
these their wants, thought the business would be short and easie, if by drawing
suddenly and unexpectedly before it he could keep it from being relieved: To
this end having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to place <hi>Iovan Ieralimo Doria</hi> with the
Cavalry which was come from <hi>Flanders,</hi> which consisted wholly of choice
and Veteran Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to guard the ways by which relief might be brought from
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> he had sent to <hi>Millain,</hi> before he went from
<hi>Pontestura,</hi> for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of Arms; and calculating the time so as
that these Horse might come to <hi>Millain</hi> at the same instant as the Army
should approach <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> he failed in his account, by reason of
some delay made by some Officer of <hi>Millain</hi> in the delivery out of the
Arms: So as the Duke, who at the first news of the Armies being gone to
<hi>Vercelles</hi> was gone with all his Forces to the Ruines of
<hi>Santia;</hi> had opportunity of sending 1500 Foot, and some Companies of
Horse, into the Town; who finding the ways open got safe without any opposition
into <hi>Vercelles:</hi> This succour came very opportunely; for together with
them there entered also many Commanders and Captains; and amongst the rest
Monsieur <hi>di Saufrone,</hi> the Dukes Engineer, who did singular service in
all this Siege.</p>
            <p>This place was begirt on that side which looks towards
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> where the greatest danger of assault lay, with a Wall which
was plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with a Ditch: It was impossible it should be infested on that
side which lies toward <hi>Millain,</hi> there being but a very little space
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Wall and the neighbouring River <hi>Sesia,</hi> full of Roots and
snags of Trees: When the Army was come within sight of the Town, finding that
the Flemish Horse did still delay coming, and fearing that more succours would
be brought in, he thought it requisite to streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it the more; He commanded
therefore that a long Trench should be begun; which beginning from
<hi>Sesia,</hi> a good way above <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and taking a compass
towards <hi>Piedmont,</hi> might not only encompass the whole Town with a
greater circuit, but might also inclose all that space of ground wherin the
Army was quarter'd, and should terminate in <hi>Sesia,</hi> a good way below
the City; to the end that the Army might lye safe within that Trench, and be
sheltered from the Dukes assaults, and might securely attend the siege; a work
which by reason of the large com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, and continual rains, could not be
perfected without much delay of time: The Horse which were in the Camp were
most of them quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the <hi>Sesia,</hi> to the end that they might
keep succour also from being brought by that side. The Town being thus be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eagured on all sides, and the

assaults, indeavoured to get underneath <pb n="189" facs="tcp:53250:101"/> the defences;
but being often beaten back, sometimes from one, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from another
Fortification, suddenly erected by <hi>Sanfrone,</hi> they were kept, as it
were, at bay, and forc'd to return back, and quit the Stations which they had
taken: So as the Siege, which otherwise would not have lasted long, was
necessarily prolonged, and would have been so longer if those within had been
better provided of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, or if the Duke had been so lucky in succouring
the Town with Ammunition, as he had been with men; yet he was very diligent in
indeavouring it; but the Governour took such good orders after the first relief
was conveyed in, as that thereby, and by a strange accident that happened, he
could not effect it: For the Duke chose out 500 of his best Horse, and amongst
them 400 Curassiers, and sent them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the besieged Town, with each of
them a sack of Powder; to which he added 12 Load of the same Ammunition: These
men think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to force their passage on a sudden, and to get safely into
<hi>Vercelles,</hi> failed in their design; for the Governour had already
placed <hi>Ieronimo Ro</hi> with 800 Horse, and 2000 Foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, to guard that passage, who light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this
Convoy, the Dukes 500 Horse found the encounter hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then they had imagined;
and yet they repuls'd the first 200 Horse that came against them; but
<hi>Ro</hi> coming in afterwards, and the Baron <hi>Batteville,</hi> with many
more men, a furious volley of Musquet shot was let fly from the Trenches; and
fire taking unfortunately at the same time in the Ammunition, it blew up with
such violence, as the whole Troop we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e miserably dissipated; many of them blown up into the Air, and
many to shun the fire, threw themselves into the <hi>Sesia,</hi> where they
were either drown'd or shot, only 25 got safe into <hi>Vercelles;</hi> many
being shrewdly scorch'd were taken prisoners, amongst which M<hi rend="sup">nr</hi>

Limogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one,</hi> the Prince <hi>Thomoso</hi>'s Lieutenant; 450 Horse were slain
in this disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster; hardly 50 escaped; other sixscore were also ill dealt withal
a little after, in a bickering which happened in the midway which leads from
St. <hi>Germano</hi> to <hi>Santia;</hi> for a Troop of Horse being sent from
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano,</hi> commanded by Captain <hi>Pallestra</hi> a Millanese, to
disturb the Fortifications which were begun by the Dukes men, they met with
another of the Dukes Troops which came from <hi>Santia;</hi> and at the first
beginning of the Skirmish the Dukes men fled to underneath the Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of
<hi>Santia;</hi> and those few who could recover the Trenches, being secured by
the Musqueteers who kept the enemy off, got free from danger; but the greatest
part of them were either slain in the encounter or in the retreat, or carried
Prisoners into St. <hi>Germano</hi> by <hi>Pallestra:</hi> the Siege drawing on
in length, the Duke sent 100 Sacks of Powder wrapt up in beasts Hides, to keep
them from firing, with 100 Horse, by the way of <hi>Gattinara;</hi> but this,
which was the third indeavoured succour, had no better success; for being
discovered by the Marquess of <hi>Este,</hi> who guarded that Pass with the
<hi>Gens d' Armes,</hi> most of them were slain, and many of them made
Prisoners. The Army was not this mean while idle in besieging the City; against
which they continued the Batteries, and laboured very much to beat down the
outward Fortifications; which besides the multiplicity and variety of them,
were so artificially ordered, as when they were gotten with much effusion of
blood, they were either easily recovered, or not hardly abandoned; and
some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, <pb n="190" facs="tcp:53250:102"/> there being a Mine underneath them, they
were fired, and so the Works were blown up with those that were on them into
the Air; oftentimes when one Cavalier was taken, another was the same night
erected by the enemy, which rendered the taking of the former the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
day of no use to the possessors: Thus the defendants not being wanting to
themselves as long as their Ammunition lasted, they did se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways with much
vigilancy and industry annoy the enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, shewing themselves in great
order, and with much courage, very ready for all necessary actions, in defence
of the Town against so stout and so fierce an oppugnation; nor in this their
defence were the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens less propitious to them, sending down rain in great
abundance for the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

actions, but did cause the neighbouring Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered very low, were forced for fear of the waters which overflowed the
Banks, to draw backwards; and many disorders which happened in the Camp were
causes of prolonging the enterprise, which was of it self so hard and
difficult: But at last all difficulties being overcome by the pertinacity,
valour and courage of the assailants, who removing all impediments w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

far on three sides as they had sometimes hope to get the victory; but those
within being no less valiant, the assault continued for the space of three
hours, the assailants not being able to make any progress; many whereof were
slain, not so much of the ordinary Souldiers, as of the Captain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

which the French were occasion why <hi>Calusio,</hi> and all the Dukes
Captains, except it were <hi>Sanfrone,</hi> consented unto: for they finding
that the Town could not hold out much longer, thought they had done
sufficiently enough in point of honour, and in obligation to the Duke, in whose
service they thought themselves not bound obstinately to lose their lives, he
not being their natural Prince, nor they fighting for their Country: so
<hi>Evangelista Tosti,</hi> a Perugian Captain, going out with the Governour
and two Companies of Horse to Parley, he demanded four days Truce; which being
positively denied, the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was finally made upon these conditions:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That all the Ravelines, Half-Moons, Stations and
Fortifications which <pb n="192" facs="tcp:53250:103"/> were without the Wall should be
delivered up the next day; that the next day after all the Souldiers should
march both out of the City, and Citadel, with Drums beating, Trumpets sounding,
Bullet in mouth, Match lighted, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours flying, with all their Baggage, two
pieces of Cannon, Mills, Cattel, Victuals, and with every thing else that
belonged unto them: That they should have sufficient carriages allowed them to
carry away their goods, their wounded men, and all their Implements; besides
many other Articles very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to those of</hi> Vercelles: <hi>upon which
conditions Hostages being given on both sides, all things were performed with
great fidelity, and satisfaction; there march'd out 4109 Souldiers, part on
foot, part on horse back, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of 600 wounded, who were carried in Carts, and
300 staid in</hi> Vercelles, <hi>not being able to be removed; they marched
through the Enemies ranks, being praised by all for their valour. The Marquess
of</hi> Calusio <hi>and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineer</hi> Sanfrone <hi>were met by Don</hi>
Piedro, <hi>and the chief of the Army, and honourably received by them, and
were accompanied by them to the Rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz of Armes, where they took their
leaves; the Governour having in a grave and civil manner shew'd</hi> Calusio
<hi>the great mischief of war, and the good which would redound by peace; and
therefore to offer the Duke the resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of</hi> Vercelles, <hi>if he would
be quiet upon reasonable conditions; which that they might the better be
concluded, he said he would be ready to speak by word of mouth with the Duke,
in any place of safety.</hi>

               </gap>e might the more confidently, and
with more reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion conclude it by their Kings means; and it was generally
held, that if the Duke had been assisted but a little by the French,
<hi>Vercelles</hi> had not been so easily taken; for the Duke coming one night
with those few <pb n="193" facs="tcp:53250:103"/> men he had, put the Spanish Camp into
much fear and confusion, left by assaulting some one place he might make his
way through the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the City: nor was the fear vain, nor danger small;
for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegers being imploi'd in defending so many places in the so long
cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit of the Trench, and busied not so much in keeping the besieged in, as
in keeping succour out, they might not peradventure have been able to resist
the Duke, if he had furiously assaulted some one place with all his Forces
close joyn'd together; and so much the rather for that the Camp having suffered
much hardship, they had lost not only many of their common Souldiers, but also
many Officers: and half their Horse were dead for want of Fodder, and many
horses were sick, so as they were reduced to so small a number, as oftentimes,
of a whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, not above six or eight entred the Guard; and it often
hapned that the Officers themselves were fain to serve for Guard, and to stand
Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel all day long, having none to supply the place: the continual
skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing about the Enemies Out Works consumed also many Foot; and the
extream hot weather, which came soon after, might easily have made the Enemy
remove, had the Town held out a little longer: so as if any the least succour
had come from <hi>France,</hi> the place might like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough have been p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> thereof, made

Embassadour his Agent there; after many debates, and discussions, the Articles
of Peace were pronounced by the King in form as followeth:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Archduke, who was then newly chosen King of</hi>
Bohemia, <hi>should <pb n="194" facs="tcp:53250:104"/> put a Dutch Garrison into</hi>
Segna; <hi>and that some of the Towns of</hi> Istria <hi>neerest to</hi> Segna,
<hi>such as should be chosen by the Emperour, and Archduke, should be restored
to the Archduke, that then two Commissaries should be chosen by the Emperour,
and two by the Commonwealth of</hi> Venice, <hi>according to whose award all
the adventitious and stipendiated Croates, who were wont to rove about before
the beginning of this present war, should be dismis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, but not those who had committed Piracy only in the
time of war; nor those who lived quietly at home; that such as were banish'd by
the Commonwealth should be driven out of the Archdukes Dominions, and that the
Pyrates Vessels should be burnt: which being done, that the Commonwealth should
restore all the Towns which they had taken, as well in</hi> Friuli, <hi>as
in</hi> Istria, <hi>and in other places: that all Fortifications and hostile
acts should cease on both sides, for the space of two moneths, to commence from
the beginning of the execution of the agreement: in which time that which
should be agreed upon should be performed: which when it should be done, all
Forces, as well by Sea as Land, should be withdrawn, and Traffick should be
restored to the same condition it was before the war began: that Prisoners on
all sides should be set at liberty, and that all those who had served the
Archduke should gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be pardoned: that the Emperour, and Archduke, should
promise for themselves, and for the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>that the Crabates
or Croates who should be driven out, should not be re admitted again, and that
the said Princes should not suffer the Seas to be infested for the time to
come, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Articles of</hi> Vienna, <hi>in the year 1612. the
tenor whereof was set down word for word in the said Capitulation: that the
Venetian Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour should declare, that the Commonwealths pretentions herein
were only for what concern'd the expelling of the adventitious and stipendiary
Crabates; and of the</hi> Banditi, <hi>who rove about the Seas, and commit
Piracy; so as for the future Traffick might be safe, and free from Pirates; but
not concerning those who live quietly with their Wives and Children; and for
what concern'd the liberty of Navigation, it was left according to the custom
of former times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These Articles were very honourable and advantagious for the
Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, who thereby got the principal point of their pretences, and of
their diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Archduke, which consisted chiefly not only in freeing the Gulf from being
molested by the Crabates Piracy, but that the performance thereof should
precede the restitution of the places which they had taken, they being for the
greater honour of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and the Archduke, first to restore only one
Town in <hi>Istria</hi> to them: which favour was the more freely granted them
in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> for that the King supposing that he was to

Archduke having (that he might be the more modest in his Arbitrement) been more
careful in satisfying the Commonwealth; thinking that by her freely remitting
the differences to be decided by him, she had abundantly satisfied the off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nces done by her to the Emperour and

that the King should be Arbitra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>or, but only Mediator of the differences; and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

refusing to accept thereof, he said he would send the Articles of agreement to
the Commonwealth, to the end that she if she did like them might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove 
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:53250:104"/> thereof: the truth of this business is hard to be known,
it having passed between the Venetian Embassadour and the Duke of

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>arged himself in words, without
Commission from the Commonwealth, for his so doing; to the end, that the King
by intending to be Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the differences, should not only incline to
favour the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in his sentence, but should also free the
Commonwealth, and the Gulf, from being troubled by the Duke of <hi>Ossuna;</hi>
it seeming to be improper, that he should compose differences as Arbitrator;
and as an enemy make war upon those who had freely put the differences, and
occasions of the war to his Arbitrement. On the other side, the Embassadour
never having shewed any special command from his Prince, for the absolute
remitting it to the King, nor no such thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever demanded of him, it
made much for the contrary: but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it was, the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>

Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour <hi>Gritti</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> that he might consent to the
same Articles in that Court; the Commonwealth having chosen to prefer the King
of <hi>France</hi> his Authority before that of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
were it either in respect of the differences which had past between her and the
Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of that Crown; or that by giving the honour to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and taking it from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> they thought
they did not only deny the King of <hi>Spain</hi> the Arbitrement of the
affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> which he pretended unto; but that they did compound
the business with more freedom and reputation, as if they thereby had made
known to the world, that they had never been brought to receive the Laws of
peace from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as that King had pretended; he by his
great interests with the Archduke, by succouring whom, and by his servant the
Duke of <hi>Ossuna</hi>'s Hostility, seeming in effect to be a party, and an
enemy: this Commission being come to <hi>Paris,</hi> the State-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of
that King were no less desirous to have the business concluded, then were the
Venetian Embassadours, in ambition that their King might seem to be the
Arbitrator of differences in <hi>Italy;</hi> and the King alledging for his
justification that he knew the King of <hi>Spains</hi> good will, as also the
danger which might insue by the breaking out of new and greater differences and
difficulties, if the agreement should be deferred; in the name of all the
parties that were absent, for all which he ingag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his word, confirmed and
ratified the same Articles as they had been pronounced by the Catholick King;
the Kings and Dukes Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours consented thereunto, who were not in any sort
acquainted with this peace before it was concluded; though the Duke, who to
divert the war from the Territories of the Commonwealth had drawn it upon
himself, would never, though never so much oppress'd, come to any agreement,
unless the Commonwealth were therein compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, or secured from the Spanish
Forces. The little respect which was shewen to the Catholick King increased the
envy of this action, who being chosen Arbitrator by the Commonwealth, or
according to thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>lves, Mediator;
and having furthered the Capitulations with so much satisfaction to her, though
against so great Princes, and so neerly allied to him, and who were assaulted
by the Commonwealth; she a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>erwards, not content to deny that Arbitrement which she seemed so
fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ly to have granted him, or at
least had signified her intention of granting it, had by applying her self to
the King of <hi>France,</hi> made him the chief Author and Moderator of that
peace, which she was to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge howsoever, from the moderation and
goodness of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the peace seemed to be stipulated no less to the prejudice of
the Commonwealth; for that the restitution of the <hi>Mahouns</hi> was not
therein comprehended, which since there was no breach between them 
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:53250:105"/> and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ought, as was pretended,
to be restored, as not taken in fair War. The Spaniards, on the other side,
pretending that the Kings Declara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion to assist the Archduke was a permissive hostility, denied
restitution; and the King refusing to decide this point, the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours were
pacified with the Kings promise that he would make them be restored, and so the
Articles of peace went forward. But the Commonwealth, partly that they might
stand upon the advantage of reputation, partly to shun the hatred and envy
which she purchased by that peace, and also for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
and Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, without whose knowledge the peace
was concluded, feigned to be very ill satisfied therewith, and, according to
her accustomed cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, laid the fault wholly upon the Embassadours, as if
they had done it of their own heads without the Commonwealths knowledge: They
therefore chose Seignieur <hi>Contarini</hi> in their place, and sent for them
presently back to <hi>Venice,</hi> that they might give a severe account of
that Action, pretending that they had exceeded their secret Orders and
particular Instructions: They also complained hereof to all the Princes that
we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e their Friends, protesting
that they would not stand to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles agreed upon in <hi>France.</hi> But
whatsoever their secret Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were, first it is to be supposed, such
prime Officers of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth would not have transgressed so; and
moreover it is most certain, that their publick Orders and Instructions were
general, and were sent after that the Senate had a Copy of the Articles
published in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> after they had been debated in
<hi>Venice,</hi> and after the <hi>Mahouns</hi> were lost: So as the
Commonwealth could not only not acquit her self by these her exclamations, but
did the more aggravate her fault, and made
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er cause the more odious; as if
not content with the small respect she had shewn to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
it had been lawful for her to treat the King of <hi>France</hi> so likewise;
who not having medled here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, save only at the Commonwealths request, and that
he might do what would be very acceptable to her, she when she had got her
desire and advantage thereby, would lay the fault upon the King which was her
own: But this excess past not unreseated; for the King stomach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this refusal
gave order that the new Embassadour <hi>Contarini</hi> should be ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ain'd in <hi>Lyons,</hi> and not
suffered to go from thence till the peace should be accepted of in
<hi>Venice,</hi> and till the other Embassadours should be freed from all
imputation, and should be fully restored to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all their
dignities and places in the Commonwealth: And yet the Venetians persisting in
this their pretention, a discourse in writing came forth not long after from
<hi>Venice,</hi> by which the same Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours said, that they were forced by
the King to stipulate that peace; for (as they alledged in that manuscript) the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred the sole power of arbitrement of the
differences in <hi>Italy</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> the King of
<hi>France</hi> desired to make use of and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise that power; and that
having notice, that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the French passing into
<hi>Piedmont</hi> after the surrender of <hi>Vercelles</hi> had committed
violence in <hi>Alessandria,</hi> where they had taken some of the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> Towns; the King of <hi>France</hi> began to doubt, that the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when this should be known, should alter his mind, and
by reason of these innovations should revoke the power of arbitrement 
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:53250:106"/> which he had already granted: So as out of a desire to
end these diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences before this News should come to the Court of
<hi>Spain,</hi> he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to abandon the Affairs of the Commonwealth and of
the Duke, in case the peace should not be speedily concluded; and that he would
joyn with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> to the prejudice both of the Venetians and Duke of
<hi>Savoy;</hi> and that he did so far persist in this, as he would not permit
them time to send an Express to <hi>Venice:</hi> So as, thinking it the lesser

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>l, they chose to comply with
the Kings desires. Which Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifications, having neither substance nor solidity
in them, did make the fault more apparent, and did much weaken the
Commonwealths plea; for if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had referred the
arbitrement of peace to the King of <hi>France,</hi> why was not the Spanish
Embassadour called to this action? why was not this expressed in the ingrossing
of that peace, in the Preface whereof the King of <hi>France</hi> used as
little forceable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he could to honest the prevention, that he might
justifie it to be his own action as much as might be; and what more fair and
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Justification could <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e
produce for himself then this? how could the King of <hi>Spain</hi> transfer
the arbitrement of the affairs of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matia, Friuli,</hi> and
<hi>Istria,</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> since they belong'd di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
to the Emperour and to the Archduke? which falling principally in the

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>on of that peace, there
was no reason why they should not only not be decided, but even not referred,
without the knowledge of those Princes, and without the intervening of their
Embassadours; and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

violences as little to be believed, if you either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the Kings Person;
(it being too contrary to the Laws of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and wherein the
Common-wealths Embassadours would hardly have met with the same measure at the
Divano in <hi>Constantinople:)</hi> Or if you mind the rigorous discipline of
the Venetian Common-wealth, which is a severe exacter of observancy of publick
Orders and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions from their Embassadours; it not being likely that the
Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that Commonwealth should so easily be threa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ened into so great a transgression; For who could fear
that that King, without any fault of the Dukes or Common-wealths, (who were
then absent, and knew not his Princely pleasure; and which is of more moment,
contrary to his own interest,) should so threaten the Embassadours only for a
little refractoriness; every one being probably to believe that the King would
have highly commended their wisdom and constancy in refusing to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto
him: As for the fear that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should revoke the power of
Arbitrement by reason of the new Commotions in <hi>Italy,</hi> the vanity of
the Paper doth therein more appear; since it is most certain, that the new
Rumours and Insultations against the Towns in <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi> began on the
third, and ended on the ninth of <hi>September;</hi> and that the peace was
concluded in <hi>Paris</hi> on the sixth day of the same Moneth; How could the
King of <hi>France</hi> in so short a time have notice of that Commotion? How
could he so soon resolve what to do, not to lose the power o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ore probably conclude by
that Paper, Writing, or Discourse, that the Common-wealths Embassadours were
moved to that action rather out of any other respect then of that which was
alledged: But let us return to our Story; The same Capitulations which were
stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in <hi>France</hi> (as hath been said) were twenty days after
accepted in <hi>Spain,</hi> and agreed unto by the Emperours and Archdukes
Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours in the names of their Princes; by the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi> in
the King of <hi>Spains</hi> name, and by the Embassadour <hi>Gritti</hi> in the
name of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; for the Court and King of <hi>Spain</hi> finding
that the King of <hi>Fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ad medled in that peace, and that
since he had made it he was ingaged to see it observed and put in execution,
they did not think good by distasting that action to adde rumour to rumour, nor
to make that war flame higher which they desired by all means to quench: To
this may be added, that the Capitulations being dictated by the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> self, and consequently approved of by him as just and
honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he could not now disapprove them.</p>
            <p>Thus the Common-wealth kept the Spanish Armyes far from her
Dominions by favou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Savoys</hi> Forces, and got also that advantage in the Agreement by their
cunning handling it, which was impossible for them to have done by their own
Forces. The precise observancy of the Articles of <hi>Asti</hi> were likewise
agreed upon at the Court at <hi>Madrid,</hi> between the Duke of
<hi>Lerma,</hi> in the King of <hi>Spains</hi> name, and Embassadour

from what was agreed upon between them, or should put any difficulty in

<hi>Vercelles,</hi> he seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very desirous of peace, even so far as he
offered to restore that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and desired nothing of the Duke but that he
would lay down Arms, and do what was agreed upon at <hi>Asti:</hi> The Duke,
who held himself to be baffled by him before the beginning of this last war,
touching the observance of the Treaty of Peace, professing to distrust him
much; desired that the rise might be had by the surrender of
<hi>Vercelles;</hi> saying, <hi>That till then he would not disarm, nor observe
the rest of the Articles of</hi> Asti, <hi>lest by Sophistical interpretations
he might again be cavil'd out of the restitution of so important a place; and
so, though much to his disadvantage and greater charge, embroil</hi> Piedmont
<hi>again.</hi> Having therefore refused to speak with the Governour, he kept
still in Arms, being resolved not to lay t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

whereof, the Count of <hi>Oneria,</hi> General of the Horse in <hi>France;</hi>
the Duke of <hi>Rean,</hi> Marshal <hi>Diguieres,</hi> Monsieur <hi>di
Termes,</hi> Count <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalle,</hi> Count <hi>Scomberge,</hi> with many
other Lords, were come to <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> with great store of Horse and
Foot: And the Marquess of <hi>Baden,</hi> with the Prince of <hi>Hannault,</hi>
were likewise come thither from <hi>Germany,</hi> accompanied with many
Souldiers: And those of <hi>Berne,</hi> in recompence of the general renouncing
made by the Duke of certain Towns pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to by him, and possessed by them
upon the Confines of <hi>Savoy;</hi> had at their own charge sent him 3000
Foot.</p>
            <p>The Duke finding himself to have, with these Recruits and with
those that were come out of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> about 20000 Foot, and between 3
and 4000 Horse, was once more become Master of the Field: And on the contrary,
the Governour having consumed many men, first in the besieging, and then in the
Garrisoning of <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and having quartered the rest of his Army,
which was much lessened, in several places far from the Confines of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> he was once more exposed to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e Dukes injuries; who after <hi>Vercelles</hi> was
lost, was become more powerful then he; and who, being desirous to re gain, if
not <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celles,</hi> at least his Reputation for the loss thereof; and to
revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for the losses and affronts which he had received; had now
oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to do it, not only by the increase of his own Forces, and by the
Governours negligence, but he had also many about him who incited him
thereunto, though he needed no inciters; For the Commanders who were come from
<hi>France</hi> being desirous of Novelties to allay the reputation of the
Spanish forces, and to make the Duke an amends for the losses he had suffered
by their so long delay; approved of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust as just and reasonable; and
said <hi>They would never go out of</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, desired him that he would either restore
<hi>Vercelles,</hi> or deposite it into the Popes hands, or into those of the
King of <hi>France,</hi> or into the hands of some other Prince that he might
confide in, whilst the Duke should really disarm, and should observe the whole
remainder of the Treaty of Peace: But the Governours distrust was no less; who
thinking that the Duke had not the first time proceeded si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>cerely in point of disarming, thought he might justly
doubt he would much less do it when <hi>Vercelles</hi> should be restored: So
as he would not depend therein upon the wills of others; nor thought he that it
suited with his own reputation, nor with the dignity of the Kings Forces, not
to reap any good by the so much labour and so much monies spent in the taking
of that City; and he likewise was loth to hazzard it, lest when the Duke should
have regained <hi>Vercelles,</hi> and being so well provided of Forces, he
might aspire after greater things; but then considering how strong the Duke was
grown by his new Recruits, and that other Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were marching to side with
him on this side the Mountains, he did not openly refuse to consent to the
propounded propositions; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending sometime; to advise with his Councel;
sometimes that since there was question touching the alteration of the Articles
of <hi>Asti,</hi> by which disarming was to precede
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>estitution, the Nuntio nor
Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour had no power from their Princes to alter them; he was ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous 
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:53250:108"/> in his answers, that he might delay the conclusion as
much as he might; thinking by this ambiguity and irresolution to make the Duke
suspend his intentions, as well as his Forces, which being collectitious and
made up of many Nations, it was probable they would crumble away, especially
since the Duke had not monies any ways sufficient to pay them: Whereas, on the
contrary, his men being refreshed, and lately increased in numbers, he hoped to
have the better. Wherefore seeing the Duke so strong, he had already given
order for making new Levies of men in several parts, and sent for a great part
of his Army into <hi>Alessandria</hi> and the parts thereabouts.</p>
            <p>But the Duke, and the French more then he, finding by these
tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versations and windings about but small inclination in the Governour to
part with <hi>Vercelles,</hi> they did distrust him the more; and therefore
being unwilling to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed with
vain hopes, or to wait till the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Forces being augmented, he might
treat of agreement upon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and as having the upper hand might
prescribe them Laws in the making of peace; being moreover desirous not to
return to <hi>France</hi> without leaving some memory of their actions in
<hi>Italy</hi> they instigated and encouraged the Duke, who was desirous of
revenge, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himself for what he had lost, to assault some Towns in
the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> Which opinion (as many thought) wrought upon the
French Embassadour, upon whose Authority the Forces of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and their
Actions did depend; and this general opinion was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not only upon the
eager inclination of so many Commanders of his Nation, who were continually by
him, for leave to assault some of the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Towns, but also
upon his not being satisfied with the Proceedings he met with in
<hi>Alessandria</hi> concerning composure of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. Count <hi>Guido</hi>
his re-admittance, which was constantly denied by the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
was also no little hinderance to the businesses of <hi>Italy:</hi> The Duke
being therefore resolved to make use of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasions, went from
<hi>Asti</hi> upon the coming on of night with his two Sons, <hi>Victorio</hi>
and <hi>Thomaso,</hi> upon pretence that the Governour by his recalling of his
men from <hi>Alessandria</hi> threatned to assault that Town; and he carried
along with him about 10000 Foot and 2000 Horse; the M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Monsieur <hi>di Termes;</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on break of day they came to
<hi>Filizzano,</hi> a great Town belonging to the King, but open and without
walls, where about 1500 Trentinians were quartered; who refusing upon any
whatsoever condition to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render the Town, Prince <hi>Victorio</hi> and
Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> came up with the main body of the Battle, and gave an
assault, wherein it was bravely fought on both sides; the Assailants were
thrice repuls'd; but at last those within having no way to defend themselves
but by setting their Carts and Carriages cross the way, they were overcome at
the fourth assault, and all of them put to the Sword, together with many of the
Town of all sexes and ages, some few whereof were taken Prisoners; and the
Town, together with nine Colours of the Trentinians, and two Colours of the
Townsmen, fell into the Dukes power. <hi>Refrancore</hi> was surrende<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Garrison, which were 100 Swissers, who, as being Confederates with the Duke,
were sent home unprejudiced: <hi>Ribaldone</hi> also, and some other Towns
beyond the <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naro,</hi> 
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:53250:108"/> being terrified at what
had befallen <hi>Filizzano,</hi> surrendered; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Nizza, Acqui,</hi>
and <hi>Bistagno,</hi> together with all the <hi>Langa,</hi> even to the Sea,
being in a manner cut off from <hi>Alessandrino,</hi> were much endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
lest the Duke should possess himself of them, to hinder the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of those
who were expected to come to the State of <hi>Millain</hi> from beyond Sea, and
particularly 500 Spanish Foot, who were at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time landed at
<hi>Savona.</hi> But the Duke and the French, it is not known for what reason,
leaving that Enterprize of greater consequence, advanced to
<hi>Quattordici,</hi> where there were two Companies of Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinians, who
having leave to march out with a Cane in their hands, yielded the Town unto the
Duke, who marched farther on to take <hi>Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leri</hi> and <hi>Corniento</hi>
in the County of <hi>Alessandrino,</hi> not above six miles distant from the
City. The Governour, who (as hath been said) was there, sent <hi>Lodovico
Guasco,</hi> though he were not yet well cured of his wounds received before
<hi>Vercelles,</hi> with 200 Horse to discover the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and, if it were
possible, to withstand his violence; as also to back the Countrey people who
retreated into the City; who coming near the Enemy had some sleight Skirmishes
with them; but being assaulted by a body of Horse he was forced to flye, being
charged to even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the Walls of the Town. This put the City into much
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and confusion, seeing the Enemy advance so couragiously; whilst many
of <hi>Castellazzo, Bosco,</hi> and of all the parts thereabouts, not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themselves safe in that City, sent their Wives and Goods into the Towns of
<hi>Genoa:</hi> And the Alessandrians putting themselves in arms stood to
defend the Walls, hourly looking to be assaulted by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and truly,
there not being in that City above 6000 Foot, and some Horse Companies, there
being also but little victuals there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n, nor in the parts thereabouts; and the honour of the Spanish
Force<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> lessening through ill
Government, as also the peoples inclination to them, who were weary of so
troublesome a War, the State of <hi>Millain</hi> was much endangered. All the
Forces of <hi>Montferrat</hi> were therefore sent for to defend that City, and
were quartered thereabouts: Wherefore <hi>Gio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van Ieronimo Doria,</hi> their
Commander, having immediately given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that they should all meet in
<hi>Cuccaro,</hi> except those who were to guard the Towns of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> march'd out himself with 2500 Foot, and 400 Horse, and not
tarrying for others who were coming to him, resolved to put himself into
<hi>Alessandria:</hi> But the Duke and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal having notice thereof
endeavoured to meet him upon the way, and to fall upon him with all their
Forces, and defeat him. As they were in pursuit of him they understood he was
past on; so leaving their Foot behind them, they advanced with their Horse, and
about evening got up unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doria</hi> was not affrighted when he saw himself assaulted at
a distance, nor lost he either courage or counsel; but fortifying himself upon
a plain, neer a little hill, which was fenced on the front by a great ditch,
and by some lesser ditches on the sides, he placed the Foot there, and left the
Horse without, that they might first receive the encounter, which if they could
not sustain, that then they might withdraw themselves into the plain: The Horse
resisted gallantly; but not being able to hold out against so great a number,
they retreated in good order to the Foot, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:53250:109"/> whereinto
whilest the Duke and Marshal endeavoured to penetrate, they were so fiercely
saluted by volleys of Musket-shot, which were so opportunely discharged, as
though wheeling about on all sides, they strove to break in upon them, they
could never do it; but after the death of many of the assailants, and the
imprisonment of some, amongst which Monsieur <hi>di S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Andres de Vius,</hi> a
Gentleman of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> was one, the night coming on already apace,
they retreated; and <hi>Doria</hi> came the same night to <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>u,</hi> and from thence, by the way of
S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Salvadore,</hi> to <hi>Allessandria,</hi> where he was received by the
Governour with much honour and applause. The Governour was then, by reason of
the diversity of his Officers opinions, very much confused, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resolved
what to do; some would have him go out with those men which he already had, and
with others who were coming, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the Enemy in the field; others,
that he should keep within the Walls, and defend the City; <hi>Doria</hi> was
for his keeping in the City, telling him, that the French could not keep the
field long, nor do any thing against any of the chief Towns, for that they were
well munited; and that the Enemy not being able to keep together long for want
of moneys, would quickly moulder away, and being reduced to a small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number,
would be assaulted upon better advantage, and overcome with less danger; and
because they feared <hi>Valenza</hi> upon the <hi>Poe,</hi> it not being very
well Garrisonn'd, <hi>Doria</hi> took upon him the defence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and entred
thereinto with about a thousand Horse. The Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spairing to do any good upon
the City, whereinto many men were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and did still enter, set fire on
<hi>Felizzano,</hi> and the places thereabouts, and went against
<hi>Annone,</hi> a strong place, and which was guarded with about 2000 Foot,
but ill provided of powder or ammunition: Those within came out against him,
but were soon made to retreat back into the Town by <hi>Termes:</hi> The Cannon
being afterwards mounted, they came to battery, and from thence to assault,
which being luckily made on three sides, the defendants not being able to
resist long for want of Ammunition, retreated tumultuously into the Castle;
which not being better provided of Ammunition than was the Town, and much
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with victuals for so great a
multitude; and being little, and incapable of so many men; whereas with a
proportionable Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison it might have defended it self, it became undefendible
through the multitude of defendants, and was forced to treat of surrender the
sooner, as not having wherewith to feed so many people; it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
agreed, <hi>That they should march forth with their Arms; and that they should
be convoyed to the Kings Territories;</hi> which Agreement being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
too sophistically interpreted by the Duke, they were sent to the County of
<hi>Burgony,</hi> which was then under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they
might serve no more in this present War: they then went speedily by the Bridge
which was cast over the <hi>Tannaro,</hi> to <hi>Arazzo,</hi> which was
immediately abandoned by the Garrison consisting of 1500 Foot, who seeing the
Bridge thrown over, and the Dukes men march over it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired into
<hi>Alessandria;</hi> but being pursued by <hi>Termes,</hi> and Monsieur
<hi>della B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rsce,</hi> they were
assaulted on the Rere, where were 300 Swissers, who after no long dispute
basely yielded, their lives, but not their Arms, being saved; in which in erim
the rest of the Garrison, who march'd <pb n="205" facs="tcp:53250:109"/> on, without ever
turning back upon the Enemy, or succouring their companions, had time to get
safe into <hi>Alessandria:</hi> wherefore the Governour, who was ill
counselled, and whose Forces were but weak, not thinking it safe to march out
into the fields, and to expose his men, whereon the defence of the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> did wholly and solely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, to the uncertainty of Battle,
stood looking on whilst his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was burnt and destroyed, his Garrisons
slain, and his Towns taken by that Enemy, whom (though once superiour to him in
Forces) he could not overcome, because he knew not how to use the Victory. But
perhaps the Dukes destiny is to be raised up when he is at the lowest, and to
be opprest when he is at the greatest height; to the end that never keeping in
the same condition, he should be a singular exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the world both of good
and bad fortune. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour complained, and protested under his hand to
Cardinal <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovisio,</hi> that he was assaulted by the Duke, and by the
French with the Forces and Ensignes of the Kingdom under publick faith, for
that the affairs of the war were already agreed between the two Kings, which
had kept him from making provision of new men; and by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses sent speedily
away to <hi>Paris</hi> he made the like complaints to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> accusing his Ministers, that by assaulting the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> with the Arms and Ensigns of <hi>France,</hi> they had broken
the good understanding, and the Conventions of peace which were agreed upon
between their Majesties of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain:</hi> But on the other
side, seeing so many French and Dutch in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and fearing that
they had higher aims, he did the more sollicite, that the new levies might be
made which were already appointed: and, as if the safety of the whole State of
<hi>Millain</hi> had been therein concern'd, he writ into <hi>Spain</hi> for
spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy supplies of money; and demanded the succour from the Princes of
<hi>Italy,</hi> which they were bound to send for the defence of the State of
<hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;</hi> and to the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> that he would
immediately send him the Souldiers which were in the Fleet, it being then
returned from the Gulf; for it was not thought that the peace, though
concluded, would be observed, by reason of the Dukes new resentments, wherein
it was much doubted, that dissimulation might be used; though it was known,
that the King of <hi>France</hi> had sent in all haste to the Court of
<hi>Spain</hi> to excuse himself for what had happened, as being done contrary
to his orders, and beyond all expectation, through the too great fervor and
ardency of his Commanders, who were more inclin'd to novelty, then that their
two Majesties should joyn together in Union: And if the Duke, when he was
beaten and under batches, was so little pliable to Treatie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of peace, how
much less was it likely that he would now con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

an occasion in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent conjuncture of times, and accompanied with so great

            <p>But the errours were already too much multiplied, which were
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted either in undertaking, or in prosecuting the war: the

               </gap>aking up of Arms for a meer
punctillio of honour had produced too bitter fruits: the King and Court of
<hi>Spain</hi> having been interessed in this war, contrary to their own will,
by their Ministers in <hi>Italy;</hi> minding now more the safety and quiet of
<hi>Italy,</hi> then the honesting of an advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <pb n="206" facs="tcp:53250:110"/>
peace, which was that for which the Italian Agents fought, did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test the
continuance thereof beyond measure; and the King of <hi>France,</hi> not being
able to minde the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and not being desirous to lose the
honour of having once again made peace in <hi>Italy,</hi> wish'd that it might
be made by any whatsoever means; and therefore as the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
accepting of the King of <hi>France</hi> his satisfactions had sent very
precise Orders into <hi>Italy</hi> for the execution of what was agreed upon;
so the King of <hi>France</hi> having upon the complaints made by the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour sent a Messenger into <hi>Italy</hi> to reprehend the French Lords
and Commanders sharply for what they had done, and to wish them upon pain of
grievous punishment to desist, <hi>Italy</hi> was freed from the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of
the late war, and from the fear and dread of that which was to insue; which was
likely to have been more cruel and bloody then the former. So as the Duke
seeing himself, on the one side, at it were abandoned by the Venetians, and
that the two Kings were desirous he should agree; and on the other side, that
he had brought his affairs to such a pass, as that he might compound with
satisfaction, gave way to what was establish'd in <hi>France,</hi> and in
<hi>Spain;</hi> the rather, for that he was fully secured by the King of
<hi>France,</hi> that <hi>Vercelles</hi> should be restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that his
State should be secured and defended. Thus then the here under-written Articles
were made on the ninth of <hi>October</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> whither the

with the Cardinals assistance, and intervening.</p>

Duke of</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua, <hi>to the Church, to the Empire, and to whatsoever
particular person: this being done, that the Governour, to comply with the King
of</hi> France <hi>his desire, should in the King his Masters name, restore
immediately whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had been taken during the war: that all prisoners
should be set at liberty on both sides as soon as the Duke should have
restored: that this being done, the Governour should dispose of his Army
according to the Articles of</hi> Asti: <hi>upon these terms a period was put
to the wars of</hi> Lombardy <hi>and</hi> Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont: <hi>and the Duke at last
laid down Arms, rather for that he had less occasion to use them, then that his
desire to use them was lessened.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Rumours ceased not for all this on the Venetians behalf; they were
freed from fear of the Spanish Fleet, which was gone by the Kings command from
the Gulf, and retreated into the <hi>Tyrrhene</hi> Sea; they perceived the
weakness of the Spanish Counsels and Forces in <hi>Lombar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi> that the
Dukes Forces by the great recruits from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
had got the upper hand: they argued by the dissimulation used in the Court of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and by the insultings suffer'd in <hi>Alessandria,</hi> that
the King and that Court were weary of war in <hi>Italy;</hi> and desirous to
make peace upon any terms. They therefore being confident that they should meet
with the same respect and the like; usage, notwithstanding the peace already
made, will continue the Siege of <hi>Gradisca,</hi> which they saw was reduced
to so great streights as it could not long hold out: howsoever, were it either
for the reputation of their Forces, or <pb n="207" facs="tcp:53250:110"/> out of a desire
of getting that Town, they could not think of coming empty-handed out of this
war, wherein they had been at so much pains and expence: and doubtlesly, if
they had effected their intention, all things would have been again in great
disorder, so loth would they have been to part with that they had gotten: but
their Counsel proved not at all fortunate; for Archduke <hi>Leopold,</hi> who
had still an eye to the conduct of that war, upon the Confines of
<hi>Friuli,</hi> and the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Embassadour Resident in <hi>Venice</hi>
knowing how impossible it was to be relieved, nor having any other means
whereby to provide for the preservation of that place, writ to the Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him know in what danger it was of being lost,
unless, as the last remedy, he would molest the Confines of the Commonwealth on
his side. The Governour therefore made many of the Forces who were quartered
upon those Confines pass into the Counties of <hi>Bergomo</hi> and
<hi>Crema,</hi> who took from the Venetians the Castle of <hi>Fara;</hi> and
went afterwards to <hi>Romano,</hi> where though they were repuls'd yet they
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran the neighbouring Towns, plundering and carrying away great store of
prey, to the very great prejudice of the people in those parts; for the
Venetians were wholly unprovided there; wherefore fearing some worser thing if
that commotion should increase, they sent for the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Embassador into the
Colledge; this Embassador was Don <hi>Alphonso della Cuena,</hi> Marquess of
<hi>Belmar,</hi> who at the Kings request was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards made Cardinal: he
having been always very attentive to the success of affairs in <hi>Venice</hi>
had by his seasonable advice and instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sent to <hi>Naples, Millain</hi>
and <hi>Germany,</hi> been a good help to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of that war for the
advantage of the King and Archduke, and consequently, had been prejudicial to
the Venetians; who being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ill looked upon by them, and hated, as one
who pryed too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into their intentions and actions, had not for many
moneths of late negotiated with any one neither in private nor in publick:
being upon this occasion sent for to the Colledge, after many complaints and
alterations made by the Doge on the one side, for the Fleets having entred the
Gulf in an hostile manner, and for the fresh assaults made by the Souldiers of
<hi>Millain;</hi> and by the Embassadour on the other side, for the war made
upon the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> for the continual helps and fomentations
administer'd to the wars of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and for the Siege continued
before <hi>Gradisca,</hi> contrary to the Articles of peace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready agreed
upon, and accepted by them; the Venetians thought it good at last to be
content, that if the Embassadour would promise that all hostile acts should
cease in the parts towards <hi>Millain,</hi> they would suffer so much Victuals
to be daily ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ried into
<hi>Gradisca</hi> as should serve for their daily nourishment; and that this
agreement should last, till such time as peace were put in execution: which
though it were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready done with reciprocal satisfaction on all sides by Land,
yet were not the Venetians free from being injured and insulted over by Sea;
for when the Spanish Fleet was gone from the Gulf, the Venetians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fall
foul upon the Ragusians, in resentment of their having gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven receptacle in
their Havens to the Fleet which wronged he Subjects and Towns which were under
the Commonwealth. The Ragusians had recourse to the Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi>
who was commanded to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect <pb n="208" facs="tcp:53250:111"/> them by the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> since they live under his protection: their recourse was not in
vain, nor was the Viceroy slow in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; who forbore not to vex that
Commonwealth once more, which he did prosecute with so vehement hatred;
wherefore since he could not have the Gallies in a readiness for this new
attempt, he sent <hi>Rivera</hi> into the <hi>Adriatick</hi> Sea with 18
Patacks and Galleoons, very well vers'd in what belong'd to warlike affairs,
who coming on the 15th of <hi>Novemb.</hi> above <hi>Raggugia,</hi> kend the
Venetian Fleet a far off, conducted by <hi>Veniero;</hi> which coming from
forth the Haven of <hi>San Croce,</hi> within half a mile of <hi>Raggugia,</hi>
came to assault him. The Venetian Fleet consisted of 19 Galleoons, 6
Galleasses, 32 small Gallies, and 15 large Albanese Vessels, which in all made
up the number of 72 bottoms: a Fleet certainly advantagious for the greatness,
or number of the Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and for the store of Artillery, and much exceeding
that of <hi>Rivera,</hi> but so bare of men, as the Souldiery came not to 2300,
and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners and Oar-men were not so many as were requisite: the Sea was
that day very calm, and the air very still; so as the Viceroys Galleoons not
being able to move, and the Venetians Fleet coming on leisurely, they came at
last, about Sun-set, to within two Cannon-shot of one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: here they stood
looking one upon another, not doing any thing: the Venetian Fleet having put
themselves into the form of a Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moon, began to discharge their great Guns,
though at a distance, with intent, if not of offending, at least of scaring the
Enemy, and of keeping him far off: this firing their Guns so far off, and at
all adventures, wrought contrary effects to what the Commander imagined; for
the Spaniard believing this to be a bravado of the Enemy, and that he detested
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to close fight, grew more confident, and placing his hopes of Victory
in boarding indeavour'd when the Sun was up to fall on: but the wind proving
scarce, he was forced to temporize till about noon, when the wind beginning to
blow more briskly, he couragiously as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted the Enemies Fleet; and having
past and repast several times amidst them with his Admiral, which was of a
large bulk, excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently well munited, and very yare, and having prejudiced
them much with his great Guns, and slaine many of them with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-shot, he
infused such terrour into the Venetians, as throwing themselves behind the
Banks and Waste-cloaths, and retiring to the safest parts of their Vessels,
they did almost give over all defence, min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to and fro couragiously amongst them, shewing much undauntedness; he incourag'd
some, threatned others, and struck divers, to make them stand to their Arms and
Fight: but so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was Military discipline observed, so great their terror

doubled; and he himself get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Galleoon Balby, put his valour to its

courage and animosity not being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to his, and cowardise and fear of

no more respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then it had b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

enemies Cannon, then by the Storm at Sea; two of the smaller Gallies, with all
the men that were in them, sunk at high Sea; three others running upon shore
were split, but their men saved: And the Viceroy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> Galleoons, the enemies Fleet being fled, and they

Vessels were much rent by the Venetian Cannon, which was peradventure the cause
why they did not pursue the enemy, and make themselves masters of the whole
Fleet.</p>
            <p>The Common-wealth was not a little afflicted at the success of
this Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tel; they were so
scandalized and incensed with the Captains and many of the Officers, as they
put many of them out of their places, and imprisoned many of the Masters and
Masters-Mates, who had been most guilty of Cowardise; particularly, the
Captains of the Galleasses, because scorning their Generals Command, they had
not the courage to assault the enemy: And <hi>Veniero,</hi> for having shewed
so much courage and valour upon this occasion, was made Procurator of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <hi>Mark,</hi> an eminent Dignity in that Common wealth, and next to the Doge;
but finding how little authority he had over his Captains, and that he was a
more practical, experienced, and daring Commander, then became a wary Admiral
of the Venetian Fleet to be; the Common-wealths intrinsical intentions being
that by no means (no not upon evident hopes of victory) he should hazzard a
Battel as he had done; they put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his place; but fearing yet worse,
other Ships and Vessels of war being come to them from <hi>Holland</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> with 3000 Dutch Foot, conducted by Count <hi>Levestein</hi>
at the Common-wealths charges; so as their Fleet was greater then before,
wherein was 40 Gallies, 34 Galleoons,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>6 Galleasses, and other smaller
Vessels; they put the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were come from <hi>Holland,</hi> and
those that were come from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Gradisca,</hi> into them, and sent them
out of their Washes command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pietro Barbarico,</hi> Procurator of St.
<hi>Mark,</hi> who upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was made General at Sea: There hath not
been in our times any Fleet of the Common-wealths like unto this, so powerful
and so well furnished with fighting men, which being for the most part
For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners caused notwithstanding more fear then confidence in the
Common-wealth, she being naturally cautious in all her actions, and extreamly
diffident of forreign forces, unless they be justly counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poised by her own
Country men; therefore not trusting them with so great a Fleet, but
apprehending much that the Fleet might be utterly lost by any unthought of
accident, by the sudden sedition or mutiny of the Souldiers, or secret
intelligence between the Captains; they by a new and unheard of advice, took
order that neither Powder nor Shot <pb n="210" facs="tcp:53250:112"/> should be delivered
out to the Souldiers: Thus did this Fleet scour over the Adriatick Sea, more
out of pomp and ostentation, to shew that Maritime Empire which she could but
ill make good against much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour enemies, then out of any present need;
for the Viceroys Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leoons were already by orders from the King withdrawn into
the Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bene Sea: The Common-wealth did notwithstanding apprehend that storm
nee at hand, and even with the very City of <hi>Venice,</hi> which they so much
fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed would fall upon their
Fleet; for some forreign Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers remaining yet in the City, the Senate had
either notice, or were jealous, that they had secretly plotted to burn the
Arsenal, to Plunder the Mint-house, the Custom-house, and publick-Treasury; and
to do yet more, if their design should prove fortunate.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Ossuna</hi> was said to be the chief Authour of
this Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy; who having taken many Souldiers into his pay at
<hi>Naples,</hi> and of seve al Nations, but the most of them French, had
corrupted them by monies and large promises, and had sent them, by a few at a
time, to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> where they were willingly entertained by the
Common-wealth, by reason of their great scarcity of Souldiers: This was given
out to be the carriage of this business, though the publick Transactions were
very secretly supprest by the Senator; and were it not for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
inflicted upon many, there appeared not any the least signe of such a
Conspiracy, either before or after the execution of such wicked ones; nay, many
circumstances were repugnant, if not to the truth, yet to the probable
possibility of what was divulged: nay there were those who with rational
arguments proved the vainness thereof. It was also observed that the
Common-wealth, which was wont to exaggerate in all Princes Courts against the
Spaniards, and to make their Agents to be conceived violent and insiduous of
what was other mens, said not a word upon this so great occasion, and past it
over with miraculous silence, not only towards the Princes who were their
friends, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their resident Embassadours; unless it were that not
being able to dissemble the business with the latter, who were present at so
strange an accident, they acquainted them with a certain Plot, but in very
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral terms, which was accompanied with much ambiguity: They spoke not one
word thereof to the Spanish Embassadour, though he was firmly believed to have
a hand in it; and who came the next day into the Colledge boldly to demand, as
he pretended, better pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the safe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y of his person against the popular insultings; but in effect to
witness his innocency to the world by that his confident ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: And it is
most certain that the people would have hardly been kep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> from committing some insolencies upon his person, if
any thing of certain or of ambiguous had appeared against him: What ever the
busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was, many Forreigners, and particularly all the French Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
were with much universal error led to the common Gaol, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them hung
up by the heels afterwards, and many drown'd; and upon the arriv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>l of Faluca sent from <hi>Venice</hi>
to the Fleet, whilst it was upon the Island <hi>Corsola,</hi> by order from
General <hi>Barbarico,</hi> one <hi>Iacomo Pier,</hi> a French man by Nation,
was put into a Sack and cast into the Sea: This man being a Pyrate, and having
gotten some same, was first entertained by the Duke of <hi>Ossuna</hi> for the
service of the Fleet; and <pb n="211" facs="tcp:53250:112"/> passing afterwards, without
leave, over to the Venetians, was received with great honour and extraordinary
pay. Captain <hi>Pettardiers,</hi> his companion, had somewhat a differing end;
he was first Strapado'd, and then hung by the foot upon the main-Mast; For the
Duke of <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suna</hi>'s part, it was manifest, that being fled from his
service to serve the Venetians, he gave publick order for the disbursing of
4000 Duck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats to them out of the Venetian Banks, as a gracious reward for their
service, and for the remainder of pay which was due to them; and that he had
been thus liberal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o them, only
for that it being known in <hi>Venice,</hi> they would be suspected by the
Common-wealth. These acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, were they either true or false, did
notwithstanding no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the main business of the peace agreed upon:
For the Venetians (as hath been said) had been very silent therein; being
satisfied with the restitution of <hi>Fara</hi> in the Country of
<hi>Bergamo,</hi> they were content to attribute all the disorder which had
happened there to military disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and not to the Governours commands,
as the Governour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self confess'd it was: For what remained, they promised
reparation for any damage done by the Common-wealth in this Commotion; which
notwithstanding was never given; and but very small satisfaction was given to
the Merchants for their Vessels which were taken in the Gulf; though the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> writ very punctually concerning it to the Viceroy.</p>
            <p>The performance of the Peace of <hi>Asti</hi> was reserved for the
last, and for the satisfaction of the Duk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> Count <hi>Gualdo</hi>'s Restauration, to the
which none being obliged by the Articles of <hi>Asti</hi> but the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who ingaged himself for it, it appeared impossible that the
Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> should ever be brought to consent thereunto; neither
would, nor could the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in reason compel him thereunto; but
as Protector of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> he was bound to defend it, as he had
formerly promised to do, against all the delinquents of that State: Yet the
King of <hi>France</hi> being much concerned in seeing the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> satisfied, by what he had undertaken by the Capitulations of
<hi>Asti;</hi> and the Duke threatning new Commotions against
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> which was not likely to have succeeded without the consent
and assistance of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was distasted at the Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi>'s so great obdurancy; both the Kings having therefore
acquainted the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> with the new inconveniencies which were
likely to insue, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so desired him by their Embassadours, that he would
pardon Count <hi>Guido;</hi> the Duke preferring Peace and the publick good
before his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate revenge and anger, and being also moved by the example of
both those Kings, who, as also their Fathers, (Princes of so great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
had pardoned more hainous Delinquents; resolved at last to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, and to
restore him to his former Estate and Honour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the wished for end was
put to the Wars of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Montferrat;</hi> which certainly
would have put <hi>Italy</hi> into her former peaceful conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for there
was nothing more desired by the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> then this) had not the
Statists in <hi>Italy,</hi> by new and unthought of accidents, inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her in

and the being fomented by the Venetians, his discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment was not to be

Venetians without his intervening or participation, that that Commonwealth had
assisted him more for their own private ends, then for the good of the common
cause, it had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deprived him of placing any future hope in them; and if
when he was joyn'd with them, and upheld by the French, he had got no other
good by so many wars, by such labours and dangers, then the bare venting of his
anger, and some satisfaction that he had been the first of all the Italian
Potentates that had dared to withstand the Spanish Forces, which were formerly

going from the Territories of <hi>Millain</hi> to those of <hi>Cremona,</hi>
touched upon some part of a controverted Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, the King caused the
business to be decided, with satisfaction to <pb n="214" facs="tcp:53250:114"/> the
Venetians: and the new Governour <hi>Feria,</hi> who was very desirous to
preserve peace, and to pluck up all occasions by the roots which might occasion
new Ruptures between the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> listned

to be molested by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and being also de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous of
revenge, for the losses and injuries which he had suffered, indeavoured to give
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> a more powerful neighbour then himself; wherefor
coming to <hi>Pavia,</hi> where he spoke with the new Governour, he offer'd to
yield up <hi>Montferrat</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon the receiving
of another State, by way of change, which might be equivalent to
<hi>Montferrat:</hi> a business which could not be effected, as well by reason
of the inequality of the bargain, as for that it was of an odious consequence,
and badly resented not only by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> but by the
Venetians, and by the French; and which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently would have afforded
occasions of new jealousies, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, instead of taking them away;
wherefore forgoing the further pursuit thereof, he fell upon a more pleasing
Negotiation, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the differences of <hi>Montferrat</hi> so as both the
Dukes might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and that wound might for ever be cured which was
likely yet to cause so great Commotions in the now peaceful condition of
<hi>Italy:</hi> but this indeavour proved vain, by reason of the too great
difference of the two Princes pretentions; so as though <hi>Feria</hi> treated

afterwards with <hi>Phileberto,</hi> Prince of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was at this

but those ends are seldom composed which are most earnestly indeavoured. This

Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Agents, now when the edge of their weapons was taken off by the late

they had met with a constant couragious resistance, grew the prouder; and
thinking that they were sure of the Kings good will, they laid aside all fear
of future molestation, and much of their respect to the Authority, and Power of
that Crown; and therefore holding back from what they saw the King did so
intensively desire, they thought by their being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for action, to put a
stand to the resolutions of that Court, and to make them do whatsoever they
pleased, as if the King would grant any thing, and would not refuse any

and devotion to the French; and the Spaniards, who had long before aspired to
draw this Nation to them by Leagues, and to joyn it by confederacy to the State

built a Fort royal just where the River <hi>Adda</hi> falls into the Lake, and
named it by his own name Fort <hi>Fuentes:</hi> which standing upon the
Confines, and almost in the jawes of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> did not only keep
that Va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

jealousie, knowing that by reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and consequence of its
situation the Count aimed at it, but because being upon the Lake it might
easily hinder that Nation from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
and with <hi>Italy,</hi> by which so many Grison families live, and have their
being. The Grisons, who were chiefly concern'd therein, did not only exclaim
against the building of this Fort, but the Venetians also and the French; and
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, who was then alive, was not a little offended
at it, as well for the interest of his Colleagues, as for fear lest the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, the Spanish Authority should grow too great:
but all this was in vain, for neither the Venetians nor other Italian Princes
had any mind to fall out with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was then at
the height of her greatness and authority, so as they were necessitated to be
quiet; and the King of <hi>France,</hi> were it either that he was not
displeased that the Grisons should begin to taste the good of the Venetian
League, or that he did not then much value it, would not break with
<hi>Spain</hi> upon that occasion, which (as he was wont to say) did not
principally belong to him; and the Swissers, who were the Grisons antient
Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, although they mutter'd somewhat, yet being corrupted in their
Diets, partly by their home dissentions, partly by Spanish gold, did only
pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>swade the Grisons to
accommodate themselves to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <pb n="219" facs="tcp:53250:117"/> of the times,
and to provide civilly for their affairs; wherefore the Venetians, seeing
themselves left all alone, and that Count <hi>Fuentes</hi> was ready with a
great Army, when the Grisons, who upon their account had entred into these
troubles, demanded aid of them, did at last declare, that they thought it not
fit that the peace of <hi>Italy</hi> should be disturbed upon such an occasion.
Thus the Fort <hi>Fuentes</hi> kept unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced by the Forces or threats of
so many Princes. But the year 1613 being, together with the time of
Confederacy, expired, the Venetians bethought themselves not only of renewing
the League, but of esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing it for ever; and, as being a thing necessary
to the very being of their State and Liberty, they laid out great store of
moneys in that Nation, whereby they purchased so many Partakers, and so
numerous a Faction, and so many Votes adhering to their party, as prevailing
over the French and Spanish Faction, both which were too weak to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them,
they united themselves by means of the Agents of both the Crowns; and those
Agents joyning in their endeavours and designs, which till then had been
contrary to one another, labour'd to exclude the Venetian Confederacy:
Wherefore the French Embassadours, who had formerly been held to be the chief
Protectors of the Rhetian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against the Spaniards, began to be much
suspected; and this suspition grew to be so great, as being turned into hatred,
and not being any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be concealed, Monsieur <hi>Gueffier,</hi> then
Resident Embassadour for <hi>France,</hi> was publickly dismiss'd; who fearing
the open hatred and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of that Nation, and shunning the popular Tumults and
Insurrections which he knew were incited against him (and chiefly by the
Preachers) he withdrew almost in a flying posture to amongst the Swissers:
Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Grisons having immediately sent away to acquaint the King of
<hi>France,</hi> and withal to complain of the reason which drove them
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the King being either displeased at it, or not making such account
of the Embassadours which were sent unto him as he had wont, they thought
themselves treated as Subjects; wherefore they inclined more then before to the
renewing of their League with the Venetians.</p>
            <p>The Grisons therefore chas'd away the Bishop of <hi>Coira</hi>
(who being a Prince of the sacred Empire, holds the first place in the Dyets)
and began to persecute the chief Fautors of both the Crowns with
Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonments, Confiscations, Banishment, and with corporal punishments, as
Enemies to the publick Liberty; nor therewithal content, differing in their
opinions, they lean'd almost altogether in the Government of their affairs to
their Preachers; who being Hereticks preached nothing but the necessity for
preservation of their State and Liberties, of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the people in one
Religion; and that therefore they must extirpate the Catholicks, and drive them
totally out of their Houses and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: Many there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ore being forced by this persecution
fled, some of them went to the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> some to the Swissers,
endeavouring to recover their Countrey by force of Arms, out of which they were
driven by rigour, by the injustice of the Judges, and by violent facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
Those that fled to the Swissers made the Embassadour <hi>Gueffier</hi> their
Head-Commander, and the others the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> with whom
<hi>Gueffier</hi> held secret Intelligence, that he might interest himself in
their Cause, and help them with men and moneys (which were 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:53250:118"/> things they wanted) to return into their Countries.
<hi>Feria</hi> furnish'd them with moneys, where with they raised a body of
men, and entring into <hi>Coira</hi> they made themselves Masters of it; but
their Adversaries being stronger then they, they were soon driven out, and
together with them the French Embassadour: Yet they nor the Duke of
<hi>Feria</hi> not being any whit dismayed, they tryed their Fortunes once more
with greater resolution and Forces; for <hi>Feria</hi> afforded them commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
of taking 500 Foot out of <hi>Tyrvolo,</hi> and moreover he assisted them by
diversion, causing an Insurrection in the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> which being set
on Foot between <hi>Radolfo Pianta,</hi> Head of the Grisons that were of the
French Faction, and Cavalier <hi>Robustelli</hi> the chief of the Valtoline
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, was much fomented by <hi>Feria,</hi> but with so much secresie, as it
was not known to any of the Princes Agents that were in <hi>Millain.</hi> This
Insurrection of the Valtolinians began the year 1620. The pretence was, that
they being anciently Confederates with the Grisons, the Grisons being the
stronger had turn'd their Confederacy into Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and exercised too great
Tyranny over them, not only over their persons and fortunes, but over their
Consciences; and would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore introduce the poyson of Calvinism, and
withdraw the people from their Fore-fathers Religion, which they had suck'd in
with their milk: For after they had driven out those that sided with the
French, the Grisons (as hath been said) made their Preachers Arbitrators of
their affairs; who began to prohibite Indulgences in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi>
and to preach Calvinism, to possess themselves of Churches and Monaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
and to make Colledges thereof, for the breeding up of youth in their Sect, to
the end that they might totally root out the Catholick Religion: And that this
might the more easily be effected, they put some of the chiefest and most
religious of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Valley to death.
Having therefore by <hi>Feria</hi>'s assistance shaken off the servitude
suffer'd by the Grisons, they put all the Heretical Officers and Preachers to
death that they could lay hands on: Afterwards, the better to maintain the
begun Insurrection, they possess'd themselves of the Passes whereby the
Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons might fall down upon them and vanquish them, and fell to munite them
with men and Fortifications; wherein they were the more fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

environing the upper part of the Lake, they woond about into the
<hi>Valtoline;</hi> where having taken and fortified some convenient places to

and recovered the bridge <hi>Ganda,</hi> with the death of the Garrison who

<hi>Chiavenna:</hi> But to the end that they might not enter another time by
that way into the <hi>Valtoline, Feria</hi> ordered Don <hi>Ieronimo
Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montello</hi> General of the Light-Horse of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
(who by his directions was drawn neer the Confines of the <hi>Valtoline</hi>
with some Companies of Horse and Foot) to possess himself of the Shore of
<hi>Chiavenna,</hi> which being scituated upon the Head of the Lake, lies in
the mid-way by which people pass conveniently from <hi>Chiavenna</hi> into the
<hi>Valtoline:</hi> This Shore or Bank was well fortified by some of the
Grisons, who resenting the Spaniards attempts in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> were
fallen down into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and had given upon some of the
neerest Towns thereof, and carried away some Pillage. <hi>Pimontello</hi> sent
about 500 Souldiers in Barques to assault that Garrison, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of
300 Foot; who landing not far from the Garrison went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the bank,
intending to assault it: But the Garrison being affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their coming,
abandoned that Station, and not staying to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted, fled into
<hi>Chiavenna;</hi> so as the bank fell without any disputing into
<hi>Pimontello</hi>'s hands, which he forth with fortified.</p>
            <p>By such like demonstrations as these the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi>
had plainly declared, that he had sufficiently ingaged not only the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> Forces, but his name in this Enterprise, being moved chiefly
thereunto out of two reasons; The one, because he saw the Heretick Swissers and
the Venetians had openly ingaged themselves in the Grisons cause, and in
recovery of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> that Senate having sent money into those
parts to raise two Brigadoes, the one Swissers, the other Grisons, wherewith to
go to the recovery of the <hi>Valtoline:</hi> The other, because the King of
<hi>France</hi> his Agents, by order from their King, who was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with
the Grisons, did not only consent unto, but had a hand in the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> insurrection, and desired <hi>Feria</hi> to protect them:
All this was endeavoured from <hi>France,</hi> to the end that the Grisons
being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested on that part might have the more reason to have recourse to
their King, and their King by that means might govern them as he list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and
causing them to abandon the Venetian Confederacy, might recover his ancient
Authority with that Nation; wherefore <hi>Feria</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king courage from the
consent and intercession of the French, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from the Venetians
intermission to meddle in that Affair, thought it might be likely to succeed
well, whereby such conveniencies and safety would redound to his Kings Affairs:
He notwithstanding cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his
designs with the mantle of Religion, as if he would have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that it
was rather his zeal to the Catholick Faith, and to Gods service, than the
conveniencies and interest of State, and of his King, which had made him
embrace a business of that importance; professing himself there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ure to be a better Catholick than
Polititian, he sent Priests of holy and devout life into those parts, to preach
the Word of God, and to convert souls to the Catholick Religion: He aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the wicked and detestable actions of the Calvinists, committed against those of
the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> to force them to receive <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Doctrine; and the danger of that disease being diffused abroad 
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:53250:119"/> in the neighbouring parts of <hi>Italy</hi> and State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> might infect all <hi>Italy</hi> with the contagion thereof:
Nor herewithal content, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Pope with the whole business,
intreating him, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting him by particular Letters, not only to approve
of, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in his actions, in so pious and Catholick a business: The
pretence was very just, and the colours very lively and apparent to justifie so
great an action; nor could there be a fitter occasion to effect it: but the
sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Italy,</hi> which lay hidden under these religious pretences,
spoil'd all the glory and good which adorned this action; and it being not
probable that so many Princes, whose liberty was concern'd in this business,
would ever suffer that the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> should insnare their States
and Liberties with such conceits as these, it might upon better grounds be
supposed he would meet with very many difficulties in bringing them to
perfection: so as peradventure it might have been a more opportune advice for
the affairs of his King, and for the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the present times, not to
have provoked the Italians with such and so great a novelty, who were already
very much incens'd with the Spanish command, who being become more jolly by
reason of the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses in the late wars, were ready to hold up their heads,
and to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard the wholly laying aside all respect to the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and forgoing all fear of his Arms to turn the world
upside down for the preservation of themselves and liberties, rather then to
suffer themselves to be inslaved as they were likely to be by the novelties
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, and so strongly indeavoured by <hi>Feria.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither was it likely that the French who did now incourage
<hi>Feria</hi> to this enterprise, would ever be content that he should reap
full satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therein; for they having no other end, then by vexing the
Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons to force them to have recourse unto their King for help, it was more
certain, that they would indeavour by all means, that that Valley might not
remain possess'd by the Spaniards, lest the Spanish Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezza might be the
more increased, and the liberty of the Italian Princes might be by them
oppress'd, and lest that passage might be block'd up from those of their Nation
by the Spaniards; and besides that the precise Orders and Instructions of the
Court of <hi>Spain</hi> did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne such novelties, the example of the
Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, might
keep the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> from such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts: which Princes though they
knew how fitting a thing it would be to be masters of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi>
and would galdly have been so; yet thinking it to be a business which would be
hard to compass, they were far from thinking of it; and the example of the
commotions which hapned in Count <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>entes</hi> time was more fresh, and of greater force, when by
building only that Fort within the Confines of the State of <hi>Millain</hi> he
was likely to have caused such wars in <hi>Italy;</hi> the French, and
Venetians having ingaged themselves meerly for the preservation of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> when the Spanish Forces were at the height of their
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; what could he then pretend, or hope for, upon this present
occasion, when the intire usurping of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> was in question,
by the preservation whereof the liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> and by the loss
whereof her slavery, did evidently result? and yet <hi>Feria</hi> preferring
the great good which would be gotten by joyning <hi>Italy</hi> to
<hi>Germany,</hi> before so <pb n="223" facs="tcp:53250:119"/> many other respects, entred
couragiously upon the enterprise, and plunged himself daily more thereinto:
thinking that the glory of this acquisition would be greater, by how much the
respects were the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which had kept the Emperour, and <hi>Philip</hi> the
Second, from endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring it: he did not apprehend that any one could disturb

would prove a tedious business, and not to be effected: so as holding it for
undoubted that neither the French, nor (without them) the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, nor other
Italian Princes would stir, he thought they would be content with it, as they
had been with the building of Fort <hi>Fuentes;</hi> and that therefore he was
not to abandon an occasion whereby he might signalize his Government beyond
that of any of his Predecessours: who though they had always had their eye upon
it, yet they never knew how to effect it. But the Grisons, who were not this
mean while idle, having by the Venetians moneys assembled about 6000 Foot,
tried once more to enter into the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> by the way of
<hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna;</hi> and finding <hi>la Riva</hi> well fortified, they took a
great compass along the Mountains, and fell down into the Country of
<hi>Bormio,</hi> which lies in the utmost part of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> where
it joyns to <hi>Tirvolo: Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van di Medici,</hi> Marquess of St.
<hi>Angelo,</hi> was entred into this Town with 600 of those Italian Foot who
came in Threves from the State of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> and had already begun a
great Trench, by which he thought to have shut up the mouth of a Valley whereby
they come from the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permost part of the Grisons: but the Work not being yet
finished, and consequently remaining subject to be offended by the Enemy, when
coming upon their backs they should assault the defendants, being therefore set
upon on that side which lay yet open, he forsook the T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

into <hi>Tirano,</hi> a Town, which lies more inward, and almost in the midst
of the Valley; and the Grisons entring <hi>Bormio</hi> without any resistance,
sack'd it, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily profaning the Churches, and converting sacred things,
and what was consecrated to divine worship, not only to prophane, but to
sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious, and scandalous uses: being incouraged by this good success they
fell down upon <hi>Tyrano</hi> assuredly hoping to take it with as much ease,
but they fared here otherwise; for the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> hearing what had

indeavours favoured the oppression of the Valtolini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to drive the Spaniards
from amongst the Grisons to the recovery of the Valley which they had lost:
they were thereunto also incited by their Preachers, who detesting the

so as there proceeded great altercations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those who were against it;
and the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> having taken five Companies of Swissers into

adhering much to their former opinion, the Swissers were forc'd to retreat: so
as this party having gotten the upperhand, they began to implead the chief
Authors of the <hi>Millain</hi> Capitulation, as having betrayed the publick
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, by agreeing thereunto without the publick consent of all. But new
Orders being sent at this time from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> reduces the
trouble to a more quiet Negotiation. The Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were much
moved at these proceedings of <hi>Feria,</hi> and resented them; and the
Venetians, who (as hath been said) covered both their own, and the common

<hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the 15th, who succeeded <hi>Paul</hi> the 5th, who died in
the beginning of the year 1621: this was Cardinal <hi>Lodovisio,</hi>
Archbishop of <hi>Bullognia:</hi> he was commonly held to be not well affected
to the Spaniard, by reason of the distastes between him and Don <hi>Piedro di
Tolledo,</hi> when being the Apostolick Nuntio in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and
<hi>Piedmont</hi> he negotiated the composition of those wars; and therefore as
one that detested the Spaniards, and loved not to see them increase in
greatness and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it was thought he would not omit suppressing those
ends upon this occasion, which did so much vex him, so to make himself famous
by restoring <hi>Italy</hi> to her former security, and thereby make the
beginning of his Popedom more acceptable. <hi>He wrot a Letter with his own
hand to the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>complaining of, and much resenting the
Governours actions, as prejudicial to the common quiet, and satisfaction; and
desiring him that he would not deny him this favour which he very earnestly
desired of him, in this the beginning of his Popedom: he did also seriously
admonish him, that for the good of the common peace, and for the safety of</hi>
Italy, <hi>and of those States which

the interest of Favorites, for the space of 22 years, wherein he reigned, and

in publick affairs then his Father had done, yet his young years, and the
pastimes of youth not permitting him to partake of the troubles of publick

condition, which the Spaniard call <hi>di Privanza:</hi> or, of affairs being

            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Valtoline</hi> was that which the new King took first into
his consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration; wherein the Pope, the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the
King of <pb n="227" facs="tcp:53250:121"/> 
               <hi>France,</hi> had used their indeavours: The
new King would satisfie the joint desires of so many Princes, and give a taste,
in this the beginning of his Reign, of his being content with what was his own,
not desiring to usurp upon other mens states, or upon the Liberty of the
Italian Princes: But because the interest of Religion was concern'd in this
bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; that he might shew himself to be a no less pious and religious, then
wise and moderate King, he agreed upon certain Articles with the French
Embassadour; the substance whereof was, <hi>That the same Religion should be
established in the</hi> Valtoline <hi>which was there used in the year 1617;
And that the State should be restored to the same condition that it was in
before the Rebellion: That the Forts should be demollished, and all Garisons
removed from thence: That all the</hi> Valtolinians <hi>should be pardoned for
their Rebellion: That the King of</hi> France, Switzers, <hi>and</hi>
Vallesani, <hi>should become sureties to the</hi> Grisons <hi>for the
observance of what was agreed upon:</hi> These Articles came from
<hi>Madrid</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> soon after the Capitulation of
<hi>Millain;</hi> and as they came unexpected by any, (for even those who did
most desire it, could not expect nor hope for such facile proceedings from that
Court, in so weighty a business, and of such importance to that Court) so the
Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> and all those who out of a desire to advance the
Spanish Grandezza had co-oppe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in this business, seeing their plots and
designs wholly overthrown wherein they had taken so much pains, were totally
astonished, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the prejudice which they thought would thereby
redound to the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and to the other affairs of the Crown
of <hi>Spain;</hi> but for the loss of that ostentation, glory and merit, which
<hi>Feria</hi> and the rest hoped to have reaped thereby: Yet not being able to
withstand the Kings so precise Orders and Commands, they were forc'd to be
content; and not knowing from whence this resolution should proceed, some laid
the fault upon the new Kings weakness; others upon the Orders and Commands of
the late King; who, upon receiving the Popes Letters a little before he died,
charged his Son to desist from the enterprise of the <hi>Valtoline:</hi> Others
argued, that the new King being too indulgently affectionate to his Wife, who
was sollicited by the French Embassadour, was desirous to please her at her
earnest desire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in not coming to a breach with her Brother, the King of
<hi>France,</hi> upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Valtoline:</hi> There were not some
wanting who affirmed that Don <hi>Piedro di Tolledo,</hi> out of private
emulation that his successor should so happily effect this business, which nor
he nor so many others of his Predecessors could ever do, did oppose in the
Supream Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of State, to the end that <hi>Feria</hi>'s actions might not
be approved but rejected, as the original and undoubted cause of great scandal
and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: Howsoever it was, by the effects men may easily comprehend
either a Repentance in theie Court of the thing capitulated for; or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to others (for there never wants sinister Interpreters) an End rather to quiet

exclaiming sufficiently in the Court, that by this <pb n="228" facs="tcp:53250:122"/>
resolution the King had lost so opportune and so important a purchase, the
execution of the Articles was defer'd; but the Valtolinians ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed more
then <hi>Feria,</hi> as men who were sent thither on purpose by <hi>Feria:</hi>
They mingled tears with their perswasions, and did infinitely desire the King,
<hi>That he would not abandon them, nor force them to return under the antient
yoke of Tyrants; of Heretick Tyrants, who would rise up not only against their
lives and fortunes, but even against their souls, crying down the Catholick
Religion in the</hi> Valtoline: They desired him <hi>That he would inform
himself fully what the condition of the</hi> Valtoline <hi>was formerly, and
what it was now; as well in respect of their natural liberty as Religion; for
by the perfect knowledge of these two Points the cheat would be discern'd, by
which his Majesty was perswaded to condescend to those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles: And as for
the first Point, they shewed that the Valtolinians were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally a free
people, not Subjects nor Vassals to the Grisons, as his Majesty had been
informed, but their Companions and Confederates, to whom nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor
their fore-Fathers had never sworn fealty, nor done homage, or shewed any signe
of subjection; though by reason of the diversity of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, their liberty,
after having for many years governed the common Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick jointly, had been
oppress'd and suffocated by their more powerful Confederate: And the Tyranny
was the more cruelly exercised against them, for that the Catholick Religion
was constantly profest by the Valtolinians, and</hi> Calvins <hi>abhorred:
Wherefore,</hi> said they, <hi>the Commotions of the</hi> Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline <hi>were
not, nor could not, be esteemed Rebellion, but the defence and maintaining of
the Catholick Religion, and the recovery of their natural Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which was
not only allowed of, but favoured and assiste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> by all Laws both humane and divine: That this was the reason why
no Prince, how great or powerful soever, having neither jurisdiction nor
command over them, could, without using violence, bring them under the command
of others, and much less under the unjust Tyranny of the usurpers of their
Liberty; from which by singular divine goodness, and by the so great hazard of
their lives and fortunes, they had once withdrawn themselves: Nay, that all
lawful and just Princes, the more great and powerful they were, were the more
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged by the Laws of Nations, and by Gods Laws, to favour and take into
their protection, the Liberties of opprest people, and to turn all the forces
of their Kingdoms to the destruction and beating down of Tyrants, who were

                  </gap>hor'd and persecuted by all Laws
both divine and humane: And if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Valtolinians liberty was to
be expected from any of the Princes of the present Age, it did undoubtedly
belong more to his Majesty then to any other; who having taken the Valtolinians
Religion and liberty into his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection before the Capitulation stipulated
with the King of</hi> France, <hi>he could not without breach of his Royal
Word, abandon them, nor make them to do an action so contrary to the protection
his Majesty had taken of them, by forcing them to return to their former
slavish condition; But that this did b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lone,
much more by reason of the hereditary profession of the House of</hi> Austria,
<hi>of always being the safe shield and constant defence of the Catholick
Religion, which was so annexed to the liberty of the</hi> Valtoline, <hi>as the
ruine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

draw after it the ruine of the other; for who would doubt but if the</hi>
Val<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>oline <hi>should return again
to underneath the slavery of the</hi> Grisons, <hi>the Catholick Religion would
be there trodden under foot: Nor did that Article of the Convention, whereby it
was agreed that <pb n="229" facs="tcp:53250:122"/> Religion should be returned to the same
condition as it was in the year 1617. make any thing for the preservation
thereof; for his Majesty was abused in that Point as well as in the other of
Religion, being falsly given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that the Roman Religion was that
year unblemished and undefaced there; and that this cousenage was so much the
greater, as the inconveniences and exorbitances which did thereby result were
the greater, and that therefore the better provision was to be had for it:
Saying that the demolitions and profanations of Churches; the usurpation of
Church goods; the Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and banishment of religious people; the Schools
and Seminaries for the breeding up of youth in Calvinisme; the abolition of
Images, prohibition of Indulgences, and many other impious and enormious
abominations, were introduced in the</hi> Valtolme <hi>long before the year
1617. And on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that obedience to the Pope; the Introduction of the
holy Office; the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting of Bishops and Prelates of the holy Church; the
accepting of the Councel of</hi> Trent, <hi>and of the Gregorian Kalander; the
publication of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies; the abolishing of Heretical Schools and
Seminaries; the Resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of demolished Churches; of the goods and persons
of Church men; and finally the extirpation of Hereticks and Her sies, were the
fruits and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of Liberty, recovered the year 1620. Who sees not
then</hi> (said they) <hi>that if that Article being to be put in execution,
and that Religion be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the state it was in the year 1617. That your
Majesty being highly abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, doth command that all those abominations which
were abolished in the year 1620. shall return in the</hi> Valtoline; <hi>and
that, on the contrary, that all of Holy and Catholical, which was blessedly
introduced there, together with liberty, be abolished. We cannot (said they)
without blushing and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion represent unto your Majesty that which your
most Catholick mind can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not without horror hear, and know to be true: not only
all sacred Canons and most holy Councils of the Catholick Church, do not only
reprove such Conventions, but do punish the Authors, Fantors, and Introducers
of all these abominable impieties, with severest excommunication: the Solemn
Oath your Majesty took a little before your Coronation, to the high Almighty
God, to the Princes and People of this so Catholick Crown, doth not admit of
such Conventions. The Catholick Kings, your Predecessours, who have spent so
much Gold, and blood of their best Vassels, for the maintenance of Divine
Worship, and for the beating down of Heresie, who have not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued the loss of
whole Provinces, for not admitting of any other then the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion,
do conjure your Majesty, the Inheritor not only of so many Kingdoms, but of so
great Catholick zeal, not to allow of that Covention, to which, the world
knows, had you not been abused, you would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented for all your
Kingdoms. They finally concluded with exaggerating the iniquity, and inhumane
cruelties of the Grisons, which they were sure would increase, together with
their fierce hatred against the miserable inhabitants of the</hi> Valto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

Arms, in defence of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liberty, and of the Holy Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King was doubtlesly moved with these Reasons, which being
afterwards divulged in the Court, the chief Lords and Officers thereof, and the
people in general, finding the resulting inconveniences by this cous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nage put upon the King, were much
moved thereat, and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess that nothing more contrary to the Faith, nor
more prejudicial to Catholicks, could be contracted amongst Heretick Princes;
and storm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="230" facs="tcp:53250:123"/> thereat, knew not what to do, whereby with
safety to the Kings royal word and agreement, the Convention might be kept from
being put in execution; and whilst they were busied thereabout, a new acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
fell out which furnish'd them with a means: A Diet was resolved upon for the
execution of this agreement amongst the Swissers, to be celebrated in
<hi>Lucerna,</hi> one of the chief Catholick Cantons of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: wherein
(to boot with the Deputies of all the Cantons) Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Scappi,</hi>
Apostolick Nuntio with the Swissers, was to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent for the Pope, Monsieur
<hi>Myron,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>Monholon,</hi> Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours, in ordinary and
extraordinary, for the King of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Gueffiere</hi> Resident
in <hi>Rhetia,</hi> and <hi>Andriano Tomasini,</hi> President of the Parliament
of <hi>Burgony,</hi> for the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> was commanded to observe <hi>Tomasini</hi>'s Orders, for what
should be resolved upon in that Diet touching the affairs of the
<hi>Valtoline:</hi> the Deputies also of the Grisons appeared at this Diet, who
presenting the Decree of general pardon granted to those of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the demollishing of the Forts lately erected in
the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> guarded at the present by Spanish Garrisons, and to be
repossest of that Valley, according to the agreement made at <hi>Madrid;</hi>
offering themselves ready to observe whatsoever they were obliged unto by the
said Capitulation: The President of <hi>Burgony</hi> perused, and attentively
considered the Decree; and finding it to be too full of cavils and snares for
those of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> exclaimed much against it, first in words, and
then in writing; and as if a large Gate were thereby left open for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he
began to accuse it of fraud: the words and actions of the Grisons gave more
credit to the Presidents Reasons, and Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who seemed so incens'd
against those of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> as not being able to contain
themselves, they stuck not to say, they hoped one day to wash their hands in
their blood: the President was followed by all the Catholick Cantons, which
were Confederate with the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> and by him of
<hi>Appenzel,</hi> which stands in the midst between the Catholick, and
Heretick Cantons; and therefore expresly refusing to stand bound for the
Grisons, as they were required to do by the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation of <hi>Madrid,</hi>
they made a Decree thereupon, which they cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led irrevocable: the other
Cantons, either not being willing to appear of another opinion, or seeing that
their obligation would not be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory without the like of their
companions, thought it not fit to be bound. Thus was the Convention of
<hi>Madrid</hi> excluded, or as the Fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nch and Venetians complain'd, deluded by the cunning and secret
carriage of the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> who, as they said, had wrought upon the
Swissers by moneys: neither did the heat of opposition made by the President of
<hi>Burgony</hi> pass without suspect of some secret Commission from the Court
of <hi>Spain,</hi> which might have altered her opinion touching the affairs of
the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and this suspition increased the more, for that the
Spanish Agents, after the Swissers refusal, began to pretend that the
Convention of <hi>Madrid</hi> was no longer valid, but was to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Convention was void also: the business of Composition being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
desperate, the Grisons being assisted by the French and Venetians, 
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:53250:123"/> resolved to go once more armed to the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> and to indeavour the recovery thereof with greater Forces:
which being presently done, they fared not better then they had done before:
though many men were ready to assist them in the parts about <hi>Bressia,</hi>
and <hi>Bergamo:</hi> they fell down with 13000 Foot into the Country of
<hi>Bormio,</hi> with intention to assault the new Fort, wherein were 600 Foot
under <hi>Ottavio Sforza,</hi> who being very well prepared for defence, the
Grisons thought not good to assault them; but sent some Squadrons to the taking
in of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fort not far off, wherein were about forty foot, who defended
themselves egregiously, and slew and repuls'd many of the assailants: hearing

went to meet him; and drawing out their Forces between <hi>Bormio</hi> and the

when they heard the Drums which were nigh at hand, they retreated into

they were rugged and almost unaccessable, yet by the long practice and
experience which they had therein, they overcame them; and being scattered they

Articles of <hi>Millain,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> waged open war against
them; and agreeing with Archduke <hi>Leopold,</hi> whom <hi>Tirvolo</hi> and

Mountains, he entred himself in person into the <hi>Valtoline</hi> with 6000
Foot, and 500 Horse, thinking to oppose the Grisons new Forces: but when he was
not well got to <hi>Morbegno,</hi> a Town which stands in the mouth of the

turn'd upon <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> a Town of the Grisons, which is the head of
another Valley, which runs along <hi>la Mera,</hi> a River which falling from
the Alps runs into the Lake: there was therein a Garrison of about 500 Grisons,
who trusting more to the open Fields then to their Walls, drew a long Trench on

the whole Plain above which lies on the left side of the River, they minded not
much the lower side, it being narrow and moorish: thinking to make head there,
they put themselves almost all in Garrison, and sent for a good strength of men
to defend a certain place beyond the Trench: which being seated upon the skirts
of the Mountain, <hi>Pitz</hi> commanded the way, and the Plain, The Governour
sent a good Band of Carabines against those that defended this station, who
forcing the defendants to abandon it, the defendants retreated to the Trench,

desiring to be restored to the antient condition of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi>
they were plainly told that this their demand was contrary both to Humane and
Divine Laws; the latter not suffering Catholicks to be under the Dominion of

wherefore being forced to submit unto the will of the more powerful, they came
to new Conventions; <hi>Whereby liberty of Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was allowed through
their whole Country; a perpetual confederacy was agreed upon between those two
Leagues and Crown of</hi> Spain, <hi>with due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect had to their ancient
Confederacy with the Crown of</hi> France: <hi>perpetual passage for the King

obligation notwithstanding that they should pay yearly to the Grisons</hi>
25000 <hi>Duckets by way of Tribute; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Bishop of</hi> Coira,

            <p>The business between the Grisons and those of the

alterations hapned, which were soon appeased; for those of the third League
could not suffer subjection; they therefore plotted Insurrections against
Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duke <hi>Leopold,</hi> by means whereof they endeavoured to re-gain their
Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The Commotion began amongst those of the Valley of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentz,</hi>
the boldest and fiercest people of that Nation; who being sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited by some
of the Griggian League, who were ill satisfied with the last Capitulation at
<hi>Millain,</hi> entred one Holy-day into the <hi>Corps de Guarde,</hi> and
finding Arms there, but no Souldiers, they being gone to Mass, they seized on
them, and killing the Garrison, they armed their Compagnions with long staves
(for their Arms had been taken from them before by the Archdukes Officers) and
increasing in numbers they went to <hi>Coira</hi> and to <hi>Maiafeldt,</hi>
where fighting the Archdukes men twice in open fields, both which times they
were victorious, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the others to surrender up those two places to
them; which being taken, all the Garrisons of all the rest of the Country
flying away, they might easily have re-gained their former Liberty, had not new
men been speedily sent them from the Archduke to quell them; who being led on
by Count <hi>Sultz,</hi> and by the same <hi>Baldrone,</hi> beat those of the
League twice, and did not only recover all those places, but forced those of
the <hi>Diritture</hi> once more to submit to the Archdukes yoke: And a Dyet
being held not long after in <hi>Lindao,</hi> an Imperial Town in
<hi>Suevia,</hi> wherein the Archdukes Deputies, and those of the thirteen
Cantons met, it was declared, <hi>That the</hi> Diritture <hi>did of right
belong to the House of</hi> Austria, <hi>and that therefore they should render
obedience thereunto; and as being subject to the Austrian Empire they should
obey the Archaukes Commands; and that they could not pretend to any Liberty,
but should be wholly distinguished, and be altogether, and for ever be
under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to be, separated from the body of the Grisons Commonwealth;
annull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all actions of Confederacy which they had made, as the third League,
with other Princes, and particularly with the King of</hi> France. Which
Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was afterwards approved of, and accepted by the Deputies of the
said League, who swore Fealty, and did homage to the Archduke. Thus part of
<hi>Rhetia</hi> beyond the <hi>Alpes</hi> resting in the Archdukes power, and
the rest on this side the <hi>Alpes,</hi> either depending upon, or being
sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugated by the Spaniard, the affairs of the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and those of the House of <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>
were much better'd, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the great happiness which was gotten by the
Conquest of <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia,</hi> and the Union of the States of <hi>Italy</hi> to
those of <hi>Germany;</hi> by which Union the one might commodiously succour
the other; insomuch as the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and the League with the Grisons,
procured by so much indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry by Count <hi>Fuentes</hi> and the other
Governours, were of very little consideration, in comparison of this new
purchase: For whereas the <pb n="234" facs="tcp:53250:125"/> League, when it should be
concluded, would have been uncertain and very expensive to the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> the Dominion over the <hi>Dirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the necessary
dependency of the other two Leagues upon the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> did
more undoubtedly secure the same ends without any expence: And whereas he who
will enter into <hi>Tyrvolo</hi> by the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline</hi> must necessarily
pass over craggy mountains unfrequented, and in the Winter season hardly
passable, entrance is much more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously had into the Rhetian Countrey by
the Valley of <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> then by that of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and
from hence a better, shorter, and safer way is had for <hi>Germany</hi> then by
<hi>Tyrvolo,</hi> by which entrance is only
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ad into the <hi>Valtoline:</hi>
So as the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> without demanding passage from the Swissers,
had the conveniency of receiving as many men as he would at any time from
<hi>Germany</hi> into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who might deny the reserved passage of <hi>Bressa,</hi>
or, without being beholden to the French, who may hinder him, he might
commodiously, and without any opposition, pass men from <hi>Rhetia</hi> into
<hi>Alsatia,</hi> and from thence into the <hi>Palatinate</hi> upon the
<hi>Rhesne,</hi> which was won but a little before to the House of
<hi>Austria;</hi> and from the <hi>Palatinate</hi> into <hi>Flanders</hi> and
the Low-Countreys. So the Spanish and Austrian Empire so much distracted being
become united, and communicable within it self, became more firm, and less
exposed to be injured by others; and the French and other Transalpiners, who
envied such Grandezza, being by such a sound obstacle disjoyn'd and segregated
from <hi>Italy,</hi> could less easily hold intelligence with the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Princes, or administer hopes of
assistance to them. Wherefore <hi>Feria</hi> seeing how much by the success of
that Enterprize happily begun under his auspicious Government, and more happily
ended, he had exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ded the hopes
of his Predecessors, returned full of joy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to <hi>Millain,</hi>
triumphing over the Grisons, with the Artillery recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after a hundred
years, which being adorned with Lawrel were in manner of Triumph drawn before
him. But look how much the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> was better
and more advantaged by so many good successes, so much the more did Jealousie
increase amongst the Italian Princes, and the apprehension of their own Liberty
and Command; and together with this jealousie, envy, and endeavours of
opposition increased in those that envyed the Spanish greatness; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
not being able to see so great an advancement in authority, nor the others to
see that little loop-hole (much to their grief) shut up, by which their liberty
in the greatest and most urgent streights might breathe. And as some stood
lookers on, and quiet observers of these events, the lesser expecting when the
greater should move; so the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> though the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>udice did not chiefly belong unto him,
unless it were that the Spaniards needing now no longer any passage through
<hi>Savoy</hi> should have less occasion to put an esteem upon him, yet, were
it either that as an Italian Prince he was touched with the danger of others,
or that he thought the too much Grandezza of the Spaniard might prove
dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to his own affairs, or that he did desire by all means to cross the
ends and designs of that Crown, he thought it no little diminution to his own
Interests, that the Spaniards should not any more stand in much need of his
Friendship: But the Venetians were chiefly mad hereat, <pb n="235" facs="tcp:53250:125"/>
whom the danger did more nearly concern, as those that saw that the Spaniards
and Archduke by getting firm footing in the Grisons Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and by the Forts
erected in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> had not only disturb'd their ends, and
bereaved them of the good they hoped for by League with that Nation, but as it
were imprisoned their liberty, and laid it at their feet: wherefore as if the
total of their affairs, and their utmost ruine were in question, they resolved
to remove every stone, to omit for no expence nor labour, and to refuse no
danger, so they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide against the prejudice and mischief of so great
an alteration of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and finding that the moneys they had disburst
amongst the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and Swissers, the raising of men intended in those parts,
their as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of those people, that they might subsist, and not be oppressed
by the Spaniard, had proved altogether vain, and that they of themselves were
not able to undertake such a business; <hi>They resolved to move those Princes
whose interests might be concern'd in the ends and actions of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rouze themselves up upon so
great an occasion: they forbore not to exclaim against those actions, and to
make it known in the Courts of all Princes, as well Italians as Forreigners,
what the Spaniards ends were in entring upon this enterprise; and how under the
vail of Religion they did undermine the Common Liberty, incited people to
rebel, ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e themselves masters of
other mens States, aimed at the reducing of</hi> Italy <hi>into slavery, to
suffocate the Apostolick See, to give the Law to all Italian Princes, and
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having put the yoke about their neck, make them dependent upon the
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Empire, and be at their beck: that this was a great step whereby to
ascend and arrive at the absolute Monarchy of</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aly, <hi>and of all Christendom, which they so
earnestly thirsted after: that the interest of all men, the safety of the
Empire, and the Common Liberty were herein treated of: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with an
unanimous consent they ought to withstand these beginnings, oppose the progress
of these unions and concatenations of States, so prejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to all men; to
the end that when all remedies should be too late, they might not in vain
bewail those losses which would be the infallible result of their not having
moved upon this occasion, that doubtlesly, if they would all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
themselves, and behave themselves generously in this affair, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
would be forced to yield to their unanimous will and consent, and desist from
the enterprise which they had begun against the Common Safety and
Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These and the like Reasons alledged by the Venetians at the
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of these Commotions in <hi>France, Rome, Italy,</hi> amongst the
Swissers and Grisons, wrought not much effect, nor were of such moment as such
an accident required: The Court of <hi>France</hi> not being well pleased with
the Veneti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n League, desired that
the Grisons affairs might be perturbed, and that the Venetians might reap but
bitter fruit of their Negotiations: the Pope who was full of years, and of
indispositions, shew'd not such resentment as would have been necessary: the
Swissers disagreed within themselves, and as the event shewed afterwards,
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined more to favour the Spaniards Designs, then the Interest of the Common
Cause; so as the Grisons being left alone in the Field, though set on, and
fomented by the Venetians, were forced to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumb to the stronger. But
<hi>Gregory</hi> having succeeded <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom (as hath been
said) who seemed to resent the business more then <pb n="236" facs="tcp:53250:126"/> his
Predecessour had done, and the French finding what advantage had redounded to
the Spaniards by the revolt of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and how much they had
suffer'd thereby in their own authority, they began to be no less troubled
thereat then the Venetians; and by title of Protection over the Grisons, the
ancient Confederates of that Crown, to pretend that they might be restored to
the entire possession of their liberty, and of the <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But many things opposed their desires: the League between the
Venetians and that Nation confirm'd contrary to the Authority of that Crown, by
which and from which so many inconveniences did arise: the war which the King
of <hi>France</hi> made against the Hereticks of his own Country, to reduce
them to his obedience, and to the obedience of the Catholick Church; and
therefore taking from them those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which they had extorted in the
former wars, he was intent with all his Forces to heal that wound which
troubled his Kingdom; and besides that this war did keep him sufficiently
busie, and kept him from forreign imployment; the Title thereof also, like that
which the Spaniards did pretend against the Grisons, would not permit that he,
without manifest repugnancy, should favour those same Hereticks out of his
Kingdom, which he did with such fervency, and religious zeal, endeavour to
extirpate at home. The peace also, and good correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency between his Crown
and the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> did repugne it: which being very convenient for
the common interest, it did not suit well with the King of <hi>France</hi> to
discompose, especially his own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being in trouble; and by directly
entring into war with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to kindle new fires at home,
upon the interests of others: the fresh example of his Father King
<hi>Henry</hi> was also sufficient to keep him from such an enterprise, who
when he was in greatest authority, and his Kingdom in compleat peace, did not
break with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> for building Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> which
was so prejudicial to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of the same Grisons: nor would he meddle
in those affairs, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise then by intercession: how much, might it be said
then, did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the present King, in the beginning of his Reign, the
Forces of his Kingdom being divided, amidst so many Domestick troubles, to
forgo his Fathers example, and to engage himself in Forreign affairs, against a
most powerful King; the event whereof being of such weight and importance might
certainly be supposed would prove, if not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether prejudicial, at least
long and dangerous: to do this it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to have a powerful Army, just
as if he went to get the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> back'd by the German
Forces: Besides, moneys, the sinews of war, were wanting; and many other things
necessary for such an expedition: on the other side, he was obliged by being
bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his Colleagues, and their States, which he could not with his
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour see abused: but his Kingdoms interest did urge him much more the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eunto, to the prejudice whereof so
great a union of the Austr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>an
Dominions did redound: nor had the example of his Father King <hi>Henry,</hi>
alledged to the contrary, any thing at all to do in this case; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being
then upon the stage but a Fort built by the Spaniards upon their own ground;
whereas now, the usurpation of States was in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, the oppression of a
Commonwealth, confederate with his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; <pb n="237" facs="tcp:53250:126"/> the
manifest danger of the Apostolick See, and of many other Italian Princes,
Friends to the Crown; which he could not with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom nor honour suffer to fall
under the Spaniards slavery: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, that of the same <hi>Henry</hi>
might serve; when not being able to suffer that the possession of
<hi>Cleves</hi> and <hi>Iuliers</hi> should be disputed with the German
Princes, nor that the Spaniards should increase their power and reputation by
the oppression of those Princes, and by usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping those States, he took up Arms
against the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and against the house of <hi>Austria;</hi>
and incited almost all Christendom against them; that these examples and
respects were to be prefer'd before anger conceived against the Grisons for
making League with the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; if, contrary to custom, we ought in
important resolutions to have any consideration at all upon private spleens,
which were never known to be prefer'd, in well regulated Counsels, before
wholsome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations. To these Reasons, which were of great force, were
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Venetians, and the Sovoiards instigations; who shewing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
ready to concur in the same war wish'd consideration might be had, that the
authority of the French was at an end in <hi>Italy,</hi> if the King should not
be permitted to enter by that way, or should suffer those parts to be
fortified, by which they might enter with a few men into that Province, in
defence of so many Friends and Clients of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, for the good of the
Apostolick See, and to curb the covetousness and ambition of the Spaniards, who
when they should once become masters of what they had usurped, and have thereby
joyn'd the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces with those of the Austrians in
<hi>Germany,</hi> would grow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supportable for their natural pride and
arrogancy; and invincible by reason of their Command, Authority, and Power;
insomuch as the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> being deprived of the French aid,
which was the only support of their liberty, would be forced wholly, and every
where, to yield to the King of <hi>Spains</hi> pleasure, and to reverence, and
adore the name of Spaniard, as an earthly Deity, from whence they were to
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and to acknowledge the life and safety of their affairs, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
their utter ruine: how great a glory, how great an honour would it be to the
now King, in the first beginning of his Reign, and (as it might be said) of his
life, to win so much authority in <hi>Italy,</hi> not only by sustaining the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> against the Forces of the Spaniards, but by becoming
Arbitrator of peace or war between that Duke and the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi>
wherefore then should he not only lose so great an acquisition, but by
abandoning the Grisons, the ancient Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates of his Kingdom, and by
permitting all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to fall under the slavery of the
Spaniard, make the world see, that the King of <hi>France</hi> had neither
courage, nor power to defend his Confederates, to strengthen so many Princes
who expect from him only cure for so mortal a wound: to provide against so
great prejudice which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to himself in his reputation: and to his
Friends and Clients in their Safety, States and Liberties. These and the like
Reasons very much press'd, and vehemently pursued in that Court, might
perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture work upon their wills, but could not remove the difficulties of
the enterprise; for how was it possible for that King, who then lay panting
before <hi>Montalban,</hi> a great Town in the midst of his Kingdom, 
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:53250:127"/> when <hi>France</hi> was divided into several Factions,
and the Kings Treasure exhausted; to think of Forreign enterprises against the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and house of <hi>Austria,</hi> who were already
possess'd of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and almost of the whole State of the
Grisons: who joyning in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cause, the State of <hi>Millain</hi> would
abound in Dutch, and by means of their Indian Gold they might turn his Kingdom
up-side down, now when it was full of ill humours, the King and his Council did
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what was most convenient for their present condition: which was, to
proceed friendly with the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to treat of composing
the present Occurrences in a civil way. To this purpose Monsieur
<hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sompier</hi> was sent extraordinary Embassadour to the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> and finding there more likelihood of good success then he could
have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, he thought the business happily ended: but the French finding
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards that the effects were not answerable, but that the Spaniards sought
by sophisticated interpretations to annihilate and overthrow all Conventions;
and that having proceeded further in <hi>Rhetia,</hi> they had in part
lacerated, in part subjugated the Liberty and Commonwealth of the Grisons,
putting new and bitter conditions upon them, wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what had been
by common consent agreed upon at <hi>Madrid;</hi> they thought themselves
doubly concerned in this business; for to the ancient Consederacy, and
Protection of the Grisons, was added the Capitulation at <hi>Madrid,</hi> which
the French could not, without a great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to their King, suffer to be so
trodden under foot: and by the easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of satisfying their desires which they
found in the Spanish Court, concerning this business, conceiving better of
themselves, and worse of the Spaniards, they thought that when the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> should see them in Arms ready to resent the injury, he would by
no means expect their moving; nor that the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> should be
more discomposed then formerly for any such respect; therefore, not admitting
that the Treaty at <hi>Madrid</hi> should be null and void, by reason of the
Swiffers, they pretended it was to be observed: offering new warranties, or
cautions, equal to the former, for the performing of what was agreed upon; and
if otherwise, they threatned making Leagues, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for
<hi>Italy;</hi> so as <hi>France</hi> was full of warlike preparations, giving
out that it was to take that satisfaction by Arms, which they would not do by
Negotiation; and to this purpose the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> (who spur'd on this
business) being gone to <hi>Avignon,</hi> whither the King of <hi>France</hi>
was come in person from the neighbouring Camp before <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alban,</hi> the
foundations of League were laid wherein the Venetian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours did
intervene; which certainly would have been perfected, had not the Popes Nuntio
hindred it, by affirming that, for an undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d Truth, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had refer'd the whole business
of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline</hi> to be decided by the Pope: but all that the Nuntio
had affirmed proving afterwards to be but words, the Treaty of the League was
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assumed with greater fervency; for the King of <hi>France</hi> began to
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern by the not observance of the Convention at <hi>Madrid,</hi> and by the
novelt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es committed against the
Grison, by the Archduke, and Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> that the Rebels of his
Kingdom were secretly fomented with moneys by the Spanish Agents, to the end
that being entertain'd with domestick wars, they should not be at leisure to
think upon Forreign <pb n="239" facs="tcp:53250:127"/> wars: which, were it true or false,
being believed by the King to be contrary to the good correspondency which was
then profest between the two Crowns, he was much incensed at it; wherefore
speaking not long after with the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> who was come to
<hi>Lyons,</hi> he sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulated the League with him, in the Duke his Fathers
name, which was a little before in Treaty, against the States of
<hi>Italy,</hi> appertaining to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> for restoring the
Grisons to the ancient posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of their State and Liberty, and to their
possession of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and it being, divulged that the King was
so servent in this business, as he would compose differences, yea even upon
disadvantagious terms with the Hereticks of his own Kingdom, rather then suffer
such an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to be done unto himself; and his Clients and Confederates to
be so much injured; <hi>Italy</hi> grew greatly apprehensive of new troubles,
which seemed also to be just then threatned, and foretold, by Celestial
Prodigies and Impressions.</p>
            <p>In the year 1618, and in the moneth of <hi>November,</hi> there
appeared a great Comet above <hi>Saturn,</hi> and according to the opinion of
the most famous Mathematicians, very neer the Stars of the eighth Sphear, whose
angry head was like to the Star called <hi>Mars;</hi> and tail thereof, which
was very long, and like a Squirrils tail, was extended or spread abroad 20
degrees, with two motions, the one retrograde, from the East to the West,
wherewith it ran from the ninth of <hi>Scorpio,</hi> to the eighth of
<hi>Virgo:</hi> the other from the South to the North, wherewith it
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>an 64 degrees, the head thereof
terminating in that same Star which stands in the middest of the tail of
<hi>Ursa</hi> Major, and the tail of it almost touching that mis-shapen Star
which is hard by the tail of the Serpent. It was seen in <hi>Persia,</hi> in
the Indies, and in <hi>Iapan,</hi> it ran through all the parts of the World,
and continued till the end of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember.</hi> A little before it appeared
another impression was seen, which was like a Log of fire, but lasted but a
very little while: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians Prognosticated several things hereby, and
those who think the success of humane affairs depend upon Celestial influences,
as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on second causes; for these apparitions preceding the Insurrection in the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> many attributed the wars which proceeded from thence, to
the maligne effects of those apparitions; and the present Occurrence, which
grew daily hotter and hotter, to be a well prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Materia, to receive the
malignity of these influences: but these Prodigies, which are most commonly
fallacious, caused not these new Ruptures to be so much apprehended, as did the
continual pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises which were had every where. <hi>Feria</hi> appeared very
constant and resolute in keeping what was gotten; and to this purpose had used
all his Reasons and Authority, with his friends in <hi>Spain,</hi> that the
glory of his actions might not be disturb'd by his rivals. On the contrary, the
Venetians who were very fervent in this business, were resolved by all means
possible to bring it to the end which they so much desired. The Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> desirous of new wars, thought every hour a year till he had
begun war with the Spaniard, The Pope, not able to tollerate that the
Capitulation at <hi>Madrid,</hi> wherein he had co-operated, should not take
effect, was very ill satisfied, and gave manifest signs of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment: the
King of <hi>France,</hi> egg'd on by so many Princes, who had 
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:53250:128"/> recourse to him, as to the chief foundation of common
resolutions, was ready to end this business by Arms, since he could not do it
by Treaties. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> was doubly concern'd in this business;
for to the respect of Religion, which was the chief cause why he had medled
therein, was added the Decree of protecting the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and the
liberty thereof: nor could he with honour abandon the enterprise, though he
should not value the other weighty interests of his Crown: on the other side,
seeing so many jealousies, such ill satisfaction, so great a combination of
Princes, who threatned much mischief to <hi>Italy,</hi> he began to reflect
upon the prejudice which might redound, if new wars in <hi>Italy</hi> should be
added to the wars of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> which at this time
were very hot; and how hard would it be, to make sufficient provisions in all
parts; which if they should fail in any one place would necessarily draw on the
ruine of all the rest. Labouring therefore amongst so many weighty and
differing respects, but chiefly under the great apprehension of the immense
troubles which might insue un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Italy,</hi> as that which prevailed over
all other more wholsome resolves, he chose the middle way, which was, to
deposite the Forts of the <hi>Valio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> into the Popes hands, to the end
that he might keep them with his own Captains and Souldiers, in the name of the
Apostolick See, to dispose of them afterwards with satisfaction to Religion,
and to both the Crowns; whereby Religion was not injured: for laying the care
thereof upon the Pope, he himself was freed from further trouble therein; nor
was the liberty of those of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> thereby prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; for the
Pope being to satisfie both the Crowns therein, it was not to be supposed that
the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> would ever be satisfied with any thing which might
be contrary to their Liberty. Thus the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed from <hi>Italy,</hi>
it seemed that the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> had with one and the same resolution
wisely provided for her own affairs, for the point of Religion, and for
protecting the <hi>Valtoline:</hi> whereby she witnessed to the world, that
nothing else but zeal to Religion, and the keeping Catholicks from being
oppress'd by Hereticks; and not any reason of State, or desire to usurpe what
belonged to others (as was said) had made the King interest himself in the
present affairs: the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position being accepted, the Pope sent his Brother Don
<hi>Horatio,</hi> who was Duke of <hi>Fiano,</hi> and the Churches General,
with 500 Horse, and 1500 Foot, into the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> to whom the Forts
of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> of <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> and of <hi>la Riva,</hi> were
immediately delivered up; and the Archduke took the Garrisons out of
<hi>Coira,</hi> and out of the other places of that Country; and Duke
<hi>Fiano</hi> leaving the Forces of the Church in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> under
their Officers and Commanders, return'd quickly to <hi>Rome.</hi> Thus the
troubles which seemed to threaten <hi>Italy</hi> being pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in the
beginning of <hi>May,</hi> in the year of our Lord 1623, the Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation
touching the <hi>Valtoline</hi> was transfer'd from the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
to that of <hi>Rome;</hi> and the end of so weighty a business, which was
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly expected from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> was now looked for from
the Pope: but neither were the Venetians, nor those of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi>
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with this depositure; for the latter complained very much, that he
whom they had chosen to be Protector of their Liberty, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received
them into his Protection, had turn'd them over to the <pb n="241" facs="tcp:53250:128"/>
Pope; whom by reason of what he had done against them, they did not only
distrust, but feared that he could not well defend them, by reason of the far
distance of his Dominions, when they should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by the Grisons, or by
any other Potentates: they said the King should rather have quite given over
their Protection, then have put them under anothers power; for by giving it
over, he would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them, when they should be at their own command,
either constantly to defend their Liberty, or to die in the defence, thereof:
neither complained they less in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> whether having sent
people of purpose, to Negotiate their interests, they forbare not to represent
the justice of their cause to the Pope, to the Cardinals, and to the
Embassadours of Princes, not so much in point of Religion, as of Liberty: they
exaggerated the Tyrannical, and unjust actions of the Grisons; their cruel
orders to introduce Heresie amongst them: the Usurpation of their ancient and
natural Liberty: they humbly beseeched that they would not suffer the people of
<hi>Italy,</hi> who were by nature Free-men, and Catholicks, to fall once more
under the Tyrannical yoke of Transalpine Hereticks; they shew'd the danger
wherein their souls and lives should be, if they should fall again under their
Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from which they had withdrawn themselves, for the preservation of
the Catholick faith; and from whom they could expect nothing but severe
punishments in their lives, and detestable violence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
            <p>But the Venetians, who had laboured to get the <hi>Valtoline</hi>
out of the Spaniards hands, were more vex'd and in greater streights then
before, now that they saw it fallen into the Popes power; being no less
trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled now to see the Pope made Arbitrator, then the Spaniards Masters
thereof before: and this not so much out of the great interests which the Popes
use to have with the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> as for that the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans having
of late begun to struggle with the See of <hi>Rome</hi> for the first place of
Authority amongst the Princes of <hi>Italy:</hi> And arrogating more Authority
then became them in Ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Benefices,
they thought that if the Pope should keep the Key of that Gate for which they
had striven so much, the Popes Authority would be too great; and that they of
Compettitors being become infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, must be forc'd to yield, and foregoing
much of their high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions must depend absolutely upon the Popes power:
And as it is natural to all men to be more willingly under the power of
Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers then of those of their own Nation; so they could not indure not
only that they had not been able as yet to compass their desired ends, not to
secure their own liberty and the common Liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> but that
instead thereof they had changed, or rather doubled their subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being
compelled by the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to depend upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick See:
They were yet more troubled to finde that the Pope, who was very streightly
joined unto them till the day of depositure, should now after he had got
possession, begin to waver and to decline from the common Interests; For the
Pope seeing the surety and liberty of the Apostolick See secured by this
depositure, that the like of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and of the other Italian Princes
did thereby depend upon him; and that the Spaniards and French were thereby
also under his Arbitriment; <pb n="242" facs="tcp:53250:129"/> If seemed that amongst
several cogitations he had a mind to make use of the present occasion, to
purchase and establish more Authority and Grandezza in the Church, and in his
own Family: Wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to listen more willingly to those of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> he grew cool in his resolutions, and ambiguous in his
Answers; and of a Partner be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing become Arbitrator of the common Cause, he
seemed to have laid much of his servency aside, and that he did not listen
either to the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians or to the French, with that attention as he was wont
to listen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and to confer the secrets of his soul with them.</p>
            <p>The Spaniards were not displeased with these the Popes
deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, who were well enough contented that if any but themselves should
possess the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> it should be the Pope; and rejoycing that the
world should be deceived in the imputation which they had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid upon
the Spaniards, of thirsting more after Dominion then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter zeal to Religion,
they used several pieces of cunning, that the Pope delaying his Resolves might
keep possession the longer: Wherefore to boot with his fomenting the complaints
of those of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> of whom the King of <hi>Spain</hi> still
professed himself Protector, making use of the conditions of the Depositure, he
was not content with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded Propositions: And at last, to the end that
this private advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage joyned to the publick might make greater impression in
the Pope, they consented that his Nephew should marry with the only Daughter
and Heir of Prince <hi>Venosa,</hi> a Neopolitan Lord, who had for her Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
40000 Duckats, annual Revenue of Inheritance, which she held in Fee in the
Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> Nor herewithal content, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, That
regard being had to the antient Conventions of those of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi>
a fourth League might be made of them, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing governed by their own Laws
and Magistrates, might sit in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Dyets, and give their Vote with the
other three in all publick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs appertaining to the Common-wealth: Or else,
That it being made a Principality, it should be granted to some Prince who was
a friend to them all, insinuating the Popes Brother or Nephew. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals which
he listened very willingly unto, as being much inclined to the exaltation of
his kindred; but they were mightily abhor'd by others, particularly by the
Venetians, who grew as suspicious of the Pope after the Marriage, as they were
confiding in him before, for the constancy which he profess'd in the common
Cause: To this was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That the Principality of the <hi>Valtoline</hi>
being of it self but weak, and lying open towards the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> it would too necessarily depend upon the Spanish Authority;
and if this were not satisfactory in any other person, the Venetians must needs
abhor it in the Popes Nephews, by reason of the Wives Estate held in Fee; which
being by the Marriage to fall unto the Lodovisian Family, and to be annexed to
his person who should be Prince of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> they were too
pregnant proofs of the necessary dependance of that Principality upon the Crown
of <hi>Spain:</hi> Neither could the French, though they stormed at the Popes
alteration, any ways resent it; the business being by the Covenants of the
Depositure reduced from Forces to Treaty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the French were to carry
themselves cunningly, lest they might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asperate the Pope, and alienare him
the more from their Kings interests. <pb n="243" facs="tcp:53250:129"/> The Treaty of
Marriage which was near concluding between the Prince of <hi>England</hi> and
the <hi>Infanta Maria,</hi> Sister to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> did not a
little trouble the French, and suppress their pretentions; which Treaty, being
one of the most memorable and signal Negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of those times, and for that
it was also of great concernment in the present Occurrences, it will not be
unnecessary, nor will it swerve from our present Narration, to give you a short
account of it.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> being deeply concern'd in the
<hi>Bohemian</hi> wars, did not only send men and monies to the Emperour
through the <hi>Valtoline</hi> before it was deposited, but commanded Marquess
<hi>Spinola,</hi> his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain General in <hi>Flanders</hi> and in the
Low-Countries, to enter the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate,</hi> and wage war there in the
Emperours name: In obedience whereunto <hi>Spinola,</hi> with incredible speed
and prosperity, possessed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most the whole <hi>Palatinate;</hi> and
suppressing the Forces of the numerous Army of the Protestant Princes,
associated in assistance of the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi> who durst not give him
Battel, forced them at last to forsake the <hi>Palatinate</hi> upon the Rheine,
and to receive Law from him: By which prosperous success the parts of the
<hi>Palatinate</hi> and of the other Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates being overcome, they were
afterwards totally ruined by the Emperours Army, and by that of the Catholick
League in <hi>Germany;</hi> for these two Armies jointly entering
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> and joining Battel with the Palatines Army before
<hi>Prague,</hi> they routed it totally; and the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine</hi> having lost
his new Kingdom, and all hopes of regaining it, he fled with his Wife, Daughter
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> towards <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that he might go
from thence to his Father in Law, and obtain favour from him, or at least
monies to recover his Paternal Estate, which was possess'd and confiscated by
the Emperour, for Rebellion and high Treason. The King of <hi>England</hi>
could never be drawn to approve of his Son in Law's resolution of accepting the
Crown offered him by the Bohemians; and professing that he could not with a
just conscience assist him in that Cause which he thought to be unjust, and a
pernitious example to all Princes, forbore sending aid or succour to him; which
he did profess at first, and with miraculous constancy and faith made good unto
the last; whereby he deserved very well of the Emperour, and of the House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> who were so deeply concern'd in those Revolts; But afterwards
commiserating the exile of his Son in Law, Daughter, and Grand-children, and
yet resolving not to assist their afflicted Country by Arms, nor by joining
with the other Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who prepared to repair the Prince
<hi>Palatine</hi> with new forces; he thought he should be able to do him
better service by Negotiation; wherein he had placed no small hopes, by
marrying his own and only Son to the <hi>Infanta</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and by
his having deserved so well of the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> And unusual means
being to be used in unusual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, he with a sudden and very secret
resolution, sent his only Son to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to desire in his
own person the <hi>Infanta</hi> for his Wife; thinking that by the Authority of
his Sons presence, and by his generous shew of honouring that King, he should
cut off all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and hinderances which might obstruct a business of so
high concernment: And that the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> being overcome by so
magnanimous a favour, should not only consent unto the Marriage, 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:53250:130"/> but in savour thereunto restore the <hi>Palatinate,</hi>
which the Prince intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to demand, and hoped to obtain amidst the Festivals
and Jollities of the Royal Marriage.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>England</hi> departing from <hi>England</hi>
privately, past with a very small attendance disguised through <hi>France,</hi>
and came to <hi>Madrid</hi> before the knowledge of his departure, and of so
strange a resolution, was arrived there: The King and the whole Court being
astonished and confused at the arrival of such a Guest, knew not whether they
were to be glad of the Princes coming, in respect of the great Honour they
received thereby; or to be sorry for it, being necessitated to grant him
whatsoever he should desire, though peradventure they were not thereunto well
inclined: Yet being received with all the demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Honour, and with
the greatest applause that might be, he found a first very good correspondency
of good will in the King and in the whole Court, and already desire to please
him in what concern'd the Match; and for what concern'd the <hi>Palatine,</hi>
such demonstrations were used, as he had reason to conceive hopes that he
should obtain his whole desire by that voyage. As for the Marriage, all
difficulties giving way to the Authority and presence of the Prince, the point
of Religion was the only <hi>Remora;</hi> wherein the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
desiring much satisfaction, many debates were had about it: But at last, the
English being desirous of a conclusion, consented to whatsoever the Spaniards
did demand; so as the Marriage was held as good as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and for such
divulged: Very rich Presents past between the Prince and his Mistress, as an
earnest-penny of the future Marriage; and many signs of rejoycing, and of
reciprocal affection and union, past between the two Crowns; There rested only
one scruple on the King of <hi>Spains</hi> part, which delayed the
Consummation, which growing daily greater became an invincible difficulty; and
afterwards reverst the whole business, and did wholly defeat it: For the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> desirous to proceed cautiously in so weighty a business, and
which was on his side irretractable, required security for the performance of
what was agreed upon; And the King of <hi>England</hi> offering his Princely
Word and Solemn Oath, (which was all that he could offer, or the other could
pretend unto) the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was not therewithal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; as not
being willing by any means (in a business of so great concernment and
importance) to depend upon anothers will, subject to so many casualties and
accidents of Variation, which might perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture happen: And because the
business of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> grew more difficult, the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> keeping himself within the bounds of not promising any
effectualy estitution, (which the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> desired, and
pretended that it was promised) affirming that he would use his Authority and
best indeavours with the Emperour; (to whom, he said, the inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>est of concession did chiefly belong,
and upon whom the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal of that State did absolutely depend;) men began
therefore daily to suspect more and more, that the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
having been from the beginning intentionally and inwardly against the Match,
they had only cunningly held on the Treaty; partly, out of their own ambition
and Grandezza; partly, for the Honour of the Prince, whom they seemed to esteem
very highly; but chiefly that they might gain time, <pb n="245" facs="tcp:53250:130"/> and
advance the mean while in the business of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> Which the
Prince percerving, he parted from that Court after he had been six Moneths
there, without having made any conclusion; and imbarking in a Fleet which was
come from <hi>England</hi> to re-conduct him, he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his own Kingdom,
carrying with him implacable hatred, grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous complaints, revenge and enmity,
instead of friendship and a Wife.</p>
            <p>Here I, the Translator of this Book, must crave leave both of my
Author and Reader, (which if it may not be granted me, I will presume to take)
to insert a passage which then happened, and does relate to this Story; it
being a full and perfect Vindication of a scandalous imputation laid by some
black back-biting Dogs, nay foul-mouth'd Curs, upon this then glorious Prince,
my since blessed King, and now and for ever that undoubtedly happy Saint in
Heaven, King <hi>Charles,</hi> late Monarch of Great <hi>Britain</hi> and
<hi>Ireland;</hi> they being defirous to make the world believe, by their
scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous speeches and writings, that this pious, conscientious, and
religious King, was a Papist in his heart, and intended to introduce Popery
into this Land: And truly, since it falls out so pat and so aptly here, I
cannot forbear doing it, though I know it be unusual, and contrary to custome,
for Translators to adde any thing of their own; and this it was:</p>
            <p>I <hi>Who had the honour to be bred up with this hopeful Prince;
and who account it my greatest happiness to have known him, and to have been
known by him when he was King; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard a street Report that this</hi>
Infanta, <hi>his then Mistress, and since Wife to the King of</hi> Hungary,
<hi>was turned</hi> Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran; <hi>according to the gratious freedom his
Majesty was always used to afford me, I told him of it one day when he was at
Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; upon the hearing whereof, His ever blessed Majesty was pleased to
say;</hi> Harry, <hi>if this be true, I am confident I know who turn'd her;
which I desiring to know who it might be, His Majesty answered,</hi> Padre
Rohose: <hi>This</hi> Padre Rohose, <hi>said His Majesty, when I came to</hi>
Spain, <hi>was Confessor to the</hi> Infanta; <hi>and in the absence of the
Kings Confessor, was also Confessor to the King; He was one</hi> (said His
blessed Majesty) <hi>who gave very diligent attendance upon me when I came
first to</hi> 
               <pb n="246" facs="tcp:53250:131"/> Spain, <hi>and for two or three Moneths
space never failed to wait upon me when I was at Dinner; insomuch as some
acquaintance being grown between us, he one day moved me that a Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
might be had in publick between my Chaplains and some of the King of</hi>
Spains <hi>Priests in point of Religion; affirming that he knew it would be
very pleasing to the</hi> Infanta; <hi>I answered, no, saying, I came not
hither to turn, nor to be turned in my Religion by any publick Argumentations;
nor have I any such Commission from the King my Father; but rather a Command to
the contrary; but if you,</hi> Padre Rohose, <hi>have any thing to object
against the Religion which I profess, I will give you the hearing in
private:</hi> Padre Rohose <hi>being glad that he had got thus much, began to
object somewhat against the Religion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd in my Fathers Dominions; at the
beginning whereof, said the Prince, laying his hand upon the others Arm,
No,</hi> Padre Rohose, <hi>this is not the way, this is to Dispute</hi> de non
conces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis; <hi>But let me give you an account of my Faith, and of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents
of my Religion first, and then if you have any thing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, speak your
mind freely:</hi> Padre Rohose <hi>being herewith content,</hi> (as surely he
had good reason) <hi>the Prince began and made him a full and true relation of
the Tenents of his Religion; which when he had done,</hi> Rohose <hi>replyed,
Sir, do you believe all this? Yes, said the Prince; And will your Highness give
me leave, said</hi> Padre Rohose, <hi>to affirm this to others from your mouth?
Yes,</hi> (said the Prince) <hi>do it boldly, for this is the Religion I was
born in, and bred up in; the Religion which is profess'd in my Fathers three
Kingdoms, and wherein, by the Grace of God, I am resolved to live and dye: Why
then</hi> (said Padre Rohose) <hi>for ought I know, Sir, you may be saved as
well as I. My blessed King having told me this, I asked His Majesty
whether</hi> Rohose <hi>did not object any thing against what His Majesty had
said; Not at the present,</hi> replied His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty; <hi>but some few days
after he took me aside, and began to alledge some trivial things against what
he had heard me say; to which</hi> (said the King) <hi>I gave him such an
Answer, as I heard no further news of</hi> Padre Rohose <hi>for a good while;
whereat marvelling not a little, I wonder</hi> (said the Prince, one day, in
publick) <hi>why</hi> Padre Rohose <hi>hath not visited me of late; What is
become of him? To which he was answered by a whisper in the ear, That the
Priest</hi> Rohose <hi>was forbidden <pb n="247" facs="tcp:53250:131"/> coming any more to
the Prince his Court, left instead of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Prince, the Prince
should convert him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could not omit mentioning this remarkable Passage here, since
(as I said before) I had so pat an occasion to do it; and since it was to my
self that His blessed Majesty was pleased to make this Relation upon the
aforesaid occasion; And upon the Faith of a Christian, and Word of a
Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, this, is the full sence, and as near as I can remember, the very
words His ever blessed Majesty was pleased to do me the honour as to tell me;
which though they wrought nothing upon me, more then what I did formerly know,
and did confidently believe; if they be not able to stop the mouths of those
slanderous companions, and make them bite out those Tongues wherewith they have
indeavoured to throw dirt upon the Memory of His Sacred Majesty; yet at least,
his constant perseverance in the profession and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing his Faith at his
unpresidented death, me thinks should make them do it. </p>
            <p> And now to pursue my Authour again;</p>
            <p>These practises made the French grow cooler (as I have said) in
the affairs touching the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> for doubting lest by this Marriage
a streight League might be concluded between the Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>England;</hi> the Kingdom of <hi>France,</hi> being placed between them,
grew apprehensive of it: And the intestine wars continuing in <hi>France</hi>
against the Hereticks, who were much favoured by the King and Kingdom of
<hi>England;</hi> it behoved the Fench to be very circumspect in falling foul
with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> when it should be so closely annex'd to the
English, as it was likely to be by that Marriage: But new accidents did this
mean while happen, which did much better the French affairs: The Pope, who was
grown very inward with the Spaniards, died about the end of <hi>Iune,</hi> in
the year 1623. who was succeeded by <hi>Maffeo,</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal
<hi>Barbarino,</hi> a Florentine by Nation, who caused himself to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

prescribed by his Predecessors; who to the end that the Cardinals might give
their Votes with the more freedom, did by a particular Bull ordain so secret a
way for the giving of Suffrages, as it could not be discovered by any; which
form, though as new and not formerly used, it kept the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave a little
longer; yet it being then the Dog-days, and the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals being much
incommodated by their being kept so close, many of them fell sick, and some
died; wherefore, forced by fear and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they joined in the election of
Pope <hi>Urbane,</hi> who was indowed with all those parts and ornaments
required in a great Prince, and in a powerful Pope. Having taken the Popedom
upon him, great signes of constant resolution appeared in him, of a good
affection to Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and that he was not apt to siding: For to the great
neutrality which he seemed to profess in publick affairs, and in such as
apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to the Papal dignity, he added great severity in his private
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by refusing great offers which were immediately made him by the
French Agents for the aggrandizing of his House; but on the other side, being
very gratious to the Cardinals of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to the French and
Venetian Cardinals, with whom he held close consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he caused much
distrust in the Spanish Cardinals and Agents, who therefore quickly shewed
little satisfaction in his choice, and were displeased with themselves for the
favour they had done him: And truly the success of affairs under his Popedom,
shew'd they did not much erre in their judgment, nor in the diffidence which
they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of him; for Pope <hi>Urbane,</hi> whether moved thereunto by
his own Genius and inclination to the French, or out of a desire to restore the
Pontifical dignity to its former vigour, and render it less exposed to the
dependancy of anothers will, or that he nourished more generous and more
exalted thoughts of the Liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> he soon discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself
no great favourer of the Spaniards, and very much a friend to those, who being
desirous of the like liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> strove to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Spanish
greatness: This jealousie was augmented by the knowledge of an important
accident which happned in <hi>Avignon,</hi> in the Moneth of <hi>October</hi>
this very year.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>France, England,</hi> and <hi>Denmark,</hi> the
Venetians, Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Hollanders; many of the <hi>German</hi>
Princes; and, as some will have it, <hi>Bethlem Gaber,</hi> the Transilvanian
Prince, sent their Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours very secretly to that City; where coming
unknown, and in the habit of Merchants, they made a League between them against
the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the liberty of
<hi>Italy,</hi> for the restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> and of the
<hi>Palatinate;</hi> The principal Articles where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of were; <hi>That the
Hollanders, to boot with the war which they made in their own Country against
the Spaniards, should send Fleets into</hi> America, <hi>and possess themselves
of</hi> Brazil: <hi>That the King of</hi> England <hi>should assist the
Hollanaers with a certain number of men in their Domestick wars, and should
send a powerful Fleet to</hi> Spain, <hi>to assault those Rivers, and to
intercept the Navy which useth to come thither from</hi> America: <hi>That the
King of</hi> Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, <hi>together with the Protestant Princes of</hi>
Germany, <hi>should raise a powerful Army, and wage war with the Emperour
in</hi> Flanders <hi>for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi> 
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:53250:132"/> 
               <hi>of
the</hi> Palatinate: <hi>And that</hi> Bethlem Gaber <hi>should molest the
Emperours Dominions towards</hi> Hungary; <hi>to the end that being assaulted
on two sides, he might be the less able to make resistance: That the King
of</hi> France <hi>should hinder the commerc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> between</hi> Spain <hi>and</hi> Italy <hi>with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fleet
to be kept at</hi> Marselles; <hi>and should pass into</hi> Piedmout <hi>with
an Army of 25000 Foot, and 4000 Horse; and that joining with the Duke of</hi>
Savoy, <hi>who was to raise another Army of 12000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, he
should assault the State of</hi> Millain; <hi>for the maintaining of which Army
the Venetians should disburse 100000 Duckats a Moneth to the Duke of</hi>
Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy: <hi>And that at the same time the King of</hi> France <hi>should fall
into the</hi> Valtoline <hi>with another Army out of the Grisons Country; and
when he should have possess'd himself of it, he should fall down from thence
into the State of</hi> Millain; <hi>and joining with the Venetians, who for
those enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were to join a certain number of men to the French Army, he
should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault the same State of</hi> Millain <hi>with the Common forces; and
that they should assault the affairs of the Kingdom of</hi> Naples <hi>with a
Fleet of Ships towards the Adriatick Sea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This League being made two months after the Pope; Election, in a
City belonging to the Church, made the Spaniards suspect that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver would
have been appointed without tacite intelligence held be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Pope and the
French, who were thought the authors of it: because besides the restitution of
the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> the restoring of the
Apostolick See to all that did anciently belong unto her was agreed upon;
wherein it seemed the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> might be understood: and place
was also left in the same League, for the Pope, and great Duke of
<hi>Tuscany,</hi> who was also promised to have all the Havens of
<hi>Tuscany</hi> restored unto him: but the French openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying any such
Conspiracy, and no wise man being to believe, that a Pope hardly wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>m in his Chair should enter into so
weighty Machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whereby the world was to be turned up-side down, and the
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religon to be disturb'd; the Spaniards, though this Union might seem
to be true, by many successes which insued, not having any certain proof which
might clear these jealousies, thought it a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>afer way to work upon the new
Pope by dissimulation, then to alienate him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from them by complaints,
and vain resentments; that which did most trouble the Pope, was, how to
establish the Dukedom of <hi>Urbine</hi> in the Apostolick See, which was, as
it were, devolved thereunto by the sudden death of the Prince, only Son to the
old Duke, who a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Popes Election was found dead in his Bed,
having been very well the night before when he went into it: for he having no
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er issue but a very young
Daughter, and the Duke being so very old, as he was not likely to live long,
much lesse to have any more Children; that Dukedom, when he should be dead, was
to fall to the Apostolick See, whereof it was an antient Fee

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and as this so great addition
of State to the Church was odious to the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Princes, the Venetians, and
the great Duke, so neither did the Spaniards approve of it: wherefore they
began to talk how they might continue that young infant in the Principality
(whereof by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>enure of
investing she was absolutely uncapable) by marrying her to a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Prince,
and so, with satisfaction to all, keep that State from being 
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:53250:133"/> united to the Church: the manifest claim of the Church
did oppose these designs, against which nothing could be attempted without open
violence, and without troubling the whole World. Neither did the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ety and Religion of the old Duke
permit, that (to the prejudice of his soul and conscience,) he should leave his
people whom he loved very well, involved, after his life, in fore wars: the
difficulty of managing the business was likewise a rub, and the great
contestation which would be found in effecting it; there not being any Prince
to be found for this Marriage, with whom the other Princes would be content; so
great an addition to the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> Cosin german to the
Infants Mother, who was Daughter to <hi>Cosmo</hi> the Second, Father to
<hi>Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do</hi> the Second, now great Duke of <hi>Tuscony,</hi> on whom
mens eyes were more fixed, for this business, then on any other, was equally
suspicious to the Spaniards and Venetians, and to the other Princes of
<hi>Italy:</hi> It made more for the interest of them all, to leave it in the
Church, the common Mother, and Commonwealth; the Empire whereof is more
moderate, by reason of the Sacerdotal profession, of the often change of Popes,
and necessary vicissitude of Prelates which govern her: and wherein all Princes
had more reason to confide, as being more interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed therein: whereas on the
contrary, by joyning that State to <hi>Tuscany,</hi> too great and powerful a
Pincipality would be constituted in the very heart of <hi>Italy:</hi> which
extending from the one Sea to the other, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding whole <hi>Italy,</hi> it
would have born too great a sway in all general affairs; and dividing wholly
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> it might
have been too prejudicial to the interests of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> in
those troublesome times, which afterwards hapned. To this, moreover, was added
the tender years of the great Duke, who was under the Government of his Mother
and Grand-mother, that Archduchess of <hi>Austria,</hi> Sister to the present
Emperour, and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e Duke of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> and therefore little able to enter upon
new undertakings, so much controverted, and of so high impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: to fix
their thoughts upon any of the Popes Nephews, as was then spoken of, would have
been indeed more acceptable to all, for it would have hindered the connexion of
States; a thing so prejudicial to that equality by which <hi>Italy</hi> is at
the present maintained; nor would the Span<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ards have been against it, to shun so great an addition to the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Church, and to win the Popes favour: but to boot that the
Pope himself was not for it, it was a scandalous example, and subject to be
revoked by the insuing Popes, by the precise orders and instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the
Church, confirm'd by the reiterated Oaths of the Cardinals and Popes, by which
the new Feofments of States which are devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Apostolick See are
forbidden; and the Infants age did most of all oppose it, who was incapable of
contracting Marriage: so as by reason of the continual variation of worldly
affairs, no certain resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could be taken in a business of such
importance, whereby all Princes might be satisfied; and yet the Spanish Agents
did abbet these endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours: but of all oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rs Don <hi>Antonio di Tolledo,</hi> Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> and
Viceroy of <hi>Naples,</hi> who was allied to the great Duke, was most zealous
in the business for the great Duke; and the old Duke of <hi>Urbine,</hi> being
aware that Monsieur <hi>Santorio,</hi> made by the new Pope Bishop of
<hi>Urbine,</hi> 
               <pb n="251" facs="tcp:53250:133"/> and who was speedily sent to his
Episcopal residence, began to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, and to interpose his Authority in some
Affairs which appertain'd more to the State then to his Episcopal care, was not
only much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with <hi>Santorio,</hi> but interpreting it, as if the
Pope, anticipating the time of the lapse, had sent him as a Superintendent over
the Affairs of the State, thought himself much injured: wherefore being angred,
he sent the Child to the Court of <hi>Florence,</hi> and re-inforced
<hi>Tossone</hi> and the other principal places, with Garrisons, and seemed
desirous to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Grand-child to the great Duke. The Pope was certainly
much troubled at these passages, being wholly bent to reunite this State to the
Apostolick See; insomuch as waxing jealous he sent many men to the Confines of
<hi>Tuscany</hi> and <hi>Urbine:</hi> but they produced contrary effects to
what the Spaniards pretended; for they did the more unite the Pope to the King
of <hi>France,</hi> who having no Territories in <hi>Italy</hi> would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be a great friend to the Churches pretences and greatness; which increasing,
without any prejudice to his Crown, was prejudicial to the Grandezza of
<hi>Spain,</hi> which was envied by <hi>France;</hi> and therefore the Pope,
that he might the better fortifie himself against the Spanish Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations,
and that he might be reveng'd of them who endeavoured to anger him, he shewed
himself very resolute in the affairs of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline;</hi> that when he
had rid his hands thereof, he might with more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence attend the affairs of
<hi>Urbine;</hi> and because the Spaniards, when they deposited the Forts of
the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> obliged themselves (to the end that the Church might be
put to no prejudice nor expence) to pay such stipends as should be necessary
for the Souldiers, that they might defend them; and the Spanish Agents having
failed in their payments; the Pope, who was in teh mean while to take order for
pay, said with much fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dom, that
he would not forgo what was his own, for what (according to the Grammarians)
was Appellative, nor would he squan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der away the moneys of the Apostolick
Chamber, in defence of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which did appertain little or
nothing to the Church; but spare them for the eminent danger of the State of
<hi>Urbine:</hi> which speeches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accompanied with some other favourable
Demonstrations to the French, did trouble the Spaniards, and made them very
circumspect in the business of <hi>Urbino,</hi> lest the Pope, to make a
greater conjunction with the King of <hi>France,</hi> might probably
precipitate the business of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and yet being naturally
very considerate, he had two Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations about the business of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> of the most conspicuous Theologists of the Court, and most
exemplary for holiness of life; who having discus'd the business were of
opinion that the Pope ought not to permit Catholicks to return under the yoke
of Hereticks, out of the evident danger of their souls, which belonging to the
Flock of our Saviour Christ; it became him, according to the Gospel, to defend
them like a good Shepherd, from the Wolves, though with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of his own
life. Thus did the Affairs of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> alter, out of several
respects, in that Court, just like the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; and the
Pope not being resolved what to do in it, that he might hold them both in hand
temporized, and delai'd his resolution: but the French, who whilst
<hi>Gregory</hi> lived were quiet, when they had a Pope who was their friend,
began to rouse up, and to pretend that the <pb n="252" facs="tcp:53250:134"/>
               <hi>Valtoline,</hi> the Forts being demolished, was to return under the
Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons command; nor did they admit of any exception, unless that for what
concern'd the safety of the Catholick Religion, the Pope should be the
determiner: this they said was dictated by the first Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at
<hi>Madrid;</hi> and thus Reason, and the King of <hi>France</hi> his
Obligation to Protect the Grifons, did require: they persisted the more in
these pretentions, for that they saw their affairs were much altered; for in
the Spanish Court, instead of alliance, enmity with the English was increased:
the Spanish Army in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and all the Forces of those States, were
busied before <hi>Breda,</hi> a very strong Town of the Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, both for
Situation, Fortification, and for its being triple fenced by water; the taking
of it was held impossible, the Siege very long, and of uncertain success, the
Hollanders having raised a strong Army to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. The Affairs of that
Court had had but bad success in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and in <hi>America;</hi> for
<hi>Ormuz,</hi> a very strong Town, situated in the mouth of <hi>Persia,</hi> a
principal place for Merchandize, and of great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual revenue, and of greater
concernment for the command of the East-Indies, was taken by those Barbarians,
they being assisted by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish shipping: the <hi>Baja de todes santos,</hi> or
<hi>All Saints Bay,</hi> the chiefest staple Town of <hi>Brasile,</hi> being
(perhaps in pursuance of the League of <hi>Avignon)</hi> assaulted by a
<hi>Holland</hi> Fleet, was taken, and sack'd; which having had booty th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>re to the value of above two Millions
of Ducates, fortified themselves there, intending further progress: these were
two mighty blows to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> which did oblige that King to
send a powerful Army, as he did, to recover them; and to boot that the event of
these Affairs was uncertain, they required great store of shipping, multitudes
of men and money: nor were the wars of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> yet wholly at an end;
for many Rebels of the Empire, and whose Forces seemed rather to increase then
to lessen, did molest it in several places; for the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi>
in conformity to the League at <hi>Avignon,</hi> came into the Field very
strong, and had made himself head of the Protestant Princes, who took up Arms
against the Emperour, to restore the <hi>Palatine</hi> to his Patrimonial
State, and who made great progress in the lower <hi>Germany.</hi> On the
contrary, the Affairs of <hi>France,</hi> which till now had been full of
troubles and civil wars, seemed to be brought into a safe Harbour, and by
several accidents to be in a better condition: the King of <hi>England,</hi>
having broken the match with <hi>Spain,</hi> had concluded a Marriage between
his Son, the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and a Sister to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who was yet unmarried; and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in League with him,
promised great things against the interest of <hi>Spain,</hi> both by Sea and
Land, answerable to the League of <hi>Avignon;</hi> and the tumults of
<hi>France</hi> were either totally composed, or it was in the Kings power to
end them: which accidents concurring at the same time were able to incite any
Prince to novelties, though never so much an enemy thereunto, much more the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and French Nation, who were so far interessed and
ingaged in the business of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and therefore though after
many Consultations had in <hi>Rome,</hi> between the Embassadours of
<hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> of themselves, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with the
Pope, the Pope put forth at last some Articles touching the security in point
of Religion amongst those of the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line;</hi> 
               <pb n="253" facs="tcp:53250:134"/>
whereunto the Embassadour did agree, and made others between themselves in
their Kings name, whereby the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> when the Forts should be
demolished, was to return to be under the Grisons; but with some Articles,
Conditions; and upon pain of Escheat, in case of swarving from the agreement,
and particularly with leave for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to pass men thorow
it; yet the King of <hi>France,</hi> accepting only those that were propounded
by the Pope, did absolutely refuse those that were agreed upon by the
Embassadour; and being highly offended with the Commandator <hi>Sillery,</hi>
who was his Embassadour, he sent Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>di Bittune</hi> to succeed him,
and sent for <hi>Sillery</hi> back to <hi>France;</hi> and did not only deprive
him of his favour, but removed his Brother, who was Lord Chancellor, and the
Chancellors Son, who was Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of State, together with other of their
dependants, from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, being apprehensive (as was said) that they
held some secret intelligence with the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> and being
incensed against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> desired the Pope that he would
either cause the Forts to be demolished, or else restore them to the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> to the end that he might make way to their demolishment,
without offence to the Apostolick See: but the Articles of depositure withstood
the demolishing, and the restitution was gainsaid, for fear of raising new wars
between the two Kings: so as, look with how much more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection it became
the Pope to proceed in his resolves, so much more did the fervency of the
French increase; who not brooking any delay, and seeing things in a way for
war, furthered the execution of the League, and the preparations for all things
requisite for what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on. But the Marriage (which was just at this
time in hand) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Prince <hi>Phileberto</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
Princess <hi>Maria,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Francis</hi> late Duke of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> did either totally hinder, or at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard for the present
the effects of so great a combination: by which Treaty the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> (who if he were not the head, was a principal member of this
League,) was diverted from the common Counsels. The Spaniards had formerly
endeavoured by several ways to stave him off from the other Confederates,
shewing plainly how much it would make for his advantage to withdraw the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> from subjection to the Grisons, and make it dependant upon
their King; for his Territories having no need of access by that way, he would
be the only man on whom the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> would fix their eyes, and
whose friendship they would mainly endeavour, by reason of the need they should
have thereof; and the two Crowns would be inforced to esteem him no less then
they, since he would be the only man, who, when all other pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages should be
shut up, might keep out the French, and all other For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, from coming
into <hi>Italy,</hi> or who might bring them in. But hatred against the
Spaniards, and a desire to oppose their ends, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing more with him, and
conceiving great hopes from the League, he still continued therein: some
Propositions being afterwards made concerning this aforesaid Marriage, of some
resignation to be made by the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> of <hi>Montferrat;</hi>
at least after the death of the said Duke <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and of his
Brother Prince <hi>Vincenso,</hi> both which for several respects had small
hopes of succession, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being exceedingly desirous of
new pretentions to that State, easily fore went <pb n="254" facs="tcp:53250:135"/> any
other business; and the Spaniards, who out of many respects were interessed in
these Negotiations, were not displeased that this might be effected, fearing
lest the line of these two Princes failing, the Duke of <hi>Nivers,</hi> who
was to succeed in those States, should draw the French into <hi>Italy;</hi>
chusing, for the lesser evil, that since <hi>Montferrat</hi> was to fall to the
house of <hi>Savoy,</hi> it might be given to the second Son, in whom they did
much confide; and not to the eldest, who being to succeed in his Fathers
Dominions, his Principality would be too great: and the Duke not being able to
forgo so great an occasion of increasing his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, for the vain and
uncertain hopes of the League, which did not much belong to him, was so much
the more necessitated to forgo the League, and the Friendship of the French;
for this Marriage would make the French his enemies, if the succession of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve upon the Duke of <hi>Nivers,</hi> who that
they might have a Prince in <hi>Italy,</hi> totally dependant upon their King,
would protect and maintain his pretences: nor could the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
keep possession of that State from the French, without the Spaniards
assistance. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ds
therefore being desirous to win him over, and to interest him in their own
Affairs, were then very hot in pursuing that Marriage: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very well that
if the Duke should be separated from the League, the plots of the Confederates
would vanish, who being, as it were, same for what concern'd <hi>Italy,</hi>
without him they could not, at least not without difficulty, do any thing they
had agreed upon: the design had taken handsomely, but a petty accident which
hapned in the River of <hi>Genoa</hi> withheld the effecting of it, and the
Prince his insuing death did to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally overthrow it: where <hi>Liguria</hi>
Confines upon <hi>Piedmont,</hi> stands the little Marquisate
<hi>Zuccarello,</hi> whereof mention hath been formerly made: it was anciently
granted in Fee by the Emperour to those of the house of <hi>Caretta;</hi> but
by alteration of times, and accidents, being got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Genoeses, and
afterwards invested in those of <hi>Caretta,</hi> it was held and possess'd for
the space of 200 years by them, as Feudato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Commonwealth, upon the
usual recognition of homage: the same accidents and revolutions of
<hi>Italy</hi> had lately transported it from the Commonwealth to the
Emperours, not without the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths complaint, which yielding to the
times that were but bad for her, was not well pleased to be after so many years
possession deprived of that Fee, which lay so neer, and so conveniently, to
their own State: but the Emperours Authority rising up again in <hi>Italy,</hi>
after some ages, the Genoeses were forced to be content, and to expect a better
occasion of repossessing it; and therefore in the year 1576, they purchased an
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nt out of the said Fee,
from <hi>Scipio del Caretto,</hi> the Marquess and possessor thereof; and this
Annual Rent was approved of by the Emperour, and ratified by a solemn Decree.
Not long after the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess being impleaded by the Emperour, for a certain
man-slaughter, he sold that Marquisate to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> to the
prejudice of the Cesar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>an
Exchequer, and of the Covenant of Prelation, so to avoid confiscation; and the
Emperour proceeding to Sentence of Death against the Marquess, and to
confiscation of the Fee, took it from the Duke (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o whom it was already assigned over by the Marquess)
and held it for himself, and for the Imperial Chamber: the Duke being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:53250:135"/> of possession, labour'd hard in the Court at
<hi>Germany,</hi> sometimes in his own name, sometimes in the name of the
Marquess, and of his Son, to have the lapse and confiscation revoked; but in
vain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the opposition of the Cesarian Exchequer, and of the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which by re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>son of
her ancient pretences, and much more by reason of her more modern ones, which
she had got therein, was by the Emperour admitted to give a Vote in that
Judgement. In fine, the claim of the <hi>Caretti</hi> being excluded, the
Emperour, in the year 1624, set it to publick sale by the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>yer, for whosoever would give most;
and divers offering moneys for it, it was adjudged to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, which
offer'd most; whereat the Duke thought himself much injured, as supposing that
no Chap-men would be found for it, so as the Fee remaining still unsold, he
might obtain it the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Imperial Chamber: he thought that the
Commonwealth, by buying it, had spoiled all his designes, and utterly defeated
all his hopes of ever coming by it. <hi>He therefore writ to the Commonwealth,
complaining of what had been done, and exhorting her to desist, for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> it

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>: the Commonwealth had just
occasion long before to complain upon this account of the Duke, since the
question being of a Fee situated in</hi> Liguria; <hi>wherein the Duke had
never either action or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, all reason would that, in point of good
neighbourhood, he should have forborn it: but that the same neighbourhood
allowed the Commonwealth to purchase it, as that which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ecame her better to do then any
other, by reason of her confining thereupon, out of reason of State, for her
antient pretences thereunto, and for the new Article of Prelation: but being
desirous of the publick peace, and of keeping good correspondency with her
neighbours, she chose to prosecute her pretentions by a civil way in the
Emperours Court; wherein having after much labour, and expence, obtain'd her
end; (which she had done by no other way then by purchasing that at a high rate
which she had much reason to pretend unto as her own,) she thought her self the
much more injured person, seeing the Dukes appeals accompanied by such open
threats: and that though she was resolved to keep what she had purchased, so as
she might shew her resentment in equal terms, yet thinking moderation did
better become her dignity and gravity, she was more temperate in her answer;
whereby endeavouring to possess the Duke fully of her justifiable actions, she
was resolved to make good what she had done, notwithstanding all his
threats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This constancy and freedom of the answer, the less it was
expected, the more did it sting the Duke to the very soul, who was haughty of
himself, but much more by reason of the present Occurrences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thinking
himself to be in high esteem with the greatest Potentates of Christendom, which
strove who should most favour him, and draw him over to them, he thought
himself formidable to the lesser: he could not thereforefore well indure that a
Commonwealth of Gown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men should so little value his threats; and so much the
less, for that the Commonwealth added Military provisions to her answers,
shewing her self ready to make resistance, in case the Duke should second his
words with deeds: they therefore gave present order for new levles of men, for
taking Foot into pay, for sending for Captains and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders to serve them;
and for her better justification, she together <pb n="256" facs="tcp:53250:136"/> with the
Dukes complaints, published the merits of the Cause, and the small justice he
had to complain; the business being hereby brought upon the Stage, the Duke was
the more bound to persist in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences, and howsoever to maintain them, if
not for the interest which the having or not having the Fee of
<hi>Zuccarello</hi> would be unto him, at least in respect of his reputation,
wherein he thought he should suffer very much, if the world should have reason
to attribute his desisting therein to the Commonwealths threats, and
preparations: so as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving to have the better of the business, he being
full of inexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble invention, began to bethink himself how he might find
out some plot, whereby his honour might not precipitate from that height which
it was in: he began to invite, and to incite the Transalpine Nations against
the City and State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> by giving out what immense riches, and
vast prey, they might get from the wealthy Genoeses: from these fleight
accidents, as from a little spark, great and dangerous flames for
<hi>Italy</hi> arose, which had almost caused an universal combustion; for the
greatest Monarchs of Christendom had a hand in the kindling, and in the
quenching thereof: and because for the knowledge of this, and of several
weighty successes which did from thence result, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to know
the condition and state of the Commonwealth of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> which was such
as made many Christian Princes to appear upon this occasion, I will for the
present leave the pursuit of this Narration, and will unfold somewhat briefly
of the Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa;</hi> which though it may seem superfluous to
the present Age, as being sufficiently known, will be both acceptable, and
necessary, for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Posterity.</p>

               </gap>en turned, (through the ambition and
blind unbridled desire of precedency in her own Citizens) to their own
prejudice, and to the prejudice of their Country; for being divided into
parties and facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and cruelly rent by intestine contention and strife, she
was forc'd to yield the Reins of Government, sometimes to the most powerful
Citizen, sometimes to some Forreign Potentate; but the prosperous and
unfortunate adventures of the ancient Commonwealth are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diversly
written both in her own Annals, and in those of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and they being
far from our purpose, I have not room to write them here: that which is
sufficient to know concerning the main busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which we are now about to
write, is, that since the Genoeses drove out the French, whereby they regained
their ancient Liberty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced their Commonwealth to the present form of
Government, (which was in the eight and twentieth year of the Age next before
this that we now are in) they have always kept strict and sincere union with
the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> insomuch as not any Italian Potentate hath shew'd
themselves more a Friend to the Spaniards then they: nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was there
ever known a conjunction between Princes of so unequal power and greatness,
which hath been preserved for the space of a hundred years, with mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e sincere faith, and more reciprocal
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: the Havens, Seas, Passages, and all other conveniences of the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ate of <hi>Genoa,</hi> were always
open to receive the Fleets, and to give passage or any other accommodation to
those of that Crown: whereas they were always shut up to any who might bring
prejudice to the Grandezza, Dignity and Security of the Spanish Dominions. The
King of <hi>Spain</hi> is permitted to keep a Squadron of Gallies in the Haven
at <hi>Genoa,</hi> for any sudden or urgent occasion that may arise: which
makes very much for the good of the affairs of that Crown, by reason of the
opportune situation of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which being seated between the Kingdoms
of <hi>Spain,</hi> and of those o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> and being also the Staple to the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> is very convenient for the uniting and preservation of
States, and Provinces divided so far one from another. On the other side, the
same friendship and good correspondency is a great security and help for the
Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e of <hi>Genoa,</hi> for the
singular care which those Kings are forced to have of her preservation, not
only by the tye of extraordinary Friendship, but out of private Interest, so as
the Commonwealth may with good reason suppose all the Forces and 
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:53250:137"/> Fleets of that Crown to be always ready to defend her,
against who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever shall plot any thing to the prejudice of her, or her
Liberty: he gave the beginning to this so neer conjunction, who being the first
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Commonwealths Liberty, deserves to be by her stiled the Father
and Free<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Country, and fellow Citizens. Prince <hi>Andrea
Doria,</hi> the best Captain in Sea affair of any in his time, and reputed the
best for Maritime Forces, and experience for Military Valour and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
success: wherein the compassion of his afflicted Countries misery prevailing
more with him, then the great offers, and afterwards the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the King of
<hi>France,</hi> forsaking not without great danger to his own Fortune, the
French offers, and stipends, he went over to serve the Emperour
<hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and hoping much in this new
conjunction, he betook himself with incredible courage and generosity to so
glorious an action: wherein being very fortunate, he proved not only an
unexpected safety to his Country, which driving out the French, he restored to
happy and miraculous liberty, but gave a great turn to all the affairs of
<hi>Italy;</hi> for the fortune of the French, which had then the upper hand,
and was almost victorious, began then to decline; and that of the Emperour
which was then at an ebb, began to be raised up; for the French mens losing the
State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> was immediately followed by their loss of the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they were almost fully possessed; and being by
<hi>Dorias</hi> resolution robbed of all their best and greatest Maritime
Forces, and by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the affairs of <hi>Genoa</hi> deprived of the
opportunity of being succoured by Sea, they fell upon sad incounters; and not
being able to hold out longer, were at last forced to abandon the enterprise to
the Imperialists; who getting to within the walls of <hi>Naples,</hi> the
French did not only badly defend the free possession of that Kingdom, but lost
all hopes of ever regaining it. The King of <hi>France</hi> his enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises
in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> had no better success both then
and afterwards: Where the conveniency of the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> being
afforded to the Emperour, and deny'd to the French, was of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for
the Emperours victory, and for the ruine of the French forces; insomuch as the
French being utterly ruined, and the Emperour supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to all, and able to
give the Law, he built up that grandezza of Fortune to himself, and posterity,
which he injoyed whilst he live<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>,
and which his descendents, the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> do at the present
injoy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doria</hi>'s name grew very glorious every where for such
egregious actions; and his Authority was very great in the Commonwealth of
<hi>Genoa</hi> for her re-gained Liberty; and his Power was no less great with
the Emperour, who esteeming it not only a great happiness to have so famous a
Commander under his pay, and of such valour and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in Naval Affairs,
but thinking him also a fit Instrument to make the City and State of
<hi>Genoa</hi> side with him (a thing of great impor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ance to his affairs) he studied still to keep him his
Friend, by conferring great Rewards upon him, and unusual Honours: He therefore
made him Lord High Admiral at Sea, and seldom dissented from his advice (which
he valued very much) in Land Enterprises. And as <hi>Doria</hi>'s power with
the Emperour rendred the liberty of the Genoe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es free from <pb n="260" facs="tcp:53250:138"/> being disturbed by so great an
Authority, as some of the free Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> were; so his authority
with his Fellow-Citizens was sufficient to keep the Genoeses constant in their
devotion to the Emperour; which was the more easily effected, for that the
affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> being divided into two Factions, the one adhering to
the French, the other to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, the prevalency of the latter was very
opportune and necessary to the Commonwealth, to preserve her from the evident
danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more opprest by the former, the French being the more
incens'd against the Genoeses for the great prejudice they had received by
their revolution. <hi>Doria</hi> out-lived the Emperour some few years, and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the same Employments and Honours under <hi>Philip</hi> the
Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Son to the Emperour, he was succeeded by
<hi>Iohn Andrea Doria,</hi> Heir not only to his Principality, States, and
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Fortune, but also to his Heroick Virtue and singular Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Countrey; who after having served the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> in places of
great Employment, and given good proof of his Valour and Counsel upon all
occasions, and having kept great sway with his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Citizens, was of no less
authority in the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> in so much as he was preferr'd by
<hi>Philip</hi> the Second in command at Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many Competitors and
famous Captains of Illustrious Families, and discharged the Office of Lord
High-Admiral with splendour and magnificence answerable to the authority: And
as he was a great help, and very serviceable to the keeping of the same
correspondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Commonwealth; so
was he a no little supporter of his Countreys Liberty in the jealous and
troublesome times which did sometimes happen; and as the former was honoured by
the publick Decree of the Commonwealth with the title of Father and Freer of
his Countrey, so was he by the like Decree honoured with the title of
Conservator of the Liberty thereof. After his death (for the chief Command at
Sea was reserved for the Princes of the Blood Royal) his third Son Don
<hi>Carlo Doria</hi> succeeded in the Government of those Gallies which the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> keeps in <hi>Genoa</hi> (for his eldest son being by
reason of his private indispositions unfit for Navigation; as also his second
son <hi>Giannettino</hi> by reason of his Priesthood, he being at the present a
Cardinal, Archbishop of <hi>Palermo,</hi> and Viceroy of <hi>Sicily.)</hi>
Which Don <hi>Carlo,</hi> as also Cardinal <hi>Giannettino,</hi> treading in
their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers steps, proved very advantagious in the service of that Crown
to their Countrey, and to themselves. At the same time almost that the supreme
Command at Sea ceased in the Dorian Family, new and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary worth arose
in the Family of the <hi>Spinolas,</hi> a House of great Alliance and Wealth in
the Commonwealth, whose worths fomented the same good correspondency. Marquess
<hi>Ambrosio Spinola,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Frederick,</hi> both of them
being young men and very rich, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating as well the glory and splendour as
the virtue and worth of the <hi>Dorii,</hi> and not knowing any more
Illustrious Theatre then the Wars made by the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> in the
Low-Countries against the Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and the United Provinces, for the
maintaining of Religion, and Regal Authority, they both of them offer'd to
enter upon that warfare upon their own expence; the youngest to serve with a
certain number of Gallies in the Flemish Ocean, and the eldest in Land-service
with a <pb n="261" facs="tcp:53250:138"/> great number of men. But <hi>Frederick</hi> being
slain in a Naval Battle, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the beginning of the War, could not arrive
at that height of Glory which the Marquess his Brother did in a few years; who
being a great Commander of Armies almost before he was a Souldier, and far
out-doing the expectation of men most exercised in Military Affairs, became in
a short time the best Commander of this present age; and having the
superintendency and absolute management of those Wars given him by the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> he did not only stop but suppress the Fortune of the Enemy,
which like an impetuous Torrent was like to drown the Kings Authority, and the
Catholick Religion in those parts: Moreover he carried the Spanish Forces into
<hi>Germany,</hi> where he did singular good service, took many entire
Provinces, and was (as hath been elsewhere sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d) a great help to the affairs of Religion, and of the then
tottering Empire: His counsel in civil matters was answerable to his Military
Valour; for which being admired and reverenced by all <hi>Europe,</hi> he bare
also a great sway in the important resolutions of the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi>
Thus the Fleets at Sea, Armies at Land, the most considerable Employments of
that Crown, having for the most part past through the hands of the Genoeses for
almost a whole Age, and these drawing over other of their Fellow-Subjects to
the Kings service, and using them in many useful and honourable Employments
apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their Governments, it necessarily followed, that so much
confidence being put by the King in the chiefest Subjects of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
and such Honours and Employments conferr'd upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers united the whole
Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> for ever firm to that Crown: Moreover, the
Squadron of the Kings Gallies which was kept in <hi>Genoa</hi> were generally
commanded by Genoese Captains, and served with Officers and Mariners of the
same Nation, who did not only maintain their houses and families by the Kings
pay, and by the great emoluments which they got by navigation, but did augment
their own fortunes.</p>
            <p>This Squadron of Galleys were therefore a great good to the King,
and to the Commonwealth; to the King, for that to boot with the conveniency of
that Haven, which was so fitting for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and for his
Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> it encreased the number of his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in
<hi>Genoa;</hi> for the Common-wealth, for besides the entertaining and
employment of so many of her Captains and Citizens, and to boot with the
advantage of Traffique and Treasure, it was of great use to train up her people
in maritime skill, which Art could not well have been preserved amongst them,
but upon this occasion; and those Galleys being commanded and managed by the
Genoeses, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth had conveniency to make use of them, as if they
had been her own, upon any occasion of her own safety and defence, without any
the least jealousie; for these being added to her own, made up al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most a
compleat Fleet, able to oppose the assaults of any enemy; but chiefly for that
this being one of the best Squadrons of Gallies the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi>
had, and being in the power of the Genoeses, it must needs be a good pledg of
the Kings good will to the Common-wealth: The Comme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Kingdoms of <hi>Spain, Naples, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> and the
Traffique <pb n="262" facs="tcp:53250:139"/> which is very great, in the State of
<hi>Millian,</hi> and in <hi>Flanders</hi> doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy great part of the
meaner sort of the City and State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who by natural
inclination, and by reason of the barrenness of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, are given to
Negotiation, both by Land and Sea: so as there are but very few, who for their
own peculiar concernments, are not very desirous of the prosperity of that
Crown. But the Contracts or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants of the richest and ablest Gentlemen of
the Commonwealth doth interest the Genoese Nation with the Crown of
<hi>Spain:</hi> the most famous and important contract, and of greater
concernment for the affairs of Crown then any other which we reade of, or have
heard.</p>
            <p>The King, to keep and maintain his Armies in <hi>Flanders,
Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> and for maintenance of his Fleet in the Ocean,
and in the Mediterranean, is forced to make many expeditions, and send
provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons sometimes to one part, sometimes to another: the Kings Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer
had not alwaies ready money; or, in case it had, moneys could not with safety
and speed be conveyed into those parts where they were to be serviceable, but
they must either be intercepted by the Enemy, or sunk at Sea, or come too late
to where they were destined, which would cause the ruine of the Kings
Enterprises and Armies: The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noese Merchants, by the great affluence of their
riches, credit, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondency, which they held in all parts of
<hi>Europe,</hi> did abundantly and beforehand supply what was necessary; so,
as in humane bodies the soul, and natural heat, send forth and supply all the
members with necessary nourishment; just so in the immense body of so great a
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the Pen of the Genoese, as the soul and vital spirit of the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Treasure, serves the King to convey ready moneys happily,
safely, and speedily, whithersoever it is needfull, with reciprocal profit and
conveniency; for the King by making his provisions in good time, and speedily,
secures his Enterprizes, wins honour to his Arms by victory, and defends his
Dominions; and the Genoeses get vast gain by the employment of their moneys,
whereby their private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes do exceed that of all other Nations; for which
advance of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys they are paid by the King in annual Revenues, out of the
States and Kingdoms belonging to the Crown, as well in <hi>Spain</hi> as in
<hi>Italy:</hi> therefore as this contract is necessary for the main affairs of
that King, it oblige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> him to have
a care of the Commonwealth; for without the preservation thereof, the contract
is impossible to be made good; and so great a stock of moneys of the Genoeses
being imploied in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms belonging to that Crown, serves the King as a
pledge of their good will. These are the Ties, these are the Bonds of
Friendship, and conjunction between the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and
Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa;</hi> which being confirm'd by process of time, and
by so many trials, grow daily stronger, not only for the interests, which
multiply continually, but for the trust and confidence which doth also multiply
by the course of years: the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the space of almost
one whole Age, have had trial of the good and sincere publick corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency,
and of the acceptable, and faithful service of the priva<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

got both in publick and private. On the other side, those <pb n="263" facs="tcp:53250:139"/> Kings having always born much respect towards the Commonwealth, and
having eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and good will towards them, as the neighbourhood and greatness of the Kings
Dominions, wherewith their are invironed, and the powerful Forces of that Crown
both by Land and Sea; (sufficient to bege<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

only no cause of fear nor terrour to her, but they by long experience began to
confide in them; and they served as a Bulwark and defence to the Commonwealth,
against all hostile violence. No foot of the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> was ever
seised on, no point of her jurisdiction injured, nor the least part of her
liberty; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Commonwealth, when she began to adhere to this Crown,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then newly got out of Forreign subjection, was faint hearted, weak in
Forces, rent with intestine discords, and both publick and private fortunes
were exhausted; by her regained liberty, and by this new contracted friendship,
she did not only recover her former spirit and health, but reassuming her
native colour, and being restored to her ancient splendour, appeared in publick
and in private as formerly; and whereas having been formerly molested,
sometimes by one, some times by another Potentate, and troubled by intestine
discord, she had much ado to preserve her self, but undergoing great storms was
sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many dangers; after the union and good correspondency with the
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> she was brought into a safe Haven, secure from
Domestick and Forreign tempests, she was respected by her neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Princes, honour'd by those that were further off, not molested by her rivals,
nor offended by any; and if at any time she hapned to be molested by any, she
was protected and defended by all the Forces of the said Crown, as if she had
been one of its Patrimonial Dominions.</p>
            <p>The Nobility of <hi>Genoa</hi> prosper'd no less in their private
affairs, then in the publick; some of them were honoured by that Crown with
great Honours and Imployments, others were favoured with Offices, Dignities,
and great Rewards: the City her self was embellished with stately Edifices,
which were not inferiour for Ornament or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence to those of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ny other private personages:
private houses were strangely beautified: none were like to them for Plate,
Jewels, nor Moveables, neither in quality nor quantity, for the fortunes of
private men, some amounted to the yearly rent of a hundred thousand Ducates,
many to half as much, and very many to less, but still very considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sums:
by which riches and splendor the Commonwealth being become very powerful, she
might justly be adjudged to be brought to a better condition, in all respects,
then ever she had formerly been; for though in pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> Ages, when she was wholly intent upon Maritime
Affairs, she was become very glorious for famous Victories, made by her
numerous powerful Fleets: yet the vivacity and refinedness of the Genoese
spirits being become fierce by continual use of Arms, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Forreign
Enemies, she could hardly keep from civil dissentions; the result whereof was
the ruine of Military knowledge, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Countries destruction: the
same vivacity and acuteness growing wanton by the continual peace of latter
times, and being refined in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil <pb n="264" facs="tcp:53250:140"/> Arts hath made them
study publick Government the more, and more desirous to preserve their Country
and Liberty, as the Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of all their good, and as the only stay and
foundation of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fortunes; and being hereby become so happy both in
publick and in private, she had no reason at the present to envy the condition
of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times: her Subjects were no less glorious then those of former times
in Military Affairs, and for what concerns the Gown and Civil Affairs,
undoubtedly, far beyond them: she had plenty of men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent for learning,
and for all kind of Erudition, very wise for State-Government; and (which is
seldom seen in so great affluence of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Riches and Authority) singular
for Religion, Piety, and Charity towards their Country: so as though in point
of greatness of State she may yield the upper hand to some of the modern
Commonwealths, yet can she not be thought inferiour for unanimity of mind, for
a solid and well regulated Government, nor for the love of Liberty: The
Legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of antient times, and those who in their Rules of Philosophy have
left excellent Precepts of Policy, always thought private riches, and excessive
power in private Citizens, to be the corrupters of mens minds; wherefore as if
it were a Plague or pestiferous Venome in a well regulated Commonwealth, they
did so abhor it, as <hi>Licurgus,</hi> the wise composer of the Spartan
Commonwealth, not being content with an equality of Land amongst the Citizens
of his Commonwealth, he would not permit them the use of Silver or Gold. In
process of time, the same Spartans did of their own free will yield up the
command of Maritime Fleets, which the Confederate Cities of <hi>Greece</hi> did
maintain in common, to the Athenians, for fear lest their Citizens, being
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to so great a command, might become contumacious to the Orders of
the County, and might some time or other have some Plots upon the publick
Liberty; therefore they provided against too great power and authority in their
Citizens, by the Law of Ostracism; and how much did the Agrarian Law trouble
the Commonwealth of <hi>Rome.</hi> It is too clear and manifest, how the Roman
Liberty was at l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>st overthrown,
first by the too extraordinary power of <hi>Marius</hi> and <hi>Sylla,</hi> and
afterwards by the like of <hi>Caesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey:</hi> some of the
modern Commonwealths, out of the same respects, give the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in chief of
their Land Armies only to Forreigners, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Government at Sea,
which they cannot take from their Citizens, they confide it in them so allaied
as they cannot exercise it within a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles of the City: nor is it
permitted to their Citizens to receive Pensions, or take imployments or
dignities from other Princes, nor yet to purchase esta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

dependency upon that Prince may prove prejudicial to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. The
Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> by a singular and happy example, which doth
confound both the precepts of the ancient and the institutions of modern
Commonwealths, doth not only sustain her

means of her Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens great power recovers sometimes her lost liberty,
sometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves it, and becomes considerable to Forreign Nations, and to
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Potentates. The Citizens of this Commonwealth treat with 
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:53250:140"/> the greatest Monarchs of Christendom; they get Revenues
in Forreign Countries; they are admitted into administration of the King of
<hi>Spains<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Treasure; they receive Pensions, Titles and Dignities
from his Crown, they receive the chief Government of his Kingdoms and States,
the prime jurisdiction over his Fleets at Sea, the absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over his
Land Armies, they are admitted into, and chosen to be Counsellors of his Privy
Council; and yet so many, and so great Dignities, Titles, Imployments, Offices
and Preeminences, do not at all prejudicate or weaken the Principality of their
common Country, but do rather strengthen it: The occasion of so many miraculous
effects may be attributed to the union and good Government of the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth: which keeping her Forts, Garrisons, and the whole ground-works
of the State in her own hands, by the favour of her people; who are more
inclined to live free then any others, and by the leaning-stock or support of
her Nobility, (which being bound up, and united in one body, doth much exceed
the grandezza of any one pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Citizen, and is sufficient to suppress any
whatsoever force, and to curb any intention which shall be contrary to the
present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment), it may be attributed to the good opinion of the Kings of
<hi>Spain,</hi> who being, on the one side, certain that they may have any
thing of the Commonwealth, in the condition she now is in, which they can
desire at her hands, always provided her liberty be preserved; and on the other
side, apprehensive of the strange consequences which might result from the turn
of Affairs, they have reason to abhor all novelty, or alteration of Government.
But it may chiefly be attributed to the private Citizens ardent desire of
liberty, who being taught by the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of former times, that the
Principality of one alone is unsuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to a people that are born free, and
how dangerous it is for him who shall arrive thereat; and being made to know by
their present hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, how pleasant, useful and glorious a thing, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>etters of their liberty, which
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shadow of friendship and equal confederacy, was the base and servile
slavery of the Spanish Empire. King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of
<hi>France,</hi> whom the French after his death honour'd with the Cogno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of
Great, having bent his thoughts, in his latter years, upon quel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the
Grandezza of the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi>
fix'd his eyes first upon the Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> intending to make
his first blow at her, as at one of the corner-stones of so great a Monarchy,
with firm resolution to cut that knot in pieces with the sword, since he saw it
impossible to be loosened otherwise: but this design falling by the sudden
fatal death of the said King, the image thereof remain'd imprinted in his
successors, who thinking that the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> was become more then
Spanish by this undissolvable knot, and that it made too much against the
common ends and designs, did not only abhor the name of a Genoese, but began to
betake themselves against the Commonwealth: thinking that when she should be
abased, the Spanish Empire should receive a shrew'd blow; and that taking their
rise so high, the success must needs be good; for they made their account, that
when they should have possess'd themselves of the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the
State of <hi>Millain</hi> being shut up on that side, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from
succour by Sea, would be the sooner taken by Land Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and that the
Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> being so far distant from

               </gap>ing unable to make provisions for Armies, they held for certain
that the chief sinews of the Spanish Empire being thus cut in pieces, the
affairs of that Crown would give against such encounters as would make way for
much further proceedings: they therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to bend all their
endeavours, to plot any thing, and to use all force against the State of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> as against that which did chiefly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the ends and
interests of the common cause: no provision was had for this by the last League
of <hi>Avignon:</hi> but the enmity which not long after arose between the
Commonwealth and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> touching the Marquisate
<hi>Zuccharello,</hi> much fomented these their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations; which enmity
daily increasing, a great combustion brake forth

               </gap>rom a little sparke. The Duke was
not inclin'd at first to make war with the Genoeses upon this account, for
though he was senfible enough of their resistance, and appeared to be already
much in that resentment, yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>reaty of Marriage between Prince <hi>Philiberto</hi> and the
Princess of <hi>Mantua</hi> detained him, and forced him to swallow down any
thing, out of a desire of getting more pretences to <hi>Montferrat</hi> by this
Match, and to reunite himself to the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> for to break with
the Genoeses did diametrically oppugne both these ends, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ch his mind was then chiefly set upon; for there was no
doubt, but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would interest himself with the Genoeses:
wherefore forbearing rigorous proceedings, and falling upon a more moderate
way, he tried to get out of this trouble by some fair means; he endeavour'd to
get the Spanish Agents to delay the assigning over of <hi>Zuccharello</hi> for
a while, upon agreement that he would plead the utmost of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences 
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:53250:141"/> within a few days in the Cesarian Court; and that if he
did not then obtain his intent, it should be lawful for the Commonwealth to
injoy this their new purchase without any disturbance. The Spanish Agents who
were to manage this matrimony, and the reconciling of the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> were desirous to please him, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths delay
should be granted him; lest the purchase of that little Castle might not only
be a hindrance to that which was in Treaty, but might occasion new rumours, and
noise of wars in <hi>Italy,</hi> to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the publick peace:
wherefore means being used with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, to forbear, they also under
hand delaied the assignation of <hi>Zuccharello;</hi> &amp; some Propositions
of accommodation were with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi>
offer'd to the Embassadors, who were then in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to pay
their wonted obedience to the new Pope; by which the controverted Fee should be
delivered to ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ther of the
parties, but should be invested in some third person, who might be a friend to
the other two; insinuating Don <hi>Carlo Barbarino,</hi> the Popes Brother: but
all was in vain, for the Commonwealth fearing that the Dukes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er would at
last prevail over what was right, and fearing that they might prejudice the
King of <hi>Spains</hi> reputation, if they should put over the business to the
Arbitrement of any other Princes; or else thinking that to yield to any thing
would seem that they were afraid of the Dukes threats, persevered constantly
not to put that to the Arbitrement of another, which was undoubtedly theirs,
and which they had law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully purchas'd from the Imperial Chamber: so as being
resolved to keep it just as they had bought it of the Emperour, they complain'd
of the delay made by the Governour of <hi>Millain:</hi> but at last, all
difficulties being ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the Commonwealth being possess'd of the Fee, the Duke was necessitated to think
of resentment: where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n he found
himself much ingaged both by the Letter which he had written, and by the
Commonwealths refusal: the way for his resentment was made more free by Prince
<hi>Phileberto</hi>'s death, which hapned at this time in <hi>Palermo,</hi>
that City being visited with a sore Contagion: which did not only put an end to
the Treaty of Marriage, but cut off all hope of ever piecing it up again; for
though he left two brothers unmarried, yet since the same parts, nor
circumstances, did not concur in them, it was impossible to continue it;
neither of them being acceptable at the Spanish Court, they having openly
declared themselves for the French party; and moreover, the Cardinal had
appeared openly an enemy to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> almost upon all
occasions. A petty accident did also more irritate the Duke, which had he not

Castles which they had been long at Law for; but more of late, for favours
privately administred to the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> in the War of

Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour with the Duke, the Venetian Embassadour, and some other
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours of the Confederate Princes: Here the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
after having made grievous complaints against the Genoeses, for injuries which
he pretended to have received from them, proposed it, as the better and more
secure course, to turn their Common Arms against the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
before they should fall upon the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> as was agreed on at
the League of <hi>Avignon:</hi> He said the victory would be the more easie and
certain by reason of the weakness of the chief City, and of the other Towns in
that State, by reason that that Common-wealth was totally unprovided of
forreign Forces, and that she could make but little use of her Natives, they
being imbased by long peace; that he himself had many friends, and many that
would side with him, in that City, and in that State, who being desirous of
innovations would be a great help to the Enterprise: He represented, that when
that Common wealth should be subdued the Contract would be at an end, whence
many inconveniences would result to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and, in
particular, that the Siege of <hi>Breda,</hi> which was under the eyes of all
the Confederates, upon the fail of moneys would undoubtedly be raised; but he
chiefly endeavoured to inform them, that when the <hi>Valtoline</hi> should be
taken, which was to be assaulted in the first place by their common Arms,
though thereby the State of <hi>Millain</hi> would be kept from relie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e by <hi>Germany,</hi> yet the way by
Sea being open, it might be succoured from <hi>Spain, Naples,</hi> and
<hi>Sicily;</hi> whereas when <hi>Genoa</hi> should be taken, and the River
thereof, the State of <hi>Millain</hi> being block'd up on all sides, and
debarred succour, would become an easie and secure prey to their common
Forces.</p>
            <p>These reasons of the Dukes being the more efficacious, because the
rest saw, that unless they would give way thereunto he would not joyn with them
in their League, they did not only approve of his opinion, 
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:53250:142"/> but contrary to what was agreed upon at
<hi>Avignon,</hi> they promised to joyn their Forces with his, to the
suppressing of <hi>Genoa;</hi> and that the Fleet of <hi>Marselles,</hi> and of
<hi>England,</hi> which were destin'd to go against <hi>Spain,</hi> should
assist the enterprise of <hi>Genoa,</hi> not only with Arms, but with abundance
of Victuals, Ammunition and Men: they were said moreover, to divide the
Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> thus amongst them, that the City of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and all her River as far as <hi>Savona,</hi> should belong to
the King of <hi>France;</hi> that <hi>Savona,</hi> and the rest of the River
till you come to <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> should fall to the Dukes share: that
the number of the French should be between ten and twelve thousand Foot, and
1000 Horse, and on the Dukes side 15000 Foot, and 200 Horse, and sufficient
provisions of Victuals, Ammunition and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery: the Venetian Embassadour did
not joyn in this enterprise against <hi>Genoa;</hi> for that it not being
comprehended in the League of <hi>Avignon,</hi> he said he could not consent to
this new enterprise, without new Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from his Commonwealth: but time being
given him to write to <hi>Venice,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d to receive resolution from thence, he received Orders to
conclude, in conformity to what was agreed upon by the French and by the
Duke.</p>
            <p>This new League being made, or reformed, in satisfaction to the
Duke, they proceeded therein with as much privacy as was possible, left if it
should be known, those against whom they were chiefly inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded should take up
Arms: the French professed openly that they would submit to the Popes
resolution for what concern'd, the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and that the

more occasion of distrust: no less shews ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd on the Venetians behalf, in

<hi>Genoa</hi> fell down already from the Alpes into <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and the

sollicitous the Confederates were in their proceedings and preparations, the
State of <hi>Millain</hi> was the more remiss in theirs, which was at this time
almost wholly unprovided and unarmed; for the King not being contented to have
appeased the minds of the discontented Princes by depositing the Forts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to satisfie them, and to remove all jealousies from them of being infested, and
consequently to take away all occasions of new troubles, he had ordered the
Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> to send all the men he could into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and
he to obey him had sent 6000 Foot, and 800 Horse thither, a few moneths before
the Diet at <hi>Susa;</hi> and had moreover sent Cavalier <hi>Pecchio</hi>'s

afterwards, that this his shewing himself to be inclined to peace was not able
to withhold the Counsels and Resolves of the League, but that it did rather
hasten the execution thereof, he advertised the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
thereof, desiring orders and provisions to prepare against the insuing storm.
This advertisement, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd from other parts, was not credited in
that Court<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he and Don <hi>Sanchio de Monry,</hi> Marquess of

thought it dangerous to bring the Kings Auxiliary Forces into her Dominions,

what she was to make, seeming as if she needed no succour: by which the Court
of <hi>Spain</hi> argued, that the Agents in <hi>Italy</hi> did amplifie the

he could get no <pb n="271" facs="tcp:53250:143"/> more from <hi>Naples</hi> save one only
Brigade, and some Troops of Horse; for the Viceroy hearing of the English
Fleet; would not unfurnish the Kingdom of many men; and casting it up that
these men being num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred into the usual Garrison of the State, they would not
amount to 16000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, he knew they would not be sufficient to
defend the State, and to succour <hi>Genoa</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> if
(as it was feared) they should be assaulted all at once: he therefore betook
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to think upon Forreign Forces; and since he saw he could hope for none
from <hi>Spain,</hi> by reason of the Courts great aversion thereunto; and for
that the Fleet which was gone to recover <hi>Brasile</hi> had carried away
10000 men from those Kingdoms; and that Marquess <hi>Spinola,</hi> who was
imploied before <hi>Breda,</hi> did rather want then abound in men; and that
for the aforesaid respects he could not ground much upon the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples;</hi> he betook himself to <hi>Germany,</hi> where without expecting
any order from the King, he gave out Commissions for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great levies of
Germans. Besides, because he could not expect provisions of moneys from
<hi>Spain,</hi> and that the State of <hi>Millain</hi> was so exhausted as it
could not furnish him with any, he applied himself to the Genoeses: nor was his
application in vain; for some of the richest Gentlemen of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and
who did most study the interests of that Crown, seeing how much the welfare of
the Commonwealth was concern'd in the preservation of the State of

three and four hundred thousand Ducates, by which he was inabled to disburse
the first payments, and to raise four Dutch Regiments, consisting of 4000 Foot
apiece: he believed that the Confederates intended their first blow against the

were guarded by the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticks, and that the Kings Forces would never
commit any hostility against the Ensigns of the holy Chuch, did not apprehend
the fears which were thought to be very remote, and idle; and therefore being
unwilling to beget diffidence and distrust in either of the Kings, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the succours which were offer'd were superfluous and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, lest they
might draw humours to that wound which they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to heal by succours;
for he said it was probable that the French would take pretence to assault the
Forts of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> from the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring of the Spanish succours
thereinto, and would turn those Forces against them which they profess'd were
intended elsewhere; and that they would assault them, not as deposited in the
Popes hands, but as assigned over by him, contrary to the agreement of the
Deposition, to the Spaniards; so as esteeming the remedy a mischief, he thought
the Articles of the Depositure, and the Majesty of the Popes name, and Ensigns,
to be a surer defence, and a fitter means to remove new occasions of war, then
the Auxiliary Arms of that Crown: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did so far persist in his
constant refusal, as the many and pregnant evidences which were laid before him
by the Spanish Agents, that the French preparations were intended against the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> were always by him repuls'd as imaginary jealousies, vain
rumours, and as sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>le Spanish
inventions.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Pope carry himself in these and in other Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
which not long after happened against the State of <hi>Genoa;</hi> for a great
many Souldiers being already pass'd from <hi>France</hi> into
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> where the Constable was already arrived, and the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king also great preparations for war out of his immense
hatred against the Genoeses, the Commonwealth had recourse to the Pope, that he
would intercede with the Duke, and that he would assist them with some men in
this so great, and so neer at hand danger; but all these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and
applications were to no purpose; for the Pope constant to his resolution of
Neutrality would not grant her any succour; only, to shew himself desirous of
her preservation, he proposed a League be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the great Duke for the
defence of the States in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon: which Proposition the Genoeses took to be
either a kind of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable denial of their request, or an endeavouring to
separate the Commonwealth from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the prejudice of
that conjunction which, if ever at any time, was now necessary for them, and
from whence they might promise themselves more potent, certain and undoubted
aid, then from any other Prince or Potentate; and thereby to draw her
insensibly into a League with the contrary parties which were chiefly ill
minded towards her; for there being but little corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency then between the
Pope and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and (on the contrary) much distrust, the
Commonwealth could not joyn in League with o her Princes, and particularly with
the Pope, without offending the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and without injurying
the good will, correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and the weighty interests of the common
affairs; nor could she, without danger to her self, separate her self from the
union of that Crown which she had found to be so certain for the space of so
many years, so advantagious, honourable and faithful; which Crown (were 
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:53250:144"/> it only for the necessity of her own interests,) was
forced to sustain her with all her power; so to cast her self into the arms of
the Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Princes, who so vehemently conspired her ruine; and yet the
Commonwealth, trying the Pope, as it were, with the like cunning, answered,
that they would willingly accept of the Confederacy, if the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> were therein comprehended: which the Pope not giving way unto
(for it would be an apparent parting from his profess'd neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and a
drawing the enmity of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and of the other
Confederates, upon him) the Commonwealth was therefore not to hope for any
assistance from the Pope; for 1000 Foot being at the same time desired of him
by the Commonwealth, and by the great Duke, who had but little need thereof, he
granted them to the great Duke, and denied them to the Commonwealth, then whom
none could have greater need thereof; and he denied them also those Corsicks
which were granted to the Pope for the service of the Apostolick See, in the
time of peace. But for all this the Genoeses wanted not Forces to sustain and
defend themselves; for having always doubted that the clouds of <hi>Susa</hi>
would discharge themselves in a great tempest upon them, they had not been
sparing, nor negligent in making provisions against it: they sent into
<hi>Germany</hi> for two levies of Dutch, the one of 2000, the other of 3000
Foot: they took order for 30 Companies, to consist of 200 Foot apiece to be
raised by the richest and chiefest Gentlemen: they sent for 600 Foot from
<hi>Corsica,</hi> they brought in the Prince of <hi>Bozolo,</hi> with 800 Foot,
and 200 Horse; Prince <hi>Doria</hi> raised 400 more at his own particular
charge; and finally, they had many Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and other Citizens, who
assisted the Commonwealth with men paid by themselves, and with ready moneys:
these Forces being put together, and added to those of the preceding year, and
being secured by the choice Militia of the State, they thought they needed not
fear the Enemies assaults; for though all the aforesaid preparations could not
be in a readiness at the appearing of the Enemy, yet they would have a strength
of between eight and ten thousand Foot and 200 Horse, in the State, all of them
being paid; besides as many more of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Militia; and the State of
<hi>Genoa</hi> being begirt by the <hi>Apenine</hi> toward <hi>Piedmont</hi>
and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> the Enemy must either enter in a gross body, or by small
numbers; if in a gross body, the strength of situati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the sterility of the
Country, the difficulty in bringing Victuals, and other impediments, did secure
them from the progress of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; it being impossible for great Armies to
continue long in that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise without much Victuals; if in small numbers,
the Army of the Commonwealth being assisted by the same difficulties, and being
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated by the Country, would be sufficient for defence: to this was
added, that howsoever the Enemies Army entred the Mountains, they must needs
leave the State of <hi>Millain</hi> on their backs; wherein though there was
not very great Force; at the present, yet the few that were there, and the
ordinary Militia of so great a State, was, doubtlesly, sufficient to shut up
the passes, so as neither Victuals, nor provisions could be brought them; and
having them behind, they might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed between them and the Forces of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> on their Front, which might occasion them many troubles and
dangers, and be such a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance <pb n="274" facs="tcp:53250:145"/> to them as they could
not long continue in oppugning the City: but when the Forces should be
augmented in that State, according to the orders that were given, and
provisions that were ordered: the ruine of the Confederates Army did plainly
appear, since it would be shut up between barren Mountains, and the Sea,
without Victuals, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, or hope of succour: they must therefore of
necessity be very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect in their proceedings, in engaging themselves far
within the Ligu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ian Mountains,
having considerable Forces on their Front, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not safe behind, and exposed
to the assaults of a powerful Enemy: especially since the Commonwealth, besides
ten Gallies of her own which she had then at Sea, being to receive all the King
of <hi>Spains</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies for her defence, together with the succour of men,
which were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready preparing in <hi>Naples,</hi> and in <hi>Sicily,</hi> the
Enemy could hardly be relieved by Sea; and yet the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and
the Constable, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring vain and uncertain supposals before so solid and
undeniable ground-works, doubted not to enter couragiously upon the business;
for making account that the English Fleet, and that of <hi>Marcelles,</hi>
should appear strong and powerful in the Ligustick Sea at the same time that
their Land Army should draw neer the Sea, and that being to be much more in
number and Forces, then the Gallies of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> they
thought they would not only be able to keep those Gallies from them, but supply
their Army with abundance of Victuals and Ammunition which they should bring
along with them; so as not only the danger of Famine, and the difficulty of
bringing Victuals to the Land Army ceased, but the expence thereof: they
thought themselves sufficiently safe from being disturbed by the
<hi>Millain</hi> Forces, by the union and good correspondency which continued
still between the two Crowns; the which they firmly believed their proceeding
against <hi>Genoa</hi> would no way oppugne, since that State was not directly
comprehended under the Territories of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> nor could
they perswade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves that the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> should move,
for fear of being the author of the breach, or that he would commit any hostile
act against that Army, in which together with the Ensigns Royal of
<hi>France,</hi> which he saw therein displaied, the Lord high Constable of
that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom did wage war in person; and the State of <hi>Millain</hi> being
then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most unarmed, and unprovided of any manner of warlike provision; having
the French in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and upon the Confines of <hi>Como,</hi>
and the Venetians armed upon the Cremonesian Confines, they thought their
moving would be rather desired, then dreaded, on that part; since their Army in
all warlike reason was to be superiour, as they were much superiour in numbers
of fighting men, and in valiant and experienced Commanders; for which cause it
was likewise probable, that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour finding himself in such a multitude
of business, with but a few men, and those ill ordered, he would not dare to
meddle with a fresh, gallant and impetuous Army, led on by two of the most
famous Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of the present Age.</p>
            <p>And to the end that new levies of Dutch might not pass into the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> held Treaties with the
Swissers, that they should keep their Passes shut, till such time as the
enterprise of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa</hi> should either be perfected, or brought neer
perfection; and of so <pb n="275" facs="tcp:53250:145"/> great authority were the
Confederates, especially the French, at that time, with that Nation, as all the
Cantons, the Catholick Cantons being comprehended, which are united to the
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and confederate with the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
suffer'd the French to pass armed thorow their Country, and in order, contrary
to their ancient customs and institutions, and which had never upon any
occasion been violated, of not allowing passage to Forreigners, unless either
unarmed, or few at once; and this for nothing else but out of their great
desire of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving their liberty: nor did it seem that so unaccustomed a
thing did proceed from ought else but from their firm opinion, that the
Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates preparations would devour the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> which
they saw was wholly unprovided of defence; so as if they adored the French as
Victors, they durst not anger them. Thus the Duke and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, taking it
for granted that they were sure of the State of <hi>Millain</hi> by going to
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and being abundantly provided of all things by the Fleets at
Sea, they thought nothing could obviate their Victory, save the defence which
would be made by the Genoeses, who they thought would be able to do very
little, being streightned at Sea, and assaulted by Land: they confided not so
much in the valour of their own men, as in the weakness of the Enemy, and of
their Discipline: they, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, grounded their hopes of Victory upon the
Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> assur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Constable, that for certain he held very
much intelligence in that City, by means whereof, as soon as they should come
before the Walls, confusion and disorder would fall out amongst the disagreeing
Citizens, so as, undoubtedly, the Gates of the City would be thrown open, and
they should be let in into the City; and when they should have taken
<hi>Genoa,</hi> they supposed the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> being inclosed by
their Forces, would soon submit to their discretion: upon such sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posals, and
such foundations, which their hope of Victory, and desire of revenge made
appear easie unto them, (but which in reason were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uncertain, and which
the success was likely to gainsay,) they resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to commence the enterprise:
they began first in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> about the end of <hi>November;</hi>
the Marquess of <hi>Coure</hi> who had 8000 Foot with him, and 600 Horse, all
well in order, thought it no longer time to delay executing their designs:
discovering himself therefore, of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Embassadour, to be become a
Commander in Arms under the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Confederate
Princes, he past from amongst the Swiffers into the Grisons Country, and
suddenly took <hi>lo Staico,</hi> a chief and important pass, by which you come
from <hi>Tirvolo</hi> into <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia;</hi> and having afterwards taken the
City of <hi>Coira</hi> he went to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations of the <hi>Diritture,</hi>
who having driven out the Archdukes Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers had reassumed their liberty:
having restored the Grisons to their former ancient condition, and driven the
Bishop of <hi>Coira</hi> from his seat, he fell down with his men into the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> about the end of <hi>December,</hi> in the year 1624, and
totally laying aside the Protestations and Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made a little before
by himself, and by the other French Agents, that all due respects should be
born to the Ensigns, and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons of the holy Church, he fell upon the Forts
of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which were guarded by the Forces of the Church:
those of the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> when they saw the Enemy approach, applied
themselves to the <pb n="276" facs="tcp:53250:146"/> Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> and to
<hi>Bagni,</hi> desiring the first that he would send in some Spanish succour,
and the other, that he would receive them; without which they saw it was
impossible for them to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: whereupon the Governour, who had
sent many men already into <hi>Comasco</hi> under <hi>Ioh. Ieronymo
Pimontello,</hi> to make head there, and to defend the State against any
hostility, sent again to offer those suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to <hi>Bagni,</hi> who when he
saw the danger so neer, would not not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding accept thereof, building, as
he profess'd, upon <hi>Coure</hi>'s word; for when he saw him pass armed from
the Swissers to amongst the Grisons, he sent his Secretary unto him, to know
his intention: answer was made, that by the orders he received from the King,
he was to bear all respect to the Apostolick See, and that he would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
it: wherefore <hi>Bagni</hi> would not draw upon him the insulting French, by
receiving succour from <hi>Millain,</hi> in which abuse he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued so long,
at least seemed to continue, as when he afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired those succours, it
was too late to receive them; for the Count entring the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> by
the Pass of <hi>Ploschiavo,</hi> did at the very first take
<hi>Piattamala,</hi> a Castle defended by some few Forces of the Church, and by
them forsaken at the very first appearance of the French. Then drawing neer
<hi>Tiranno,</hi> not above a mile distant from <hi>Piattamala,</hi> he threw a
Bridge over the <hi>Adda,</hi> by which passing those men over he kept three
days idle beyond the River, expecting that the Horse which were sent with 1500
Foot, a little lower, to take the place called <hi>Tiglie</hi> and <hi>Pontc di
San Pietro,</hi> (by which way only succour might be brought from
<hi>Millain)</hi> should have made themselves masters of those places:
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards absolutely denying that he had given his word to <hi>Bagni</hi> not
to prejudice him, he assaulted the Town of <hi>Tiranno</hi> on two sides,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Bagni</hi> was with 600 of his men; and whereinto Cavalier
<hi>Robustelli</hi> was entred a little before with 800 of those of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> people of the Train bands who were but little exercised in
Arms. <hi>Coure</hi> had but one small piece of Artillery with him, which being
level'd against that part of the Wall where the Valtolinians were, had hardly
made one shot, when the Valtolinians were so terrified, as throwing down their
Arms they abandoned the place; and <hi>Robustelli</hi> not being able to make
them stand to their Arms, they retreated into the Castle, which was more
defensible; whereinto <hi>Bagni</hi> being also retired, those of the Town,
see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ng themselves abandoned by
their Chieftains, surrendred upon Articles, and incontinently the Venetians who
were at <hi>la Veletta,</hi> which stood upon the Mountains that divide the
<hi>Valcamonica</hi> from the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> fell down with their
Artillery, Ammunition, and all things belonging to war; and placing their
Battery against the Castle, <hi>Bagni</hi> articled to go with all his
Souldiers out of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> without entring into any of the Forts.
<hi>Coure,</hi> when he had taken the Castle, went to <hi>Bornilo,</hi>
accompanied by the Venetians, and by their Artillery; and having easily taken
it turn'd backwards, and took the other Forts, and the Towns of
<hi>Sondrio</hi> and <hi>Morbegno,</hi> towards the State of <hi>Millain;</hi>
whereby the <hi>Valtoline</hi> was wholly in the possession of the French.
<hi>Bagni,</hi> when he saw <hi>Coure</hi> so neer, had sent to demand those
succours from <hi>Feria</hi> which a little before he had refused, who gave
order forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to <hi>Pimontello</hi> to send 1500 of his best Foot, and a
Troop of Horse, <pb n="277" facs="tcp:53250:146"/> under Count <hi>Iohn Serbellone;</hi>
and they being come to St. <hi>Pietro,</hi> at the same time that the Castle of
<hi>Tiranno</hi> was surrendred, seeing it possess'd by the French, who we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e fortifying the opposite Bank, they
past no further on, but return'd back to the State of <hi>Millain, Feria</hi>
feared that the French would not be satisfied with getting the
<hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line;</hi> but that being back'd by the Venetians, by whom they were

               </gap>lly furnish'd with
Moneys, Munition, and continual recruits of men, they would assault the State
of <hi>Millain;</hi> and that the Venetians would do the like, according to the
Conventions of the League at <hi>Avignon</hi> to <hi>Crema,</hi> and
<hi>Giaradadda,</hi> as soon as the French should have given the first assaults
on their side, or at least, when having taken any Town they should have got
footing; wherefore being troubled at the imminent danger, he found out a means
whereby keeping the French from invading the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> the
Venetians should also be forced to forbear. <hi>La Riva di Chiavenna,</hi>
being taken at the first commotions from the Grisons, as it was a hindrance to
keep them from entring the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> so it being now in the power of
the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticks, he thought that if he should take it, it would be a mighty
stop, to keep the Enemy from assaulting the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> he
plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with <hi>Iohn Francisco Sacchetti,</hi> the Popes Commissary-General
in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> who was then in <hi>Millain,</hi> to re-inforce the
Garrison of <hi>Riva</hi> with a thousand Foot, which (if he would give way
thereunto,) he would send thither: <hi>Sacchetti</hi> consented, as either not
knowing the importance of the place, or thinking it too hard to deny so small a
mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in such a precipice of affairs: so as 1000 Foot entring, they
re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced that place both with Fortifications and Garrison: <hi>La Riva</hi>
is nothing but an Inn, to which is joyned a little Haven, where the
Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, which go and come from <hi>Germany</hi> into the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> do lade and unlade; it stands upon the top of the upper Lake,
which, as being lesser, is called <hi>Agheto;</hi> and joyns by a strait
channel to the lower Lake, just as the head is joyn'd to the breast of the
body, by the neck: the situation of <hi>La Riva</hi> is very narrow between the
Lake and the Mountains, which drawing neer the waters in this place leaves a
little margine which serves for a shore: a certain little Mountain stands over
<hi>la Riva,</hi> over which many high Mountains stand. This place is of such
consequence, as whosoever will pass from the <hi>Valtoline</hi> into the State
of <hi>Millain</hi> with Armies and Artillery, must either go full upon Fort
<hi>Fuentes,</hi> which is upon the left side of the <hi>Adda,</hi> where she
falls into the Lake, or go about by the River of the Lake, and pass over to the
shore opposite to the Fort, and go from thence into the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> and therefore, as Fort <hi>Fuentes</hi> is too hard an
encounter for those that will fall down by that way, and assault that State, so
to go about by the Rivers of the Lake is impossible, if <hi>la Riva</hi> which
is in the midst there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of be fortified: the Governour got leave to have it in
his hands, and to fortifie it strongly, and munite it with men, to oppose it as
a fence against the Torrent of the French Forces: nor was his Counsel there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
bad; for <hi>Coure</hi> having possess'd himself of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> as
he would go to the recovery of <hi>Chiavenna</hi> by the River of the Lake, and
when he should have taken it, would have saln down with his Army into the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> he saw his design prevented by <hi>Feria</hi>'s
dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: <pb n="278" facs="tcp:53250:147"/> so as being forced to change his way, he
turn'd back again by the same craggy Rhetian Mountains, by which he came into
the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline,</hi> and was necessitated to take a long and troublesome
compass about, by the Vale of <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> but without any incumbrances
or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery; which because he was not able to bring thorow those Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
he was fain to leave in the <hi>Valtoline. Chiavenna</hi> made some
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, but not being able to hold out, yielded, as did the rest, to the
French; and <hi>Coure</hi> finding that it would be impossible to pass by
thence into the State of <hi>Millain</hi> without Artillery, knew he must
neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily first expugne <hi>la Riva:</hi> the which was the only deposited
Fort that remained untaken; leaving therefore some of his men in
<hi>Chiavenna,</hi> he returned with the rest into the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> by
the same craggy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains by which he was come. The Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> on
the other side, commanded <hi>Serbellone,</hi> that to boot with the thousand
Foot which were already entred, he should enter <hi>la Riva</hi> with 2000 more
Foot, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come thither made many Fortifications, as well upon the Plain
of the Mountain, as upon the Passes towards <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> and towards the
way that leads from the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and moreover, that he might keep
the Enemy from passing over with Barques into the opposite part of the Lake, he
munited all the Passes which were on the other side of the River of the Lake
and of the Channel, that were fit for landing, to the end, that <hi>Coure</hi>
might not effect that by Water which he could never do by Land, as long as
<hi>la Riva</hi> held out: so as that very Inn was able to put a stop unto the
vast designs of the French, and the other Confederates, who when they should
have taken it, thought to have done great matters in <hi>Italy:</hi> Thus
<hi>la Riva</hi> only excepted, all the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> together with the
Counties of <hi>Bormio</hi> and <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> which by joynt consent of
both the Crowns were deposited into the Popes hands, were taken by the French
and Venetians, more by cunning and dissembling then by open force. The Duke of
<hi>Feria,</hi> as he could not meddle in the defence before the taking of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Pope, so professing that the
business did not belong unto his King after the depositure, would not go to the
recovery thereof without new orders; but being content to keep <hi>la
Riva,</hi> expected new directions from the Court; and the Court unwilling to
come upon this occasion to a breach with <hi>France,</hi> had recourse to the
Pope, laying all the burthen of this affair upon him, and pretending the
observance of agreement from him, desired him that he would endeavour the
restoring of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and offer'd to assist him therein, if he
from whose hands the <hi>Valtoline</hi> was taken would use his own name for
the recovery thereof.</p>
            <p>The Pope, abhorring to break with <hi>France,</hi> no less then
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and thinking that the Spaniards would lay all the
burthen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his shoulders, examin'd this business otherwise: he considered
how unworthy a thing it would be, for the Pontifical Office to become the
Author and Promoter of Discord and Wars between two Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom, as
Sons of the holy Church, he was bound to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour peace and union: he
considered that the ambition of some of the Spanish Agents, contrary to the
safety of the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> had given just occasion for the
present commotions, wherin he neither out of <pb n="279" facs="tcp:53250:147"/> right nor
justice, nor State-interest, ought to favour them; that pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly the King of
<hi>France</hi> might have no hand in <hi>Coure</hi>'s actions, or that if he
had, his aim might only be to suppress the Spanish ends, and to secure the
common affairs of <hi>Italy:</hi> that therefore it was necessary first to spie
into his intentions: that difficult and dangerous businesses were brought with
more ease and safety into the Haven, by fair means, then by rigour and
severity; and that it would not be wisely done to fall foul at first, whereby
if the King should grow obstinate in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, he would by all means make
it good: that it was not the part of a Pope to give the King occasion to cast
off his obsequiousness, and respect towards the Apostolick See: nor by making
himself a party, to give him such reason of distrust, as if a breach should
happen to fall out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards between the two Crowns, he should be made unfit
to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it: that the Grandezza of the Apostolick See consisted in this,
which if she should be a partaker, she would necessarily cast the ballance on
one side, and by standing Neuter she should keep them both her friends: so as
by his Pontifical Authority, and by the credit he should get by his neutrality,
he should be the better able to compose businesses: Being therefore desirous to
proceed maturely in so weighty a business, he resolved first to use peaceful
endeavours with the King, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the restoring of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> by civil means, and by Negotiation: but so much
circumspection in such urgency of affairs was interpreted a luke-warmness, and
coolness of Counsel; especially by such who are better pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ased with actions of resentment then with such as are
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate, and duly weighed; and much more by such who might reap advantage
by the Popes resentment; and therefore the Popes cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspection made all men
wonder, and afforded variety of discourse and interpretation, no less then did
the fervency of the French, and their double-dealing upon the present
occasions: <hi>On the one side, none could conceive so little respect from the
French, to be used towards the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick See; that so little account should
be had of the reciprocal conventions touching the depositure, and of the
Promises and Declarations made by them but a little before, in the face of the
whole World, of not innovating any thing concerning the</hi> Valtoline: <hi>on
the other side, it past not without admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the Pope, not making any
the least account of so many Counsels, and so many Protestations, and offers
made by the Spaniards, accompanied by the evidence of such preparations made by
the French, and by the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, would first wait for the blow, before he
would hold up his hand to fence it; and that he did so sleightly resent it,
when the blow was given; and none being able to believe that he was really
deceived, it was therefore ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that he suffered himself to be deceived, by
secret intelligence; and as suspicion when it is once entertain'd, draws unto
it all the actions of those, who are already become suspected; so the Pope, who
from the beginning of his being Pope was held to be sufficiently inclined to
the French, it was thought, that partly to please that King in that wherein he
was so much press'd in point of honour, partly not to incense the King of</hi>
Spain <hi>by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press delivery up of the Forts; after his Declaration made
in points apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to Religion, that he saw this practise which did indeed
give some co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to this commotion, and did oblige the Pope to provide for it;
and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps also, as some men thought, because he was not of opinion that the
depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siture</hi> 
               <pb n="280" facs="tcp:53250:148"/> 
               <hi>of the</hi> Valtoline <hi>did suit
with the interest of the Apostolick See, even when he was Cardinal, and much
less now, when if the two Kings should fail the Souldiers which were in
the</hi> Valtoline, <hi>the Pope must supply their defaults with the Churches
moneys: that therefore he chose the middle way, and did permit the French to
make themselves masters thereof by force, to the end, that afterwards he might
dispose thereof with advantage, and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to that Crown; and so with
greater safety, and satisfaction to the common affairs; and that therefore
thinking this the best course he could take for the safety of</hi> Italy,
<hi>over which he was very vigilant; and to suppress the unextinguishable fire
of war which did hang upon the Gates thereof, he chose, as the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sser evil, to consent to the wills of
the French, of the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and to the common sence of the Italian Princes:
some setting aside such nice Considerations, said more freely, that the Pope
was no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ss troubled then the
Venetians, that the Spaniards under pretence of Religion should get footing in
the</hi> Valtoline, <hi>thereby to trample upon the Liberty of</hi> Italy,
<hi>and reduce the Apostolick See and so many Princes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>to slavery; and that therefore abhorring their
intentions, they were vex'd at nothing more then to see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves undone by
such ambitious ends; so as not accepting the Spanish suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, he gave secret
orders to</hi> Bagni, <hi>that he should suffer himself to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the
French: many also discoursing yet more freely of the Popes mind said, that the
Pope not being content with excluding the Spaniards from the</hi> Valtoline,
<hi>to have thereby deluded their ends, and secured the Common Liberty, did
nourish yet greater designs in his bosom, and aspired to curb their immense
power and ambition, so to reduce the affairs of</hi> Italy <hi>to within such a
compass, as the Princes thereof being gotten free from the Spanish tutelage,
might govern themselves as they listed, and dispose of themselves, and of their
own business, without such respects to that Crown<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that therefore
joyning with the French, the Venetians, and Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>he did go
along with them in the same common ends, which was, to pull down the Spanish
greatness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This opinion was much strengthned by the great conformity of
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius between him and Cardinal <hi>Magallotti,</hi> Brother to his Brothers
Wife, who in his first conferring of promotions was by him made Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal,
whose Counsel he did so highly esteem, and so much confide in, as he was wont
to say, that if there were another World, it might be govern'd by his opinion;
and though the Pope himself was of solid Counsel, and very capable of Publick
Government; and that he needed not to be advised by any one, and that his
favours confer'd upon <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallotti,</hi> and his having imploi'd him much in
publick Affairs, might be attributed to his alliance, to his ancient
Friendship, and to the desire which is usual in Princes, to exalt their
Favorites; yet the most diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult affairs of the Papacy passing thorow
<hi>Magallotti</hi>'s hands, and all men esteeming him to be high in the Popes
favour, it was necessarily thought that he had a great stroke in all publick
resolutions; and therefore <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallotti</hi> being rather of a brisk and
stirring spirit then given to mildness and moderation, and much more inclined
to the French then to the Spaniards, made men think that the Popes
deliberations, passing tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Magallotti</hi>'s Forge, did partake more of
that temper then of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ality,
which he did so publickly profess: whilst in these ruptures, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken into
consideration, how much the affairs of Religion would <pb n="281" facs="tcp:53250:148"/> be
endangered, and how much he ought therefore to have opposed himself even in
Arms, against whosoever should bring wac into <hi>Italy,</hi> he was wont to
say, that of a Judge, he would not make himself a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: that he would not
break with either of the Crowns; that he would not exasperate the King of
<hi>France,</hi> nor provoke him to any strange resolution, by which that
Kingdom might separate it self from the Church, whereof there being some speech
at that time in <hi>France,</hi> whereat the Pope was much troubled, would
sometimes say, that he would not imitate another <hi>Florentine</hi> Pope, who
by not knowing how to carry himself dexterously in point of neutrality, had
given oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to the disunion of <hi>Englaud:</hi> These were the opinions,
these the discourses which were commonly had in <hi>Italy,</hi> and even in the
Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> which being somewhat controverted, grew after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
somewhat stronger, and got a little more field-room, in the troubles and
dangers, which not long after befel the Genoeses: at the which being but very
little moved, it was conceived that being herein also of intelligence with the
other Confederates, he was not less displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to see business proceed
successfully against <hi>Genoa,</hi> then with those that had proceeded in the
<hi>Valtoline.</hi> The <hi>Valtoline</hi> being taken, the Pope hearing the
rumours which were spread abroad through <hi>Italy,</hi> and in the Court, of
his intentions, and seeing that all mens eyes were bent upon him, he sent
<hi>Bernardine Nari</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> who was his Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, and one
that he loved very well, and who was acceptable to that King, as having been
formerly a Page in that Court; to complain of <hi>Coure</hi>'s actions, and
shewing himself to be thereat offended, he gave order for levying of men, and
made some other preparations for war: which being unseasonable for what was
past, proved also unuseful for what was to insue; for what remained, he held
very secret Consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the Cardinals, and Embassadours of
<hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> so as he seemed to continue his former
Friendship, and good Intelligence with them, and that those his preparations
were in order to somewhat else, then for the recovery of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> or for the defence of the present state of <hi>Italy</hi>
against the perturbers of her peace. A little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the French entred, and
took the <hi>Valtoline</hi> under the Marquess <hi>Coure,</hi> the Constable of
<hi>France,</hi> falling into <hi>Piedmont</hi> with about 14000 Foot, amongst
which were some Veterane Regiments, and with 1500 Horse; and joyning with the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who had 14000 Foot and 2500 Horse, together with much
Artillery and Cannon for Battery, they marched towards the State of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> the Constable being accompanied by his Son in Law, Marquess
<hi>Crickey,</hi> and the Duke by his Son the Prince; and were not only
favoured by the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> who gave them free passage thorow the
lower <hi>Montferrat;</hi> but also by the season of the year, which though it
were in <hi>February,</hi> 1625. yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the custom of that Country,
and to the season it self, they were not hindred either by by ice or snow:
there was no title nor reason on the behalf of <hi>France,</hi> for the war
against <hi>Genoa,</hi> nor were there any Heralds sent from that Court, to
demand or pretend unto any satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for any offence done to that Crown by
the Commonwealth, nor was there any to be alledged: nor did any of the French
mention any end their King had in that enterprise, save only some that vaunted 
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:53250:149"/> that they went to free <hi>Genoa</hi> from being
oppress'd (as they said) by the Spanish Tyranny: others, who were not so close,
let it sometimes slip out of their mouths, that the King assisted the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting the injuries he received from the Genoeses, by
reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of alliance which he had with his family: but when they
were entred the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> they minded the making themselves
masters of the Towns which they took, and put Garrisons into them in the Kings
name, as belonging (as they affirmed) to the ancient Patrimony of
<hi>France.</hi> The Duke and Constable intended at very first to besiege the
City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Metropolitan of the whole State, which not doubting
but that they should easily take, they thought they should find little
difficulty in the rest of the enterprise: news came at the same time, that the
Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> prepared a Fleet in <hi>Marcelles,</hi> who having
declared himself an enemy, before any of the others, had taken 150000 Ducates,
which being sent in small Vessels from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Genoa,</hi> came
into the Ports of <hi>Province,</hi> as into Friends Havens; and it was given
out that both that, and the English Fleet, would quickly appear in the Seas of
<hi>Genoa.</hi> The Commonwealth did not believe that the enemy would aim so
high at the very first; but that bending their first violence against the
Western Seas, and taking some important place, they would fix their footing
there, and making it a Rendezvouz for Arms they would wait upon such occasions
as time and condition of war would produce, and proceed further afterwards, and
advance against the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; wherefore they had distributed the greatest part of
their best and most experienced men into the Towns of <hi>Savona, Albenga,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Mauritio</hi> and
<hi>Ventimiglia:</hi> but receiving assured advertisement, that the enemy was
resolved, the first thing they did, to fall upon the City of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
they va<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed their form of defence;
and leaving <hi>Savona</hi> well Garrisoned, which is a chief place of the
State, neerest the City, and neerest the enemies Army, they recalled all the
rest of their people which were distributed along the River, the greatest part
whereof were presently sent to defend the Passes: there are two ways which lead
to <hi>Genoa</hi> from the lower <hi>Montferrat,</hi> through which the
Confederates Army past. The one by <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> which passing
over the <hi>Apenine,</hi> goes to <hi>Voltri,</hi> a great Town upon the Sea,
ten miles Westward from the City: the other by <hi>Gavio,</hi> which passing
also over the fame <hi>Apenine,</hi> falls by the Valley of <hi>Poz
Zevera,</hi> to St. <hi>Pier d' arena,</hi> two miles distant from the City
towards the same side: the latter being the more ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way for Carriages is
more large and open, and made more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and plain, by Art, as far as
the situation will permit; at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into this way is <hi>Gavio,</hi> a
Town indifferently great, but weak, unless it be for a Castle seated on high,
and (though little) of no little consideration: it is hard to bring Cannon by
either of these ways; and almost impossible by that of <hi>Rossiglione.</hi>
The Commonwealth therefore resolving to quit the defence of <hi>Novia</hi> and
of <hi>Occada,</hi> two great Towns, the first beyond <hi>Gavio,</hi> and the
other beyond <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> fell to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Gavio,</hi> and put
2000 Foot therein, to defend it: she also caused some Trenches, and some
Redoubts to be made beyond the straits of <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> for the better
security of that Pass; for Garrison whereof were sent 2500 Foot, by which and
by the strength of the situation, it <pb n="283" facs="tcp:53250:149"/> appeared (by the
relation of experienced Commanders who were sent thither) so secured as the
Pass was thought almost invincible: looking therefore
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the enemy would be longer
detain'd, they gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, with much study and industry, to Munite the
City; which though it be walled about with great Walls, and flank'd with good
Bulwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ks, yet being over-looked by
Mountains which incompass it, they chose to fortifie the top of those Mountains
by a long continued Trench, which beginning from the head of the Lanthorn which
shuts up the Haven Westward, should run upon the back of the Mountains; and
bending towards the East, should descend into the Valley of <hi>Bisagno,</hi>
and should terminate there almost upon the point of <hi>Carignano,</hi> which
is the furthermost part of the City towards the East; and because the
Commonwealth knew she wanted a Commander in Chief, who might be well
experienced in war, to whom they might commit the weight thereof, they chose
<hi>Giovan Ieronymo Doria,</hi> Knight of St. <hi>Iago,</hi> to be their
Camp-master-general, of whom mention hath been formerly made: an ancient and
experienced Commander, but whose great age did diminish that vigour in him, by
which in his youth he had done much in the behalf of the Catholick Religion,
and of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the wars of <hi>France</hi> and of
<hi>Flanders;</hi> and they made Don <hi>Carlo Doria,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Turcis,</hi> chief General for the defence of the City.</p>
            <p>The Camp-master-general <hi>Doria</hi> being brought into the

consisted in keeping the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as long as they could beyond the
<hi>Apenine;</hi> for the City being situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated much underneath the neighbouring
Mountains, and it being to be conceived by the great Train of Artillery which

and confusion in the City, not being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to such furious noise of the
Cannon: so as not approving the former resolution of abandoning <hi>Novi</hi>
and <hi>Ovada,</hi> he moved for their defence; for though they were not able
of themselves to stand out, yet they would afford time and commodity to make
their Trenches already begun upon the Mountains, and for the coming of succours
from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> and from the State of <hi>Millain.</hi>

               </gap> The Commonwealth approved of
this advice, and sent <hi>Georgio Centurione</hi> and <hi>Henrico de

Commissaries General, and ordered <hi>Doria</hi> to defend the State beyond the
<hi>Apenine:</hi> furnishing them all with such men as they could spare without
disfurnishing the City: <hi>Doria</hi> passing over the <hi>Apenine</hi> sent
his Nephew <hi>George Doria,</hi> with some Forces to <hi>Novi,</hi> and he in
his own person undertook to defend <hi>Ovada:</hi> the Enemy had not as yet
appeared before any of these places, only a Trumpet came some days before to
<hi>Ovada,</hi> to summon it to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; and the scarcity of Oxen and
Horses, for the Train of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, together with some other impediments, was
such, as not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to conduct them, they were forced to bring part of
their Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry some miles forwards, and to send the same Cattle back to bring
on the rest: which occasioned much delay in their march; and the deep Mire, and
Rivers which were swollen by the great fall of Rain, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarded 
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:53250:150"/> them much more; and yet the <hi>Dorii,</hi> finding
neither Victuals, Munition, Artillery, nor any manner of defence in either of
these places; for the Inhabitants finding that the Commonwealth had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
them, had for the most part quitted those Towns, and carried away the Artillery
and Munition along with them, which were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to be brought back, the
Enemy not being many hours march off when the <hi>Dorii</hi> entred: <hi>Iovan
Ieronymo</hi> was forced to abandon the enterprise, and to retire to within the
Trenches of <hi>Rossiglione;</hi> which finding to be ill ordered, and not
defensible, he writ unto the Senate, advising them to remove the people from
thence, lest they might be lost; and it being impossible to go with the Army
and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery that way to <hi>Genoa,</hi> he counselled that the whole defence
should return to <hi>Gavio,</hi> by which the Enemy must of necessity march;
and whither he would go with his men, as he did: going therefore to
<hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taggio,</hi> a great Town upon the same way, five miles more inward then
<hi>Gavio,</hi> he thought to send aid from thence to <hi>Gavio</hi> and
<hi>Novi,</hi> which he held would assuredly be the first places which the
Enemy would fall upon; and by thus keeping them from entring by that way, to
keep the City from being assaulted, and from the misfortune of the imminent
war. <hi>Doria</hi> was not well got out of <hi>Ovada,</hi> when the Van of the
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army, which was advanced, not meeting with any obstacle, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
thereinto, and finding no resistance took it; and the Count of
<hi>Overgnia,</hi> General of the French Horse, advancing by the way of
<hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio,</hi> took <hi>Novi</hi> also upon surrender; and the Enemies Army
which came on, lay idle for some days, quartered in these two Towns, and in the
adjacent parts; waiting for the rest of their men with the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery and
Munition, which came on but slowly, by reason of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said difficulties,
The Duke being quartered in <hi>Cremolino,</hi> a Town in <hi>Montferrat,</hi>
neer to <hi>Ovada,</hi> was busie in taking the Trenches which guarded that
Town; and the Count <hi>d'Overnia,</hi> who was quartered in <hi>Novi,</hi> and
in the Cottages thereabouts, had his eye upon the Town of <hi>Gavio,</hi> which
was defended by <hi>Benedetto Spinola,</hi> who upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was made
Commissary-General beyond the <hi>Apenine,</hi> a Souldier much imploi'd in the
wars of <hi>Flanders,</hi> in chief commands, for a long time; he had with him
1500 Foot, most of them Country people, and one Troop of Horse from the State
of <hi>Millain:</hi> he having spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily fortified the place, withstood a
fierce assault given by the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who going to surprise it with almost all
his men, but without Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, was forced to retire with the loss of many of
his men, and some of the chiefest, and also to abandon some stations which he
had taken before the assault. The Dukes men had no better success in an assault
which they gave to the Trenches of <hi>Rossiglione;</hi> for the station was
manfully defended by <hi>Iacomo Spinola,</hi> the head of 500 Souldiers of the
Militia of <hi>Bisagno,</hi> with no small loss of the assailants: so as the
people of the Commonwealth, though for the greater part of the meaner sort,
having gotten the better in these two assaults, and in some lesser at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts,
began to take heart, and to think the face of the Enemy less formidable; and
the Commonwealth her self, fearing before how her men would behave themselves,
seeing things succeed better then they expected, and that the Enemies Army lay
still idle, doing nothing <pb n="285" facs="tcp:53250:150"/> worthy the threats, and same
which was given out; began to build more upon the difficulties the Enemy would
meet with, then upon the strength of their situations, and of the valour of
their own men: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would not (according to <hi>Doria</hi>'s advice)
abandon the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of <hi>Rossigllone,</hi> which they were told by
others were not to be taken; and hoping every day for better success, they
thought that the Enemy, being streightned in those parts, began to experience
those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, whereinto they had unadvisedly brought themselves; and
this the rather, for that Don <hi>Ieronymo Pimontello,</hi> General of the
Horse of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> being entred by order from the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour into <hi>Torona,</hi> with 4000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, stood
observing their ways, that he might fall upon them in the Reer, if they should
pass further into the Mountains of <hi>Liguria:</hi> all this while the peace
was not violated, nor was there any breach of a war conceived to be made
between the two Crowns; though for the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
seized on the 150000 Ducates, as hath been said, in <hi>Provence,</hi> the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> pretending an interest therein, had made a reprisal of all
the French goods that were in <hi>Spain;</hi> and the French had done the like
to those of <hi>Spain,</hi> that were in <hi>France;</hi> therefore the Duke
and the Constable, professing to observe punctually friendship, and good
correspondency with the States, and Subjects of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> did
not permit any act of hostility to their men; and if any accident should happen
to the contrary, they proceeded to severe punishment against the Delinquents,
as done without their order, thorow milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry licentiousness, and excused
themselves; which was not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Spanish Officers, but seeding
the French with the same food, they assured them they should not be injured by
their Forces: many invitations were made moreover to the Duke, and to the
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable, and reciprocal friendly Offices past between them; and upon
complaint made by the Constable that some loads of Meal were taken by the
Subjects of the State, restitution was forthwith made; the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who was
unarmed, being unwilling to provoke an Army which was strong and powerful upon
his Confines: but when he should have past the <hi>Apenine,</hi> where the
numbers of men would neither be an help, nor hinderance, it was certain he
would not keep within the same bounds; for it being as impossible to keep
<hi>Genoa</hi> without the assistance of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> as to
defend <hi>Genoa</hi> when that State should be lost, it was apparent the
Spaniards would be forced to break with all the World rather then to lose
<hi>Genoa;</hi> for these Reasons the Genoeses were reasonably well satisfied,
especially since they saw none of the Enemies Fleets appear: but the Duke being
desirous to clear the Pass of <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> resolved to assault it with
the gross of his Army on <hi>Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thursday,</hi> the twelfth day after
<hi>Ovada</hi> was taken: the defendants, who had had the better upon other
occasions, were afrighted to see so many men appear in good order; so as
distrusting not to be able to defend themselves, they all basely forsook the
Trenches before the Enemy came within Musket-shot, and retreated, unless it
were a Company of the Corsicks, which being placed higher made honourable
resistance: but afterwards fire taking in a Barrel of Powder, at the blowing up
whereof 20 of them were burnt and slain, and seeing the places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind 
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:53250:151"/> them abandoned, they likewise forsook their stations,
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to <hi>Rossiglione;</hi> and the Enemy following their blow,
became masters of the Trenches, and soon after of <hi>Ros<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

rest, who making it a Rendezvouz for Arms, for re-inforcing those who defended
the more inward Trenches, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they all ran away, they likewise beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n to run: so as the place, together
with the Victuals, Munition, Moneys to pay the Souldiers, and other provisions,
fell (without any opposition) into the Dukes hands: they continued running
away, till they came to the Sea; only two Companies of Souldiers staid in
<hi>Mansone,</hi> where there was a little Castle, very strong by reason of the
narrowness of the Passage, fifteen miles distant from <hi>Rossiglione,</hi>
towards the Sea; wherein there was two small pieces, and whither sufficient
Victuals, Men and Munition were sent from <hi>Genoa:</hi> the Enemy entring
<hi>Rossiglione</hi> past on to <hi>Campo,</hi> a place only three miles more
inward then <hi>Masone:</hi> here they halted, trying those of <hi>Masone</hi>
with small Skirmishes, and Articles of agreement, who still defending
themselves did manfully make good that Pass, and that Castle: all this while
the new work of incompas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the Mountains with Trenches was hardly begun in
<hi>Genoa:</hi> the Walls of the City were not at all fortified; and their
Artillery, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had great store, and very great ones, were yet in
their Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, unmounted, as in time of peace, and lying one on the top of
another, they had no experienced Cannoneers, little store of Match, and the
meaner sort of people was beyond measure increased, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of women,
and others fled thither from the neighbouring parts for refuge: the Souldiery,
which for a whole year were there assembled at the great charges and industry
both of the publick and private, much diminished: those few that were left were
sent to Garrison <hi>Gavi</hi> and <hi>Rossiglione;</hi> and many of the latter
were dissipated through the terrour of the preceding day: 200 Neapolitans, who
at the earnest intreaty of <hi>Ianetto Spinola</hi> were by <hi>Iohn Ieronymo
Pimontello</hi> sent to <hi>Tortona</hi> some days before what had hapned at
<hi>Rossiglione,</hi> as they past a long, without thought of being assaulted,
were cut in pieces by the French: wherefore, the City appeared to suspect
<hi>Feria,</hi> as being abandoned in her so great danger: so as the unexpected
news of <hi>Rossiglione</hi> being brought to <hi>Genoa,</hi> the City was in
great terrour and confusion; which increas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d by the children, old men and women of <hi>Vettri,</hi> who
flocking to <hi>Genoa,</hi> full of fear, and believing that the Souldiers of
the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, who fled from <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> and returned by the way
of the Mountains towards the Sea, were the Enemy, affirm'd that <hi>Masone</hi>
was taken, and that the French did draw neer; that therefore which befell
<hi>Rome,</hi> the City of <hi>Mars,</hi> after the rout at
<hi>Thrassimeno</hi> and <hi>Canna,</hi> and at <hi>Hannibals</hi> approaching
the Walls of <hi>Rome;</hi> and of later times, <hi>Paris,</hi> when the Army
of the Duke of <hi>Burgony</hi> and of the other Confederates, in the War for
the Common Good, was heard to arrive; and yet of later years, when she feared
to be assaulted by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifths Army; that which befel the
Venetians after the Rout at <hi>Giaradadda,</hi> befel the City of
<hi>Genoa:</hi> a City bred up for almost a hundred years in peace; where there
was not any that had ever heard the noise of an Enemies Drum or Trumpet: some
of the Gentlewomen went from the City, <pb n="287" facs="tcp:53250:151"/> some of the
weaker sort of people fled; others freed their houses of what they had of most
value and worth, and sent them to <hi>Ligorne.</hi> The Senate amidst such a
multitude of affairs and troubles, hearing the opinion which was had of the
greatness and neerness of the danger, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved forthwith to abandon
<hi>Savona, Gavio,</hi> and all the other places of the State, and to withdraw
all their Forces to defend the City of <hi>Genoa,</hi> upon whose safety and
welfare, all their thought were set: therefore on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> the
very day that they heard this news, they sent all the Gallies that were in the
Haven to <hi>Savona,</hi> with order to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missaries, that leaving the
Citadel provided for, they should presently return with all the inhabitants to
the City: Orders were likewise sent to Camp-master <hi>Doria</hi> in
<hi>Ottaggio,</hi> to do the like with all the Garrisons thereabouts, and with
those of <hi>Gavio:</hi> the first Order was obey'd, for on <hi>Easter</hi> Eve
the Gallies returned from <hi>Savona,</hi> with the people and Commissaries,
but not the other; for <hi>Doria</hi> being experienced in war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, thinking
it to be a rash resolution, wrot back, before he obeyed it, that the Enemy
having brought so many and so great pieces of Artillery by the way of
<hi>Rossiglione,</hi> there was no danger that they could possibly app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>oach the City without them; and that the people might
run danger of being lost, if they should be brought away, the Enemy being so
neer; he therefore exhorted the Senate to make head against them in
<hi>Gavio,</hi> which whilst it was maintained did obstruct, and being
abandonded did make way for free passage to the City. The Senate approved
<hi>Doria</hi>'s advice; true it is that the Commonwealth building much, in
this so great terror, upon his Counsel and Valour, and upon the like of
<hi>Benedetto Spinola,</hi> who kept to defend <hi>Gavio,</hi> sent for them
both to <hi>Genoa,</hi> that they might assist to defend the City; and
<hi>Spin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>la,</hi> (who upon this
occasion was made Camp-master-general) was by <hi>Doria</hi>'s direction,
succeeded in the defence of <hi>Gavio,</hi> by <hi>Iovan Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tista Meazza,</hi>
of <hi>Pavia,</hi> Captain of the <hi>Millain</hi> Horse who were there in
Garrison: it was therefore ordered contrary, to the former resolution, that the
Gallies should return the next morning with the people who were not yet landed,
to defend <hi>Savona. Lodovico Guasco</hi>'s coming to <hi>Genoa</hi> did also
much incourage the Inhabitants, and appease the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion they were in, who
was sent by <hi>Feria</hi> with 2000 Foot, and 200 Horse to the relief of the
City; and coming on the <hi>Easter</hi> Eve, when the confusion was so great,
was received with great joy, not only for the Forces which he brought with him,
but also for that thereby the jealousies which were had of <hi>Feria</hi>
ceased, and they hoped for greater succour: so as now some hopes of
preservation appeared; especially since they heard that the Enemy came on no
further by the way of <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siglione:</hi> they therefore knew that the City
had conceived too excessive fear by the disaster of <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> and
Proclamation was made, that upon pain of Death none should depart the City, or
send away any Goods or Moveables; and they began very diligently to make
Trenches, to mount their Cannon, to dig Ditches, and to make other Fences for
the City, all, both men and women, being very intent upon the preservation of
the publick safety and liberty: but on the other side, the Senate fearing that
some new invasion might be made in the Western River, especially since they
heard that at this very time the <pb n="288" facs="tcp:53250:152"/> Pimonteses were gone to
<hi>Sassello,</hi> a Town belonging to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, lying a little above
<hi>Savona,</hi> and that they had taken it; and fearing that General
<hi>Doria,</hi> by reason of his great years, would not be able to provide at
the same time for the defence of the River when it should be assaulted, and of
the parts beyond the <hi>Apenine</hi> whereby the the Army marched, they chose
<hi>Tomaso Caracolla,</hi> who was then in <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> for their
Camp-master-general; and deputing him for defence of the State beyond the
<hi>Apenine,</hi> they sent <hi>Doria</hi> to recover <hi>Sassello,</hi> and to
defend the Western River. On <hi>Holy-Thursday,</hi> the Popes Gallies, and
those of the great Duke, appeared in the Haven at <hi>Genoa,</hi> which waf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed Cardinal <hi>Francisco
Barbarini,</hi> the Popes Nephew, to <hi>Marcelles,</hi> who was sent Legate
<hi>à Latere</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> upon the occasion of
the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and of these present occurrences: a provision which was
thought by many to be very weak, and unseasonable to keep off this imminent
storm; and therefore as it proved useless afterwards, so was it of very little
hope now: the Legate being arrived would not come on shore, nor accept of any
publick or private invitations, many whereof were offer'd him, excusing himself
upon his precise Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and Orders limited by the Pope: insomuch as there
were some who interpreted this Embassie to be for some other more secret ends:
being staid there some time by contrary Winds he departed on
<hi>Easter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> early in the morning, towards <hi>Savona,</hi> where he
tarried some days, expecting Monsieur <hi>Pamphillio,</hi> Auditor <hi>di
Ruota,</hi> who going along with the Legate, was to remain N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tio in ordinary in <hi>Spain,</hi> and
was sent from <hi>Savona</hi> to the Duke, to get from him some cessation of
Arms. The Duke seeming somewhat scandalized, that the Legate came not himself
in person, gave <hi>Pamphillio</hi> but a cool welcome; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the
Victory at <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> thinking that he had the City as good as in
possession, he did not grant the demand, alledging for his refusal, that being
but a Souldier of the King of <hi>France</hi> in that war, it was more then lay
in his power: not long after what had hapned at <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> the Duke
and Constable turn'd their Forces by the other way of <hi>Gavio</hi> and
<hi>Ottaggio:</hi> distrusting as, I conceive, to be able to advance by the way
of <hi>Rossiglione.</hi> The Genoeses penetrating into the design by what
<hi>Doria</hi> had said, and being somewhat freed from their first
astonishment, thought it necessary to turn their defence that way, not only to
oppose and weary the Enemies Forces, but to get more time by delay for the
coming of succour from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> from the Kingdoms of
<hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> where they were raising; and though all
agreed in this, yet they differ'd in their opinions touching the way of putting
it in execution: some were for re-inforcing the Garrison of <hi>Gavio,</hi>
whither <hi>Doria</hi> (before he went from <hi>Ottaggio,)</hi> had sent 1500,
who if <hi>Gavio</hi> should be lost, might entertain the Enemy, till more
succour should come: others were of opinion, that all the Kings and
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths Forces should march towards <hi>Ottaggio,</hi> or the
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts, and make use of the Mountains situationous: and that
gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving more incouragement to the defence of <hi>Gavio,</hi> they might force
the Enemy to live more close, and with more trouble and unquietness. During
these discourses, <hi>Thomaso Caracciolo,</hi> and the Baron
<hi>Batteville</hi> came from <hi>Millain,</hi> who unwilling either to approve
or disapprove, any <pb n="289" facs="tcp:53250:152"/> of the aforesaid opinions, before
they had gone in person to know the situation of the Country, and condition of
the places, that so they might give their opinion the better upon what was
propounded: it was forthwith resolved they should go into those parts, and take
with them 1000 of <hi>Guasco</hi>'s Souldiers; and that <hi>Guasco</hi> himself
should go with them and be assistant to them in Counsel; and that
<hi>Doria</hi> should go to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vona,</hi> and from thence to the recovery
of <hi>Sassello,</hi> which was soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. <hi>Camillo Cattaneo,</hi>
Knight of <hi>Malta,</hi> came also to the City from <hi>Sicily;</hi> one that
had been long vers'd in the wars of <hi>Flanders,</hi> who was presently sent
with 2000 Foot to <hi>Masone,</hi> and finding it not capable of so great a
Garison, he was ordered to go to <hi>Ottaggio;</hi> so as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween those who
were there already, and those that were to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within a few hours,
<hi>Caracciola</hi> had with him in <hi>Ottaggio</hi> about 5000 Foot, and 80
Horse; <hi>Caracciola,</hi> leaving <hi>Guasco</hi> behind him, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with
the Foot, came to <hi>Ottaggio</hi> about the going to of night; and
understanding immediately that the Duke, being then very strong both in Horse
and Foot, was come to <hi>Caroxo,</hi> a little Village in the mid way, but
neerer <hi>Ottaggio</hi> then <hi>Gavio,</hi> and not thinking that he would
come to an assault so soon, he was not so diligent as was necessary, the enemy
being so neer with so great Forces, and himself so couragious; and the night
being dark and rainy would not permit him to discover the condition of the
situation, and circumstances of the Country: some few men were only sent to
guard the Passes, and to re-inforce some of the neighbouring Hills; and news
coming to <hi>Genoa,</hi> that for certain the Duke would make himself master
of <hi>Ottaggio,</hi> before he would attempt <hi>Gavio,</hi> as well for the
Victuals which he was confident he should find there, as that the enemies being
driven out of those quarters might be no hindrance to the taking of
<hi>Gavio,</hi> they only staid expecting the next days light, to give
necessary orders, and make requisite provisions: only they argued that night,
whether if the Duke should advance, they should do better to wait for him
within the Town, or meet him in the Field: <hi>Camillo Cattaneo</hi> was for
keeping within to defend the Town, and <hi>Caracciola,</hi> that they should go
out: but sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing that the Duke could neither have Cannon, nor be prepared
for an assault, they thought they should have time enough to do what should be
best, so as it would be superfluous to talk thereof now, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that time, the
proceeding of the Enemy, and the next days light, would counsel them what they
had best do. <hi>Ottaggio</hi> is great and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, situated at the foot of
the <hi>Apenine</hi> towards <hi>Lombardy,</hi> upon the left hand of a
rivulet, which falls from the Mountain, and runs along the Plain on which the
Town stands, which is weak, and almost open; for the ancient walls are ruinated
in many places: on the top of it there stands a little Castle, much decay'd by
time; and standing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high-w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y which leads to <hi>Genoa,</hi> it was rich and populous through
the Merchandize, and passage which went and came continually from
<hi>Lombardy;</hi> and the Geno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ses thinking that it might be made very tenable, by reason of the
situation, if it should be fortified, they made many Trenches in several parts,
as well to defend the way as the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Mountain: the chiefest were, one
made to defend a little Bridge called <hi>Frasso,</hi> half a mile beyond the
Town; the other, a long <pb n="290" facs="tcp:53250:153"/> Trench, which extending from the
foot of the Mountain to the rivu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, sheltred the Town and the whole
<hi>Campagnia</hi> on the front; by these Works they thought they might be able
long to withstand the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning of <hi>Ottaggio,</hi> and keep the Enemy from
entring by that way, not considering on how many sides an Army may make its
way. The Duke who expected the speedy arrival of his Artillery, resolved not to
march that day, so as the Commonwealths Captains might have had better
conveniency to provide for defence: but Monsieur <hi>Di San Anna</hi> being
sent by the Duke with some Forces about break of day to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the way, and
the first Fortications, took the Fortifications of <hi>Fras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,</hi> almost
before he had discover'd them, which were the first, and were basely abandoned
at the first appearance of the Enemy; he sent forth with to acquaint the Duke
with this his happy beginning; the Duke was in doubt whether he should keep
behind, with all or with part of his men, or make them retire from the place he
had taken; and whilst he knew not what to resolve upon, he might hear a
Skirmish which had hapned between his men, and 400 Foot which were sent from
<hi>Ottaggio</hi> to recover the abandoned place; he was advertised of what was
done, and was sent to for succour, for that his men were in great danger: so
seeing himself ingaged, contrary to the orders he had given, he commanded his
men to advance, crying out aloud, and with much confidence, this is a day of
Victory: going forth with all his men into the Field, and sending part of his
people by the Hills beyond the water, who should seem as if they went to
assault that Town on the back, he disposed his Cavalry a long the River, and
kept the rest on this side, and went with a large Front to assault the Plain,
and the Hills which stood over them. The Genoese Commanders betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to defence with no less courage, though with worse order and fortune; for
<hi>Caracciola</hi>'s power prevailing, they march'd into the Field; and whilst
the 400 Foot which went to recover <hi>Frasso</hi> entertain the Duke, they
ordered their men thus. The Plain which lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Ottaggio</hi> and
<hi>Frasso</hi> is divided; on the left side whereof, which is under the Hills,
they disposed of the Foot, wherein were compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <hi>Guasco</hi>'s men,
who were come but very then, weary and wet: in the way that lies neerest the
River they placed 80 Horse, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into four small Squadrons; they sent some
to re-inforce those that were to defend the Hills, by which the Enemy might
advance: the mean while, the Duke having not only defended and kept
<hi>Frasso</hi> which St. <hi>Anna</hi> had taken, but repuls'd the 400 Foot
that went to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it, he pursued them, though not without trouble and
difficulty; for they retreated slowly, still resisting and fighting; and
continuing thus for some hours, the Duke came at last within sight of the Plain
of <hi>Ottaggio,</hi> where he might see the Commonwealths Forces in order, and
prepared for defence; and staying his march a while, that he might form his
Squadrons, and give fitting orders, he sent to assault them on all sides, those
who defended the Hills were the first that gave back, who being pursued by much
a greater number, retreated towards the Plain; whither being come, they
disordered their friends Files, who being justled by their friends, and
assaulted by the Enemy which pursued their friends, they could not resist; and
the 80 Horse which they had <pb n="291" facs="tcp:53250:153"/> placed in another part,
wheeling about, at the first appearance of the Enemies Horse, without striking
one stroke, the flight and confusion grew greater every where, then the
fighting: so every one endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their safety by retiring towards the Town,
the Field was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken; and <hi>Caracciola,</hi> who fought there manfully
with a Pike in his hand, and <hi>Agostino Spinola,</hi> were taken Prisoners:
great was the slaughter of the Genoeses, especially at a Portcullies which they
found shut; for there being here a great press of those that pursued, and those
that were pursued, and little or no resistance made, the Dukes men had
opportunity to kill many: yet this slaughter was not without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for the
Portcullies being beaten down, and the Dukes men entring the Town, were very
hardly dealt withall, not only by Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-shot from the windows, but by two
Barrels of powder, to which fire being seasonably set, many of the Dukes
Souldiers perish'd, amongst which many of the chiefest both for Birth and
Valour: yet that first part of the Town was taken by the Duke; who without
gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving any time of respite fell upon the main Town, which was divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by a
little rivulet from the Suburbs which were taken; where also the falling on was
not only great, but also the resistance; and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners received most
prejudice, who remaining an open mark to the shot of the defendants, (for there
were neither Trenches, nor cover'd approaches) they fought for the space of
three hours: the defendants playing upon them from the Windows and tops of
Houses: yet the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugners increasing every moment, and a rumour being spread
abroad amongst the defendants, that the Enemy was entred by another part of the
Town, the Captains and other Officers, being surprized at so sudden a news, and
not knowing what to do, they gave over making further defence, and fled to the
Castle, hoping to get out from thence by the way of the Mountain, and go safe
to <hi>Genoa:</hi> but they failed in their design; for seeing the skirts of
the Mountains possess'd by the Enemy, and having neither Powder in the Castle,
to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor Victuals to maintain themselves, they had but little
hope of safety. The Town, by their retreat, slackned their defence, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at last either abandoned by the defendants, or overlaid by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants,
whose numbers increased by continual recruits, and the Duke being there in
person, it fell into the power of the Enemy; and soon after the Castle; wherein
there being neither Victuals, nor any thing for defence, <hi>Guasco</hi> and
the other Commanders who were shut up there, surrendred upon Articles: which
being agreed upon by word of mouth, but not in writing, afforded occasion of
wrangling; those within pretending that they were to have their liberty
together with their lives; and the others, that their lives were only granted
them; wherefore the Duke kept them all prisoners; and the more to justifie his
doing so, said that they had broken their Articles by setting fire to a Barrel
of Powder, which slew many of both sides, and amongst the rest Monsieur <hi>di
Flandes,</hi> one of the chief Officers of the Dukes Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and one whom he
esteemed very much for his valour: at the which unfortunate accident the Duke
was so disgusted, for the loss of his men, and especially for that of
<hi>Flandes,</hi> as he thereby pretended to detain them all, and to deprive
the Commonwealth, in such an exigent <pb n="292" facs="tcp:53250:154"/> of time, of their
chief Commanders, attributing the accident to the Enemies maliciousness. Thus
all Articles were broken; and the Souldiers entring the Town presently sack it;
wherein not only much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>avenous
cruelty was committed, but great impiety, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of those of
<hi>Ottaggio,</hi> they being destined to suffer the first mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of war
which was begun against <hi>Zuccharello,</hi> 80 miles distant from thence:
great was the prey that was here got; for this was the usual Market for
Victuals which past from <hi>Lombardy</hi> to <hi>Genoa;</hi> and the
Ottaggians being naturally industrious, and given to Trade, were very rich in
Moneys, Houshold-stuff and Corn: whereby the Dukes men, who had known the
miseries of war, clothed themselves anew, and got great store of Moneys,
Victuals, and of many other things: the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners were very many, amongst
which, nine of the prime Gentlemen of <hi>Genoa,</hi> besides many other
Captains and Officers; seven Ensigns were there taken, and the Victory was
great, for here did the chiefest of the Commonwealths Souldiers and Commanders
fight; but yet it was not without the loss of a great many of the Dukes best
Souldiers. <hi>Ottaggio</hi> being taken, the Duke took some Horse with him and
rode up the <hi>Apenine;</hi> where when he was come to the top, he looked
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly upon the Valley of <hi>Pozzevera,</hi> which lay beneath, and upon
the Sea which was neer unto it: for the City which is inviron'd with neerer
Hills cannot be seen from thence; and devouring that prey with his looks, and
desire of revenge, which he was never to get, he thought every hour a thousand
years till he had got the City: not knowing, nor being able to imagine that God
had prefix'd that place where he now was for the boundure of his vast designs,
and for the utmost limits of his Triumph. The Duke could not so fully injoy
this his Victory; for to boot with the loss of his best men, his joy was
embittered by the news which he heard the next day, touching his Admiral
Galley, which the very next day after the Battel was brought, with his chiefest
Standard in her, captive into the Haven of <hi>Genoa:</hi> the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
had sent three Gallies some few days before into the Provencal Seas to annoy
the Dukes Coasts, who hearing that the Dukes Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral was at St.
<hi>Honorato,</hi> a very small Island in that Sea, anciently called
<hi>Lerino,</hi> not far from <hi>Nice,</hi> and disjoyned from the Continent
by a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Channel, they resolved to go in pursuit thereof: when they came
neer the Island, two of them kept without at Sea, and <hi>Galleazzo
Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ustiniano,</hi> who commanded the Genoese Admiral, entred between the Island
and the Continent, and lighting upon the Dukes Galley, (which seeing what
danger she was in retired) and strove to get into some Town of
<hi>Provence,</hi> but was overtaken and forc'd to yield to the Genoese
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral: but though the unhappy success at <hi>Ottaggio</hi> did not occasion
so great terrour and confusion in <hi>Genoa,</hi> as did the loss of
<hi>Rossiglione</hi> but some few days before; (for she was the better
accustomed to bear with such disasters:) yet the wifer sort knew, that this
loss was much greater then that of <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> by reason of the
defeat given to all their best men, and the imprisonment of sogallant and
experienced a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, in whose worth and valour the Commonwealth reposed so
much trust, together with the like of their Captains, and prime Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen:
they considered the danger they were in, that the Duke fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing 
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:53250:154"/> his good fortune might present himself before their
Walls with his whole Army, and that of the King of <hi>France:</hi> so as being
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly afflicted with so great a loss, they knew not how to sustain so
imminent a danger. The Senate calling a Counsel of many of their Captains and
Counsellors, (whereinto was admitted the Marquels of <hi>Castagnedo,</hi> being
the Spanish Embassadour, whose advice they much valued, as being one well
experienced in the Wars of <hi>France;)</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Turcis;</hi>
they were of differing opinions, as were also their Captains and Counsellors:
some thought it a pernitious advice to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume their best men in the defence
of a weak place, against so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an enemy; and thinking it a better course
to make use of them for the defence of the City, whose danger could not be
greater, nor neerer hand, they advised to abandon <hi>Gavio,</hi> and to
withdraw the Garrison, to defend the chief City: others persevering in their
former opinion, said, that the Enemy losing also many of their best men, which
were the very sinews of their Forces, they became weaker, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
less able to expugne the City; and that succours being daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from
<hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> the City could run no danger: so as it
might do well, though with the loss of the Garrison at <hi>Gavio,</hi> to
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the enemy, and to gain time not only for the coming of the foresaid
succours, but for the arrival of the Germans, who (they heard) were already
entred the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> In this difference of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they
resolved to consult with the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> and to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd by
him: the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> on the othe other side, grown proud with
Victory, prepared to pass with all his men over the <hi>Apenine,</hi> and to
come before the City Walls; and was very careful in preparing all things
fitting for the enterprise: but the Constable kept him from this resolution;
who being unwilling to leave <hi>Gavio</hi> behind his back, which was well
fortified, and had a great Garrison in it, it being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let for succour, and
a place of safety for the Enemy to retreat unto up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any occasion, gave order
for the expugning thereof before they should advance further. The Duke thought
it somewhat hard to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slow the course of Victory; but not being able to do
otherwise, he was forc'd to give way to the Constables will; without which he
could not prosecute the intended enterprise: and because the Constable thought
the loss too great which was received by the former assault gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to place by
the General of the Horse, and the loss greater which was received before
<hi>Ottaggio,</hi> because they had proceeded in those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons according to
the Military manner, he would therefore proceed or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in the taking of
<hi>Gavio,</hi> with Artillery, Approaches, and making of Trenches: Captain
<hi>Meazza,</hi> Governour of the Garrison of that place, labouring how to
defend it, and how to offend the Enemy by often sallies, conceived such hopes,
as he writ to the Senate, that he would make good that place for the space of
ten or twelve days; nor would he peradventure have failed to do it, had not one
who had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten privately into <hi>Gavio,</hi> given him some orders from
<hi>Stefano Spinola,</hi> and from the Resident for the Commonwealth with
<hi>Feria</hi> at <hi>Millain,</hi> whereby he was told that <hi>Feria</hi>
thought it a better and safer way, to preserve their men, then to lose them
together with the Town; the preservation whereof was desperate: that he should
therefore give over <pb n="294" facs="tcp:53250:155"/> the defence thereof, and provide the
best he could for the safety of the Garrison. The Senate had writ to
<hi>Meazza</hi> when they left the decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the business to <hi>Feria,</hi>
that he should observe such Orders as he should receive from <hi>Spinola</hi>
from <hi>Millain;</hi> and they had written to <hi>Spinola</hi> that he should
direct <hi>Meazza</hi> what to do touching the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or abandoning of
<hi>Gavio,</hi> according as <hi>Feria</hi> should think fit: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<hi>Meazza</hi> about midnight, without knowledge of the Townsmen, went away
with the Garrison of 3000 Foot towards <hi>Serravalle,</hi> a Town lying
towards the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> about some five miles of; but finding
the ways bad, and therefore having spent much time in his march, he began to
fear being surprized by the way, the next day: wherefore resolving to return
back, he did so, with the like silence as he had come out that night; and upon
Articles to march out with his men the next day, he yielded up the Town, but
not the Castle, which was not at his disposal: this third accident did again
afflict the City, which the day before the surrender had received
<hi>Meazza</hi>'s Letter, by which he assured them he would maintain the Town
fourteen or twelve days at least: in which mean time the Genoeses believing
that for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that relief would come from <hi>Naples</hi> and
<hi>Sicily,</hi> they began to hope, that the succour would come before they
should see the Enemies Army: but now failing of that assurance, and not seeing
the succour come, every one apprehended his own misfortune, and were
astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed at the Enemies success; and finding that they prospered in all
their actions, they thought it impossible they should do otherwise in the
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise of <hi>Genoa.</hi> This their affliction and astonishment was
presently increased by the loss of the Castle, which hapned not long after; for
the Duke being desirous to remove all pretences and impediments that the
Constable could alledge, for not going to <hi>Genoa,</hi> speedily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
the Battery, wherewith having for a while plai'd upon the Walls and prejudiced
them a little, the Captain of the Castle (though he were strongly situated, and
well provided of all things, yet being) but young and unexperienced, he came to
Parley, and obtain'd Truce for three days, with leave to send to
<hi>Genoa,</hi> to advertise the Senate of his condition; but the Duke having
made some Trenches during the Truc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and the Captain not having received any advertisement from the
City during those three days (for the Duke had detain'd the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger) he also
surrendered: so the Army, having no other obstacle to keep them from going to
<hi>Genoa,</hi> unless it were the craggedness of the Mountain; the Duke eg'd
on by ardent desire, and by the great hopes which so noble a concourse of
Victories afforded him, he press'd the Constable very hard, that without giving
further respite to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he would give order for the advancing of the
Army and Artillery, assuring him of undoubted Victory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have already</hi> (said he) <hi>opened the gate, paved the
way to the City: all obstacles and impediments are already removed; the Enemies
are routed, their chief Commanders are our Prisoners; the City her self, before
the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory at</hi> Ottaggio, <hi>being full of terrour and confusion, had (as
we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by some Prisoners) sent to Article with us, and to offer us
great sums of Money: many of the chief of the Commonwealth do the like to
redeem themselves from us, and our hands; from whence knowing their own
weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <pb n="295" facs="tcp:53250:155"/> and being confounded with the presages of
imminent ruine, they very well know they cannot possibly escape, what will they
now do, after so many defeats, in the heels of one another? after having lost
their best men? when they shall see themselves deprived of so many Chieftains
and Officers? de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their General at the very first encounter, in whom
they did so much confide? shall we think that they will hold out, at the very
first appearance of our Ensigns, that they will wait for the noise of our
Cannon? shall we believe that a City accustomed only to Traffick, and to give
account how they have gotten so great riches as they have now within their
Walles, and as they have distributed elsewhere, shall dare to make any
resistance against our Forces, our Ensigns, our Fame? against the dread which
the French Forces bear with them every where, and which are every where so
feared and reverenced? let us go, for Gods sake, before they by their flight
rob us of such riches as are already ours: before that being fortified, and
succoured by the Spaniards, they may dispute that Victory, which nothing but
speed can, in all probability, assure us: what terrour, what consternation hath
the loss of their Trenches, the rout and defeat at</hi> Rossiglione,
<hi>imprinted in our Enemies? how neer was that City then to be abandoned; and
shall we now, after the defeat of</hi> Ottaggio, <hi>after the loss of</hi>
Gavio, <hi>when they are deprived of their best Souldiers, best Commanders,
doubt that they will not undoubtedly be readier to run away, then to defend
themselves? that they will not rather think of their own safety, then of making
resistance? I pass by the many intelligences which we have with those Citizens;
I mention not the discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and dissatisfactions which are in that City;
which certainly will much facilitate our Victory. Let us go on then, great
Constable! not to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning, but to the expugning of this City, not to the
Assault, but to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest thereof; not to the Combate, but to the assured
Victory, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised, and prepared for us, by so many Circumstances and
Arguments: whereby the name of</hi> France, <hi>and the Empire of that Crown,
which is already in the wane in</hi> Italy, <hi>shall be by us raised up again;
and to our perpetual glory, be restored to her former splendour and dignity;
and your Excellency by so signal an action shall crown your so many former
praises, and gloriously concluding your Heroick Deeds, shall render your name
more famous amongst the French, and other Nations, then that of any of those
ancient Commanders which we remember or read of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Dukes Authority was not so powerful with the Constable as it
had been; and as fellowship in command is always full of emulation, and
jealousie; the ends of Commanders not being always the same, it appeared by
several signs, that neither were their wills the same: he therefore
answered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If your Highness, His Majesties Agents, and the other
Confederates had, in some sort at least, corresponded to the Obligations of the
League, and to the great offers made to me at</hi> Susa; <hi>surely such
exhortations as these would be superfluous to me: nor should I, who have always
incited others to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and gallant actions, need now such an Inciter; for
the very Reasons, and the same Courage, which in obedience to his Majesty, and
to serve so many Confederate Princes, moved me in my old Age, and in the midst
of Winter, to pass over the Alpes, would of themselves be sufficient to bring
the Enterprize to an honourable end, which was resolved upon so good 
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:53250:156"/> grounds, and begun with so great preparations, and
greater cheerfulness: but in a business of such weight we must go to work with
understanding, and casting up our accounts well, we must not golgroping in the
dark amidst so many dangers; best we repent our rashness too late, and lest
instead of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which we pretend unto, and the glory which we hope for,
we reap ruine, loss and dishonour: we go against a great City, well peopled,
muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with strong Walls, and invironed with many Fortifications, as we are
informed: we go by uneasie ways, by a barren Country, by strong situations, by
craggy Mountains, by Countries which have nothing left in them for the
maintaining of an Army; where are our Victuals for nourishment? where Cattel
for Carriage? where Carriages for other Implements? does your Highness know how
far the Provisions which you ought to make prove short? how far inferiour to
your obligation, and to what you did assure me they should be, first in</hi>
Susa, <hi>and afterwards in</hi> Turin? <hi>I do not here Dispute whether it be
out of will, out of negligence, or impossibility, that they have not yet
appeared: whatsoever the reason be, it cannot be denied but that there is great
want of them, and that the consequence thereof is great for what we have to do:
the English Fleet, and that of</hi> Marcelles, <hi>which were the chief
ground-works of our enterprise, have not only not yet appeared in the Seas
of</hi> Genoa, <hi>but are not (for ought we can learn) come yet out of their
Havens: the supply of men, which should be prepared in</hi> France, <hi>for the
necessary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of our Army, which is weakned very much already, and very
much lessened, we do not hear that they are yet sent, no not so much as in a
readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: nor is there any care had of us in that Court, more then if we had
never come out of that Kingdom; and who can think but that a resolution wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
put on upon these ground-workes must needs run to ruine, when these foundations
fail? and yet your Highness, persisting in the same fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, thinks it great
shame not to pursue that which it would have been great weakness to have begun
without these foundations, or to have resolved upon, and which it would be
great rashness to pursue: whether of our two advices be the better, (if it were
not convinced by common sense and reason) would be better comprehended if we
would but duly consider what our condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was when we had past the</hi>
Apenine: <hi>it being impossible, if we should have met with any indifferent
resistance, to keep there idle, destitute of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and of all humane
provision; and who can doubt but that any the least stop, any the sleightest
hinderance to this your Highness his pretended Victory, will redound to our own
total ruine and destruction? but why talk I of stops or hinderances? our only
tarrying for the bringing on of our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, and other Provisions, which
cannot March as fast as our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; the time onely to distribute out Quarters;
to make our selves masters of their Sentinels or Sconces; to the disposing of
our Artillery; (if we should meet with no other lets,) will be undoubtedly
sufficient to ruine us, and to destroy our men, if we carry not Victuals along
with us, sufficient for our maintenance the mean while; so as we shall have
come thither, for nothing else but to make our selves a ridiculous spectacle to
the world, through our rashness, and indiscretion, whereof our very enemies,
whilst sitting within their Walls, will be the first and neerest spectators:
what will become of us then, think you, if the State of</hi> Millain, <hi>which
we shall leave behind us, as a sure enemy, shall move? who can assure us that
they will continue their hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto <pb n="297" facs="tcp:53250:156"/> feigned friendship
with us, when we shall have passed the Mountains? what will the event be, if
the great succours and aids which are preparing in</hi> Naples <hi>and</hi>
Sicily <hi>shall come from thence this mean while? with what courage, with what
Forces, can we at the same time mind the expugning of a City well walled, well
provided and succoured, and resist the Forces of the State of</hi> Millain,
<hi>which shall come upon us, whilst we are oppress'd by so many troubles,
straitned by so great necessities, shut up between the Mountains and the Sea,
and deprived of any mortal succour? will your Highness con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in the
weaknesse of Enemy, in the Peoples astonishment in, the disorders of the City,
in the great intelligence which you confess you have there? let us suppose,
that this being our condition, the City Gates should be thrown open to us, and
that that should be the only way remaining for us, in this extremity, to get
the Victory, or rather to save our selves? will your Highness (persisting
constantly in your opinion,) place, I will not say the happy event of the
Enterprize, but the safety of our selves, and of our reputations, upon so
acrial, and so uncertain points? the battel at</hi> Ottag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio <hi>may make your
Highness know that the enemies are not so full of baseness and cowardize, as
your Highness believed them to be but a little before: the taking of that
little Burrough which made nothing at all for our main affair, which wanted
Artillery, and whose Walls were for the most part down, cost us the blood of
our best men, as your Highness very well knows; and shall we think that they
who have sold so little a Town at so dear a rate, will be ready to throw open
their Gates, that they will so easily give themselves, their Wives, Children
and Riches, in prey to us? let not, oh let not the too immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate desire of
Victory, the too great thirst after glory and revenge, make us too rash; and
let us not be misled by vain intelligence with discontented people, wherein the
total of our lives and reputations does depend; nor let us not place the
ground-work of our Enterprize upon the peoples confusion, and sudden fear; for
I protest and declare, that we shall assuredly be deceived if we carry with us
no other preparations, no other inforcements for Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for our own
escape: the intelligence, and plots of malecontents, may easily be discovered
and hush'd, they may be withheld by the coming of new suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours, changed by the
alteration of success, vanish through the difficulty of performance, or
suppress'd by the diligence of the Governour: a little time appeases hidden
commotions, a small opposition curbs popular insurrections; and by what we hear
of the union and good order of that City, we have more reason to fear, then to
hope for Victory; and I who have some experience of the worlds affairs, as I
build somewhat upon such occasions, and accidents, when Forces are adequate to
the Enterprize; so where I finde them inferiour, I have always thought them to
be but baits to ruine, and to the destruction of those that lay the ground-work
of their successe thereupon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke replied many things, whereby to draw the Constable over
to his opinion; sometimes shewing him that being so far advanc'd, they could
not without much shame forbear prosecuting: sometimes endeavouring to free him
from the fear of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him in what
straights of men and money the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> was; sometimes that the
French Forces had the better of it in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and were
Conquerors on that side, who would at the same time fall there upon the State
of <hi>Millain:</hi> sometimes mentioning the Venetians, <pb n="298" facs="tcp:53250:157"/>
who being ready to break into war upon the account of <hi>Cremona</hi> and
<hi>Giaradadda,</hi> would reduce that Governour to a condition of rather
needing succour, then of succouring: that therefore they were to make use of
the reputation and heat of Victory, which doth oft time bring Enterprises to a
happy end, though they be otherwise impossible, and desp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rate, to the appearing of all humane reason: that all
sinister events ought not to be thought upon, which may intervene in humane
acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; since there are none so certain, nor so surely grounded, which may
not be hindred by a thousand accidents; upon which he who would fix his eye too
attentively, must not hope to do any thing; that many things were to be left to
Fortune, which bearing a great sway in all humane actions, but particularly in
those of War, doth commonly assist bold and couragious actions: that it could
not be long ere the Fle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ts would
arrive, the necessity whereof he, out of many considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, did not much
value: But the Constable demanding, finally, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions to maintain the Army
for at least three moneths beyond the <hi>Apenine,</hi> before he would move
from those quarters where he was; (and not long after these Disputes, news
coming, that great succours were come to <hi>Genoa,</hi> from <hi>Naples</hi>
and <hi>Sicily)</hi> the execution of this so great Enterprise was almost quite
given over.</p>
            <p>The Duke being necessitated to steer on his course, resolved, to
shun lying idle and loss of time, to turn part of his men towards the Western
River, which by the Capitulations of <hi>Susa,</hi> were assigned over to him;
and where he understood the Genoese had taken <hi>Oneglia</hi> from him,
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all the Valleys of that Country, and were entred into that of
the neighbouring <hi>Prela:</hi> he gave the charge hereof to the Prince, who
forgoing for then to attempt <hi>Savona,</hi> turn'd upon <hi>Pieve,</hi> the
first Town of the Genoese, of the neerest to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the

Piedmontese of the Trained-bands of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> and of the Marquisate of

               </gap>cts who were returned from those parts, he had reason to expect but
small resistance: he therefore with hopes of good success, began it: nor failed
he in his hopes, for finding the Passes, as he had been informed, but badly
guarded, he fell down from thence to <hi>Pieve,</hi> a great Town at the foot
of the <hi>Apenine</hi> towards the Sea; and <pb n="299" facs="tcp:53250:157"/> the Market
being usually there as great and populous, used by the Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monteses and
Genoeses, but not weaker to be defended then that of <hi>Ottaggio,</hi>
Camp-master <hi>Doria</hi> was entred thereinto, being sent thither from
<hi>Genoa,</hi> when the danger of that side was known: he had only a thousand
paid men given him by the Commonwealth; so as though he had refused to go
thither with so small a number, yet to obey the Senates Orders he went: but
with protestation, that he went, to the manifest loss of himself, and of his
men: so gathering together 1500 more of the common people of that Country, he
came together with them into <hi>Pieve;</hi> and holding it was impossible to
take that Town with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Artillery, which he also thought was impossible to be
brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he gave all necessary Orders, and made all requisite
provisions for defence: he fortified the Monasteries of St. <hi>Austine,</hi>
and the <hi>Capuchins</hi> which were without the Town; and munited them with
sufficient Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risons: he did the like at a certain station which was called
<hi>la Morte,</hi> all which places he thought untakeable without Artillery: so
as thinking himself sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the Town with those Fortifications, he expected the coming of the Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doria</hi> was not deceived in his opinion; for the Prince
appeared without any Artillery, and sitting down before St. <hi>Austines</hi>
Monastery, he met with great opposition, and for some days had little hope to
take it; but Artillery arriving the fifth day, beyond the defendants
expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, all impediments were removed; for levelling them at the
Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nastery, and beating down the Steeple, it slew many of the defendants with
the fall thereof, he infused such terrour into the rest, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
tumultuously into <hi>Pieve,</hi> leaving that station in the Princes power:
their example was immediately followed by the rest of the Guards, so as the
Prince (being master of the Field,) sate down present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before the Town, which
being by so unexpected a chance fuller of confusion then order, and the Walls
not being fit for battery, the Captain began to Parley; and having the word of
one of the Dukes Captains given him, that he might march out, he, not minding
who it was that gave it, or what power he had to give it, was presently made
Prisoner; and it being given out amongst them that were within, that for fear
of troubling of the Treaty, they should put out their Matches, the Besiegers
approach'd the Wall without resistance, and beating down the Gate with a Beam
of Wood they entred the Town, and those within fled away by another little Gate
that was towards the Sea: but they mist of their design, which was to escape,
for that other Gate being presently possess'd by the Princes Souldiers, many of
them throwing themselves down from the Walls, which were not very high in that
part, were some of them slain by the Musketiers who were placed on the out
side, and other some perish'd in their falling down: here was the greatest
slaughter of the best men, to the number of 200; but those that kept within the
Town met with more mercy; for the Town being taken whilst the surrender was in
Treaty, the Prince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for the peoples safety; and the Souldiers falling

being greater then their cruelty, none were troubled but those that withstood
plunder: many were taken Prisoners, amongst <pb n="300" facs="tcp:53250:158"/> which,
Camp-master <hi>Doria,</hi> and four other Gentlemen of <hi>Genoa,</hi> two
others who were got into the Castle yielded not long after, upon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of
safety of life and liberty, which was readily observed. Thus was <hi>Pievs</hi>
taken, <hi>Doria</hi> made Prisoner, and the people of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, who
were destined to guard that part, were defeated: <hi>La Riviera,</hi> having
lost its Garrison, and not hoping for relief,

from the violence of War: Whereupon <hi>Albenga, Alassio, Porto Mauritio, San

<hi>Oneglia,</hi> fell (without any gainsaying) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Princes hands; as did
also all the weaker places, unless it were <hi>Triora,</hi> which being seated
upon the top of a Mountain, held out, and kept still manfully for the
Commonwealth, and defended it self man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully against many attempts. The Castle
of <hi>Ventimiglia</hi> held also for the Commonwealth, which resisted for some
days after the Town was surrendred, till the Prince having caused some
Artillery to be brought from <hi>Nice</hi> by Sea, began to batter it, and also
to make a Mine; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Captain who was but little experienced in the
Militia, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to assault the City on that side which was thought the weakest. Don
<hi>Felice</hi> succeeded therein happily, and without resistance; for the City
being brought into great streights and anx<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ety, was wholly intent upon fortifying herself; and to keep off the
danger which she saw drew (every day) neerer, she was very diligent in making

               </gap>renches, in furnishing the Walls
with Artillery, in digging Ditches, in making Plat-forms, and Stockcadoes, to
fence the weakest places. Thus the Affairs of <hi>Genoa</hi> were thought to be
brought to the last period: moreover, the City was at this time in great want
of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys; for some Gallies being gone into <hi>Spain</hi> to fetch moneys

therefore made use of the Plate of private persons, which being turn'd into

               </gap>ame far short of what was
requisite: there we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e not many men
ready in the State of <hi>Millain</hi> to come into the Field, the Germans not
being yet <pb n="301" facs="tcp:53250:158"/> come: and some few that were already come were
sent to desend <hi>la Riva,</hi> which was so necessary for the preservation of
that State; and Don <hi>Ieronymo Pimontello,</hi> not thinking himself safe in
<hi>Tortona,</hi> thought it better to retreat with those few men he had into
<hi>Alessandria:</hi> at which the Genoeses were not a little astonished, who
by the fear he shewed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion, were not well pleased to see him go
further from the City, instead of drawing neerer to the relief thereof; and the
like scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of money being there as was in <hi>Genoa,</hi> the Swissers, who
were much in Arreer for former pay, seeing the great necessity of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Officers, and being set on by the Princes of the League, denied passage to the
Germans who came to defend the States of <hi>Millain,</hi> and <hi>Genoa.</hi>
The failing of the Genoeses credit insued the want moneys; for their State
being given for lost, throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> and all Europe, it was thought
that the private Fortunes of those Citizens would perish with the publick. The
fear which was had in <hi>Genoa,</hi> of the English and French Fleets, was of
no small consideration, and did much afflict the minds of all men; it being
hourly feared that they would appear in those Seas, by reason of the continual
news which they had of great preparations made both at <hi>Marcelles,</hi> and
in <hi>England;</hi> and of moneys sent by the Duke, and his Son, when they
were before <hi>Ventimiglia,</hi> to the Guisans, that they might put the Fleet
in readiness, and appear as soon as might be in the River of <hi>Genoa:</hi> to
which Fleets it was feared that 40 Frigots or men of War would joyn; which
being come from forth of <hi>Holland,</hi> and it not being known whither they
were bent, all men thought they were intended for the Enterprise of
<hi>Genoa:</hi> great was the danger, lest taking <hi>Corsica,</hi> or some of
those Havens, they might forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it, and make it serve for a Bulwark against
the State of <hi>Genoa;</hi> and there hinder the passage of shipping between
<hi>Spain</hi> and the Kingdoms of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily:</hi> the
Genoeses were no less jealous of the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who having room
left them to be admitted into the League, it was not known how they stood
affected to these present commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ions: it being feared that either apprehending to share in the
ruine of <hi>Genoa,</hi> they should not dare to declare themselves, or run the
same fortune for assisting them, or that out of a tacite abhorrence of the
Spanish Empire, they might not be sorry to see an alteration in the State of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> which was so neerly joyn'd to the Spanish Grandezza; and that
some out of a desire of bettering themselves in the ruine of that Commonwealth,
might wish it; for a Rendezvous for Arms was made in the City of
<hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> and a great assembly of men, and preparations for War; and
though it was said to be done under the colour of being ready upon all
occasions to defend <hi>Tuscany,</hi> yet the Genoeses wanted not conjectures
of danger to <hi>Serezzana</hi> and <hi>Serezzanello,</hi> belonging to the
State of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa</hi> upon those Confines: which places the great Dukes of
<hi>Tuscany,</hi> under pretence of the <hi>Florentine</hi> Commonwealth, have
always had an eye upon, and (sometimes) some secret practices: it was certainly
known that the great Duke did at this time treat with the Duke of
<hi>Feria,</hi> that he would suffer him to possess himself of them, and of the
Gulf of <hi>Spetie,</hi> and to keep them, and defend them against the Confede
ates Army, lest when they should have taken <hi>Genoa</hi> they should take
them <pb n="303" facs="tcp:53250:159"/> also; and that answer was made, that neither by the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor yet <hi>Feria</hi>'s self, that any one-foot
belonging to the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> should be possess'd upon any
whatsoever pretence. The Genoeses were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much distracted, being forced
upon these urgent occasions to lessen their own necessary defences, so to
provide for the defence of <hi>Corsica,</hi> and of the two other places, of
such concernment; whether they not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding sent people, and provision for
the maintaining of them: though the danger from the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
(who was thought to be privately very partial to the French) were not so great,
yet the jealousie was no less, by his giving free passage to the Confederates
Army through <hi>Montferrat;</hi> and more by the offers made afterward by him
in secret to the Commonwealth, to joyn with them against the same Army which
was already past; promising to fall upon them in the Reer with 6000 Foot and
1000 Horse; if they would give him money to raise them, and to maintain them in
the field: which offers, as contrary to the ends and proceedings of that
Prince, were not only not accepted, but (as not too much to be trusted in these
times,) they were rejected. The Venetians forgoing that so noble study and
endeavour publickly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by them upon all occasions, of the lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rty of <hi>Italy,</hi> being now
joyn'd with Forreigners against the Genoeses, were held to be little less then
open enemies to them: they had no old quarrel against the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, nor
any new occasion of enmity or resentment to incite them to so hostile a
resolution: but after the ancient emulation for Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire at Sea, the two
Commonwealths had always kept upon fair terms: the uniformity of their
Government, and their being both of them Italian Potentates, might have been
sufficient to interest them in the reciprocal maintaining of each other: only
the common end and desire of the Confederates, to abate the greatness of the
Austrians, and of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was more suspicious to the
Venetians then to any others, by reason of the neighbourhood of
<hi>Germany,</hi> was sufficient to work upon that Senate at this time, and to
make them (to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the rest) plot the ruine of <hi>Genoa:</hi> it was
commonly said, that this business being handled in the <hi>Consiglio de
Pregati,</hi> and it being argued what disorder and inconveniences would insue
to the common affairs by the ruine of <hi>Genoa,</hi> at that time
particularly, when that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth was desired, in the Dyet at
<hi>Susa,</hi> to ioyn with the rest in the War against <hi>Genoa;</hi> Rainero
Zeno, <hi>a Senator of great sway and eloquence, should say, that the
inconveniences were most apparent, but that the danger of their affairs, by
reason of the great power of the Empire, and of the Crown of</hi> Spain,
<hi>was such, so imminent, and so neer their State, as all other respects and
considerations whatsoever being laid aside, it ought in good Government of
State to be prefer'd before all things else; and that since all disorders could
not be prevented, they ought, in so weighty and important resolutions, too have
an eye upon the greater, and wink at the lesser; just as wise Physitians do,
who (to preserve their Patients life) stick not sometimes at the amputation of
a Leg or an Arm, which being preserved would be his death.</hi> And though the
Venetian Forces, being far from the Confines of <hi>Genoa,</hi> were not much
to be doubted: yet being neer the Cremonese, and joyn'd with the French in the
<hi>Vatoline,</hi> they kept the State of <hi>Millain</hi> imploied, and 
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:53250:159"/> consequently were no little hinderance to the succours
which might be brought from thence to the Genoeses; whose condition was now
such in <hi>Venice,</hi> as the Merchants of <hi>Genoa</hi> durst not appear in
publick, they were so generally hated; and great was the rejoycing of the
Venetian Nobility and Commonalty, when they heard of the good success of the
Confederates Army against the State of <hi>Genoa;</hi> and no less triumph and
rejoycing was made in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> where the Genoeses through
sinister news, spread abroad of their misfortunes, had lost so much reputation,
as they mock'd, and publickly laught at them, as if they had already been quite
vanquish'd; and were it either by reason of the great joy which great
alterations cause, or were it that the Officers of the Palace were for the most
part Florentines, or such as depended upon Florentines, they were not
displeased to see the liberty of others lost, though their own was therein
concerned: a thing which made some men argue that the Pope was not overwell
affected to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, and which did much detract from the fatherly
zeal which he profest to bear her, and from the words which he was used to say,
when he heard ill news of the Commonwealth, wherein he was wont to deplore the
ruine of so Christian and Catholick a State: to this mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and ruinous a
condition the Affairs and Liberty of the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> seem to be
reduced.</p>

whose whole thoughts were set upon her extirpation; so as instead of flocking
to so rich and plentiful a prey, they began to fall from their hopes of
success; just as befel <hi>Hannibal,</hi> who whilst he was with an Army before
the walls of <hi>Rome,</hi> understood that some L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

further from their hopes, when they heard that great succours of men were
almost at the same time come to <hi>Genoa:</hi> For from <hi>Millain</hi> (to

<hi>Pecchio,</hi> after the loss of <hi>Gavio</hi> and <hi>Ottagio,</hi> with

of those of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> which did amount in all to
about 3000 Foot; and the Marquess <hi>della Croce</hi> came about this time to
the City with 33 Galleys, wherein were 4000 Foot, all very good men, and
whereof 2000 were Veterane Souldiers, trained up in the Wars of
<hi>Flanders;</hi> and a little before 1500 Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were come thither in
some Galleons: The Sicillian Galleys came also thither with 600 Spaniards,
which were sent by <hi>Ianettino Doria,</hi> Vice roy of that Island, at his
own expence, in defence of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Marquess <hi>Bozzolo</hi> came thither
also with his three brothers, 800 Foot, and 200 Horse, besides Infantry, which
came daily from <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples;</hi> so as with these, and those which
<hi>Guasco</hi> brought from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> those that were
sent from <hi>Lucca,</hi> and those which came (though somewhat late) from
<hi>Germany,</hi> the Commonwealth was in a short time provided with about
15000 paid Foot, for defence of the State and City; besides many Commanders,
and people of Quality, and experience, who were brought thither from several
parts upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary pay: By means of these Forces, and of her own people,
who were very vigilant in defending their Country and Liberty, and with the
Militia of the State, the Affairs of the State were prettily well secur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d, and almost brought into a condition
of safety. The Popes Galleys, and those of the Great Duke, came along with
<hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> which returning from <hi>Marselles,</hi> whither they
had carried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

meeting with <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> as he came from <hi>Naples</hi> to the
relief of <hi>Genoa,</hi> turned back the same way, by Orders directed to the
Captains from their Princes, which Orders <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> brought with
him: it was not thought strange that the Great Duke should issue out such
Orders, who profest himself a friend to <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the house of
<hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria;</hi> the Popes Concession came more unexpected, he being
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly held to be not only averse to the Spaniards, but to joyn in ends with
their Rivals; and the French Embassadour Resident at <hi>Rome,</hi> did exclaim
much against it; yet it was thought that the Pope to remove so great suspic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

at the perswasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Duke of <hi>Pastrana,</hi> who press'd very much for
it. The first thing that was consulted of in <hi>Genoa,</hi> was, touching the
whole matter of defence; they all joyn'd in opinion, That being now only to
minde defence, their first care should be to defend the City, the Head of the
State, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>he Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> might
assault them in the Field, and drive them out of the Common-wealths
Territories. Seeing therefore that the loss of <hi>la Riviera,</hi> as long as
<hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> should be preserved, did not at all concern
the main business, they took not much care to defend it, that they might not
disfurnish the City of a Garrison in a time of such danger, nor hazzard her

insulted over by the Enemies Army, which being so neer, when they should see
those who were come in to her succour imployed <pb n="307" facs="tcp:53250:161"/> in
defending <hi>la Riviera,</hi> might approach her Walls, and attempt an
as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault: howsoever, what should be lost would be easily recover'd, if
<hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Savona</hi> should be kept, by reason of the situation
of <hi>la Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viera,</hi> which being naturally open and undefensible is soon
taken by any that will endeavour it; and when the danger of the neighbouring
Army should be over, it would be more easily recovered by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
then by any others, as well by reason of the peoples incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, (who by
reason of the interests they have in the City, and by their continual necessity
of providing things necessary from thence, would desire to return to their
ancient obedience;) as also that the Commonwealth being master at Sea, it would
be very hard for any who should hold the Town to defend it against a Fleet at
Sea; and yet though so many succours, come suddenly, were sufficient to secure
the present condition of affairs, yet were they not sufficient to free the
Commonwealth wholly from the imminent danger of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Army; and
much less to free the Genoese from fear, who were troubled at the successful
proceedings of the Enemy in <hi>Rossigli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, Ottaggio, Gavio</hi> and <hi>la
Riviera del povente;</hi> and being still full of anxiety, could not be at
quiet, whilst they were still subject to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lested by the Enemies Amry; and
it being requisite to expect the total freedom of the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e of <hi>Millain,</hi> though it were hindred by many
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments, the Genoeses were still fearful, and full of troubles; for
together with the want of people which the State was in, the Dutch not being
yet arrived, the defence of <hi>la Riva</hi> (which was a great curb to the
French and Venetians) not being to be abandoned, kept the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour from
thinking of relieving <hi>Genoa.</hi> Count <hi>Iovanni Serbellone</hi> was
there (as hath been said) well fortified on all sides; and to keep the Enemy
the further off, he had extended his Fortifications on the left side, by which
you come from the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> even to the Town of <hi>Campo,</hi> (a
Town upon the River of the Lake) wherewith he incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed that Town and <hi>la
Nova,</hi> which did almost joyn upon <hi>la Riva.</hi> The Count being past
over (as hath been said) to the other side, into the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> with
the greatest part of his men, was very intent upon f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eeing himself of that hinderance which cross'd his
designs and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings: being therefore resolved to attempt the Town of
<hi>Campo</hi> first, to keep it from being defended, he made <hi>la Riva</hi>
be assaulted on the opposite side, by those who he had left in
<hi>Chiavenna,</hi> as he returned into the <hi>Valtoline:</hi> to the end that
when he should assault <hi>Campo</hi> with his whole body he might the more
easily take it: he mist of his intent, though his design succeeded; for those
few defendants who remained to defend <hi>Campo,</hi> when <hi>la Riva</hi> was
assaulted on <hi>Chiavenna</hi>'s side, did so stoutly maintain the defence, as
they got time to be succour'd; for Count <hi>Iovanni</hi> leaving
<hi>Chiavenna</hi> well defended, came himself in person with many men to
<hi>Campo,</hi> where the Siege was more fierce: so as the defendants
increasing in number courage and valour, a strong conflict was begun; which
being often re-inforced by the French, <hi>Coure</hi> perceiving that his
enterprise succeeded not so easily here, as in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> against
the Forts which were guarded by the Ecclesiasticks; and remembring that he had
left 400 of his men before that assault, and that many others were wounded, he
withdrew into his Quarters: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <pb n="308" facs="tcp:53250:162"/> done but little harm to the
defendants, whereof hardly 20 were slain; though they were plaied upon by the
French Artillery, placed in fitting places.</p>
            <p>After this Count <hi>Iovanni</hi> found that <hi>Campo,</hi> as
being too far from <hi>la Riva,</hi> was dangerously defended; wherefore
resolving to give it over, he made his Fortifications more inwards towards the
Town of <hi>Nova;</hi> and the French, who could not take that Town by force,
see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it abandoned, went immediately thither, took it without any
diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and fortified it; and not satisfied with this, they would advance
to the top of the little Hill, that they might go by that way to
<hi>Chiaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and fight the Garrison that was there: but they failed of
their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by the gallant resistance which the defendants made, who
oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all their Forces, had always the better of them: wherefore
<hi>Coure,</hi> who desired still to joyn with those that were at
<hi>Chiavenna,</hi> and to make them come unto him, was forc'd to make them
pass over hither, and come to <hi>Campo</hi> by a further way about, and over
craggy Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: in which passage the French having, possess'd themselves of
the tops of the higher Mountains which over looked the little Hill of
<hi>Riva,</hi> they threw down great stones into the Valley which lay under the
little Hill, wherewith they did much annoy the Rampiers, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
who would not have been able to defend that so important stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on long, had not
Count <hi>Giovan</hi> sent a good many Souldiers to the tops of those Mountains
to drive them from thence; and herein he suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded happily, for the French
being unexpectedly assaulted; threw away their Arms, and begg'd their lives:
but their prayers prevailed not; for being made prisoners, and tied back to
back with ropes, they were tumbled down the same precipices, which was a most
horrible spectacle. <hi>Coure</hi> for all these unfortunate accidents would
not give over the Enterprise, but fell from assaults to Siege: those of <hi>la
Riva</hi> received Victuals and Succours by two several passages, the one by
the Lake, the other by Land: by the Lake, by Boats, which past from the lower
Lake into the lesser one; and by Land, by Conducts which were brought to the
Territories confining upon <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> by the three Chappels of ease
which lead to <hi>Riva. Coure</hi> possess'd himself of these ways, and placing
part of the Garrison of <hi>Chiavenna</hi> to defend them, he block'd up that
passage; and having the coming of Victuals by Land, he endeavoured to do the
like by water: he, by the help of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced Artificers, and Mariners,
brought from the <hi>Arsenal</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> built certain Boats and
Brigantines; and putting them armed into the water, he made himself master of
the little Lake, and of the Channel by which Boats came with Victuals and
Ammunition to those of <hi>Riva:</hi> remedies were found for both these
inconveniences; for Count <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni</hi> sent men to <hi>Riva,</hi> who
taking from the French the Fortifications which they had possess'd themselves
off, made the way open, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred that pass free for Provisions and Succour;
and the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> having also sent for experienced Ship-wrights
and Mariners from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> he also put other Barques and Brigantines
into the River, which be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ng well
armed and man'd, and some pieces of Artillery being placed in fitting palces
upon the side of the Lake, kept the way open as well by Water, as by Land, for
Victuals and other Provisions, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <pb n="309" facs="tcp:53250:162"/> freed
<hi>la Riva</hi> from being besieged: but <hi>Coure</hi>'s men being this mean
while much recruited by more men and moneys sent by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, who desired
to see that Enterprise ended, to the end that when the French should fall upon
the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> they might also as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault it on their side; and
new Regiments of Souldiers being come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from the Swissers and Grisons,
<hi>Feria</hi> being very careful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend that pass, sent 2000 of those
Dutch thither who came fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>st to
the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> which hapned very opportunely; for
<hi>Coure</hi> being thus recruited would needs go to assault <hi>la Riva,</hi>
and do his utmost to take it; and he found the Defendants also recruited, who
marching into the Field encountered the Enemy in a little Plain, beyond
<hi>Nova,</hi> and fought them; the Combate was very fierce and stoutly fought
on all sides; and the French being often times recruited the Fight conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
till night; upon the coming on whereof, the French were forced to retreat with
the loss of many of their men; and could not only not come neer <hi>Riva,</hi>
but forsaking <hi>Campo,</hi> withdrew into their Quarters about <hi>Vico</hi>
and <hi>Vercei,</hi> which were lower, and farther distant from <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi>
These happy successes afforded the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> breath, he thought
himself so safe from assaults on that side, as he might have more leasure to
think upon the affairs of <hi>Genoa,</hi> in the freeing whereof the Victory in
all parts did depend: but the delay of the Dutch was a great hinderance to it,
which did proceed not only from the endeavours to the contrary of the
Confederates, and of the French, but also from the avarice of the Cantons who
were to permit them to pass; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creditors to the Crown of
<hi>Spain</hi> for pay, denied them passage till they were paid their Arraers;
and the Governour being in great want of money, much time was required to get
the moneys wherewith to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie them, before the coming of the Gallies from
<hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>Genoa:</hi> nor would they grant them free passage when
they were satisfied, as they had granted to the French, but with many
limitations, which caused much delay; and the Governour being much sollicited
by the Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eses, whom he could not please before the arrival of the Dutch, he
made use of appearance, instead of effects; for making all things ready for
marching, he went from <hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Pavia,</hi> giving out that he
would go to relieve <hi>Genoa;</hi> and here according to what was published,
he was very diligent in making all requisite provisions for that succour, and
for the people who came daily from <hi>Genoa:</hi> a shew which was very
seasonable, and which was thought did much detain the Enemies pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, who
seeing him ready to march, could not without apparent danger to themselves,
keep their Quarters, much less could they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to their Enterprise; to the
home and neighbouring provisions which secured the Genoeses, forreign and
further distant accidents were added, which though far enough off, yet made
much for their main business; Don <hi>Frederico di Tolledo,</hi> who was gone
with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Fleet to recover <hi>Brafile,</hi> return'd at this time
victorious into <hi>Spain.</hi> and Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> after nine
moneths Siege took <hi>Breda;</hi> in the defence and preservation whereof, not
only the Hollanders did labour with all their Forces, but the Kings of
<hi>France, England, Swethland;</hi> and <hi>Denmark:</hi> so as the Fleet
which was return'd from <hi>Brasile,</hi> was a strong defence to the
Mediterranean, against the English and the Flemish <pb n="310" facs="tcp:53250:163"/>
Fleets, if entring the Mediterranean they should make for <hi>Genoa;</hi> so
also the <hi>Flanders</hi> Army, being freed from besieging <hi>Breda,</hi>
might commodiously and without any impediment go whither it listed, and keep
<hi>France</hi> in j alousie, which was then rent and disturbed with home
discords; and when the affairs of <hi>Genoa,</hi> wherein that Crown was so
concern'd, should require it, it was sufficient by molesting that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom on
that side, to divert <hi>France</hi> from offending the Genoeses; and the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> being quite of these two impediments, might im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Genoa:</hi> to boot with these two Forreign accidents, whereby the
conditions of the affairs of <hi>Genoa</hi> were bettered; three others which
hapned neerer hand, did much impair the affairs of the Confederates Army: the
one was, that the Victuals and Provisions in the English Fleet were corrupted,
then, when it was ready to put to Sea for <hi>Italy;</hi> so as it was foced to
tarry some moneths to take in new Provisions: another, that the Hereticks in
<hi>France</hi> began again to tumultuate, and the King being necessitated to
quench the fire which was kindled in his own house, could not furnish fuel to
mantain combustion abroad: the third, that the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> who was
to put with his Fleet from <hi>Marcelles,</hi> notwithstanding the 150000
Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates taken from the Genoeses, and other moneys which the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> furnished him with upon this account, proceeded slowly in his
preparations, and could not put to Sea, according to appointment: therefore the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Constable failing in the chief ground-works of
their Enterprise, and seeing the Enemies preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to increase both in
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> they were forced to think
more upon their own safeties, then upon the ruine of others. The inward
discords of their own Army was also a great break-neck to their affairs; which
keeping about <hi>Gavio, Ottaggio,</hi> and the neighbouring parts, uncertain,
and not resolved what to do, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to want Victuals, the Country being barren,
and those spent which were in the Army at its first appearing, and at the
taking of <hi>Ottaggio;</hi> for they could not hope for any from the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> now that it was provided of Souldiers; and very little came
from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by reason of the length of the Journey, the difficulty
of the Guides and Conducts, and by the hindrances they met with by the
Montserrians, who being irritated, and angred at the ill usage they received
from the Army, as it passed through their Country, declared themselves fierce
Enemies; hindring their Conducts, killing the Conductors, and all such
Souldiers, who to get rid of the sufferings of the Camp retired either into
<hi>France</hi> or <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The trocb'es were no less which they
received from the Pozzeveraschy: these are those that inhabit the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys and

Westward from <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa:</hi> they are men for the most part given to
Husbandry, but very fierce and strong, who having no well-ordered Militia,
whereof they are altogether incapable, prove (on the contr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

neither Discipline nor Order; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the defence of Passes, and
of the neighbouring Mountains, by reason of their experience and practise in
those Valleys, and by their <pb n="311" facs="tcp:53250:163"/> being well vers'd in those
craggy Mountains: these men appeared, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into Troops, on all sides,
taking all such of the Enemies party prisoners, who fled from their Quarters
for prey, or driven by any other necessity: which hapning often times, did so
terrifie the Enemy, as none durst stir from the Camp, for fear of being slain,
or taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners: so as being in a manner besieged in their Camp, they were
forced to keep in; and as by reason of this, and of famine, and other
sufferings and sicknesses which began to increase amongst the Souldiery, and by
the running away of many the Camp grew daily less; so by the disagreement of
the Commanders their main enterprise grew still less prosperous: a manifest
disagreement appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>red between the
Duke and Constable; which arising at the first out of sleight occasions and
jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, did daily so increase, as did totally destroy the common resolves.
The Constable came into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> inflamed with high desires, and
almost as fervent as the Duke in the business of <hi>Genoa:</hi> being come
neer the Genoese Confines he cooled in his ardour, and seemed (as hath been
said) to weigh the condition of the war with too much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: so as being
much perplext, and unresolved in point of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, he proposed the
enterprise of <hi>Alessandria</hi> to the Duke, as being by all the reasons of
war, necessary to proceed that of <hi>Genoa,</hi> wherein he appeared to
dev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ate from his former
resolutions, and desirous to bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie himself in new wars, and greater troubles,
against the State of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;</hi> which the Duke being hot in the
enterprise, and in his resentment against the Genoese, did absolutely abhor:
but the Constable making objections against advancing into the Ligurian
Mountains, without having first made sure their retreat; which he said could
not be done without taking some strong place, and capable to receive them; the
Duke having removed so many difficulties, did by the happy success at
<hi>Rossiglione, Ottaggio</hi> and <hi>Gavio,</hi> tacitely accuse the
Constable of coolness and de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ay;
several were the debates and contestings between them touching who should be
master of <hi>Gavio,</hi> and many other things, whereby they came little less
then to an open breach: Yet the Duke, lest lesser respects might spoil their
greater ends, was content that the Constable should put a Garrison into
<hi>Gavio,</hi> till such time as the King, to whom they both writ, should
decide the business; the King return'd an Answer, but in favour of the
Constable; at which the Duke was highly scandalized: but the Duke was most of
all troubled, for that he did firmly believe the Constable was bribed by the
Genoese Gold to delay the business; for to his jealousies which he had in this
behalf, even since when he was in <hi>Asti,</hi> other conjectures were added
which made his suspicion the more probable: one amongst the rest; that
<hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fano Spinola,</hi> who was one of the prisoners at <hi>Ottaggio,</hi>
was sent by the Common wealth to try the Constables mind, by the means of
<hi>Claudio Marini,</hi> who was Embassadour from the King, with the Duke, and
whose Wife was <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Sister; and to bargain with him, upon the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of a great sum of money, that
he would forgo the Duke, and give over the business. This jealousie was
occasioned by its being known, that the day before the taking of <hi>Ottaggio,
Spinola</hi> had obtain'd by <hi>Marini</hi>'s means, a safe conduct

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rom the Constable to come to the
Camp, and speak with his Brother in Law: nor wanted there secret ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisments
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:53250:164"/> sent craftily from <hi>Genoa</hi> to the Duke, whereby
he was fully informed of these proceedings: he who was naturally suspicious,
and prone to give ear unto such informations, and who made himself be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he
had many adherents in <hi>Genoa,</hi> who did privately favour this his
enterprise, began to believe that to be undoubtedly certain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had
formerly had some deep impressions; especially since the Constable was known to
be naturally covetous, the Duke began to impute this his so great change of
will, and resolution, to manifest cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and to complain freely enough
that he was cousened in this Enterprise; and the news which he affirmed he
heard from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> of the continually passing of French Souldiers
through those parts, who returned into <hi>France</hi> from the Camp, with the
Constables Pass, increased these his complaints: from hence (were these
relations and suspicions true or false) began reciprocal detractions; and
little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or intelligence was had betwen the Courts of these two great
Commanders; and in this interim, the Supream Magistrate of <hi>Genoa</hi> who
was Superintendent in the Government of Affairs, was informed that about 500
Oxen were grazing in the Enemies quarters, which served for the Train of
Artillery; and he considering that without those it was impossible for the
Enemy to approach the City, and give battery; gave order to the Pozzeveraschy,
who by their success were become bold, and formidable to the Enemy, that they
should use all means to scatter them; the Pozzeveraschy betook themselves
coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously to the business which was hard enough otherwise to be effected:
nor was their fortune inferiour to their courage; for coming in the night
season to the Enemies quarters, they slew the Sentinels, and came to the
<hi>Corps de guarde,</hi> and entring thereinto, slew many, and many of them
endeavouring safety by flight abandoned the Oxen, giving the Pozzeveraschy
means not onely to disperse them, but to lead them alive through unusual ways,
but which were well known to them into <hi>Pozzevera,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Genoa,</hi> to the great joy of the City, and no little praise unto
themselves, entring as it were in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph for having done so generous an
action: whereupon the safety of not seeing the Enemies Artillery planted
against their Walls did much depend; so as being made unable to move, they
could neither come to <hi>Genoa,</hi> nor return to <hi>Piedmont:</hi> they
were therefore forced to expect carriage Horses from <hi>France,</hi> which
were suddenly given order for; which preparations were afterwards imploied in
<hi>Italy,</hi> for other more necessary occasions of that war: this loss was
succeeded by the like of <hi>Savignone,</hi> which was taken by the same
Pozzeveraschy, and by other Mountainers of those parts; where Don
<hi>Felice</hi> was said to be with 200 Foot, but ill provided of Victuals or
Ammunition. The Pozzeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raschy went thither with 200 Foot which were sent them
from <hi>Genoa,</hi> and being accompanied with many others of the neighbouring
Villages, they sat down before the Castle, hoping rather to take it by keeping
them from Victuals, then by assault; and they would have soon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained it, and
have taken Don <hi>Felice</hi> prisoner, had not the Duke, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending his
Sons danger, resolved to free him: he therefore chose 500 of his best Foot, and
50 Horse, and having overcome the asperity of the Mountains, he came so
suddenly and unexpectedly upon <pb n="313" facs="tcp:53250:164"/> the assailants, as
quitting their stations, they afforded the Dukes men free access unto the
Castle, and conveniency to take the Dukes Son and the whole Garrison out, and
to return with them: yet this retreat was not without some trouble and loss
unto the Duke; for the Pozze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraschy keeping behind him in those rocky
Mountains; slew some of his men, amongst which, <hi>Crotti,</hi> the Dukes
chiefest Secretary. The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> kept still in <hi>Pavia,</hi>
idle and irresolute; for though a great many of the Dutch were already come;
yet could he not march out for want of moneys to pay the Souldiers, and for
want of other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions; and the fear of breaking with the Crown of
<hi>France</hi> did so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex him, as he knew not what to resolve upon;
especially since he had received Orders from the Court, to be very cautious in
what he should therein do.</p>
            <p>The Duke and Constable being aware of these delays and
perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties grew more encouraged to persevere in the Enterprise; and being
sure that <hi>Feria</hi> would not second his threats with effects, they were
daily less afriad to be assaulted in their quarters; and not having whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
given over their hopes of succour by Sea, and of being recruited from
<hi>France</hi> by Land, they thought they might have more leasure to expect
them. The Commonwealth, on the contrary, which had the Confederates Army still
within their Dominions; and which was not yet out of fear of the Fleets by Sea,
could not be free from apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of danger: wherefore being afflicted with
their so long expectation of succour from <hi>Millain,</hi> they resolved to
put it to a push; and sent <hi>Iovan Vincenzo Imperiale,</hi> Son to <hi>Iovan
Iacomo,</hi> to <hi>Pavia,</hi> who had been Doge a little before, to the end
that by his Reasons, and by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, whereof he carried good store with him, he
might facilitate the Governours coming into the Field: the resolution was very
sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, and the expedition very acceptable; for <hi>l' Imperiale,</hi>
being come unto the Governour removed all impediments by his present moneys,
and wan so much credite by the efficacy of his perswasions and counsels, as he
was admitted into their most secret Consultations, where he wrought it so, as,
the Governour laying aside all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, resolved to go to the delivery
of <hi>Genoa:</hi> he therefore went with those of <hi>Pavia</hi> into
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> and prepared to march into the Field, and to fall upon
the Confederates with a powerful Army: the Dutch who were come, and who were to
come into <hi>Italy,</hi> were 16000, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into four Regiments: one under
Baron <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> another under the Count <hi>di Solmes,</hi> the third
under Count <hi>Sultz,</hi> and the last (which was not yet arrived,) under
<hi>Charles</hi> Count <hi>Mansfield.</hi> Besides these, many Horse were come
from <hi>Polonia</hi> and <hi>Croatia,</hi> to the number of between two and
three thousand; to which the Neapolitan and Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barde Horse being added they
made up 5000: but because so many Forreigners in the body of an Army, went
accompanied with danger of Sedition, Mutiny, and other greater mischiefes; the
Governour who had but few home Forces to counterpoise the Forreigners,
resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take out all the Spaniards and Italians who were in Garrison at
<hi>la Riva,</hi> and send thither a greater number of Dutch in their places:
he sent <hi>Papenhaim</hi> thither with his Regiment, consisting of about 6000
Dutch, to which he added 500 Italian Foot, and 500 Horse; and sent 
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:53250:165"/> back for Count <hi>Iovan Serbellone</hi> with all his
Spaniards and Italians, and kept them in his Army: The Duke and Constable grew
fearful when they saw so great a body of enemies so neer; (for it was
calculated that the Governour, leaving all his Towns well Garrison'd, was to
march into the fields with above 20000 Foot, and 4000 Horse) and their hopes of
the English Fleet, and of new supplies from <hi>France,</hi> being vanish'd,
they began to see plainly that the business of <hi>Genoa</hi> grew daily more
desperate; and that it became them better to think of retreating then of
advancing any further. Leaving therefore <hi>Novi</hi> and <hi>Gavio</hi> well
munited, and in the latter 19 of their greatest Cannon for Battery, which they
could not possibly carry along with them for want of Oxen; and firing
<hi>Ottaggio</hi> they resolved to return into <hi>Piedmont</hi> by the same
way they were come, not having with them above 8000 Foot in very ill order, and
2500 Horse, and some small pieces of Ordnance: It is true they were met in the
County of <hi>Neice</hi> by Prince <hi>Victorio,</hi> with part of the
Garrisons that were left in the Town <hi>della Riviera:</hi> This was the issue
of the ill undertaken Enterprise of <hi>Genoa,</hi> meted out rather by vast
thoughts, and ardent desire of revenge, then by any civil or Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
wisdom.</p>
            <p>When they departed, to the end that their Retreat might be the
less dishonourable, they resolved to go to the taking in of <hi>Savona:</hi>
The same, nay greater difficulties opposed this designe, then had done that of
<hi>Genoa;</hi> the same sterility of soil; the difficulty of the ways,
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for the bringing of Artillery; the weakness and small number of those
they brought, which were unfit for Battery, especially of such new
Fortifications and strong Rampiers as were made to defend the Town; the many
Souldiers and Commanders which were gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from <hi>Genoa,</hi> (for
<hi>Genoa</hi> being freed from danger, they turned all their thoughts and
forces upon defending <hi>Savona)</hi> the smallness and weakness of their
Army: whereas on the contrary, that of <hi>Millain</hi> was multiplied, and
ready to march; so as if when their forces were entire and fresh, some of these
respects kept her from proceeding against <hi>Genoa,</hi> whilst the Governour
was unprovided, and whilst relief from <hi>Naples</hi> was not come to
<hi>Genoa;</hi> what could they hope for in so great an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Affairs?
But the Duke thought it too great a scorn to be forc'd to return to
<hi>Piedmont</hi> weakened in forces and Reputation, not having done any thing
worthy his threats and preparations: He therefore for the honour of their joint
forces, and for the performance of what they had agreed upon at <hi>Susa,</hi>
propounded this advancing towards <hi>Savona</hi> to the Governour; who having
been never to be moved in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the enterprise of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
suffered himself by the Dukes importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and reproches to be perswaded unto
this.</p>
            <p>This Enterprise appeared to have two foundations; one, That they
had discovered new and precise Orders sent from <hi>Spain</hi> to the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, whereby he was absolutely forbidden to come to a Battel; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
supposing that all the Forces in the State of <hi>Millain</hi> would stand idly
looking on, they thought any enterprise feasable: The other, for that they had
received new advertisement that the Fleet at <hi>Marcelles</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come
from out that Haven should appear in those Seas with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits of men, victuals
and munition, at the same time that they should <pb n="315" facs="tcp:53250:165"/> come to
<hi>Savona;</hi> and that landing a great many men, they would keep between
<hi>Savona</hi> and <hi>Genoa</hi> out of a double end; The one, to keep
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from <hi>Genoa;</hi> the other, that they might play upon the City with
their great Guns from Sea, whilst it should be assaulted by the land Army; and
so to facilitate the surrender of <hi>Savona:</hi> And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Prince
<hi>Victorio</hi> had given the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> 40000 Ducates, when
having taken <hi>La Riviera</hi> he was in <hi>Ventimiglia:</hi> Upon these so
sleight and weakly-laid foundations they would once more try their fortune:
Thus leaving their Quarters they marched through <hi>Montferrat</hi> towards
<hi>Acqui,</hi> whither they came within a few days without any disturbance;
For the Genoeses being more desirous to preserve <hi>Savona</hi> then to fall
upon them in the Reer, sent all their men thither: Nor could the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> who was come to <hi>Alessandria,</hi> fall upon them as they
retreated, though he intended so to do: For being got on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back to that
end, and being ready in Arms with his forces; as he was saluted according to
the Military manner, by a Dutch Company, his Horse rose up on end at the noise
of the Musquet shot, and threw the Governour, who was somewhat corpulent, down,
so as he was forc'd to keep his bed for some days. Thus their Retreat proved
fortunate, though between two enemies Armies; yet as the Reer was bringing up
some small pieces of Artillery, with about 800 Horse, they had a bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with some Troops of Horse which were quartered in <hi>Sesse,</hi> a Town of
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> which is upon the way by which the Reer passed: The
Encounter was gallant and stoutly fought; the Spanish Horse were fewer in
number, but coming to blows had the better of the enemy, with little loss unto
themselves; for the French Horse had only breast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates on, and the Spaniards
were armed at all pieces; so as they slew and wounded the enemy without being
hurt themselves: Being at last dis-intangled and got loose, they retreated
commodiously. The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being come to <hi>Acqui,</hi> and persevering in their
intended march to <hi>Savona,</hi> they destin'd <hi>Acqui,</hi> though it were
very weakly walled, for a Rendezvouz for their Arms, and for a safety on their
backs: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaving 3000 of their best Souldiers there in Garison, with
all the Ammunition and provision they could bring from <hi>Gavio,</hi> they
march'd on with the rest, which were not above 8000, towards <hi>Savona.</hi>
When they were come to <hi>Spigno,</hi> a Town which stands in the mid-way,
they made Prince <hi>Victorio</hi> and Marshal <hi>Crickey,</hi> advance with
part of their men to <hi>Cairo,</hi> which was defended by 250 Neopolitans; and
playing upon it with some small Pieces of Artillery, they after having made two
shot, took it upon Articles: But the Governour having recovered his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>all, and finding that they
march'd on still towards <hi>Savona,</hi> held it now no longer time to stand
idle, nor to suffer that Town to be taken whilst he and his Army looked on,
which being of such importance to the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> was also a great
concernment to the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> Setting therefore all other
respects aside, he went out of <hi>Ales<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandria</hi> with 22000 Foot, all very
good men, and with 5000 able Horse, and marched towards <hi>Acqui;</hi> whether
being come, he forthwith pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest himself of all the eminent parts thereabouts,
and planted his Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries; which caused such terrour in the French, who saw
how weak their Rampiers were, and that the Citizens would not for the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r sakes <pb n="316" facs="tcp:53250:166"/> run the
hazard of being sack'd, parleyed presently; and agreeing to march out, the
Souldiers only with their Swords and Daggers, and the Officers with their Horse
and Baggage', but upon obligation to return into <hi>France</hi> by the Country
of the Vallesani, lest they might return to the Army: 2300 Foot marched out;
many who through great weakness were not able to go staying behind: They found
17 Banners left there, 500 Barrels of powder, many Sacks of Victuals, many
Cannon Bullets, Arms, and artificial Fire-works; and which was more
remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the Dukes Wardrobe, wherein were rich Liveries for Pages and
Foot-men, Saddles, Bridles, and other Furniture for Horses, all very richly
wrought; and Moveables to a great value, which the Duke had provided, thinking
assuredly to enter in triumph into <hi>Genoa:</hi> So far had this Prince
suffered himself to be transported by his aspiring imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>The Duke and Constable, finding by the loss of <hi>Acqui</hi>
(which they heard of in <hi>Spigno)</hi> the falshood of the Report that the
Spanish Forces would not move for fear of disturbing the union and friendship
of the two Crowns, they were astonished, seeing in what danger they were of
being assaulted by two enemies Armies, being inclosed between them amidst those
Cliffs: The Duke hearing the news, got immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on Horse-back, and leaving
the care of all things wholly to the Constable, went with some few Gentlemen
towards <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Constable, seeing himself abandoned, termed the
Dukes departure down right running away, and complained of his being left to
manage the business himself alone; and speedily calling back the Marshal from
<hi>Cairo,</hi> with whom came also Prince <hi>Victorio,</hi> they went
altogether to <hi>Bistagno,</hi> where there being a Garison, they were
received without any withstanding: But being aware that the Governour did
advance with part of his forces to fall upon them in that place, and that he
had sent another part thereof to hinder their retreat and victuals, they
resolved to get out of those streights, and to get into the open fields of
<hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Retreat being thus resolved upon, the Constable and the
Marshal, heading the Van, wherein were about 2000 Foot, and almost all the
Horse, they parted early in the morning; and marching apace, they came without
disturbance to <hi>Canelli:</hi> The Prince kept in the Reer, wherein were the
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>st men; and making the Artillery
advance, he also retrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed,
leaving the place to the enemy; who ere he was well got out entred <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>stagnano,</hi> and pursued him without
any intermission, so fast, as being got near unto him upon the going to of the
day, in the Valley of <hi>Mun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>stero,</hi> they faced one another within Musquet shot: Some small
Skirmishes passed here, which the night parted, without much loss or advantage
to either side: The mean time, the Prince being careful of the Artillery and
other incumbrances (which he had much ado to get up the Mountains) made great
diligence be made in the climbing up; and at the same time minced his own
defence against the enemy, who were at his heels: But hearing that at last the
Artillery was got to the Mountains top, he also retreated thither without any
trouble; for the enemy having no order to fight, nor to advance, retreated to
<hi>Bistagno,</hi> and suffered them to retreat quietly into <hi>Canelli,</hi>
where he was received by his Father, and by the Constable, with great applause,
who had been <pb n="317" facs="tcp:53250:166"/> in great anxiety for him. The Governour
would have made use of the present occasion, and would have assaulted the Reer,
and taken away all the Artillery and Baggage; But Don <hi>Ieronimo
Pimontello,</hi> Don <hi>Lewis di Cordua,</hi> and Don <hi>Francisco
Padiglia,</hi> took him off from so seasonable a resolution; first by
perswasions, then by protesting against it; who out of private emulation,
envying (as it was thought by many) the glory of so happy an atchievement,
proposed unto him <hi>the precise Orders of the Court to the contrary; the
danger and assured ruine which would insue of things should not succeed well;
which if they should do, the good thereof was not to be paralell'd with the
danger: For what more can we expect,</hi> said they, <hi>if we should get the
Victory, but the routing of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of a miserable Army, which being
already consumed of themselves, cannot prejudice us: but say we should be
worsted, what danger would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by result to the Kings affairs, both from the
Venetians who are ready to make war in the</hi> Cremonese; <hi>from the French
in the</hi> Valtoline, <hi>and from the Duke and Constable, if they shall have
the better of the Conflict? Besides, that the Confederates party, who were now
quite overthrown, if they should get heart again by any the least encounter,
they would for certain become more fierce and fervent then ever.</hi> The
Governour, who was better vers'd in State affairs then in what belonged to war,
suffer'd himself to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by those who were better experienced in war
then he, and so let slip a signal occasion of putting an undoubted end to all
the present war with one little action: The like advice being given to the
Marquess of <hi>San Croce</hi> in <hi>Savona</hi> made him keep from marching
out of <hi>Savona,</hi> and from falling upon the enemy on the Reer in their
retreat from <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> and <hi>Spigno;</hi> it being certain that if
<hi>San Croce</hi> and the Governour had known how to make use of the occasion
by inclosing the enemy in those difficult places, they would undoubtedly have
ruined them: And yet the remainders of this Army, ruin'd as it was, which the
Spanish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders thought not worthy their destroying, did within a while
after ruine the Governours intire Army; and not long after the Spaniards needed
to be protected and defended against those weak remainders: Thus doth Fortune
often vary the condition of humane affairs; and the loss of opportunity doth
oft times carry victory to those who in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood would have been
overcome.</p>
            <p>The Genoeses being thus freed from fear of the enemies Army; the
first thing they did was to think of recovering what they had lost, and of what
the enemy were yet masters: The first Town that returned to the obedience of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> was <hi>Novi,</hi> wherein was a French Regiment under Monsieur
<hi>della Grange;</hi> partly by means of the <hi>Pozzeveraschi;</hi> partly by
the means of the Towns-men and other inhabitants of those parts, who being
dispers'd by the war went wandering up and down about the neighbouring Towns.
About 300 whereof met at the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins Covent, not far from that Town; part
whereof entring by night, by a Vault under ground, into the Town; and being
assisted by some of the Burgers who were acquainted with the Plot, first slew
the Sentinels, and then forced the Gate <hi>della Valle,</hi> and let in their
Companions by the Portal which they opened with their Axes; who going jointly
to the Gate <hi>della Strada,</hi> where most of the French Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison were,
they put them to the Sword, and made themselves masters <pb n="318" facs="tcp:53250:167"/>
of the Gate: Then running about the Town, and putting it into an Alarm, they
slew all the French they met with; and then going to the Castle, whither the
greatest part of them were with their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour retired, they begirt it on all
sides, threatning to kill them if they did not immediately surrender the
Castle: The French being astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at so sudden and unexpected an accident,
yielded before the Sun ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing upon discretion of the enemy: About 300 of them
were slain in this conflict, amongst which the Governours Son; a young youth,
who contrary to his Fathers Example, chose rather to fall manfully with his
Sword in hand, then to purchase his life upon base conditions: The number of
the Prisoners were twice as many; the chief whereof were the Governour Monsieur
<hi>de la Grange,</hi> his Lieutenant, <hi>il</hi> Signior <hi>di
Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagrada,</hi> and his Brother, who was a Knight of <hi>Malta;</hi> Monsieur
<hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neville;</hi> the Baron <hi>Lattè,</hi> nine Ensigne-bearers,
and four Lieutenants. The recovery of <hi>Ovada, Rossiglione</hi> and
<hi>Campo,</hi> succeeded that of <hi>Novi,</hi> which were abandoned by the
enemy; who flying so to shun death, met with it, by being miserably slain and
cut in pieces by the country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: The recovery of <hi>Gavio</hi> proved
somewhat harder; wherein were about 1800 Souldiers under Monsieur <hi>di
Sonsi.</hi> About this time the 2000 Dutch came to <hi>Genoa,</hi> commanded by
<hi>Verrema,</hi> who, together with Monsieur <hi>Bozzoloe</hi>'s men, and some
others were sent by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, under the Baron <hi>Batteville,</hi> to
recover the Town. Being come to the Town they took up their Quarters, planted
their Batteries, and fell to work; but first they try'd the defendants, and
began to treat with them upon surrender upon Articles: whereupon they quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agreed; so as the Town remained in the power of the assailants, but not the
Castle; they therefore planted their Batteries against the Castle, and plaid
upon it for some days; and though by reason of the far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> they could not prejudice it much by
their shot, the defendants yielded it upon agreement to the Common-wealths
Commanders, who recovered it in less time, and with fewer men by much, then the
Duke and Constable had taken it, with so powerful an Army. There were therein
19 great Pieces of Artillery, great store of Arms and Powder, of artificial
fires, and other warlike preparation, which were left there by the enemy, and
were taken by the Captains of the Commonwealth; 17 Colours were likewise
therein taken, part belonging to the King of <hi>France,</hi> part to the Duke;
which were all brought to <hi>Genoa</hi> in a kind of Triumph: All the people
and Citizens ran with great joy to see it; who could not satisfie themselves
with seeing those Tools brought cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the City, which were but a little
before destin'd to make them Captives. The Duke and Constable could not relieve
these places, as they faithfully promised the Commanders whom they left to
defend them when they went from thence; and as so noble a Train of Artillery
left behinde them obliged them to do, in regard of the Governours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
coming out against them, and of the necessity of their retiring from
<hi>Canelli;</hi> from whence they afterwards recovered <hi>Asti,</hi> where
they consulted rather how to defend what remained, then to keep what they had
gotten.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Feria</hi> was at this time come from <hi>Acqui</hi> to
<hi>Rocca a' Arazzo,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Occimiano,</hi> a Town in
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> four miles distant from <pb n="319" facs="tcp:53250:167"/>
               <hi>Cassal;</hi> whither Don <hi>Gonzallo di Cordua,</hi> a Captain of good
account came to him by order from the King, out of <hi>Flanders,</hi> to be
assistant in Counsel to the Governour, and in the managing of the present war;
wherein the Governour who was not over well experienced, and who had Captains
and Counsellors about him, rather Rivals then Confidents; had need of a
Counsellor and Moderator, who might not only be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, but faithful: And
Don <hi>Gonzallo</hi> was allied unto the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, wherefore he had reason
to confide in him. They consulted of all things in <hi>Occimiano;</hi> wherein
the Consultors differed in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to attempt <hi>Asti</hi> or
<hi>Vercelles,</hi> so to open their way into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> would be long
and laboursome Enterprises, and the event uncertain; wherein, together with the
ruine of their whole Army, their Honour was much hazarded, without any apparent
signe of profit; for if peace should be made they must be necessitated to
restore them: And it was already supposed for certain, that the King was not
inclined to pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess himself of any thing belonging to the Duke, with an
intention to detain it: To what purpose would it be then to take so much pains,
to shed so much blood, and spend so much money, in taking a place which was
afterwards to be restored? It was therefore agreed that it would be better and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>arer by making In rodes into the
open Towns of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and by destroying and burning them; and so to
afflict the Duke by those means, as that he might be quiet for the future; and
that he might not afterwards think it lawful to disturb the peace of
<hi>Italy</hi> upon any sleight occasion: Thus they thought that without danger
of wasting their men, or hazarding their reputation upon the uncertain taking
of a Town, they might safely enter <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and overcome it with a
fresh and numerous Army, and with the <hi>Polack</hi> and <hi>Croat</hi>
Cavalry, which were naturally good at In rodes and the laying of Countries
waste: For that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates Army being weakned, and almost annihilated,
would not dare to fight, nor appear against them in open field; which
resolution being divulged infused such terror into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> as not
only the Inhabitants of the weaker Towns, but even the very Citizens of
<hi>Turin,</hi> not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves safe within those walls, nor under the
shelter of that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, they fled towards the Alpes with all the best things
they had; in so much as the Duke began to taste of that fright and fear in his
own Territories, which he had a little before occasioned in <hi>Genoa:</hi> But
this resolution, which undoubtedly was the safest, was out-voted by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
which was, to attempt the taking of some Towns in <hi>Piedmont</hi> first; and
this, not so much out of good reason of war, and for securing their entry,
which they resolved to do howsoever; as out of Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; thinking it not
becoming the Grandezza and Reputation of so nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous an Army to do nothing but
make In-rod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s, and lay the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try waste; They were the more easily induced to give way to this, for that
they thought they might secretly, and without much difficulty, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their
desires: Fixing their eyes therefore, according to wont, upon the Cities of
<hi>Asti</hi> or <hi>Vercelles,</hi> or upon the Towns of <hi>Verrua</hi> or
<hi>Crescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tino,</hi> they kept still in <hi>Occimiano,</hi> a place almost
equally distant from those four Towns; providing Bottoms to throw a Bridge over
the <hi>Poe</hi> at <hi>Pontestura;</hi> giving out that they would pass
thereby over either to <hi>Vercelles</hi> or <hi>Crescentino;</hi> to the end
that the Duke not being able for <pb n="320" facs="tcp:53250:168"/> want of men, to furnish
all those Towns at one and the same time, might by betaking himself to defend
some one of them, afford them opportunity of turning upon that which should be
worst pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; which thinking they might easily take, it might open the way
for them to prosecute their resolution of prejudicing <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this design, which by speedy execution might easily be
effected, was hindred by the accustomed, and almost natural slow proceeding of
the Spaniards; for though the throwing the Bridge over at <hi>Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuna</hi>
made the Duke bethink himself of <hi>Crescentino;</hi> and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he
came with the rest of his men to the Banks of <hi>Poe,</hi> leaving Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> with only 2000 men in <hi>Asti. Feria</hi> went immediately
towards <hi>Asti</hi> with his Army, out of a double intent; either to draw the
Duke thither with all his men, and so leaving the rest of his Towns unprovided,
and as it were abandoned, <hi>Feria</hi> might make use of the occasion, and
turn upon some other of them, and take it easily; or else, if the Duke, not to
leave his other Towns abandoned, should not come to defend <hi>Asti,</hi> he
might possess himself of the ways about <hi>Asti;</hi> and keeping it from
being relieved by the Duke, might easily make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self master of it: but being
come to the <hi>Osteria della San Croce,</hi> where he kept idle for some days,
and suffering his Horse to scoure the Field only, without passing over <hi>la
Versa,</hi> he afforded the Duke opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to send the Marshal first thither
with 3000 Foot, and to go after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thither himself with the rest: failing
therefore in his design of taking this City unprovided, he fell to his other
design, to go to some one of the other three Towns, which by reason of the
necessity of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending <hi>Asti</hi> were abandoned. <hi>Verrua</hi> was that
which was pitch'd upon, as being neerest, more commodious, of more profit and
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; for by taking it he should so divide <hi>Crescentino,</hi> and
all the County of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> from the County of <hi>Asti,</hi> as the
one should not be able to assist the other: nor did he fear the taking of it,
as well by reason of the littleness thereof, as also for that it was only
guarded by 300 Country people: but the same slownesse, and irresolution of the
Spanish genius, ruin'd this designe also, which required haste
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n execution; for if the chief of
the Army, without stirring from the quarters where they were, had entertained
the Duke in the defence of <hi>Asti,</hi> and had at the same time sent a
flying Squadron of Horse with Musketeers <hi>en croupe,</hi> they might easily
have taken it at the very first, or at least have possess'd themselves of the
Passes thereabouts, and have block'd up all succour so, as it must soon fall
into the possession of the Army which was to come soon after: but either not
loving to divide their Forces, as being too contrary to that security which
they so much studied, (so thinking that whatsoever diligence the Enemy could
make, they could not keep that little Castle from them;) they will go thither
with their united Army. Thus parting from the Banks of <hi>Versa,</hi> without
having attempted any thing against the City of <hi>Asti,</hi> they went with
all their Forces to <hi>Verrua.</hi> Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> and the Marshal
march'd out with 800 Horse, part French, part Piedmontese, to fall upon the
Reer; and seeing some Troops of the Dutch Cavalry, which march'd under Colonel
<hi>Lillo,</hi> far from the body of Horse, they assaulted them; and having the
better of the business, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd <pb n="321" facs="tcp:53250:168"/> them, and
wounded <hi>Lillo</hi> very sorely; and had utterly routed them, had not some
other of their friends Horse come in to succour them; who charging the French
and Piedmontese Horse, slew many of them, and amongst the rest two Captains,
the Baron <hi>d' Hermanza,</hi> the Dukes Commissary-General of Horse: so as
being repuls'd, the Spanish Army might quietly pursue their March; and yet
neither this, nor any other impediment which they met with, which retarded the
proceeding of the Army, nor yet the Castle of <hi>Rubella,</hi> which being in
the mid-way would not yield till it was batter'd, would have hindred the taking
of <hi>Verrua</hi> much; the Army not finding it any way better provided with
Garrison, or better fortified, then it was when they went from their first
quarters to take it: so as they might have done the same thing which they might
have done before <hi>Asti,</hi> with their flying Squadron; for though the
Duke, when he was free of the danger of <hi>Asti,</hi> went with such of his
men as were readiest into the Field, and coasting along by the Enemy, intended
him no good; yet because the way by which he saw them march led both to
<hi>Cheri</hi> and to <hi>Verrua,</hi> and that he knew not whither of the two
they meant to go to; he was forced to suspend his resolution, and be ready to
go whithersoever he should see them bend: moreover, when he saw them incline
towards <hi>Verrua,</hi> he must if he would succour it, go to
<hi>Crescentino,</hi> which was on the other side of the <hi>Poe:</hi> and not
being able to pass to the other side, but by the stone Bridge which was neer
<hi>Tarino,</hi> he was fain to take a large compass to pass his men over it,
to <hi>Crescentino:</hi> so as the Governour had conveniency enough to have
found that Town unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, and to have done what he pleased with it: but
neither he nor Don <hi>Gonsallo,</hi> who then order'd and provided all things
under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, being able to make use of so happy an occasion, lost it
by these and other negligences; and by the destruction of that flourishing
Army, made that little Burrough, which was not otherwise considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, famous
to posterity; and with no little loss of honour, raised up the Dukes almost
quite lost reputation. <hi>Verrua</hi> is a little Town, upon the right side of
the <hi>Poe,</hi> not of any consideration but for the seat thereof: it stands
upon the top of a little Hill, stony and broken on all sides except on the
South, wherein somewhat a gentler descent it su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stains a little Suburbs, which
cover almost all the descent of that Hill: on the North side the <hi>Poe</hi>
enlargeth it self, leaving <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>a
little plain in the midst, full of Trees: it hath not any Fortification, except
a little Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle upon the top of the Hill, from which if you take away an
ancient Tower, it is more like an old ruine, then a Fortification: the Suburbs
which lies upon the descent of the Hill is begirt with an old weak Wall; the
Country about is full of Hills which inviron the Hill whereon <hi>Verrua</hi>
stands.</p>
            <p>The Governour incamp'd himself upon these little Hills on the East
side, to the end that <hi>Montferrat</hi> being on his back, and the
<hi>Poe</hi> on his right hand, he might receive Provisions both by Land and
Water: afterwards extending his quarters towards the West, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of falling
to assault the Town at his first arrival, and of presently possessing himself
of so weak and ill guarded a Town, he (as if he were to besiege a great Town,
in the face of a powerful Enemy-Army) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fortifie his Quarters with
Trenches and other Works; and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <pb n="322" facs="tcp:53250:169"/> for provisions,
which were but slowly brought, he took no care to block up the
<hi>Avenues;</hi> insomuch as soon as he saw the Enemies Army bend towards
<hi>Verrua,</hi> having sent the Marquess <hi>di San Rerano</hi> thither with
his Regiment of a thousand Foot, there was not any one that moved either to
stop him by the way, or to hinder his coming into the Town: which he did at
full noon, and in sight of the Enemy by the Gate of the neighbouring Suburbs,
neer the Enemies Quarters, with no little note of infamy to those that suffer'd
it. The Duke whilst the Governour minded nothing but making of Baracadoes and
Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piers, sent to the Marshal, who was left with Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> to
defend <hi>Asti,</hi> to come after him, and joyn with him in
<hi>Crescentino,</hi> whither he speedily marched; and coming with his men
first thither, whither the Marshal came also within some days after with 5000
French, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himself wholly to defence: being past by the <hi>Poe</hi>
from <hi>Crescentino</hi> to <hi>Verrua,</hi> he found that the Enemy, having
quitted the Banks of the River, and the Plain, minded nothing but fortifying
himself upon the little Hill; and thinking that it made much for the defence of
<hi>Verrua,</hi> to make himself master of the Plain before it, he presently
past over some of his men in boats, and quarter'd himself there without any
gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying: being then advised by some of his Officers to defend
<hi>Verrua</hi> on the upper side, and to abandon the Suburbs which was upon
the hanging of the Hill, as that which being weakly walled was not tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
nor was the main business much concern'd therein; he contrary to their opinion
undertook the defence thereof, thinking that any what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever opposition would
either abate the edge of the Enemies Forces, or else weary them, and occasion
delay: which afterwards proved much for the defence of the Town: he therefore
began to perfect a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veline before the Suburbs, which was formerly begun by
the Towns folk, which did partly cover, partly flank the Wall on the Front; and
placing a sufficient Garrison, he Plat-form'd the Wall it self, and afterwards
cut thorow the very Suburbs with a threefold Trench, at equal distances: to the
end that those who should assault the Raveline; and the front of the Suburbs,
should not only be annoyed by those Trenches which arose as did the Suburbs;
but that if the defendants should be repuls'd at the first onset, they might
have more advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous places to retreat unto behind them; from whence
reassuming the defence they might make head again, and driving the assailants
from what they had first taken, might recover it with more ease: he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
placed some Artillery in fit places of the highest Hills, which served not only
to defend the Raveline and the Suburb, but to offend the Enemy who were
incamped on the opposite Hills; and (which made the defence more safe) he threw
a Bridge of boats over the <hi>Poe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Banks of
<hi>Crescentino</hi> and the Plain before <hi>Verrua;</hi> by meanes whereof
those who were quarter'd in <hi>Crescentino</hi> might communicate with those
of the Plain, and those who were in <hi>Verrua;</hi> and the latter might be
relieved and refreshed by the former, whereby the defence might be made more
easie, and consequently might last the longer: nor herewithall content, for the
greater security of the Bridge, and of the Garrison which lay in the Pla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n, he erected a great Trench between
the point of the Hill towards the East, and the Banks of <hi>Poe</hi> which did
shelter almost all the Plain and the Bridge. Things being <pb n="323" facs="tcp:53250:169"/> thus ordered, the Governour who not making any opposition was this
mean while preparing how to offend the Town, found the business harder then he
at first imagined it to be; for to fall absolutely to assault the Town with all
his Forces, as he was advised to do by many, though it might peradventure have
proved the shorter, and more efficacious course, yet was it too severe,
especially for him, there being so many Souldiers to make defence, and he being
naturally averse to hazard himself; for the assailants being commanded by the
Hills, by the Trenches which cross'd through the Suburbs, and by the Batteries
which were placed upon the Hills, they would not have been able to advance, nor
without much danger have continued the assault; and when they should have made
some advancement they would have found it very difficult to intrench
themselves, and shelter themselves from the imminency of the situation; so as
they would have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd with much loss, and would have been forc'd at
last to forsake their stations, which they had possess'd themselves of with
much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and loss of blood: to drive the Enemy from the Banks of the
Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though at first it would not have been very hard to have done, yet when
the great Trench was made, it was thought impossible, by reason of the
continual succour which might be had by the Bridge, and of their being plai'd
upon from the higher places: which was soon known in some attempts which they
made, wherein the assailants were with no small loss repuls'd: to deprive them
of the use of the Bridge, which would have been the most advantagious and
safest course, was not easie to be done; for being shelter'd partly by the
Hill, and partly by the great Trench, it could not have been easily beaten down
by their Artillery; though two of the Boats were sunk, and the Bridge loosned
by a Battery planted against it by Don <hi>Philippo,</hi> Son to the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess
<hi>Spinola;</hi> for they being supplied by the diligence used in fastning of
Boats together, and in substituting others in the places of those that were
sunk, the wonted conveniency of passage was soon provided for; and to the end
that it might not be subject another time to the same chance, the Duke made it
be drawn a little lower, where it was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shelter'd from battery by the
Wood in the Plain, which kept it from being seen: the like provision had, for
another disaster which a few days after was occasioned by the fullness of the
River, which driving a Mill broke the Bridge, and disordered the Boats, did
seasonably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the loss which was received: the least of evils, since all
other ways was held impossible, and desperate, was to begin with expugning the
Suburbs, which being won by little and little, would make way for them to get
to the top of the Hill, where the Town and Castle stood: but here they would
also have enough to do; it being to be opposed not only by the Raveline, and by
other Fortifications made by the Duke, but by the very situation of the place;
for the rising of the Hill whereon the Suburbs stand, being on both sides
rocky, and hard to climb, it was unaccessible on any of those sides; they must
therefore necessarily attaque it on the Front; which being very narrow, a small
number of defendants, would be able to make it good against a much greater
number of assailants; and hence it was that the Duke was not prejudiced by the
scarcity of combatants, nor the Governour advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged <pb n="324" facs="tcp:53250:170"/> by
numbers thereof; and notwithstanding the oppugners being confident that their
labour and diligence would overcome all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, thought they might prove
greater then they expected; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was necessary at last to do
something, they made some Trenches against the Front of the Suburbs, and making
their approaches at the same time, they came to an assault; which being given
by Don <hi>Lewis di Cordua,</hi> and by Count <hi>Sultz</hi> his Dutch, was
stoutly withstood by those within; for though they were twice entred, they were
twice beaten back: the third assault made the assailants masters of the
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs but they were forced to quit it that very night by the Marshall, who
was sent by the Duke to recover it: he coming out of the Rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, made
himself master of some of the Enemies Trenches and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: this Raveline
may be said to have been, for a while, the stumbling-block against which they
oft times gave; and the business was brought to such a condition, as it being
often times taken and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, at last, as being a place too prejudicial,
and too much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted, it was abandoned by both sides; and served for a
while for nothing, but for a Stocado for the encounters, and for a Scene or
Stage, on which these valiant Souldiers did alternately by death Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. The
assailants finding themselves more prejudiced then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged by assaults,
fell to play with their Cannon and Musket-shot, not upon the Rampiers or
Fortifications, but to beat down the Houses, and kill the Souldiers who
defended the Trenches; and though the Houses which were but weak were at last
thrown down; yet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that those ruines made nothing for the main business,
they began to make Mines, hoping thereby to effect their work with less
preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and loss of men: but neither did they succeed better therein, by
reason of the extraordinary diligence and vigilancy of those within; who having
very cunningly made counter-mines, sometimes made them play against the Enemy,
and by disturbing the Enemies proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings rendred them vain and unefficacious:
the defendants becoming this mean while more hardy; and not being content to
stand upon their def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nce, made
some sallies out upon the Enemies Quarters; but fared not so well therein, as
whilst they stood upon their defence; for they were much prejudiced thereby;
and more particularly in a Camisado by night, made by 1500 French, led on by
Monsieur <hi>di Vallentienes,</hi> who went to fall upon the Italians Trenches;
which lying utmost to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West were quartered farthest off: but the
assault being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liantly sustained, and the assailants beaten back,
<hi>Vallentienes</hi> remained prisoner there, and 400 of his men were slain
upon the place; which causing the defendants to betake themselves to defence
only, wherein they were advantaged by their Situation and Fortifications, they
durst not sally out any more; but minding the motions of the Enemy, were
content to keep them aloof off from their Ammunition: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the
assailants finding the business grow daily worse and worse began to doubt the
effecting of it; finding how far the Dukes dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, industry and wariness,
accompanied with the strength of the situation, and the condition of his
Quarters, did exceed the greatness of their Forces: Affairs were brought to
that pass, as they were not now to think barely of the expugning of
<hi>Verrua,</hi> unless they did first, <pb n="325" facs="tcp:53250:170"/> or at the same
time beat the Enemy from their Quarters at <hi>Crescentino;</hi> which was
impossible to do without dividing their Army; and to boot, that this dividing
of the Army was contrary to the Governours geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, and to the mind of the
chief Commanders of the Army, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to proceed warily, these Quarters
were as hard to be taken, as was <hi>Verrua;</hi> having <hi>Crescentino,</hi>
a strong place, on their backs, the River before them, and beyond the River the
Quarters of <hi>Verrua,</hi> which was joyn'd by the Bridge to those of
<hi>Crescentino;</hi> on the right hand the <hi>Dora Baltea,</hi> with a Bridge
of Boats, by which all Provisions and necessary Ammunitions were brought to the
Camp from <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and this Bridge was at both ends very well munited
with two small Forts; on the left hand, which was the place the Duke doubted
most, because of the Bridge which the Governour still kept at
<hi>Pontestura,</hi> it was shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by a long Trench flank'd with Bulwarks,
which beginning from <hi>Crescentino</hi> reached to the Rivers side: the banks
also on <hi>Crescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi>'s side, as well above, as below the Quarters,
were secured by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Corps de guarde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These difficulties which were thought not to be overcome being
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, doubtlesly the best course would have been to have quitted the
Enterprize, chiefly at a time when the Army was not afflicted with sickness,
which ensued afterwards, and when the Season was proper for them to betake
themselves to some other Enterprize; for to perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere obstinately against so
many difficulties was no better then to bury so gallant and powerful an Army
before so igneble a Castle: But the first building of the bridge at
<hi>Pontestura,</hi> where it was given out that they would go either to
<hi>Crescentino</hi> or <hi>Verrua,</hi> the change of this after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the
Enterprizes of <hi>Asti</hi> and <hi>Vercelles,</hi> their not persevering
therein, but betaking themselves to that of <hi>Verrua,</hi> would not suffer
them so much as to think of such a resolution. The Governour and other
Commanders thought themselves too much obliged to persevere before
<hi>Verrua,</hi> lest it might be conceived, that so flourishing and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
an Army changing their Sails so oft should go wandring up and down here and
there, as if they were not resolved what Enterprize to fall upon, nor minde to
do any thing: To the fear of losing too much reputation, if in this condition
of affairs they should rise from before <hi>Verrua,</hi> was added their
expectation of more men which were shortly to come to the Camp. Four thousand
Foot came very soon from <hi>Genoa</hi> of those who were under <hi>Guasco</hi>
and <hi>Pecchio;</hi> new Levies of Foot were made in <hi>Naples;</hi> and
<hi>Charles</hi> Count <hi>Mansfield</hi> was to come speedily into the State
of <hi>Millain</hi> with his Regiment of 4000 Foot and 1000 Horse: And these
recruits being added to the Army, enabling them to make two Camps, one whereof
might fall upon the Quarters at <hi>Crescentino,</hi> and the other keep still
before <hi>Verrua;</hi> it was held that the Duke being assaulted at one and
the same time on two sides would be worsted at least in one, and the victory in
one part did secure the victory on the other. They were yet more invited
hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the diversion which they expected from the maritime parts; for the
Marquers of S<hi rend="sup">ta</hi> 
               <hi>Croce</hi> was to enter <hi>Piedmont</hi> with 8000 good
Foot of the Kings and Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ese; and
to this purpose 500 Horse were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to him under <hi>Manfrine
Castiglione,</hi> which together with 200 <pb n="326" facs="tcp:53250:171"/> which the
Commonwealth was to pay, were to be a safeguard to the Foot, whilest they
should enter into the Plain of <hi>Mondovi:</hi> In which case the Duke must
either be forced to abandon <hi>Verrua,</hi> and to relieve that other part
which was wholly destitute of defence, or, that he might maintain
<hi>Verrua,</hi> leave that other part to be prey'd upon by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army:
To which so e're of these the Duke should betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, the Spaniards would
assuredly have the victory, either on the one or on the other side, and
peradventure on both; and the victory in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side would have satisfied the
Kings intention, which was not, quite to ruine the Duke, but to keep him under:
Moreover, the Dukes For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were not such, nor so many, as that they could of
themselves make any long stay or resistance at <hi>Verrua;</hi> and the less,
for that being depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of almost all external helps, he had not so much as
reason to hope for any, by reason of the continual troubles of <hi>France</hi>
which totally cut him off from any. Out of these hopes, and out of these
probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of succour, the Governour persevered in the Enterprise of
<hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rua,</hi> and the Duke kept constant, and undaunted in the defence of
this little Burrough, against so great Forces, and so many preparations, and
upon so many disadvantages; and he succeeded therein; for the Governour failed
not only in his hopes and calculations, but the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Camp grew daily
worse and worse: the sickness which was begun in the Camp did so increase, as
not only many of the common Souldiers, but even the chief Officers were
infected with it, and many of them died: three Camp-masters died, and all the
rest fell generally sick; as many Serjeants, Officers, Commanders, and persons
of Quality, who were neer about the Governours own person; nay, he himself
being infected with the Disease was carryed to <hi>Pontestura</hi> for cure;
leaving the charge of the Army with Don <hi>Gonzallo,</hi> rather in a posture
to retreat, then to continue the Enterprise.</p>
            <p>This so sore sickness was not occasioned only by the influence of
the intemperate air which was excessive hot this Summer, and which in those
boggy and plashy parts became pestilential, but the great labour and hardships
which the Souldiers endured, and chiefly the scarcity of victuals, of which
those that were brought by the <hi>Poe</hi> were often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the
Dukes men, who scowred up and down on the opposite Shore, hindring Navigation,
and sometimes seized on the boats which brought provision; and those that came
by <hi>Montferrat</hi> were stopt by those of that Country; either out of the
hatred they bore to the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, or, as some would have it, by private
Orders from their Prince, who would never declare himself for the Spaniards,
but hated them extreamly, though the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had spent, and
fought so much to protect him against the Duke, who would have suppress'd him.
Hence also arose great scarcity of Fodder for the Horses, which having wasted
all that was neer hand went far off to fetch it, not without great weariness
and danger: the want of moneys added much to all these mischiefs, whereof very
little or none came from <hi>Spain;</hi> and their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Provisions were
already spent: Pay being therefore wanting, the Souldiers were brought to so
miserable a condition, as not being able to provide for covering their
nakedness, they could neither fence them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the excessive heat of
Summer, nor from the cold of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="327" facs="tcp:53250:171"/> which drew on: as
one evil therefore draws on another, many mischievous accidents proceeded from
hence in the administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the War; streightness and difficulty in
Ammunition, want of Military Discipline, contumacy and disobedience amongst the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Souldiers; the Officers who were half sick, and half amazed, not being
able to make their Souldiers obey them, who were tatter'd, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd, and ill
paid: supply came in very slowly and scarely; very few Souldiers, and far short
of the need and expectation, came from <hi>Naples;</hi> and <hi>Mansfields</hi>
Souldiers, who came late into the State of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> refused to go
into the Field till they had received their Pay. <hi>San Croce</hi>'s
diversion, whereupon they did chiefly relie, proved also vain: he was to have
entred <hi>Piedmont</hi> with those Forces which were in <hi>Savona;</hi> and
with <hi>Manfrino</hi> his five Horse, by the way of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vona,</hi> such an
expedition at that time and by that way would have produced three very good
effects. First, entring the enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which did abound in Victuals,
wanting Forts and Ammuniiion, and which was bere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t of all defence, he might have easily possess'd
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of it, without any gainsaying; by this diversion if made in a
sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable time, have very much helped the business of <hi>Verrua;</hi> and
last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the River of <hi>Genoa</hi> being by the interposition of this Army
cut off from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and (consequently) deprived of all hopes of
succour, it would at the very appearance of the Gallies have been abandoned by
the Garrisons of <hi>Piedmont:</hi> so as, of it self, it would have faln to
the Commonwealth. <hi>San Croce</hi>'s genius, who was better vers'd in
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine affairs then in band service, and loved not to go far from the shore,
opposed this resolution, which certainly would have been the most commodious
and best for the common cause: it was opposed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by that which serves always
for an excuse to any Commander, for either not beginning, or not prosecuting an
enterprise, the scarcity of provisions; wherefore being resolved that the
recovery of <hi>Riviera</hi> should precede his entrance into
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> it was conceived that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate emulation between him and the
Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> bore greater sway with him, then any respect of the
common Cause: wherefore not caring for the good success of the enterprise of
<hi>Verrua,</hi> he was not displeased that his rival might reap but little
honour thereby: parting therefore about the midst of <hi>Iuly</hi> from
<hi>Savona,</hi> accompanied by two Senators, <hi>Iovan Battista Saluzzo,</hi>
and <hi>Agostine Centurione,</hi> who were chosen Commissaries by the
Commonwealth, at whose expence, and in whose name the whole business was
carried on; and carrying with him 8000 Foot, and two Troops of Horse, they
betook themselves to the recovery of <hi>la Riviera;</hi> the first in order
was the City of <hi>Albenga,</hi> which being first assaulted came first into
the power of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, though it were recruited but some days before
both with Men and Victuals by the Gallies of <hi>Marcelles:</hi> the battery
began from the Gallies, which by their Cannon beat down the Houses; for the
City stood within Musket-shot of the Sea-shore: but that battery doing but
little harm, the people were that mean while landed, and two great Cannons,
which being level'd against the Gate and Wall which we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e towards the Sea; after having plai'd upon them a
while, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants began to apprehend the assault, which they saw was
preparing <pb n="328" facs="tcp:53250:172"/> to be given: so as beginning to parley, they
yielded within a few hours, upon Articles; that the Captains should march out
with Arms and Baggage, and the Souldiers with their Swords, as also they were
not to serve for that Summer against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. <hi>Albenga</hi> being taken, all the Towns till you come to
<hi>Porto Mauritio, Oneglia</hi> being therein comprehended, most of them being
without Walls, and abandoned by the Dukes men, return'd under the obedience of
the Commonwealth: from hence they went to <hi>Porto Mauritio,</hi> a place
strongly situated, munited with Artillery, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a good Garrison in it, and
abundantly provided of Ammunition; it stands upon a great Rock, which being for
the greatest part invironed by the Sea, is as it were a <hi>Peninsula:</hi>
their Men and Artillery being landed, they had no little labour to draw them up
those craggy cliffs, for many necessary things were wanting for the train of
Artillery, and the weather was then very hot. <hi>Thomaso Raggio, Iovan
Battista Ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and <hi>Iacomo Moniglia,</hi> three of those Gentlemen
who had raised and maintained seven Companies at their own expence, and had
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually served the Commonwealth with them very affectionately, had the
care thereof given them; who not only by their Authority, but by their example,
brought them in a short time to fitting places: they raised three Batteries,
two on the Flank, and one behind; and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants ordered their defences
very fittingly against these Batteries: by two days continual battery a breach
was made, fitting for an assault; and the three forenamed Gentlemen were ready,
with their Companies, to give an assault; when the Defendants, who had inriched
themselves by booty taken at <hi>Ottaggio</hi> and <hi>Pieve,</hi> being loth
to adventure what they had gotten, parlied, and on the third day surrendred the
place upon the same terms that <hi>Albenga</hi> had done: but the Kings
Souldiers missing the prey which they thought they should have had if they had
taken the Town by assault, turn'd upon many of the neighbouring Towns,
plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and sacking them, to the great grief of the Commissaries, who could
not bear with so great mischief done to the Subjects of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, or
with such an affront to themselves; and finding that the Kings Captains took no
care to prevent such an inconvenience, <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maso Raggio,</hi> a man of a
great spirit, who upon all occasions had shew'd much zeal towards the affairs
of the Commonwealth, offer'd to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy this inconvenience by force of Arms;
which offer being accepted of, he was sent with many Companies of Souldiers, to
suppress this prejudice done unto the Country by the Kings Souldiers; who
hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his coming joyn'd together in a body; and yet he had the good luck
to make them soon retreat; and imbarquing themselves in the Gallies with
<hi>San Croce,</hi> they went some of them to <hi>Savona,</hi> some to
<hi>Genoa;</hi> for <hi>San Croce,</hi> by reason of the excessive
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eat, and of the sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness amongst
the Souldiers, would not continue the enterprise, which he might easily have
prosper'd in; for after the surrender of <hi>Porto Mauritio,</hi> all the Towns
as far as <hi>Ventimiglia</hi> being abandoned by the Dukes Garrisons, return'd
to the anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Genoeses; so as when he should quickly and happily have dispatched this
business, he might have facilitated the taking of <hi>Verrua</hi> by diversion:
but that so much time might not be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ent in vain, the Commonwealth gave order <pb n="329" facs="tcp:53250:172"/>
that <hi>Pigna,</hi> a great Town belonging to the Duke, lying above
<hi>Venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miglia,</hi> should be gone against, where they understood that many
of those who were gone out of <hi>Albenga,</hi> and the rest of the Towns which
were recovered were got together; and it was feared, that (contrary to the
Articles of surrender) they might be a great disturbance to the Enterprise of
<hi>Ventimiglia,</hi> which upon the ceasing of the excessive heats, and the
amendment of the Souldiers, was preparing for: This business was committed to
the Baron <hi>Batteville;</hi> who coming thither with about 3000 Foot, and
having long batter'd the Trenches which joined to the houses, and served for a
wall or Rampier; at last the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants fearing an assault yielded upon
Articles; which being agreed upon and perform'd, they delivered up the Town to
<hi>Batteville;</hi> in the delivery whereof the Ammunition fell on fire, which
occasioned much mischief to many; amongst the rest to <hi>Iovan Antonio
Sauli,</hi> General of the Common-wealths Artillery, Son to <hi>Lorenzo,</hi>
who had been Doeg, he being therein burn'd to death: And at last the weather
grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cooler, and the 3000 Dutch who were raised by <hi>Philippo
Spinola,</hi> being arrived, they went with all their forces, about the midst
of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> to the taking in of <hi>Ventimiglia;</hi> which was
reduced with little labour: For the City bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>g after some Cannot shot abandoned by the Garrison, who betook
themselves to defend the Castle, fell into the Genoeses hands. The Castle being
plaid upon on three sides, held out a little longer; but the assailants being
gotten under the Counter-scarfe, and the defendants fearing to be undermined,
which they saw they were begun to be; they after eight days Battery yielded
upon Articles, <hi>That only the Officers should march out with their Swords,
and all the rest with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms:</hi> The little Marquesate of
<hi>Zuccarello,</hi> the first beginning of so many evils, was yet in the
enemies possession: A 1000 Foot were sent thith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r, to whom all the Towns were instantly surrendred,
except Castle <hi>Vecchio;</hi> which was longer ere it was taken then it
deserved tobe, for that it was requisite to bring Artillery to batter it, which
by reason of the roughness of the way, and height of the situation, was not
without much labour and expence of time effected; but at last, all difficulties
being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, the Cannon being presented, and the Castle somwhat batter'd,
it was also surrendered upon Capitulation, to <hi>Iovan Ambrosio Casella,</hi>
a Senator, and Commissary of the Commonwealth, who succeeded
<hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turione.</hi> Thus in the space of few Months the Commonwealth of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> which was assaulted by powerful forces, and partly abandoned,
partly fought against, partly plotted against in private by Italian Princes;
being solely protected and defended by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> kept not
only unprejudiced from the fury and hostility of so many forces raised against
her, and from so many Princes which conspired against her; but preserving her
natural Liberty, did in a short time recover all that the enemy had taken from
her; and entring the assailant Dukes State took some of his Towns, and
indamaged him as much as he had done her; For to boot with the Towns of
<hi>Oneglia</hi> and <hi>Pigna,</hi> which were taken at the same time that
<hi>La Riviera</hi> was recovered; <hi>San Croce</hi> having regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="330" facs="tcp:53250:173"/> forces of the King and Commonwealth, which entring
<hi>Piedmont</hi> should have helped to raise the Siege of <hi>Verrua</hi> by

confined upon the Common-wealth; which though it were great, and well peopled,
yet made not much for the main concernment of the war; and which for the
badness of the ways by which the Artillery was to be brought, did much delay
the entrance into <hi>Piedmont:</hi> The forces drew near that Town, but
without Artillery, which was not yet come, but was speedily expected: And this
Town standing in a Valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Mountains, through the which the
<hi>Tannaro</hi> runs, which takes its rise from a little above, it was
impossible for the Horse to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very near it; they therefore quartered two
miles off, which was the cause why they could do but little service upon an
occasion which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not long after they were quartered: Don
<hi>Carlo,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>'s natural Son, and the Marquess
<hi>di San Trinità</hi> coming from <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rissio</hi> with about 2000
Foot, and 200 Horses, endeavoured to relieve <hi>Ormea;</hi> but falling upon
the Neapolitan Quarters, under Don <hi>Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio Tuffo</hi> their Camp master,
though they charged home, yet two Troops of Horse coming in under Captain
<hi>Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ra,</hi> and other
assistance with them from the neighbouring quarters, the Piedmontese were
beaten back with great loss, which would yet have been worse if all the Horse
had been there, which (by reason of their being quartered so far off) could not
be present at that action: When the Artillery was come, they raised two
Batteries, and having made a sufficient breach, an assault was given, which was
stoutly fought on both sides; but the assailant get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the better at last,
the Town was taken, with much ruine, and effusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of blood; and was afterwards
sack'd, to the great inriching of the Souldiery, who got as much booty there,
as the Piedmontese did <hi>at Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eve:</hi> The Town being taken the Castle
yielded the next day, and both of them were freely delivered up to the
Senators, who were in the Camp; who receiving them in the Common wealths name,
placed 600 Foot in Garrison there, under <hi>Mark Antonio Brancaccio,</hi> who
upon that occasion was chosen Camp-master to the Common-wealth.</p>
            <p>From hence they went to <hi>Garrissio,</hi> another great Town of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> wherein there was a good Garrison under Monfieur <hi>di
Flescè;</hi> but the fierce assault and taking of <hi>Ormea,</hi> which
happened with so great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, did not terrifie the Towns-men of
<hi>Garrissio</hi> only, but the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison also; who abandoned the Towns-men
before the enemy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; wherefore they sent the Keyes of the Gates to
<hi>San Croce,</hi> in signe of surrender; yet the Castle held out nine days,
which whilst it was plaid upon by the Artillery, and undermined, the Horse
over-ran those parts even to <hi>Céva,</hi> plundering and much
prejudicing the Campagnia: wherefore those of <hi>Bagnasco,</hi> being wise at
the cost of others, sent also to surrender to <hi>San Croce;</hi> and the
Castle of <hi>Garrissio,</hi> which was at last surrendered, was sleighted by
<hi>San Croce.</hi> I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> was now
about the midst of <hi>November,</hi> when they went to <hi>Garrissio;</hi> and
the season grew daily more obnoxious by reason of rain and cold; it was also
given <pb n="331" facs="tcp:53250:173"/> out about <hi>Garrissio</hi> and the Marquesate of
<hi>Ceva,</hi> that there was an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly of men, and that the Duke himself
was speedily advancing with all his forces: It was true that the Prince of
<hi>Piedmont</hi> was come into the field with a Body of Foot and Horse, to
defend those parts; and that joining with his Brother Don <hi>Carlo,</hi> and
the Marquess of <hi>San Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nità,</hi> he thought to oppose <hi>San
Croce:</hi> But the news of the Dukes co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming himself in person was the more
confirmed in the Spanish Camp, by the news of the Governours withdrawing from
before <hi>Verrua:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>San Croce</hi> was the more perplex'd
what to do; but this difficulty was eased by a Letter which (as it was said)
came to him from the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; wherein he was advertised, that it being
impossible for him the Governour to continue longer before <hi>Verrua,</hi>
(which had caused him to rise from thence) it was superfluous for him to
advance any further on that side: Fitting Orders being therefore given upon
this advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they resolved to return towards the Maritime parts; which
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divulged through the Army, the greater part thereof believing the report
of the Dukes coming, thought that the retreat was occasioned by the certain
knowledge thereof: So as overcome with too much fear they retreated in very
little order, almost in a flying posture; leaving part of the prey they had got
at <hi>Garrissio</hi> behind them, and one great Piece of Cannon, which they
could not bring over those rocky Mountains.</p>
            <p>This was the success of <hi>San Croce</hi>'s entring
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and the Prince, when he was gone, went to before
<hi>Felizzano,</hi> a Town belonging to the Marquesate of <hi>Finale,</hi> and
subject to the King; but with no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess; for <hi>San Croce</hi> having sent
forces to defend that place, the Prince retreated also into <hi>Piedmont:</hi>
At the same time or a little before these things happened, the Camp before
<hi>Verrua</hi> not having by all their As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, Mines, and Batteries, been
able to get above twenty two foot into the Suburbs, grew daily more afflicted
with sickness and morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; so as being reduced to a very small number, it
was not only not longer able to continue that enterprise, but neither to
retreat without danger of being lost; especially for that the ways so sunk by
the fall of rain, and the dirt was so deep as the Foot could not march without
much ado, nor the Artillery and other incumbrances be carried along: But this
was seasonably helped by the coming of <hi>Mansfield</hi> with his Dutch-men,
who were at last satisfied in point of pay; and these men being fresh proved
very fit to back the Army in its Retreat: which being thus secured by the
assistance of these new men, Don <hi>Gonzallo</hi> made the Artillery be
removed from his Quarters, and be brought to the Rendezvouz for Arms. The
Constable, who being recovered of a long sickness was returned from
<hi>Turin</hi> to the Camp, seeing this, did not let slip the occasion of
assaulting the enemies Trenches, which want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed defence and Artillery, and were
negligently looked unto by the Souldiers, who minded more their retreat then
making defence: So as upon the change of the Guards which was made in the Dukes
Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in the plain before <hi>Verrua,</hi> he assaulted them so furiously,
as posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing himself of the foremost, he came almost to the Dutch Quarters;
which he would likewise have taken if he had not been first stoutly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
by Count <hi>Salma</hi>'s Lieutenant (who was slain in the fight) and
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward <pb n="332" facs="tcp:53250:174"/> by the Count <hi>di Solts,</hi> who did not
only repulse the enemy from the assaulted Quarters, but made them forego the
Trenches which they had already taken: The next night the Governour began to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move quietly, without the beat of Drum or sound of Trumpet; yet this stol'n
Retreat was not so silently performed, but that the Duke, who was aware
thereof, early in the morning went after the Army, which marched but slowly:
His men, though they were repuls'd by <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Dutch-men, slew
many of those who not being able to follow remained behinde upon the way,
besides two Spanish Captains, who resisted valiantly in the Reer: This Retreat
was very seasonably made; for a Recruit of 6000 Foot was at last come from
<hi>France</hi> into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> under Monsieur <hi>di Vigneles;</hi>
who at the same time that the Army re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, came to the City of
<hi>Inurea.</hi> The Governour was afraid that these forces being joyn'd to
those of the Duke and Constable, passing through the Vale of <hi>Sesia,</hi>
and the Principality of <hi>Messerano,</hi> might go to prejudice the
Territories of <hi>Novara;</hi> he therefore went with his Army, which was
reduced to a very small number, to <hi>Novara;</hi> but the Winter coming on,
and finding himself free from that danger, he returned to <hi>Millain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> was not he alone who did partake of the
misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes wherein the this-years Enterprises miscarried; for it was
obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that some sinister influence of the Heavens opposed it self against
the good success of the Armies, and Enterprises of this Year. The so
flourishing Army of the Duke and Constable was unfortunately lost amidst the
Mountains of <hi>Liguria,</hi> not having effected any thing worthy the
greatness of their forces and designes: That of the Marquess <hi>di
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rè,</hi> back'd by the Venetians, and maintained by their monies and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions, was likewise unfortunately lost in sitting down before <hi>an
Inne,</hi> a woful Harbour for Mules and Muletiers; at the taking whereof
having more then once offer'd, he did not only return worsted, but being
as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted in his own Quarters he received much prejudice, and was
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourably affronted; for <hi>Papenhaim</hi> (who succeeded
<hi>Serbellone,</hi> as hath been said, in defending <hi>Riva)</hi> having been
content to keep there loytering for a few days with his Dutch-men; finding at
last that <hi>Coure</hi> despairing of doing any thing of moment was retired
into the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and that leaving Garrisons only in <hi>Vico,</hi>
in <hi>Vercè,</hi> and in <hi>Sasso Corbe,</hi> he had distributed
almost all his men in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> and in <hi>Chiavenna;</hi> and
being impatient of so long idleness, he resolved to assault those Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which being fortified only on the Lake, and on <hi>Riva</hi>'s side, were not
at all fortified behinde, the height and ruggedness of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Mountains being esteemed a safe defence. <hi>Papenhaim</hi> having therefore
learn'd by certain men whom he had sent to discover those Mountains, that
people might be brought to fall upon them by that way, he sent a thousand Foot
by that way; and he, having armed his Barques and Brigandines, went to assault
those Quarters by water at the same time that the thousand Foot should fall
down by the way of the Mountain upon them.</p>
            <p>The event suited with the resolution; for the Defendants being set
upon unexpectedly on the back fled towards the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Quarters and Fortifications, which were presently taken by 
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:53250:174"/> 
               <hi>Papenhaim,</hi> together with eleven pieces of
Artillery, and much Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Ammunition; nor there withall content, he
pursued them into the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and coming to the Fortifications of
<hi>Troana</hi> and <hi>Morbegno,</hi> he thought to have assaulted them,
whereof he writ to the Duke of <hi>Feria;</hi> who being with small hopes
before <hi>Verrua,</hi> would not by any new enterprise hazard the defence of
<hi>Riva,</hi> which was of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the State of <hi>Millain:</hi>
so as <hi>Papenhaim</hi> being master of all the Fortifications which the
French had upon the lesser Lake, was conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently master of all the upper
Lake. Thus ended this enterprise, no less unfortunately for the French, then
did that of the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> before <hi>Verrua,</hi> and that of the
Constable and Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> against the Genoeses: nothing else of
moment hapned this year, unless that the English Fleet, going from that Kingdom
about the beginning of <hi>October</hi> with 93 Ships, wherein were about 10000
fighting men, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> in the Spanish
Seas, and entring the Bay of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> landed some of their men in the
Island, and five pieces of Artillery, intending to fortifie themselves there,
and wait for the Plate-Fleet, which was shortly to come from <hi>America.</hi>
The Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were three or four days busied about taking the Fort called
<hi>Pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale;</hi> and having gotten it upon Articles, they endeavour'd to make
themselves masters of the Bridge, which joyns the Island of <hi>Cadiz</hi> to
the Continent: but being hindred partly by the rain that fell, partly by those
who came to defend the Bridge, they could not effect their desire. Don
<hi>Ferrante Girone,</hi> who was there in defence, after he had well fortified
the City, issued out; and coming to blows with the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a sleight Skirmish
insued, with some prejudice to both sides: at last the English finding that
they could do no great good neither there nor in any of the neighbouring parts,
which were all well munited, they resolved to be gone; and making towards the
West, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards were afraid (as they had learn'd by some Prisoners) that
they were bent for <hi>Cape San Vincent,</hi> the utmost promontory of
<hi>Spain</hi> toward the West, to intercept the Plate-Fleet; wherefore very
much apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some adverse fortune, they sent out some Carvels into
several parts, to find out the Plate-Fleet, and to advertise them how neer the
English were, and in what danger they were of them; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore instead
of coming to <hi>Cape San Vincent,</hi> they should enter into
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogna,</hi> the utmost Haven of <hi>Gallitia:</hi> one of these Carvels
light upon the English Fleet, which hearing of the Orders sent to the
Plate-Fleet by so many parts, steered its Course towares <hi>Corogna,</hi>
supposing that the Plate-Fleet would undoubtedly light upon some of those
Carvels, and would, according to their Orders, make towards that part: a
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful accident hapned, which because it exceeded all humane fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight and
providence, may deservedly be called a miracle; not any of the Carvels met with
the Plate-Fleet; so as the Orders which were sent to them falling into the
hands of the English, was the occasion of turning the English out of their way;
for the Plate-Fleet, which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from out the Channel of <hi>Bauma,</hi> doth
usually sail Northward till it come to the 45 degree of the elevation of the
Pole, and then declining towards the East and South, comes into the
<hi>Terzere</hi> and into <hi>Portugal,</hi> and to Coast a long the <hi>Cape
San Vincent,</hi> not being able this year, by <pb n="334" facs="tcp:53250:175"/> reason of
the great Northerly winds, to enter between those Islands and the Continent,
was forc'd to pass on the out side, and to run along <hi>Africa,</hi> even to
the shores of <hi>Morocco,</hi> at the same time that the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Fleet lay
before <hi>Cales:</hi> but when the English Fleet going from <hi>Cales</hi>
went to find the Plate-Fleet out, the wind blowing very briskly from the South,
it hapned that as by the favour thereof the Plate-Fleet came successfully from
the <hi>Morocco</hi> shores to <hi>Cales,</hi> so the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish Fleet leaving
<hi>Cales</hi> behind them, the more they thought to meet with the Plate-Fleet,
the English being driven by the same winds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Corogna,</hi> the
further were they from it, and consequently left the entrance into the
Streights, and the Spanish Seas, free to the Plate-Fleet, whither it was
bound.</p>
            <p>Now because often mention is made of the great Treasure and Riches
which this Plate-Fleet brings every year to <hi>Spain,</hi> it will not be much
from the purpose, to make here a particular Discourse thereof: lest the
Narration of that which is now so well known, being not spoken of by us, may
peradventure leave the like obscurity to poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as we find in the Holy
Writ, touching the Land of <hi>Ophir,</hi> from whence we read that Gold was
brought every third year to <hi>Solomon.</hi> The King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as he
is King of <hi>Castile</hi> is Master of the great Kingdoms of
<hi>America,</hi> which is now called the new World, and which being totally
unknown to the Ancients was first discovered and found out by <hi>Christophoro
Colomba,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Genoa,</hi> in the year 1492. and as King of
<hi>Portugal</hi> he possesseth many Towns, Havens and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime Provinces in
<hi>Africa, Asia,</hi> and in the Indies, and more Eastern Islands; whereinto
by long endeavors and dangerous Navigation he had penetrated a little before
<hi>Colomba:</hi> from these Oriental and Occidental Regions infinite Riches
and Treasures are yearly brought into <hi>Spain:</hi> but particularly from
<hi>America,</hi> as more abounding then any other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the unexhaustible
Mines of Silver: between the midst of <hi>March</hi> and beginning of
<hi>April,</hi> eight great Ships fraught with Merchandize, and eight
well-armed Galleoons, do usually go every year from the City of <hi>Sivil;</hi>
which sailing towards <hi>America,</hi> steer their Course to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards that
Province which is commonly called <hi>Terra Firma:</hi> and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to shore
first at <hi>Carthagena,</hi> the chief Haven of that Province, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven degrees
distant from the Line towards the North, and 315 degrees in Longitude; do there
unload part of their Merchandize, and pass forwards with the rest towards
<hi>Porto Velo,</hi> the chiefest place for Trade, in that <hi>Istmus;</hi>
which dividing the uppermost Sea, which they call the North Sea, from the
nethermore, which they call the South Sea, joyns the two chief parts of
<hi>America</hi> together, just as <hi>Africa</hi> is joyn'd to <hi>Asia</hi>
by the <hi>Istmus</hi> of <hi>Egypt. Porto Velo</hi> is a place of receipt for
all the Merchandize which go to and fro from <hi>Peru;</hi> and for all the
Gold and Silver which is brought in great abundance from the unexhausti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Mines of the <hi>Potosi</hi> in <hi>Peru;</hi> and from the others of those
parts; for as all that passes from <hi>Peru,</hi> and from those Provinces by
the South Sea into the North Sea, to be convey'd into <hi>Spain,</hi> puts in
at <hi>Panama,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other noble Haven and place of Merchandize, on the
opposite side of the <hi>Istmus,</hi> which lies upon that Sea, and are carried
cross the <hi>Istmus</hi> upon the backs of certain creatures not unlike our
Rams, to <hi>Porto Velo.</hi> 
               <pb n="335" facs="tcp:53250:175"/> so those which are
destined for <hi>Peru,</hi> and those other Regions which lie towards the
South, from <hi>Spain</hi> and the other American Provinces which lie
Northward, are unloaded at <hi>Porto Velo,</hi> and are carried up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same
creatures to <hi>Palma,</hi> from whence they are sent in Ships destined for
<hi>Peru,</hi> and those other Provinces: the same Ships when they have unladed
the Spanish Merchandize in <hi>Porto Velo,</hi> are presently fraught with
those which are come from <hi>Peru,</hi> and those other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, except it
be the Gold and Silver, which for the greater safety are for the most part put
into Galleoons; which are very great and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vessels, each of which
carrying 36 pieces of great Cannon, and 300 select Mariners, may be said to be
the Plate-Fleets Garrison: these being loaded with Gold and Silver depart in
company with the Ships of Merchandize from <hi>Porto Velo,</hi> to
<hi>Havanna,</hi> a Haven which for capacity, safety and Fortification, may be
accounted the chiefest, not only in <hi>America,</hi> but peradventure, in the
whole World; which being situated in the Island of <hi>Cuba,</hi> just under
the Tropick of <hi>Cancer,</hi> turns towards the North, and is opposite to
that part of <hi>America</hi> which is called <hi>Florida:</hi> whither when
they are come, they find about 35 other Ships, which coming from <hi>Spain</hi>
about the end of the preceding <hi>Iune,</hi> pass to <hi>San Iovan di
Lua,</hi> which is the landing place of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and of that Province
neer <hi>America,</hi> which is commonly called <hi>Nova Spagna;</hi> and
having here unladed the Spanish Merchandize, and taken up those of <hi>Nova
Spagna,</hi> they endeavour to be in <hi>Havanna</hi> at the time that the
Galleoons and other Ships use to come thither; which is just about the
beginning of <hi>September;</hi> to the end that, guarded by those Galleoons
and other Ships, they may pursue their Voyage with more safety, and less danger
of Pyrates; to boot with these, other Ships of the neighbouring Kingdoms use to
come thither at the same time: so as the whole <hi>Flotta,</hi> as they call
it, amounts to between 60 and 70 Vessels; when they part from <hi>Havanna,</hi>
they must by the Streight of <hi>Beama,</hi> a very dangerous Streight between
the Island <hi>Beama</hi> and <hi>Florida,</hi> fall into the open and immense
Ocean, whither when they are come, they give fire to all their Artillery, in
sign of joy for that they have escaped so dangerous a passage; and calling a
Councel, they open a Packet which is brought from <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein there
are Orders and Instructions from the King, how they are to steer their Course
in their return; and in what height they are to keep from Climate to Climate:
to the end, that their Enemies may not know what Course they steer, who oft
times lie in wait to surprize them: these Ships which are called <hi>la Flotta
d' America</hi> come usually into <hi>Spain</hi> in <hi>November;</hi> and
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Gulf of <hi>Cales,</hi> goe to <hi>Sivil</hi> by the great River
of <hi>Guadal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivir;</hi> where the Merchandize and Treasure are brought to
the Kings Officers, and are by them delivered out, according to their several
proportions. They bring with them commonly to the value of eleven Millions of
Gold; whereof two Millions consist in Merchandize, the rest in Gold and Silver;
the fourth part whereof is calculated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the King, the rest to
particular Merchants: the Merchandizes are <hi>Cuchunel, Indico, Campeggio</hi>
or <hi>Campeche,</hi> a medecinable wood, <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,</hi> and beasts hides
tan'd, to make shooe-soles withall, which they call <hi>Covie:</hi> of the
Ships when they go from <hi>Spain,</hi> those which go first 
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:53250:176"/> away with the Galleoons carry Silks and Woollen-cloath,
Cloath of Gold, and other things of value: the rest, which are intended for
<hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra Firma,</hi> carry great quantities of Linnen, Wine, Oyl and Olives:
in which things those Countries which stand in need thereof do abound; for the
King, to keep those Provinces united, and dependant upon his Kingdoms of
<hi>Spain,</hi> requires (upon rigorous and severe penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties) that two things
be by them observed: the one, that neither Vines nor Olives be planted in
<hi>America,</hi> though that soil be very capable thereof: the other, that the
Exchequer-rents and Kings Revenues of those Previnces, may not upon any terms
be sold to private men; and hence it is, that those Inhabitants being in a
possibility of being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by <hi>Spain,</hi> forasmuch as belongs to Wine
and Oyle, they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated to keep Commerce with <hi>Europe,</hi> and to
tolerate the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of a far distant King, to the end that they may be
provided thereof; and not having elsewhere, where to imploy their Riches, they
must send them into <hi>Spain,</hi> to purchase annual revenues out of the
forfeitures of those Kingdoms; which by a Spanish word drawn from the Latine,
they call <hi>juri:</hi> whence it is that almost all the ready moneys of
<hi>America</hi> being transported into <hi>Spain,</hi> raises the rates of the
<hi>juri,</hi> and occasions plenty of ready money; and which is of greater
importance, the same <hi>juri</hi> serves the King as a pledge and surety of
their fidelity and vassallage: so as they can the lesse easily Rebell.</p>
            <p>Nor were the Portuguese less fortunate in their Maritime
Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises; who some years before <hi>Colomba</hi>'s Navigation, undertook by
Maritime Art and Study, Navigations no less uncertain, dangerous, unusual, and
(in mans opinion) not to be achieved; for the ancient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians and
Cosmographers holding that the torried Zone was uninhabitable, thought that
that part of <hi>Africa,</hi> which being wash'd by the Western Sea extends it
self from the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> towards the South, did enter into
that Zone, and that therefore it was in vain to sail any further that way, or
to coast along there, without evident danger of their healths who should come
to the Precincts of the Zone: so as it was impossible to penetrate, by
Navigation, from the Occiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal African Ocean into the Oriental, which washeth
<hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>India:</hi> but the Portugueses endeavouring to advance
further, did first discover the great Promontory of <hi>Capo Verde,</hi> and
the adjoyning Islands which the ancients called <hi>Hesperides;</hi> and then
advancing much further, when they had past the Equinoctial line, they arrived
at the Kingdoms of <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>Angola;</hi> then passing the Tropick
of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> they at last compassed the enterprise which was before
held so desperate; and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the furthermost Promontory of
<hi>Africa,</hi> which they called <hi>Capo di buona Speranza,</hi> or the
<hi>Cape of good Hope;</hi> and sailing from thence through the open Ocean
towards the East, they coasted so far along <hi>Africa,</hi> which turned about
thitherwards, as discovering the mouths of the Arabian and Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sian Gulfs, they came at last to that
of the great <hi>Indo:</hi> where laying the foundations of so great an Empire
upon friendship made with some of those Barbarian Kings, by the sole Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
of Spices, and other <hi>Levant</hi> Merchandiz, they began to interpose
themselves in the Wars which they made one against another; adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring 
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:53250:176"/> to some with their Arms, suppressing some others,
insomuch as having gotten some Towns, partly by agreement, partly by force, and
fortifying themselves very well therein, they laid some better ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works of
Empire in the midst of that Nation, which from nothing, or from very little,
increased so fast as exceeds all their Neighbours, if not in greatness and
union of State, at least in Worth, Maritime Forces and Civil Policy: which by
(peradventure an unheard of example) proceeding from so far distant parts,
curbs almost all the Kings and Potentates of those Regions; for being either
Tributaries, adherents or Vassals of the Portuguese Empire, they either by
force or by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interest, are become dependants upon the King of
<hi>Portugal:</hi> nor have they kept their Navigations and Acquisitions only
within the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>India;</hi> but as if one afforded materials for an
other, they still advanced, till having gotten to the head of <hi>India,</hi>
which they call <hi>Comorino,</hi> and hath on its Front the ancient
<hi>Taprobana,</hi> they entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Gulf of <hi>Bengala,</hi> and from
thence into the <hi>Molucca</hi> Islands (the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Mother of Spices) and to
the great Kingdoms of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Iapan;</hi> and so bold and
fortunate have they been, as overcoming the Seas, and finding them navigable,
they have gone about the whole World, and joyning the East unto the West they
have rendred the opinions of the Ancients fabulous and foolish, who denied that
the World was round, the possibility of the Antipodes, the peopling of the
<hi>Zone,</hi> and the conjunction of the Seas.</p>
            <p>The Kings of <hi>Portugal</hi> govern'd this Empire; and now the
Kings of <hi>Castile,</hi> in succession to those of <hi>Portugal,</hi> by a
Viceroy, to whom (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining unto themselves all that is on this side of
<hi>Capo dibuona Sper an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za)</hi> they give all Supream Arbitrement, and
disposal of all that belongs to them from the said Cape to the utmost part of
the East: upon this Viceroy, who usually resides in <hi>Goa,</hi> all the Kings
who are Vassals, Tributaries, Friends and Confederates, all the Government of
Civil, Military and Maritime Affairs, doth depend: they keep possession of
these Seas by four Fleets, distributed into fitting places and Havens: insomuch
as none of those Kings or People may sail thereon, without leave and authority
from the Viceroy, no not so much as upon occasion of Traffick or Merchandize. A
singular thing, and which was never pretended to, nor put in execution by any
Roman Emperour, or other King: the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> reap many advantages
by this Navigation; for to them belongs all the Spices which are carried away
in Ships, to boot with many other Merchandizes and Jewels which are carried
from the Indies to <hi>Portugal:</hi> by reason of this so great wealth, which
comes every year to the Kings hands, the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> is held to be
of the richest Monarchies that ever was known, or at least which are at the
present; and yet the Wars of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> have so
exhausted him, and brought him into such streights, as to boot with all the
Kings Revenues sold and engaged, <hi>Spain</hi> is now the poorest of any
Kingdom in <hi>Europe,</hi> in point of Silver and Gold; in so much as brass
money runs curr at through all the Kingdom of <hi>Castile,</hi> which they call
<hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neta del Veglione,</hi> instead of Gold or Silver, which occasioned
disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of great importance to that Crown.</p>
            <p>Now to return to where welefr, and to reassume the thread of our 
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:53250:177"/> former History. The same English Fleet being deprived of
all hope of prey, whilst it return'd for <hi>England,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Tempest which arose, which driving many of the Ships on shore, &amp; split<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, the rest return'd torn and rent, and in very bad order, without having
done any good, home to <hi>England:</hi> so as this powerful League proved no
less unfortunate at Sea, then it had done at Land: the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, Treaties,
and conclusion of peace which succeeded after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as shall hereafter be
said, were more unfortunate, and less wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy so great preparations. Cardinal
<hi>Barbarino</hi> return'd about the end of <hi>February,</hi> in the year
1626, to <hi>Rome,</hi> from his French Embassie; who got nothing by it, but an
acknowledgement <hi>that the King had aided the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>(who had
been hainously offended by the Genoeses) not so much in respect of his alliance
with the house of</hi> Savoy, <hi>as to keep the Spanish Forces imploied in
defending the State of</hi> Genoa, <hi>so as they might not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose his men in
the</hi> Valtoline; <hi>that it might be supposed that when the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of
the</hi> Valtoline <hi>should be decided, to the satisfaction of all, and in
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Articles of</hi> Madrid, <hi>he would forbear offending the
Genoeses, whom he had neither reason, nor will, directly to injure.</hi> But
the orderly disposing of the affairs of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> pretended unto
by the King see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be such, as that they offer'd to restore all the Forts
that were taken in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> to the Pope, upon condition that
they should be immediately demolished, and that being demolished the
Valtolini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans should return to their ancient obedience of their Lords and
Masters the Grisons, the Kings ancient Confederates: the Pope would not consent
to such hard conditions, as repugnant to the Catholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the
Popes endeavours: so as the Legate departed from the Court, and returned
towards <hi>Rome,</hi> little satisfied with the King, and less with Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu;</hi> the Pope intending to send him upon the same Embassie to
<hi>Spain</hi> found great resistance amongst the Spanish Agents, who thought
they should suffer too much in their reputation, if the Embassie of
<hi>Spain</hi> should seem to depend upon that of <hi>France;</hi> wherefore
protesting that the King should not receive him, the Pope sent for his Nephew
back to <hi>Rome,</hi> thinking to send him, as with a new and different
Embassie, from thence into <hi>Spain:</hi> but neither were the Spanish Agents
pleased with this, who liked not that in the same Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation the King of
<hi>France</hi> should have the precedency given him before the King of
<hi>Spain:</hi> after many debates this accommodation was found; that the Title
of the Embassie should be from the Pope, relating to the Baptism of a Daughter
of the Kings who was born about that time, and that the Negotiation of peace
should come in the second place, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending thereupon: but for all this new
Embassie, the Pope forbare not to prepare for Arms, in case he could not effect
peace by his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassie; for thinking that he should not suffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Rome,</hi> and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts; he took it also ill, that the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> did not readily restore what he had usurped, but did stand upon
unreasonable, and impossible <pb n="339" facs="tcp:53250:177"/> conditions: he therefore
resolved to resent himself by force of Arms; and after having used friendly and
benigne endeavours to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he would shew that animosity and
resentment which the world had desired to find in him, from the beginning of
these commotions; and would send men to recover the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and the
Forts thereof, which were possess'd by the French: so as the Spaniards
continuing their former offers, of assisting him with Men and Arms, he sent
6000 Foot into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> commanded by <hi>Torquato
Conti,</hi> Son to the Duke <hi>de Poli,</hi> to the end that joyning with the
Spanish Forces they might go to the recovery of the <hi>Valtoline:</hi> but the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the other Confederates, prepared forces for the
next season, as well as did the Pope; thinking to renew the war more
fortunately, and with greater forces then they had done the year before; and
news was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise heard in <hi>Italy,</hi> of great preparations which were
made in that Kingdom to the same purpose; wherefore the Commonwealth of

of 8000 Foot, and 500 Horse, should be by them joyntly raised; two thirds of
them to be maintained by the King, and the rest by the Commonwealth; and this
Army was to be commanded by <hi>Francisco Qelio Brancacchio,</hi> with title of
the chief Commander of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths Forces, which together with many
Germans and Italians, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained at her own charges, caused two Brigades to
be likewise raised, the one by <hi>Philippo Spinola di Giulio;</hi> the other
by <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ctore Ravaschiero,</hi>
Prince of <hi>Satriano,</hi> who raised them upon his own charges: but these
and the Popes preparations, as also those of the Confederates, proved vain, as
did likewise the Embassie sent into <hi>Spain:</hi> private Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of
peace began at this time to be had between the two Crowns, which were happily
concluded, and with incredible speed. The King of <hi>France,</hi> moved the
reunto either by the unfortunate suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of the League, or by the troubles of
his own Kingdom, (or were it that he saw that he must be forc'd to make a new
war in <hi>Italy,</hi> touching the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and other concernments
with the Pope, who was irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and incens'd and joyned with the Spanish
Forces;) and considering how costly and how little advantagious the
Confederates Counsels pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, conceived it better to secure his own affairs,
then to busie himself in those of other mens: laying therefore aside all the
ends and interests of the Confederates, he thought it best to close upon any
terms with the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> hearing
no more welcome musick, then the sound of peace in <hi>Italy,</hi> willingly
listned to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that way tending; the conclusion whereof, with the
same easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and good inclination of all parties, was appointed to be made on
the sixth of <hi>March,</hi> the year 1626. in <hi>Monsone,</hi> a Town in the
Kingdom of <hi>Aragon,</hi> where the King was gone to keep the Courts of that
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: so as the Popes men, who were come into the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> at the same time almost that the unexpected news of peace
came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, served only to receive peaceful possession of the Forts which in
conformity to the Articles of peace were delivered up unto them, in 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:53250:178"/> the name of the Apostolick See; the chief Articles
whereof were: <hi>That the Roman Catholick Religion should be preserved in
the</hi> Valtoline, <hi>and in the Counties of</hi> Bormio <hi>and</hi>
Chiavenna: <hi>That things should be reduced to the same condition as they
were, in the year 1617. That notwithstanding the people might chuse their
Magistrates, and Governours, by whom they were to be ruled, without any
dependency upon the Grisons: That the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those that were to be
elected should belong unto the Grisons; who if they were not confirmed within
eight days, they might administer Iustice, and exercise their Office and
Iurisdiction: That if the Grisons should fail twice in this confirmation, they
should be understood to have for ever forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this their power of
confirmation: That the Valtolinians and their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions should pay unto the
Grisons, in recompence for the jurisdiction which was confer'd upon them, a
certain annual sum of money to be agreed upon between themselves; wherein if
they should not agree, it should be decided by the two Kings: That the Grisons
should approve of these Articles, and should swear to observe them: That such
Forts as were held by either of the two Kings, in those parts, should be put
into the Popes possession; who upon restoring the Artillery and Ammunition
which should be therein at the time of depositure, should immediately demolish
them; but that the demolishing should not be delay'd, for fault of
consignation, since the King had past his word they should be consigned: That
in case the Pope should defer the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing, the two Kings should joyntly
intreat it at his hands, so as they might be effectually demolished: That the
Grisons should not enter armed into the</hi> Valtoline, <hi>nor the Spanish
Agents keep any more armed men then usual in the Confines of the State of</hi>
Millain: <hi>as touching the differences between the Commonwealth and the Duke
of</hi> Savoy: <hi>That their two Majesties, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, should
procure a Truce with their Colleague for four moneths; and should chuse two
Arbitrators, who should end the differences within the said prefixt time; in
case the differences should not be terminated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four moneths, their two
Majesties should undertake to determine them, and cause each of their
Colleagues to observe them: That their two Majesties should joyntly end any
differences which should arise between the Grisons and Valtolinians, and should
not permit them to take up Arms one against another: That if any differences
should happen in</hi> Italy, <hi>between the Friends of either Crown, their
Majesties should not adhere with arms unto their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league, till such time as
one of the Kings had treated in the other Kings Court, and procured an amicable
agreement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the substance of the chief Capitulations of Peace, at
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone;</hi> then which more honorable, or more advantagious, could not
be expected, nor hoped for, for the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> since the King got
in this business of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> all that he therein pretended to, as
well in the Catholick Religion which was there very well setled and secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
as in respect of the state and liberty of those people, who were thereby also
freed, from the yoke and slavery of the Grisons; for though it was agreed that
the condition of affairs should be reduced to the state they were, in the year
1617, (in which the Rebellion not being yet begun, the Valtolinians were under
the Grisons obedience) yet was it more in shew, then substance; for the
election of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, the necessary confirmation of them, the free and
independant exercise of their jurisdiction, were such exceptions to the
condition of <pb n="341" facs="tcp:53250:178"/> the year 1617, as they did almost totally
alter it: and the Valtolinians, having shaken off their ancient yoke, which
made not only for the benefit and freedome of the King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> for
the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> and for the necessity of Commerce
which those people stand in with the State it self, they were constrain'd to
keep united to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to depend upon the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of <hi>Millains</hi> authority: so as the passage thorow that Country, which
was the most important point, was kept shut up, and open at the free will and
pleasure of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Agents; for the Crown of
<hi>Spain</hi> having concluded peace upon so advantagious terms, after having
so fortunately defended <hi>Spain</hi> against the English Fleet; after the
safe arrival of the Plate Fleet; after the recovery of <hi>Brasile,</hi> after
the defence and preservation of <hi>Genoa,</hi> did gloriously triumph over the
League, and over so many Forces, and Plots contrived by her Rivals and Enemies,
to suppress the Grandezza of her King; and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we have not these many years
read or heard of any peace made with such advantage and honour to that Crown;
especially in a time when by the same which was given out of so great
preparations for war made by the Consederates she was thought to be furthest
off it, and that she was likely to enter into longer and more dangerous wars
then the former: but the confusion and astonishment of the Confederates was as
great, as was the glory, and satisfaction, which the Spaniards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by
this peace; for finding themselves abandoned by the King of <hi>France</hi>
when they least expected it, and that by the dissolution of the League their
ends and interest thereby pretended unto were lost, they fumed and complained
of the King of <hi>France,</hi> not so much for that he had made that peace
without their knowledge, as for the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the common affairs, which,
being by him abandoned, were totally ruined: the Grisons who were chiefly
concern'd in the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> could not tolerate, that
after having run so many dangers in point of liberty, and suffer'd such
calamities, they should be deprived of so noble a part of their Dominions; nor
that their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, the King of <hi>France,</hi> should after his publick
profession made to the contrary, have consented so far when they did most
believe to be restored by his Arms: so as they complained bitterly, and did
openly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to accept of those Articles by which they were inforced to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their own interests: the Venetians were mad, seeing themselves
deprived of that advantage which they thought themselves sure of, after the
expence of so much Treasure, after having undergone so many Troubles, after so
many Plots and Artifices, whereby, for their own safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and the safety of
<hi>Italy,</hi> they had turned the world upside down: the Pope was variously
spoken of herein; those who minded the reality of affairs thought he had reason
to be very well satisfied with this peace, since he had thereby vindicated his
reputation, by the restituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Forts, which were to be put into his
hands again; and might pretend that his taking up Arms had been a great cause
why the King of <hi>France</hi> had been brought to more moderate
conditions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, those who were more speculative, and who
were already suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ill conceited of the Pope, thought that as he had
with so much dissimulation suffer'd the King of <hi>France</hi> to enter armed
into the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> 
               <pb n="342" facs="tcp:53250:179"/> so, to secure
<hi>Italy</hi> from imminent slavery, and to abate the Spanish Grandezza; so
likewise that he took it very ill, that the King of <hi>France</hi> should have
stood upon so hard terms with his Legate in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the affairs of the
<hi>Valioline;</hi> and if he were not ill satisfied for these respects, they
thought he could not be very well pleased, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that his neutrality which
he had so publickly profess'd, and the course which he had steered upon these
present occurrences, had not only not made him Arbitrator of the present
Controversies, but that the two Kings had agreed them without his knowledge,
and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some prejudice to his authority; and the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> was no less impatient at this, then were the other Confederates;
for considering that instead of the resentment which he pretended unto against
the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeses, instead of the acquisition which he had hoped to have made in
their Dominions, he had lost many of his Patrimonial Towns, lost his Artillery
left in <hi>Gavi,</hi> and his Galley with the Sea-Standard; he thought that
being to re-have them by agreement, and not by force, was to acknowledge that
he had been a loser by that war: so as he knew not well what to do: to this was
added, that the peace being proclaim'd in <hi>France,</hi> just at that time
that the Prince, his Son, was in <hi>Paris,</hi> and was gone thither to keep
the King and that Court stedfast to the League, and to procure new and greater
preparations for war to be reassumed the next year; which preparations, that
they might be the more certain, and more dependent upon the Dukes authority,
and that he might have no occasion to contend with the French Captains and
Officers, as he had done with the Constable; the Prince had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, and (as
it was afterwards reported) obtained from the King, the charge, with title of
General of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Forces in <hi>Italy;</hi> wherefore
the Duke being become proud, as thinking himself grown formidable to his
enemies, and more regarded by the King of <hi>France</hi> then any of the
Confederates, now that he saw himself faln from such an height of expectation,
and abandoned by the French Court when he least expected it, he held himself to
be highly affronted, and that the world would laugh at him: but it was in vain
to complain; for the two Kings were firmly resolved to see their determinations
effected; and the Confederates not being able to do any thing without the King
of <hi>France,</hi> were forced to succumb, and patiently to swallow down so
bitter a pill, and of so hard disgestion; and the King of <hi>France,</hi> who
had no excuse for what he had done, cared not much for their being unsatisfied:
his Agents, sheltering themselves under the Kings great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and authority,
alledg'd not any thing in defence of what their King had done, but that the
interests of the Kingdom required it should be so; with which (they said) it
behoved and was necessary that the Confederates should comply; sometimes
suffering it to escape out of their mouths, when they were strait put to it,
that the Confederates not being any ways to be compared to their King, they
must look upon him as their superiour: The Princes of <hi>France</hi> were no
less ill satisfied with the peace it self then were the Potentates of the
League; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hating the King, as well as him who had been the chief cause
of concluding the peace, some who were discontented with the present condition
of affairs, and desirous of novelties, and pretences to conspire 
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:53250:179"/> against the Kings person, and against <hi>Armand du
Plesses,</hi> Cardinal <hi>di Richelieu,</hi> the Kings chief and most intimate
Counsellor and Favorite; and it not being known what the true causes were which
caused the King to be so sollicitous in procuring this peace so speedily, and
with such secrecie, some would have it (and it was afterwards publickly spoken)
that the signs of the dangerous conspiracy which was discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Court
of <hi>France</hi> against the Kings person, forc'd him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose businesses
abroad, upon any conditions, that he might the more securely provide against
home conspiracies; but the business being discovered in <hi>Nantes,</hi> four
moneths after the peace was concluded, does totally exclude that consideration:
but whatsoever the matter was, were it that the peace were the effect of the
Conspiracy, or the Conspiracy of the peace, some Princes of <hi>France,</hi>
taking the unhappy conduct of the Kings affairs, by the unfortunate success of
war, and by the dishonourable peace, as pretence for their Conspiracy; and
finding that they could not pull down the Cardinal, by reason of the constant
belief the King had in him, plotted to pull down the King himself: many were
thought to be complices in this Conspiracy; the Duke and Cavalier <hi>di
Vandosme,</hi> natural Brothers to the King; many were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned upon this
account: the Count <hi>di Soissons,</hi> Prince of the blood, his absenting
himself from the Court made him be suspected to be guilty: many said that
Monsieur <hi>d'Orleans,</hi> the Kings Brother, and heir to the Crown, together
with several other chief Officers who were very inward with the King, were held
to have a hand in it. The Plot, was that the King should be kil'd or deposed,
and that having no Sons, the said <hi>Orleans</hi> should be made King; upon
whose genius, as being more tractable and conformable to their humours, those
laid their foundations, who endeavoured new resolutions in the world, and the
ruine of the League, in prejudice to peace: the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was held
not only to be conscious of this Conspiracy, but the chief Author and Composer
thereof, out of anger that the peace had been so concluded; and that the Abbot
<hi>Alexander Scaglia,</hi> a chief Agent of the Dukes, and then Resident in
that Court, was not only a great Contriver thereof; but that being sent from
thence by the Duke into <hi>Holland</hi> and into <hi>England,</hi> he should
treat of novelties with that King and with those States, in the behalf of the
Rebels and Rochellers, who were at that time besieged and in great streights:
in relief of whom the King of <hi>England</hi> sent forth three Fleets, which
were all repuls'd: the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did also foment the Duke of
<hi>Roan,</hi> head of those that were risen up against the King: he received
and entertained Count <hi>Soissons</hi> in <hi>Turin,</hi> who was gone from
the Court; and offer'd the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> safe reception, and the
command of his State, when for fear of the King he should retire thither: by
which accidents, seeing himself in open breach with the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> and fearing that lying in the midst between the two Crowns he
might be equally hated by them both, he began to endeavour to joyn again with
the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> to the end, that if he should be assaulted by the
one King, he might be sustain'd by the other: this business being brought into
the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> and there discussed, met with many difficulties,
as (for the most part) new and great affairs do; for though at the first view,
it was well <pb n="344" facs="tcp:53250:180"/> and willingly listned unto, as an excellent
means for the good of the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> whereby to remove the
inconveniences which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Dukes alienation, yet it missed not
some contradictions: some inclining to embrace the examples of <hi>Charles</hi>
the Fifth, and of <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, who by rewards and alliance had
always studied to keep that Prince their friend; others were troubled at the
Dukes genius, who was various, unquiet, naturally a friend to novelties, hard
to be govern'd before he were broke, harder afterwards; when all respects being
thrown aside, and the reins given to resentment, he had already troubled the
affairs of the Crown so many several ways: so as they thought his
reconciliation would be unsafe and costly, and which could hardly be integral,
after so many injuries done and received; it being impossible to reduce him to
his former obsequie and observance, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was likely rather to trouble
and perplex the Kings affairs, then to secure them. The <hi>Conde Duca</hi>'s
authority prevailed: he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to signalize his inwardness with the
King, before that of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour the Duke of <hi>Lerma;</hi> who suffer'd
in his fame for having been too severe in depriving the Crown of this Prince
his adherence, by whose alienation such prejudice, and so many troubles had
resulted: so as thinking his reconciliation would prove as advantagious, he was
of opinion that if it should succeed in his time, and by his means, it would
adde as much to his reputation, as his alienation had detracted from that of
his Predecessour: the execution thereof was therefore out of good respects put
off till the conclusion of peace between the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth and the Duke, The
mean while they went forward with the peace of <hi>Monsone,</hi> by vertue
whereof the Forts of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> were restored to the same condition
they were in before they were taken from <hi>Torquato Conti,</hi> in the Popes
name, after many delays interposed by the Marquess <hi>di Coure,</hi> who would
have had the Forts demolished before restitution, which the Pope did constantly
deny: but did forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with demolish them, together with all the Fortifications of
<hi>la Riva</hi> and <hi>Chiavenna:</hi> so as the peace was ratified on that
behalf fully, with sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to all men: but the peace between the Genoeses
and <hi>Savoy</hi> met with greater and more inextricable difficulties; the
Duke would have his Towns that were taken, his Artillery, together with the
Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley and Prisoners, restored, before the Truce, and that they should proceed
to decide differences; to which purpose he nominated <hi>Claudio Marini,</hi>
for his Arbitrator; and the President of <hi>Grenoble</hi> came from
<hi>France</hi> to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by direction from the King, to be
assistant, together with one who should be named by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
in the Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which was to be made by <hi>Marini,</hi> and by an
Arbitrator to be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth, on the contrary,
would have the Arbitrators first chosen, who should determine the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
before any restitution should be made: nor did they allow of <hi>Marini</hi> to
be an Arbitrator, as being formerly accused by them, for that he had been in
the Confederates Army in the present war, and that he had, as Embassadour from
the King of <hi>France</hi> to the Duke, intervened in the Consultations and
Wars against the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth: but the Duke being resolved not to consent to
the Truce whilst the Genoeses should hold his Towns, and the business being 
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:53250:180"/> thereby intangled, the Marquess of <hi>Castagneda</hi>
found out this accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation; that without passing any express formal word,
each party should keep armed in their stations, but with Orders to their
Captains, that they should stand only upon their Gurd, and that in case any
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention should fall out between the Country people and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
none of them should interpose themselves in the behalf of their friends; and
having agreed with the Commonwealth that this should be observed by them, he by
Letters acquainted the French Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour who was at <hi>Turin,</hi> with what
he had done; who writ back, that the Duke had made the same agreement, and had
sent such Orders and Commissions to his Captains and Officers. Thus the
business seemed to be conveniently adjusted, rather by reciprocal intelligence,
then by any express Truce, or any formal word given or received for suspension
of Arms.</p>
            <p>In this interim, the term of four moneths, prefix'd to the
Arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours by the Capitulation of <hi>Monsone,</hi> being expired, the
Treaty of Peace was turn'd over to the Court at <hi>Madrid;</hi> where the
<hi>Conde Duca</hi> was for the Genoeses, and the Marquess of
<hi>Rambollietto,</hi> being gone to that Court upon an occasion of the birth
of one of the Kings Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was detain'd there too, by order from the King,
for this Affair. The difficulties were many; the Commonwealth refused to
restore the Artillery and the Galley which were demanded by the Duke, as things
which being taken in open fair War are never restored in peace: but the French
pressing this point much, who were desirous to appease the Duke, he being
offended and angry at the peace made at <hi>Monsone;</hi> and the Spaniards
desirous to gratifie him the most they could, in what was more of shew then
substance, that they might thereby draw him over to them, conformable to the
endeavours which were had of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; they desired the Commonwealth to
give way to this, at the request and for the satisfaction of the two Crowns,
whose aim was to settle a good and a secure peace. The Commonwealth considering
that restitution doth increase and not lessen the glory of what is gotten,
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the increase of reputation before the advantage of retention:
whereunto they were perswaded by their no want of Artillery nor Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies; and
chiefly, because the Duke had shewed the like respect to them in the Artillery
which were taken in <hi>Riviera:</hi> greater difficulties remained about the
principal point of <hi>Zuccharello,</hi> the Duke requiring that it should be
restored to him, as a thing bought by him before, or else that he might be
recompensed with as much Land elsewhere; and the Commonwealth refusing both
these, the difficulty was reduced to be decided by moneys; wherein the
Mediators at last agreeing, they disagreed in the sum: The Duke did not only
demand what he had disbursed, but the interest, which amounted to too
immoderate a sum; wherefore, and because the French demanded reparation should
be made to <hi>Claudio Marini,</hi> for the prejudice he had suffer'd in having
his house pul'd own; whereunto the Commonwealth not consenting, the French
Embassadour departed speedily for <hi>France,</hi> and left the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
undecided: but whilst the business concerning peace was thus negotiated in
<hi>Spain,</hi> affairs did not pass with that quietness and safety in the
River of <hi>Genoa,</hi> as was hoped for by <hi>Castagneda</hi>'s Negotiation.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:53250:181"/> 
               <hi>Mark Antonie Brancacchio,</hi> Camp-master and
Governour for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth in <hi>Ormea,</hi> went by leave from his Uncle
the General with 600 paid Foot, and as many of the Militia, to surprise and
sack <hi>Briga,</hi> a great Town not far off, belonging to the Duke of
<hi>Ormea;</hi> being come to a Bridge neer the Town, which, contrary to his
opinion, he found well munited, he met with stout resistance; which spun out
the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to such a length, as though the Genoese had possess'd themselves
of the Bridge and of some neighbouring Houses, yet some Souldiers co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from
<hi>Tenda</hi> to defend it, they worsted the Assailants, and slew a hundred of
them, so as the rest were forced to sit down by their loss, and to retreat to
<hi>Ormea,</hi> from whence they were come: the Duke pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that this was
done in time of Truce, exclaimed much against it; without whose knowledge this
dissaster had hapned; and being desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to know how it came to pass, found
that <hi>Mark Antonio</hi> by License from his Uncle, General
<hi>Brancaccio,</hi> before he had received Orders from the Senate to abstain
from doing any offence, had done this, the General having forgotten to recall
his License: a frivolous excuse, and which would not have kept the Fact
unpunished, had not the Dukes Captains violated the suspension of keeping from
doing any injury made by <hi>Castagneda,</hi> a little before; for one of the
Dukes Gallies go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>Villa Franca</hi> had given chase to a Barque of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and had taken it neer <hi>Albenga,</hi> and brought it to
<hi>Villa Franca,</hi> the Masters of the Merchandize, nor of the Barque, never
having received any satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: but the Duke impatient of affront, watched
for revenge; and having had private intelligence with the Captains of the
Garrison in <hi>Zuccharello,</hi> he sent 600 Horse, with Musketeers
<hi>encroupe,</hi> to <hi>Garessi,</hi> a Town neer <hi>Zuccharello,</hi> with
intention that being let in by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators in the evening, privately, by
the Conspirators, and killing as many of the Garrison as should resist them,
they should make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves masters of the Town, which being done, they should
go that very night, being guided by one that was of the Plot, to
<hi>Albenga</hi> about six miles off; where General <hi>Brancaccio,</hi>
relying upon the Garrisons of <hi>Pieve</hi> and <hi>Zuccharello,</hi> did
carelesly reside; and as if he were to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with somewhat of great
importance, whilst he could not have advertisment of what had hapned at
<hi>Zuccharello,</hi> he should beat down the Gate of the City, and let in his
companions, who should not be far off, take the General prisoner, make himself
master of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and make way for the taking of <hi>Pieve,</hi> and of all
the Towns till you come to <hi>Porto Mauritio;</hi> which Towns were not likely
to make any long resistance, when <hi>Albenga</hi> should be taken. The design
had prospered, had not the Conspiracy which was very neer being effected, come
to light: but it being suppress'd, and the Author and Complices thereof
imprisoned, they according to Military custom, were made to pass the Pikes; and
the Garrisons being changed, and the places of greatest importance re-inforced,
the Dukes men were forc'd to give over the enterprise, and to retreat. The
peace of the Commonwealth was likewise disturb'd by the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi>
his sudden coming from <hi>Marcelles</hi> with seven Galleoons, amongst which
was <hi>l' Almirante,</hi> a Vessel of great burthen, and very well munited
with Artillery: the end thereof was never known, for <hi>Guise</hi> meeting
with a tempest whilst <pb n="347" facs="tcp:53250:181"/> he was under sail neer
<hi>Corsica,</hi> he was driven by the violence of the wind to within sight of
<hi>Genoa.</hi> The Commonwealth sent speedy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Advertisment to
<hi>Corsica,</hi> where it was thought the blow was aimed; and presently
Rigging out 12 Gallies, part her own, part the King of <hi>Spains,</hi> and
furnishing them with excellent Souldiers and with all warlike preparations,
they put to Sea two days afterwards, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Don <hi>Carlo d' Oria,</hi>
who upon this occasion was chosen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Fleet: but it being presently
known that <hi>Guise,</hi> being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by tempest, was got to
<hi>Ligorne,</hi> where he staid to make some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs for what he had suffered
by the violence of the Seas, Don <hi>Carlo</hi> made thitherward, and came to
Anchor at <hi>Marzocco,</hi> a safe Habour within two miles of
<hi>Ligorne;</hi> after two days, <hi>Guise</hi> put to Sea again, and made
strait for <hi>Marcelles,</hi> being still pursued by <hi>Doria</hi> within
Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non-shot, till going out of the Ligustick Sea he came into that of
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> and so retreated to <hi>Marcelles.</hi> Many men thought
that he had only made this shew of coming out, wherein nothing of hostility
past, except the making some shot to no purpose afar off at the Gallies which
pursued him, to satisfie the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for the moneys he had
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him.</p>
            <p>The year 1626 pass'd over with these petty accidents; about the
end whereof <hi>Ferdinando</hi> Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> died, who having no
Sons, was succeeded by his Brother <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> the third Son to
<hi>Vincenzo,</hi> the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly issue that was left of the Line of his
Grand-father <hi>William,</hi> and of his Brothers. The year 1627 insued, a
year which proved very calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to many private Gentlemen of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
in their fortunes; for those that did Traffick with the Court of
<hi>Spain,</hi> having about ten millions of moneys owing them, which they were
appointed to have received out of the moneys which were to come in the
Plate-Fleets; the King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd their payment, giving them satisfaction in lieu
thereof in <hi>juri:</hi> with irreparable prejudice and loss of the Contract;
for these particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Genoese, owing great sums of money to other men, since
they were not paid in ready money by the King, could not satisfie others, but
with the same <hi>juri,</hi> or with much delay of time, when selling those
<hi>juri</hi> they might pay them in ready money. The <hi>Conde Duca</hi> was
the chief cause of this great grievance to the Genoese; whereby the Crown of
<hi>Spain</hi> reaped so much discredit, as the Kings Revenues nor the
Plate-Fleets Treasure, being able to supply ordinary provisions, the King could
not find any afterwards who would supply him upon any the most urgent
occasions; and whereas formerly all the Gold of <hi>Europe</hi> was ready at
his service by reason of his Credit and Correspondency with the Genoese, the
Contract failing, and the King and Genoese failing both of them in their
Credit, all Nations called in their moneys, and would no longer trust them who
negotiated with the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> so as the King instead of the
wealth and affluence of Gold which he hoped for by his Decrees, found extream
penury and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible scarcity of ready moneys. The Court Affairs were yet
more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricated, for that the <hi>Conde Duca</hi> through his hatred and
abhorrescence of the Genoeses, resolving not to make any more Contracts with
them applied himself to the Portugueses, and drew them to Contract and exalting
them with extraordinary favours, profess'd that for the future 
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:53250:182"/> he would make use of them instead of the Genoese: to the
end that they being for the most part such as are descended from those, who
turning from Judaism to the Catholick Faith are treated as servants or slaves
in that Kingdom, he might the better manage them, and winde them at his
pleasure, and make use of their means and substance with less re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and
force them to Contract upon any conditions: but failing in this his new counsel
and course (for the Portugeses were not sufficient to undergo so weighty a
business, neither by their own Wealth nor Credit, nor by their correspondency
with other Nations) he was aware, though too late, that by one sole Decree he
had irreparably prejudiced the Kings affairs, and had destroyed that
well-adjusted frame, which as the chief ground-work of the enterprises and
strength of that Crown, whose Grandezza was envied by her Corrivals, the
Leagues, nor For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of so many Confederate Princes could not beat down, the
late preceding years: nor was it long ere he reaped the fruit of so
unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate a resolve; for no means being found to send moneys into
<hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> the Kings business was greatly indangered; the Army not
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able there to go that year into the Field; so as he did not only not
make any progress in his affairs that year, but the Hollanders took
<hi>Groll,</hi> with but indifferent Forces, a strong Town, and of great
consequence, in the County of <hi>Zutphen;</hi> and the next year, not fearing
the Enemies Army, they turned all their Land-preparations, to the like at Sea;
for raising 80 Men of War, they sent them towards <hi>America;</hi> and entring
the Gulf of <hi>Mexico</hi> they took the Merchants Ships, which parting from
Don <hi>Iovan di Sua</hi> went to <hi>Havanna,</hi> to joyn with the Galleoons;
and moreover, took many other rich Vessels in several parts of the Ocean, which
past from the Indies and from <hi>America</hi> to <hi>Spain:</hi> which losses
were the occasion of yet greater mischiefs, not only for what the Spanish and
Portuguese Merchants suffered, by the interruption of their Traffick in the
Indies, and in <hi>America;</hi> but also for that the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers being
inriched by so great booty were able to increase their Forces the next year,
and made greater acquisitions, of <hi>Weesel</hi> and <hi>Bolduke,</hi> places
of great concern in <hi>Guelderland</hi> and in <hi>Brabant;</hi> and on the
contrary, the Spanish Army entring <hi>Holland</hi> by the <hi>Velen,</hi> was
forc'd to retreat without doing any thing. The losses and calamities which
befell some Gentlemen of <hi>Genoa</hi> in their private fortunes, was
succeeded by another publick calamity; which though it hapned the insuing year
1628, had its rise, as the Duke professed, from a petty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident which fell
out this year: the Town of <hi>Pigna,</hi> being taken, as hath been said, by
the Genoese, paid obedience to them, though there was no Garrison in it.
General <hi>Brancaccio</hi> thought it fit, after the Peace to quarter some
Companies of Dutch Souldiers there, who for their greater satisfaction, and for
the safety of the Town, made Trenches round about it; where having kept quiet
for some moneths, it so sell out, as some of them going upon their private
occasions to <hi>Busso,</hi> a little Village under the jurisdiction of
<hi>Pigna,</hi> not above a mile off, which formerly had rendred willing
obedience to the Captain of <hi>Pigna,</hi> they found a Garrison of the Dukes
men in it: which being told to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and by him to General
<hi>Brancaccio,</hi> order was given to drive them from thence: the Dukes men
defended themselves; but not being able <pb n="349" facs="tcp:53250:182"/> to resist, the
most of them, together with some of the Town Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, both men and women,
were slain. The Duke who had not forgot what had hapned at <hi>Briga,</hi> was
very much scandalized with this second accident, which seemed to be another
attempt against that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse which had been wrought by the mediation of
<hi>Castagneda;</hi> and exclaiming sufficiently against the Spaniards both in
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to other Princes, he publish'd a
<hi>Manifesto,</hi> wherein he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused the Genoeses as infringers of the
Truce, and of the agreed upon suspension of Arms; for having retaken
<hi>Pigna,</hi> which they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly abondoned, he hereunto added the
assault at <hi>Briga,</hi> the spoiling of the Country, the extortions and
damages occasioned to his Subjects by the Souldiers of the Commonwealth; that
they had attempted to suborn his vassals, cut down many Chesnut-tree in
<hi>Ormea,</hi> and that, lastly, by what had been done at <hi>Busso,</hi> they
had manifested how little they valued the Spanish Agents, their Faith, their
Word, and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension of Arms made by the Spanish Agents; wherefore he
deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded satisfaction, if not, he threatned revenge: to this purpose he sent
the Abbot of <hi>Virgis</hi> to <hi>Genoa,</hi> to treat with the Marquesses of
<hi>San' Croce</hi> and <hi>Castagneda:</hi> the Commonwealth appointed process
to be made against those who had used such cruelty towards women and children
at <hi>Buss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and none being
found guilty but some few Corsicks, who were fled, only one of them that hapned
to fall into the hands of Justice, was hang'd: but the Duke continuing his
threats, seemed as if he would once more assault the Commonwealth. The Duke of
<hi>Feria</hi> was at this time sent for back into <hi>Spain,</hi> who till
further provision should be taken was succeeded by Don <hi>Gonzalle di
Cordua,</hi> who fearing some novelty to be made by the Duke, and thinking
himself by the new League made with the Commonwealths obliged to defend her
Territories, he sent Count <hi>Luigi Terto</hi> to the Western River with his
Brigade, against which the Duke did likewise greatly exclaim in the same
<hi>Manifesto;</hi> pretending that the King ought not to assist those who by
the breach of Truce had given him just reason of resentment; nor could he do it
without express breach of the Convention at <hi>Monsone,</hi> by which it was
agreed that if any tumults should arise in <hi>Italy</hi> between the
Colleagues of either of the Crowns, none of their Majesties should assist his
Colleague, till the occasion of difference had been discust in the others
Court, and there compounded: whilst these things were in debate,
<hi>Vincenzo</hi> the new Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> died, which occasioned
greater commotions in <hi>Italy,</hi> and seemed to divert the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> from his new threatned resentments against the Commonwealth,
upon these sleight occasions.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>BY the death of Duke <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> who died in
<hi>Christmas,</hi> the year 1627, the States of <hi>Mantua</hi> and
<hi>Montferrat</hi> fell to <hi>Charles Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga,</hi> Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi>
Son to <hi>Lodovick,</hi> who was youngest Son to <hi>William,</hi>
Grand-father to the three last deceased Dukes; there was none of the legitimate
male line of the <hi>Gonzagli,</hi> who were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede him; (for the
legitimate male-line of <hi>William</hi> ceased by the death of
<hi>Vincenzo)</hi> who the day before his death did therefore command his
Subjects of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to swear allegiance to the Duke of
<hi>Retell,</hi> eldest Son to <hi>Charles,</hi> who was absent, in the name of
his Father <hi>Charles.</hi> This <hi>Retell</hi> was sent for to
<hi>Mantua</hi> by Duke <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and was kept there during his
life, and after his death, in consideration of the future succession: the same
Duke, a little before his death, for the beuer security of succession, would
have this Duke <hi>Retell</hi> Marry the Princess <hi>Maria,</hi> Daughter to
Duke <hi>Francis,</hi> and Niece by the Mother side to the Duke of
<hi>Savoy;</hi> (she of whom so much hath been spoken in the beginning of this
Book) and to this purpose a dispensation was already privately procured from
the Pope. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was not a little troubled at this
Marriage; nor were the Spanish Agents less troubled then he: both parties
complained grievously, that this young Lady should be disposed of without the
participation of the King or Duke (who had so much interest by way of Alliance
in her) not so much as waiting for their approbation; and professing much
amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at it, they had well nigh threatned publick resentment: but the
outward shew of this dissatisfaction differ'd from what lay conceal'd in the
bosom; the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> intended this Lady for Wife to the Prince
Cardinal of <hi>Savoy,</hi> so to add by this new title to his antient
pretences of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the acquisition whereof he thirsted more
after in this present conjunction of times, then ever he had done formerly; and
the Spanish Agents (who abhor'd that <hi>Nevers</hi> should succeed in those
Dominions) hoped (as it was thought) if they could have effected it, to make
use of this Princess, whereby to exclude him totally; nor was it long ere both
these parties discover'd their aversion to <hi>Nevers</hi> his succession; for
though falling into the <hi>Valtoline</hi> by the Swissers and Grisons, and
from thence being come to <hi>Mantua</hi> thorow the Venetians Territories, he
was readily received by all the Mantuans, and obeyed as their Prince; yet the
Spanish Agents refusing to receive him, or to call him Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> professing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and do in this business,
as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should do, and that he would totally depend upon
his authority; the Orders of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> whither these
advertisments were speedily sent, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: from whence they hoped and
undoubtedly held that orders and resolutions would be sent, to cross the
succession of the new Duke, because they knew that this had been discus'd and
almost resolved there, before the death of Duke <hi>Vincent.</hi> The Emperours
intention was that the succession of these States being to divolve upon a cross
line, and that many would pretend to this succession; the possession thereof
should be delivered up to him as to the Supream Lord and Sovereign 
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:53250:184"/> Judge, that he might afterward dispose thereof to those
who should have most clear title thereunto: this, he said, the peace of
<hi>Italy</hi> required, and this was wont to be done by the Imperial Chamber;
that it was thus observed in the succession of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> when it was
ventila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by many Competitors, after the death of <hi>Iovan Georgie
Falleologe.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did not concur alone with the Duke
of <hi>Nevers,</hi> in his antient pretentions to the Dukedom of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> but also <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet,</hi> the Dowager Dutchess of
<hi>Lorrein,</hi> eldest Sister to the three last Dukes, pretending by her
proximity of relation, not to exclude the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> only, but
also Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> her Brothers Daughter, respect being had to Duke
<hi>Vincenzo,</hi> last dead; whose succession was now the thing disputed, and
not the succession of Duke <hi>Francis,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Mary,</hi> who was
succeeded by her, <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> and since by <hi>Vincenzo;</hi> and as
for the Dukedom of <hi>Mantua,</hi> whereof women are made incapable, Don
<hi>Ferrante Genzaga,</hi> Nephew to that so famous Captain, Don
<hi>Ferrante,</hi> who was younger Brother to <hi>Frederick</hi> Duke of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> the new Dukes Grand-father by the Fathers side, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur:
he grounded his title upon the interpretation of certain words of the ancient
Investment; and upon <hi>Nevers</hi> his incapacity (as he alledged) of
succeeding in those Dominions, for that both he and his Father had born Arms
against the sacred Empire, whereof those States are anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fees. Pretentions
which were thought to be willingly listned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the Emperour and by the
Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by exclude <hi>Nevers</hi> as
they intended to do: nor were those of the house of <hi>Gonzaga</hi> against
Don <hi>Ferrante</hi>'s pretentions, thinking that by <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> his
exclusion, their succession grew neerer; and therefore some of them were
suspected to have had private dealing and treaties with Don <hi>Ferrante,</hi>
presently upon the death of Duke <hi>Vineenzo,</hi> to put him into possession
of that City, and to cry him up Duke; and when he died there we e some
Souldiers ready to do it, who being suppress'd more by dissimulations
seasonably, and by provision taken to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, then by punishment or by
being publickly taken notice of, their endeavours proved vain: <hi>Nevers,</hi>
on the contrary, pleading the clear and undoubted meaning of the Law, by which
the next Heir to the last Lord is to be admitted into possession of the Fee,
not only against those who lay in wait for the succession, but against the
Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and lawful Lord, (when laps or the devolution of the Fee should be
pretended) said that the Decree of the Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth,
made against the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> being passed between the Ancestours of
either of them; since which the said Duke, not having gotten any new pretences,
he could not prosecute his former claim, as long as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the
possession of <hi>Nevers</hi> his Ancestors, otherwise then in the awarded
manner; and for the Dutchess of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> that she was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded either
by the male-kindred, though never so remote, as it had been formerly practised;
or by her Niece, who was in a neerer degree to succession: but as for Don
<hi>Ferrante,</hi> who was clearly descended from the second Son of him by whom
they all laid claim, what colour of reason had he to pretend to the ancient
investment, whilst the line of the eldest Son was not yet void: which
Investment prefers the first born, and those that do descend from them, before
all others, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press <pb n="353" facs="tcp:53250:184"/> order of Birth-right; and as for
the incapacity that was objected against him, he denied that either he or his
Father had ever carried Arms against the Sacred Empire; and shewing the scars,
yet remaining in his Breast, of the wounds which he had received in
<hi>Hungary,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had fought in behalf of the Cefarian Majesty and
of the house of <hi>Austria;</hi> he said, that no incapacity could be objected
against him, for any peace that had since insued: in the Articles whereof a
full and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pardon was granted to any of the contrary party, who had drawn
their swords in that war: but the strong endeavours to the contrary made by the
Spanish Agents prevailed more with the Emperour, then these solid and evident
Reasons; who knowing that this Prince was bred up in <hi>France,</hi> allied to
the blood of <hi>France,</hi> joyn'd in Kindred to the King; (who was Feudatory
to that Crown, by the great incomes which he possessed in that Kingdom,)
thought it to be too dangerous for them to permit a Lord of two Dukedoms, and a
master of several strong holds upon the Confines of <hi>Millain,</hi> to be
placed in the bowels of <hi>Italy,</hi> lest being upheld and adhered unto by
<hi>France</hi> he might afterwards raise up new parties and factions in
<hi>Italy,</hi> by which their Kings authority might decline from that
preeminency, in which he did more easily and more securely maintain himself,
without any fear of the French, who had not one foot of Land in <hi>Italy:</hi>
a danger which the present condition of times made to appear very probable, by
the desire which, upon many of the Occurrences, was discovered in the French of
getting greater power in <hi>Italy,</hi> then the Spaniards had; and by their
being fomented by many Italian Princes, to the end that they might, for their
own interest, see the authority of <hi>France</hi> prevail over that of
<hi>Spain,</hi> or at least stoutly counterpoise it. The Spanish Agent did
therefore servently endeavour that the Emperour (who to keep the house of
<hi>Austria</hi> in chief authority amongst all Christian Princes, was
concern'd in the same ends and designs,) might readily lend his hand, and joyn
with them in excluding the new Duke; and the Spaniards authority was greater at
this time with the Emperour then usual; for the late merit by powerful aid both
of men and money afforded by the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> in the troubles of
<hi>Germany,</hi> added to the community of concernment; without which he could
hardly have made his party good against the Rebellions and contrary Factions of
<hi>Germany;</hi> and the continual need he stood in of the like assistance,
for that those flames were not yet quite extinguished: so as it becoming him to
second their interest, he to pleasure them had given them order, whilst Duke
<hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> was yet alive, (but not likely to live long,) that if the
Duke should die, they should possess themselves of those States; which when the
time came, they forbare to do, not thinking the time yet proper, nor affairs
well prepared; and though the Emperor seemed, when the Duke was dead, to
continue in the same mind; yet he appeared somewhat cooler in the manner of
proceeding; claiming therefore the possession of those States by publick
Decree, as due to him, he sent Count <hi>Iohn di Nassaw</hi> into
<hi>Italy,</hi> with the title of Cesarian Commissary, to take possession of
them in a civil manner, if the new Duke should willingly assign them up; and if
he should refuse to do so, then to proceed by Citations and Declarations, and
afterwards by Imperial Proclamation, and so by <pb n="354" facs="tcp:53250:185"/> force of
Arms: the Spaniards who upon the first Orders had betook themselves to the
business, and who were most and neerliest concern'd in the danger, appeared
more hot and fervent; for thinking it would be more easie to drive a new Prince
suddenly out of his State, then to tarry till he should be consolidated
therein, and might by making Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Fortifications make the enterprise
harder, they admitted of no delay; and the rather for that the King of
<hi>France</hi> (whose opposition they only apprehended) being busied with all
his Forces before <hi>Rochel;</hi> and therefore not able to apply himself much
to the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> nor to send succours to the new Duke; they
thought they should lose time, if they should not readily imbrace so opportune
an occasion. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> invited them much thereunto: who
professing that he would keep firm to that Crown, promised many things on his
part in favour of the new enterprise: but the instigations and relations of Don
<hi>Gonzallo di Cordua</hi> prevailed more with the King and Court of
<hi>Spain,</hi> then any thing else; who desirous to have the free and absolute
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State of <hi>Italy,</hi> being Governour there now (as hath
been said) till a new Governour might be provided; as soon as he heard of Duke
<hi>Vincenzo</hi>'s death, began to hold intelligence in <hi>Cassalle,</hi> to
have one of the Gates of <hi>Cassalle</hi> delivered up unto him; and having
agreed the business, he inform'd the Court by Letters of the intelligence he
held in that City, and how easily it might be gotten; which being done, he said
that the acquisition of the rest would with the same facility fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: in fine,
not only he, but all the rest of the Spanish Agents la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to exclude the
new Duke. But the Court, which long before Duke <hi>Vincents</hi> death had
foreseen this accident, and perhaps had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved not to permit the French to
get such power in <hi>Italy</hi> by <hi>Nevers</hi> his succession; yet being

               </gap>ained from moving therein, in
considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the unjustness of the fact, or weary of their unfortunate
success in the late Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> it abhorred to have to do in so
scandalous a novelty; and therefore did at first put on the more just and
favourable resolution, not only of consenting to <hi>Nevers</hi> his new
succession, but to receive him into the protection of the Crown, and to be his
friend: and in conformity to so holy and wise a resolution, dispatches were
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready sent out of the Kings Chancery; which not being yet come to
<hi>Italy,</hi> the Dukes Letters and the Advertisments of Don
<hi>Gonzallo,</hi> and of the other Spanish Agents, arrived at the Court;
whereby they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the King with what intelligence they held in
<hi>Cassalle:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the mind of the Court was soon alter'd, and the
justice of the Cause being born down by the apparent advantage of the new
acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the assured safety which would thereby redound to the
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Italy;</hi> they resolved to oppose the new Duke, with might
and main, and by open war to keep him from the succession of those States; and
the charge of this new enterprise, together with the abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Government of
the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> (which was the thing he aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto,) was
given to Don <hi>Gonzallo,</hi> the chief Author and Promotor of so unhappy and
unfortunate an advice: in the execution whereof, though the Emperour had not as
yet absolutely consented thereunto, Don <hi>Gonzallo</hi> began to declare war
in the Emperours name; and for his better preparing of Men and Arms, he
alledged the Emperours <pb n="355" facs="tcp:53250:185"/> Decree of Advocation for the
ground work of the Enterprise; and said, That whereas the Duke ought to have
been put into possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those States by the Emperour, he had actually, and
of his own Authority intruded thereinto, contrary to the said Decree: He also
gilded over this new Commotion with endeavours for the publick Peace of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and for the safety of the Affairs of the Crown of
<hi>Spain.</hi> And lastly, but rather by way of complaint, than of any
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full occasion of new War, he added the Marriage of the Princess
<hi>Mary,</hi> concluded without any respect to the Kings Alliance or
Authority. These were the reasons alledged for this present War, which being
but little allowed of by the tacit consent of most men, and as they rendred the
Spanish Forces but little justifiable, and <hi>Cesar</hi>'s resolutions not
correspondent to the fame and universally conceived opinion of his Piety and
Religion; so did they, on the contrary, reconcile, through commiseration, the
general favour to the new Dukes Cause; as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppress'd meerly for reason
of State, he had been suffocated only by the covetousness and force of a more
powerful Adversary: But it being apparently known, that the Emperour proceeded
herein, more as forced by the urgent and importunate instigations of the
Spanish A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, than by his own genius and will, as it did in part excuse him
from mens sinister opinion, so did it lay all the odium and blame upon the
Spaniards; which appearing naked in the Field, unassisted by the Imperial Name
or Authority, which they carried in their foreheads, written in golden Letters,
they did appear to men what they intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally were, not bent to favour the
rights of any of the pretenders, nor to the maintaining of the Cesarean
Authority, but to the new acquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Territories, and to the further
enlarging the Kings Empire in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the suppressing of that
Prince; so as the Insurrections of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> susteined and
fomented by the Spaniards, had fill'd <hi>Italy</hi> with jealousies and
suspicions, and rendred their name odious; so their present betaking themselves
to the manifest usurpation of a Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without any the least colourable
reason, forc'd the Italian Potentates to privide for their private and for the
Common safety, which, if the Spaniards should obtain their ends, they foresaw
would be much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s reconciliation to the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> did accelerate the Enterprise against the new Duke; for
the Kings Agents, to make the business easie to themselves, and to lay the way
open for the taking of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> which they did so excessively desire;
and firmly believing the Duke would not stand idle upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, nor
suppress his ancient presences; and on the other side, the Duke seeing that he
could not better advantage himself in the present conjuncture of times then by
help from <hi>Spain;</hi> therefore all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects being laid aside, they
thought neither of them could do better than to hasten the conclusion of the
Agreement, which had been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of long before, touching the division of
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> by which <hi>Trino, Alba, San Damiano,</hi> and many other
Towns of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assigned over to the Duke (which being
more incorporated with <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont,</hi> was very advantagious for the union
of that State;) the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards were to put themselves into the possession of
the rest, wherein was comprehended <hi>Cassalle, Pontestura, Montcalvo, Nice,
Acqui, Ponzone,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <pb n="356" facs="tcp:53250:186"/> with the adjacent Towns,
which, as being annex'd unto, and confining upon the Marquesate of
<hi>Finale,</hi> and the River of <hi>Genoa,</hi> made much for the
accommodation of the Spaniards. It was agreed upon by colourable pretence,
<hi>That each of them should prosecute the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise in</hi> Cesar<hi>'s
Name; That it should not be lawful for the Duke to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie any place he
should take; and, That neither of them should be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance in the
possessing of what should fall to them by the Division.</hi> So the Duke, that
he might get part, since he could not get the whole, was content that his
Niece, the Princess <hi>Mary,</hi> should be quite bereft of the whole; and the
Spanish Forces, which till now withstood the Dukes pretences, for their own
interest, began now to protect him therein. The French had long before this
endeavoured to disturbe this reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation; and to this end it was thought,
that in the Negotiation of Peace between the Duke and the Common-wealth, they
held the Dukes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences very high, not so much to gratifie him at the
Genoeses cost, and to mitigate the injury done him by the Peace of
<hi>Monsone,</hi> as for that Peace remaining unconcluded by reason of the
Dukes high demands, the reconciliation should not be effected; and not
herewithall content, that they might keep him to fide still with them, they,
during Duke <hi>Vincent</hi>'s life, held Treaties of Alliance between the
Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> and Princess <hi>Mary;</hi> and between her Mother
the Dowager Infanta, and the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> with some settlements
touching the pretensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Montferrat;</hi> and Monfieur
<hi>Sanchiamond</hi> being to this end sent Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour Extraordinary from the
King to Duke <hi>Vincenzo,</hi> after Duke <hi>Ferdinando</hi>'s death, by the
usual way of condoling and congratulating, he, as he pass'd through
<hi>Turin,</hi> and went afterwards to <hi>Mantua,</hi> treated thereof with
them both in the Kings Name: But Duke <hi>Vincent</hi> dying not long after,
the no sincerity of the Negotiation appeared, by the sudden match which was
concluded, not without satisfaction and joy to the <hi>French,</hi> and to the
same <hi>Sanchiamond,</hi> (who because he was in <hi>Mantua</hi> when the Duke
dyed, and when this match was made, was thought to be conscious of all things
that had past) wherat the Duke was very angry, and held himself to be much
injured, and complain'd grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously thereof to the same <hi>Sanchiamond,</hi>
who was at this time returned from <hi>Turin</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> and to
Monsieur <hi>di Guron,</hi> a Gentleman sent by the King of <hi>France</hi> to
keep him from the new Reconciliation, with new offers, not only touching his
new pretensions, but of assured and powerful assistance against the Genoeses,
for recovery of the Towns upon the River, which were allotted to him by the
Articles of <hi>Susa;</hi> for the King of <hi>France,</hi> being sufficiently
imploy'd and intent about the business of <hi>Rochel,</hi> did not omit any
indeavours whereby the Affairs of <hi>Montferrat</hi> might be friendly
compounded between the two Dukes: This was the Auge or Vertical point of this
Princes Greatness; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at one and the same time sued unto in his own
Court, and Idoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, as a God on Earth, by the Agents of two great Kings, and
tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by most advantagious conditions to joyn with them, as if all their
actions did depend upon him, and as if the whole Foundation of the safety of
the present Affair did in him consist. And as it often falls out in humane
affairs, that when things are come to the highest point they begin to decline,
so fared it with this Duke; for not being able <pb n="357" facs="tcp:53250:186"/> to mount
higher, and not being able through the volubility of Affairs to continue long
in that pitch, he was forced afterwards to stoop from that exaltation, and was
brought to lose a great part of his State, and almost to his utter ruine: Being
amidst so many Proposals, and finding himself, together with the former
offences, injured by the French, by the duplicity of this Matrimonial Treaty;
and being conscious to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self of the fresh injuries done to the King and
Crown of <hi>France,</hi> he gave no beliefe to his Agents great offers; and
thinking that he might build more safely upon the favour of the Spaniards, by
reason of the community of Interests, and by the advantagious bargain which he
should get from them, in the dividing of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> he rather chose
to joyn with <hi>Spain</hi> than with <hi>France;</hi> and afterwards
acquainting the French Agents with this his resolution, he tacitely pleaded the
Peace of <hi>Monsone</hi> (made by their King) for his defence, without
acquainting his Confederates with it, nor making any the least account of their
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, and in a gibing manner added, That he had learnt of their King
to joyn readily with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> which being now so faithfully
united to that of <hi>France,</hi> as might be seen by the helps which
<hi>France</hi> received from <hi>Spain</hi> in the business of
<hi>Rochel,</hi> it shew'd that it was not to be doubted, but that he being
also joyned to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> would never be able to disunite it
from that of <hi>France,</hi> nor be any prejudice to it. The French Agents
being therefore dismist with small satisfaction, as also the French Souldiers
who were under his pay; but keeping <hi>Marini,</hi> the French Resident in
<hi>Turin,</hi> till such time as his own Resident should return from
<hi>Paris,</hi> his Reconciliation with <hi>Spain</hi> was perfectly
established, but unhappily, as it proved by the great prejudice which (contrary
to their supposals) befel both him and the King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the conclusion and exclusion of these practises the new Dukes
affairs were brought to a very bad condition, both in hopes and opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for
the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was his chief Protector, not being able to
sustein him, either by authority or force, he had little help to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
elsewhere, against the Emperour, King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> who joyn'd all together to drive him out of his State, the
latter two by force of Arms, and the first by Judicial Authority and Edicts; so
as none of his other Friends, who wish'd him well, could assist him, without
indangering themselves, since he wanted the strong support of <hi>France:</hi>
And the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> though they were much troubled at this
Prince's prosecution, for the example and consequence thereof, yet were they
forced to proceed very circumspectly in declaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and much more in
assisting him: nay, it was to be feared, that, if required, they would have
declared against him. The Emperours Authority was at this time very great and
formidable, having gotten the upper hand of the Prince Palatine, and of his
abettors; all the Princes and Hans Towns of <hi>Germany</hi> rendred him exact
obedience, not so much for fear of his powerful Army of above 100000 fighting
men, which being distributed into several parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> were ready
at hand, as for that by his happy Successes, and continued course of Victory,
he seemed to be miraculously favoured by the Heavens: And truly he was in his
actions the most formidable of all his Predecessors; <pb n="358" facs="tcp:53250:187"/> and
undoubtedly had he turned his Forces upon <hi>Italy,</hi> he would have found
ready obedience; so as the Pope and Venetians, in whom all <hi>Nevers</hi> his
hopes did rest, were forced to proceed with great caution in these present
affairs, which did not directly appertain unto them. The Venetians, that they
might keep from provoking him, by adding new injuries to the ancient enmities
contracted with this very Emperour, when upon the <hi>Croates</hi> account they
assaulted <hi>Gradisca,</hi> and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deprive him of his Patrimonial
Estate in <hi>Friuli;</hi> and the Pope, for that Peace between him and the
Emperour, making much for the good of Christendome, it became not him to break
it upon the score of the new Dukes succession.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Authority was likewise augmented by the Peace
made by him at this time with the Turk and Transilvanians, and by the
advantagious offers which were made unto him by his Rebels, and by the Head of
them, the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> who being several times routed by him in
Battel, and berest of a great part of his Kingdom, desired Peace: wherefore it
was to be doubted, that these Commotions being appeased, which were those which
did only disturbe the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> the Emperour, to maintain
his Authority and Command in <hi>Italy,</hi> should have made good his threats
of passing into <hi>Italy</hi> with powerful Forces, when the Process should be
ended which was then begun against <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> and that War should be
publish'd against him, in case he obeyed not the Imperial Edicts or Banne.
Reason was added to these respects, which ought to detain the new Dukes friends
from declaring themselves to favour him: For the Emperour being Supream Lord of
these States, and of the new Duke, none could or ought legitimately to
interpose between him and his Vassal, nor reprove or correct any Judgment that
should pass, there being none to whom recourse was to be had in point of
grievance: And yet <hi>Nevers</hi> thinking, that to quit his possession
willingly was the worst of evils, resolved to keep it till the last; he
therefore betook himself to munite <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Cassalle</hi> the
best he could, both of them being very strong places, the last by Art, the
other by Nature, and stood prepared to receive so great a storm; he
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing offered (since the King of <hi>France</hi> could not assist
him) several Proposals of accommodation to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> desiring the King that he would receive him into
the accustom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed protection of his Crown, as he had done his Predecessors, and
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing to be willing to depend in all things upon his Authority:
More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, to the end that he might not appear contumacious to <hi>Cesar</hi>'s
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and to the end that the Citadel of <hi>Cassalle</hi> might not keep
the Spaniards in perpetual jealousie, he of himself offered to receive Dutch
Garrisons, which should depend upon his Cesarean M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>jesty, and to set up the Imperial Ensigns, into all the
Towns of his Dominions, except the City of <hi>Mantua,</hi> which was not (as
he said) a Magazine of Arms, and <hi>Cassalle,</hi> where in lieu of receiving
in a Garrison, he offered to beat down the Walls and Bulwarks, which divide the
Citadel from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to the end that being both joyn'd in one Body, they
might be the more easily taken; which Proposals not being accepted, they did
not at all retard the going on of the Enterprise, nor were they sufficient to
keep off the Process and Citations of the Imperial Bands or Edict, 
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:53250:187"/> which were intimated unto him, and threatned by the
Cesarian Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, who was at this time come into <hi>Italy.</hi> The
Marquess of <hi>Canossa</hi> was Governour of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the
Marquess <hi>di Rivara</hi> was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of the Citadel; the latter a
Montferrian, the other a Veronese; but the Chancellor <hi>Traiano
Guiscardi</hi>'s authority was Superintendent in the conduct of publick
Affairs; one who was very well vers'd in the Affairs of the world, quick
witted, very vigilant and careful of the new Prince his interest, and partial
to <hi>France.</hi> These providing all things necessary for the defence of
these and all other places of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> did attentively observe the
proceedings of the Governour of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and of the Duke, who
growing daily more fervent in the business, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for offending:
<hi>Nevers</hi> did the like in <hi>Mantua;</hi> and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, nor other
Spanish Agents, not having been any ways diligent, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Vincenzo</hi>'s
death, in keeping either Subjects or Forreigners from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring to desend that
City, many Souldiers came by threeves into <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> through the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> through the Venetians Towns, and those of the Genoese; and
many French who were cashiered after the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s
reconciliation and declaration, were got into <hi>Cassalle:</hi> so as before
the war began, the new Duke had got about 6000 Foot, and 1000 Horse into
<hi>Mantua,</hi> part of the same Nation, part Forreigners, and of those, most
French; and in <hi>Cassalle</hi> there were about 4000 Foot, and 400 Horse, all
of them Montferrians, unless it were 500 French, who being cashie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed by the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had
listed themselves under Monsieur <hi>di Guron.</hi> There came thither also,
after the Enemy was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd before it, the Marquess of <hi>Beveron</hi> in
disguise, who was come from <hi>France</hi> to serve in that war, that he might
be re-admitted from ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which he had a little before incur'd for
fighting a Duel. A gallant Gentleman, and well vers'd in arms: these two Towns
being strong and abundantly furnish'd with Garrisons, it was probable that both
the Sieges might prove long and difficult; and that therefore the oppugners,
who were but few in number, might not come off with honour from that
Enterprise, as being either weary or wasted by time, by warlike actions, by
sufferings and hardships, or forced by French succour, or by some other
strange, unthought-of accident. Besides <hi>Cassalle,</hi> two other Forts were
to be expugned, <hi>Nizza</hi> and <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> and two Towns,
<hi>Ponzone</hi> and <hi>Pontestura.</hi> The taking whereof, they being
reasonably well munited, would require length of time, and more men: on the
contrary many things made against the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> and against the
Governour, whose eyes were chiefly fix'd upon <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sale;</hi> scarcity of
men, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e not being then in the
State of <hi>Millain</hi> above 2000 Horse and 12000 Foot; 2000 whereof were to
be kept in <hi>Como,</hi> for the necessary, defence of the passes towards the
Swissers and Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons: 4000 others, and 800 Horse, were of necessity to be kept
in the Quarters of <hi>Cremona</hi> upon the Mantuan Confines, against the new
Duke; whose numbers being increased threatned many things: so there were no
more then 6000 Foot, and 1500 Horse to march into the Fields. True it is, that
a Truce for six moneths being agreed upon be ween the Commonwealth of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained 5000 Foot from the
Commonwealth, wherewith having suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently garrison'd the Towns <hi>della
Riviera,</hi> he seemed to have no want <pb n="360" facs="tcp:53250:188"/> of men during
the Truce: some men, but not many, were likewise expected from <hi>Naples,
Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardigna:</hi> to the want of men were likewise added the
want of Victuals, by reason of the great barrenness of that years Harvest; and
the want of ready moneys, by reason of the suspension of payment made the King,
as hath been said; and these were necessarily accompanied with the want of
credit amongst the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Genoeses, and of the Court it self: so as the chief
sinews of war being wanting, it was impossible to raise more men, or to make
much provision for the Enterprise, It being impossible to sit down upon so many
disadvantages, and upon so ill grounds, before <hi>Casalle,</hi> a place strong
of it self, but much stronger by the Cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>del, very capacious, and of a large situation, flank'd by six
Bulwarks, begirt by large and deep Ditches, and which being wholly planted and
fortified by all the rules of modern Fortification, was deservedly thought, and
commonly held to be a royal Fort, and the strongest that was in all
<hi>Italy,</hi> except <hi>Palma</hi> in <hi>Friuli;</hi> it would have been
more wisely done to have defer'd the Siege till a more fitting time; and though
the desire and haste of this new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition did exceed all other
considerations, it had been more to the purpose to have taken first some of the
Towns about it; and putting 500 Foot, and 200 Horse into each of them, and to
have cleared the ways with them, to the end that neither Victuals, Men nor
Munition might have been brought thereinto; and whilst they should have thus
besieged it at a distance, to have gone with the rest of their men to before
<hi>Nizza,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Montcalvo</hi> and <hi>Ponzone;</hi> and
having reduced the weaker Towns, to have gone then with all their Forces to
besiege <hi>Casal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le;</hi> and streightening the Siege, to bring it to a
necessity of either surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring it self, or of being stormed. But this being a
business of length, and the Governour being desirous, according to his promise
made to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to end the business in a short time, he
prefer'd the taking of the place before any other resolve, being thereto
invited not so much by the small quantity of Munition, which (as they say,) he
was made believe was in it, and by the intelligence which he had therein; as
building his belief upon the small experience and resolution which he thought
to be in the defendants, who were (for the most part) Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrians, common
people, who being affrighted and terrified by the loss of their Houses and
Fields, when they should see them ruined by the Enemy, would not in likelihood
persist long in defending <hi>Casalle.</hi> But their Calculations proved
false, and their designs vain; for the Munition and Provision did far exceed
opinion; and the Montferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans proved not only more valiant, but more faithful
and constant, then Subjects use to be to a Prince who was hardly known to them:
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence wrought no effect, either through the diligence of the Duke
of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Captains and Officers, or out of the diffidence and fear
of those that treated therein. The Governour, notwithstanding, coming into the
Field about the end of <hi>March,</hi> and passing over the <hi>Po</hi> at
<hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> came with his Army to <hi>Frassinero,</hi> the first Town of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> two miles distant from <hi>Casalle;</hi> where making a
Magazine for Arms, for Victuals and Ammunition, he muster'd his men; wherein he
found not above 8000 Foot, and 1500 Horse; wherein were comprehended 2000
Neapolitans, who were first of all come from the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> under
<hi>Antonio dal Tuffo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="361" facs="tcp:53250:188"/> The City of <hi>Casalle</hi> stands upon
the Banks of <hi>Po,</hi> in a Plain on the left side of the River: the form
thereof is irregular, but rather round then of any other shape: it is begirt
with Walls, unless it be on the North side, where the <hi>Poe</hi> coming
almost up to the Wall serves for a Ditch: on the South side, where the Plain
extends it self, is the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, within half a mile whereof the Hills draw
neer, and ancient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle defends it. It was thought very fit by many to make
themselves masters of the Hills, not only because they command the City, but
for that the defendants would thereby be streightned in Victuals; for being to
expect succours only from <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which lies behind the Hills, the
seizing of them deprived the defendants of all hope of succour: but we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e it either that the Governour, who was almost equal to
the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants in Foot, was loth to part from the Plain, where he was superior
in Horse; or that he thought if he should incamp upon the Hills he should be
too far from the River, from whence he was to receive Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and other
Provisions, not without danger of having them inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the City which
would be between the River and him; or that he thought his very accosting the
City would be enough to take it, he kept upon the Plain; and going from
<hi>Frassinero</hi> went in Rank and File towards <hi>Casalle;</hi> whither
when he was come so neer as that the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non could not reach him, he halted,
and quarter'd himself before that part of the new wall which is called <hi>Alla
nuova,</hi> which thrusting out from the Citadel towards the <hi>Poe,</hi>
joyns with the ancient wall of the City. At the sitting down of the Camp, those
within, according to the custom of Souldiers, sallied out very strong both in
Foot and Horse; and shewing great courage, made a stout Skirmish that day,
which lasted till night; and though they were manfully withstood and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd,
they failed not to make another sally the next day, out of a double design: the
one to hinder the Enemy as much as was possible from fortifying himself, and
from making his approaches, or at least to retarde them: the other, that they
might gain more time to fortifie themselves the better on the side whereon they
were assaulted: nor did their endeavours prove vain, for being defended by
Artillery from the Citadel, which plaid upon that side, they came to underneath
the Rampiers, where they fought valiantly; and being afterwards pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued, they
retreated safe to underneath the shelter of their Cannon. Continuing to do thus
many days, they afforded their men conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency to fortifie their new wing,
against which the Enemy bent their whole Forces; and they had made two
Half-moons beyond it, which defended the new Gate, and two great Plat-forms,
which did also shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Mills which furnish'd them with grist: but the
assailants being got so neer as they were able to plant Batteries, they raised
four, one of Italians, on the side of the Capuchins Church, the other three of
Spaniards, neerer the <hi>Poe;</hi> from whence, though they began to play
fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously, yet did they advance but a little; for the shot gave only against
the highest houses, and sometimes slew some of them who wrought upon the
Trenches; and having spent some days thus, and finding themselves deceived in
their opinion of taking the Town <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o easily, and of the sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ll resistance they should meet with, they began to distrust the
sequel, and to know by experience, that all they did was but apparent 
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:53250:189"/> loss of labour, time and reputation: they knew also that
Victuals were daily brought into <hi>Cassalle</hi> by the way of the Hills, and
new men and fresh Provisions, which the Montferrians, who extreamly hated the
Spaniards Government, and were desirous to keep under their natural Prince,
brought in: so as finding now for certain that it would be too desperate an
enterprise for them to attempt that place without being masters of the Hills;
and knowing the necessity thereof, it became them to desist from what they had
begun, and fall to another manner of Siege, that would be more convenient, and
more profitable; which they might the more commodiously do, for that all the
men that could come from the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> were already come; and
from <hi>Naples</hi> 1200 Neapolitans, and as many Spaniards, to boot with 400
Sardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians from <hi>Sardinia:</hi> so as the Camp being stronger in men, was
like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise more able for the enterprise of the Hills then before: but being loth
to acknowledge an errour, and a certain ambition peculiar to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, who
rather then to amend resolutions already taken, will be subject to any
inconveniences that may thereby result; and the hopes which they had given at
Court of the easie, and speedy dispatch of the business, would not suffer the
Governour to re-begin it, when by his promise he was obliged to have ended it:
so as deceiving both himself and the Court, he continued his former supposals;
and (with some new additions,) forced himself to persist therein: wherefore
without quitting those Quarters he resolved upon two Enterprises: The one, to
deprive the Enemy of the Mills; the other, to take <hi>Rossigliano,</hi> a
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle upon the Hills, five miles distant from <hi>Cassalle;</hi> not so much
for that when they should have taken it, it would avail much for the taking of
the Hills, as for that it was a receptacle for the Montferrians who were a
Convoy to the Victual which were brought to the City, and which oftentimes did
infest the Spanish Horse which were quartered abroad in those Countries. But
neither of both these Enterprises did hit; for Don <hi>Frederico Enriques,</hi>
going with six Companies of Foot, and three of Horse, to surprise that Castle,
and having to that purpose carried along with him some Petards,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e got not thither before
Sun-ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, through the maliciousness of his Guide, who was a Montferrian, and
prolong'd his March: so as being discovered, and finding the Draw-bridge up,
and the Walls full of defendants, he was forced after a sleight attempt to
retreat, with the loss of eight of his men, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fifteen wounded,
(amongst which he himself was one, being hurt, though but a little, in the head
with a stone;) and <hi>Luigi Trotto,</hi> Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master, who had the Enterprise
of the Mills given him, not being able to advance straight forwards, for the
two Forts which defended them, went with 3000 Foot, and 200 Horse commanded by
<hi>Gambacorti</hi> into the Island which the <hi>Poe</hi> makes, over against
them; and having raised a Battery there, he did nothing of moment, being
hindred, partly, by a great B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nk,
which was erected over against the Enemies Battery upon a sandy hill between
the Battery and the Mills, partly by the fulness of the River, which twice
overflowed a great part of the Island, to the danger of himself, and of some of
his men, whereof some were drown'd in the River; and that he might avoid that
danger, he was forced to retire to the other Bank, where he raised another
Battery, but did there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <pb n="363" facs="tcp:53250:189"/> no good, by reason of the far
distance, as also for that those of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle</hi> removed the Mills a
little higher, where they were hidden, and shelter'd from the sight of the new
Battery; so as being forced to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go the enterprise there also, he retreated
to his former Quarters. The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> going at the same time out
of <hi>Turin</hi> with 4000 Foot, and 1200 Horse, had more luckily begun to get
what was by the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion allotted to his share: he fell first upon the City of
<hi>Alba,</hi> whither being come he easily took it, there being only two
Companies of Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in it, too weak a Garrison, and not suiting with the
large circuit of the Walls: but in a sleight Skirmish which hapned between his
men and the defendants which stood upon the Wall, some of his men were slain,
amongst which the Count <hi>di San' Trinita. Alba</hi> being taken, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the Country there about, he went to <hi>Trino</hi> with 4000 Foot and 1000
Horse; he begirt it on the side which lies towards <hi>Casalle,</hi> by which
way only succour could be brought: he made a long and crooked Trench about it,
and plaid upon the Wall with 20 pieces of Cannon placed upon five Batteries;
and then drew neer the Ditch with Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes, and endeavoured to bereave the
defendants of their Rampiers: the defendants were not above 300 paid Foot, 200
of the Train Bands and two Troops of Horses: it was but ill provided of
Artillery or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition; there being only three small pieces in the Town, and
some barrels of Powder: wherefore the Duke having come with his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to
the Ditch, and taken a little Half-moon, and being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gotten under a
greater, which was over against the Gate, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to undermine it from the
one end to the other; then threatning the defendants to give fire unto it
unless they would yield, the Captain of the Garrison, though the breach made by
Battery was not great, and that he had other Plat-forms to retreat unto, yet
terrifi'd with fear of the mine, and having spent all his Munition, he demanded
that he and his Garrison might be suffer'd to come forth with their Arms and
Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and that they might be convey'd into <hi>Cassalle:</hi> which
Articles being agreed unto by the Duke in ambiguous terms, the Captain and five
of his Officers were permitted to go into <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> and the
Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were set at liberty: but the Governour understanding what Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
the Duke had made, sent some Troops of Horse towards the way which leads from
<hi>Trino</hi> to <hi>Casalle,</hi> which kept the Souldiers from entring
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: these two places being taken,
the Duke was possess'd of all that by the Articles of division fell to his
share: for the other Towns being but small presently came in unto him, and
swore fealty; and the Duke, for the better establishment of what he had gotten,
began to build a Fort Royal about <hi>Trino;</hi> which being in a short time
finished, began to be almost as untakeable as <hi>Cassalle,</hi> with no little
prejudice to the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and this Fortification being
contrary to the Articles of Division, the Duke to appease the Governour, sent
to take <hi>Ponte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stura,</hi> and having obtain'd it upon Articles, he caused
it presently to be delivered up unto him, as what belong'd to the King by the
Articles of Division: being afterwards desirous to take <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> a
Town which did not belong to him by the Articles, he turn'd all his Forces upon
it. The Governour and other of the Kings Commanders were not a little troubled
at this the Dukes so speedy success, for they being <pb n="364" facs="tcp:53250:190"/>
imploy'd about the taking of a Town, which proved every day harder then other
to be taken, from whence they could not in honour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, nor make any
advantagious advancement in the business of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat;</hi> they envied
the Dukes prosperous proceedings; nor could they without indignation tolerate
to be constrain'd to keep there useless and idle, and expect that the Kings
Forces should be aided and assisted by the Dukes Forces; and because to fall
again upon the taking of the Hills, as they found at last it was necessary to
do, would be a business of length, and was generally detested by them all,
since thereby they must confess their errour committed at the beginning of the
enterprise; they bethought themselves of reaping the same advantage, as they
should do by making themselves masters of the Hills, by another shor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and
more easie way, and more to their honour. <hi>Nizza della Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia</hi> held out
still for <hi>Mantua,</hi> and being, as it were, the head and Bulwark of the
lower <hi>Montferrat,</hi> many things were brought from thence, by way of the
Hills, into <hi>Casalle;</hi> this <hi>Nizza</hi> lies upon the road that leads
from the Sea; and now that <hi>Trino</hi> and <hi>Montcalvo</hi> were taken,
none of the rest of the upper <hi>Montferrat,</hi> being taken out of the power
of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua,</hi> could afford any help to the besieged: so as when
<hi>Nizza</hi> should be reduced, all the rest of the lower <hi>Montferrat</hi>
would be kept from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so likewise; and then <hi>Casalle</hi> not being to
be relieved by of the Hills, nor from elsewhere, what could it think of but of
surrendring? this was also chosen before the making themselves masters of the
Hills, by reason of the news of the coming of the French; who having no place
of refuge when they should be come into <hi>Italy,</hi> but <hi>Nizza,</hi> it
was to be feared that they might fortifie themselves there; and making it a
Magazine for Arms, they might prove a great impediment to the chief Siege: out
of these Reasons, this Enterprise was thought to be more honourable, more
necessary and convenient, and was therefore prefer'd before that of the Hills:
4000 Foot were therefore immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sent thither commanded by Count <hi>Iohn
Serbellone,</hi> together with 50 Horse, and ten piece of Cannon: there was
nothing in <hi>Nizza</hi> but the Montferrian Militia, two Sakers, and one
Murthering piece, and there was scarcity of warlike Munition: but it is true
that Count <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monte,</hi> a French man, was come thither some days before,
with some other of the same Nation, most of them experienced men, and men of
commands who coming from <hi>Mantua,</hi> and passing one after another in
disguise through the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> saw that the Enemy approached
<hi>Nizza,</hi> and made stout resistance, and Skirmishing with them, strove to
keep them from taking up their Quarters, from fortifying themselves, and from
making Battery; these did for some days hinder the Enemies proceedings; but not
being able to disturbe them totally, the enemy at last planted batteries on
three sides; and because a good Half-moon was erected against the weakest part
of the Wall, they made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches that way to take it; thinking that
when they should have done so, they might the more easily take the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>own; and whilst they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
with their Spades, they attempted to take it by an assault by night: but
finding the defendants more ready to receive them then they had imagined, and
more stout resistance, they were forc'd to retreat with some loss: being
retired, they endeavoured to get neerer, and having <pb n="365" facs="tcp:53250:190"/> got
to within the Ditches, they digged a mine; which when they should have
perfected, they resolved to give fire unto it, and to fall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to
assault: the mine being set on fire before hand by the cunning of those that
were within, and who made it play, wrought no effect, and yet the assault was
given, which was so manfully withstood, as the assailants were forced again to
retreat, with more loss then formerly, many of their valiantest Souldiers being
therein slain: yet this days acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was not altogether in vain, for the
assailants having taken station in the Ditch of the Half-moon, they went about
to destroy it by fire; which being discover'd by the defendants, who had spent
all their Powder, and saw there was no hope of holding out longer, they came to
Articles; which being agreed upon much to their honour and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, they
surrendred the Town after having stoutly defended it for above a fortnight:
About 500 of the assailants died before it: Count <hi>Serbellone</hi> was hurt
there in the arm and thigh with a Musket shot, and Count <hi>Trotti</hi>
received a sleight wound in the face: all the Towns of the lower
<hi>Montferrat</hi> follow'd this surrender, except <hi>Ponzone,</hi> which
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying upon the strength of its situation held out for <hi>Nevers.</hi> The
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being gone, as hath been said, at the same time to
<hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calvo</hi> took the Town with ease; and having plaid upon the Castle
with battery and mines, he after a while took it also; and being invited by the
strength and opportunity of the situation, it lying between <hi>Asti</hi> and
<hi>Trino,</hi> be kept it for himself, contrary to the Articles of Division,
and contrary to the Governours opinion, who thought he would have dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of
it, as he had done of <hi>Pontestura;</hi> and placing a Garrison of
Piedmonteses in it, he said he would accord the business with the King, and
give him equivalent Towns for it. This action of <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> as also
the fortifying of <hi>Trino,</hi> was rather wink'd at, then well taken, by the
Governour, and other Spanish Agents: but the same reasons which induced them to
Capitulate with the Duke, to keep him by that means from being averse unto them
in the business of <hi>Casalle,</hi> when he was not possess'd of any Towns in
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> forc'd them to see through their fingers now, when by
suffering him to possess himself of so great a part of that State, they had put
him into more power and greatness; and when he by fortifying <hi>Alba,
Trino</hi> and <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> had made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self more able to defend
himself, and to offend others. Moreover, great preparation of Arms and Men
being known to be upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of <hi>France,</hi> it became them not
only not to distaste him, lest joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the French he might plot
novelties, tending to more preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice then that of <hi>Casalle;</hi> but they
were forced to furnish him with much moneys and men, for which he very much
press'd, to make him oppose, and resist the French Forces; to the danger
whereof since he was first exposed, he had just reason to fear, that his
Dominions would be made the seat of war: the demands were thought just, and
necessary to be granted; for the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> seeing himself in
effect destitute of help from <hi>France,</hi> that Crown being wholly busied
before <hi>Rochel,</hi> he had by mortgaging his Land in <hi>France,</hi>
raised about 12000 Foot, and 1500 Horse; to which, by Order from the King,
Marshall <hi>Cricky,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> was to joyn with the
ordinary <hi>Gens d' Arms</hi> of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which might make about 5000
Foot, and 500 Horse: The <pb n="366" facs="tcp:53250:191"/> Marquess of <hi>Montenegro</hi>
also, many of his men being run away for want of p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y, desired a recruit of Souldiers, to defend that
Frontier against the new Duke, whose numbers were now grown to be about 8000
Foot and 500 Horse, wherewith, when he heard that the French were come into
<hi>Italy,</hi> he threatned to joyn in the freeing of <hi>Casalle,</hi> and in
the recovery of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t had been
lost.</p>
            <p>The Governour and Spanish Agents were doubtlesly troubled at these
accidents, who being before <hi>Casalle</hi> (a place not likely soon to be
taken) with few men, little money, and less credit, knew not what to do to
satisfie the Dukes just and necessary demands, and to withstand so great a
deluge of dangers which threatned <hi>Italy,</hi> and chiefly their own
Concernments: But they were most of all troubled by their fear of the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi>'s truth and constancy, and by their jealousie, that having now
got a good part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> he either out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of
preserving it, or of advancing to greater things, or to avoid new Wars in his
own Dominions, might bethink himself of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what else to the prejudice of the
Union which he had contracted but a little before with the King; especially
since it made not much for his own interest that <hi>Casalle</hi> should fall
into the Spaniards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ands: They
knew what private intelligence he held continually in the Court of
<hi>France;</hi> they knew how he was threatned on the one side, and what great
offers were made him on the other side by that Court against the Genoeses,
great inci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ements to work upon any
whatsoever constant heart, and to make the best composed judgments waver, much
more the Duke, who was generally held to be a friend to Novelties, mighty
desirous of revenge upon the Genoeses, and naturally given to do what made most
for the advancement of his own affairs. <hi>Claudio Marini</hi> the French
Embassadour was suspected conscious of some secret mystery, he being still
detained in <hi>Turin,</hi> though under the colour of Hostage, till the Dukes
Resident should return from <hi>France;</hi> and though the said Duke seemed
outwardly very much to study the welfare of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
Proceedings, and profess'd great constancy to the new contracted Amity, and
behaved himself with great observancy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>at Court and the Agents thereof; yet this so great and
so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary affection of a Prince who but a little before was an Enemy
had in it more of seeming then sincerity. These suspitions were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by
the doubt, that nor the Governour, nor other Spanish Agents had real good
intentions for the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> it not being very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that when
they should be Masters of <hi>Casalle</hi> they would make him greater by
maintaining him in his new acquisitions; for the Articles of division agreed
upon between the Duke and the Governour in the Kings name were never accepted
of in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> by the King, nor approved of in
<hi>Germany</hi> by the Emperour, who could not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blushing proceed
rigourously against the one, and wink at the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the other; and
therefore signified to the Duke that he should restore what he had taken, and
to the Spaniards, that they should cease from besieging <hi>Casalle:</hi> So it
was to be believed by the speedy and strong fortifying of <hi>Trino, Alba,</hi>
and <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> that the Duke of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> had the same opinion
of the Spaniards towards him, as the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards had of him towards the Kings
Affairs; and that therefore this ill <pb n="367" facs="tcp:53250:191"/> composed Union,
though it appeared outwardly to be very affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and sincere, was nothing
in reality but a desire of obtaining by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal deceit their several ends;
the one their intent upon <hi>Casalle,</hi> the other a good part of
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> which when they should have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passed, then to hinder
under-hand each others ends and interests. Nor was the Duke (since he was
possess'd of what he pretended unto) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased at these jealousies of the
Spaniards, since his joyning with them in this present conjunction of time made
more for them then ever, and made them be the readier to give him all
satisfaction: He therefore failed not to feed them with some demonstrations,
which though they were but slight, were of no slight consequence; just as it
fell out, when speaking with the Governour he appeared in a Cassock so made, as
turn it which way you will, it suited with the person; an Emblem which tacitly
threatning change, alluded to the condition of his own affairs, which being
turn'd on all sides did naturally fit all States: but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of
<hi>Montcalvo,</hi> and the fortifying the Towns he had got, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to
agreement, contrary to the president of <hi>Pontestura;</hi> his great
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, his daily immoderate demands, and the great storm which seemed to
threaten him from <hi>France,</hi> made him be daily more and more suspected:
insomuch as in the Camp and throughout the State of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> he was
ill spoken off, as if he were already fallen from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and re-united to the King of <hi>France:</hi> which favour he was to obtain by
the detention of what he had taken, and by the River of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> and a
good part of the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> that therefore it was too dangerous
to continue friends with him, and to assist him against the French, with whom
he was already closed; as if to furnish him with moneys were to impoverish
themselves, and to afford him the better conveniency to arm himself to their
prejudice; and that to grant him men were no better then to submit the cream,
and the best of those few who were left to defend the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> not only to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Enemy, but to the Dukes
uncertain faith: to dismember the Kings Forces, and to expose the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> to the manifest dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Forreigners with whom the Duke was
Confederate: and yet so great was the necessity of keeping him to side with
them, as contrary to so many and so manifest appearances, and contrary to so
great probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of suspicion, the Spanish Agents were so firm, and constant
in their dissimulation, as appearing to confide very much in him, they did not
only in this their so great need deprive themselves of 5000 of their best Foot,
and send them to <hi>Piedmont</hi> to oppose the French, who were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
gotten neer the Alps; but by publick Proclamations, and upon pain of severe
punishment, prohibited the speaking ill of the Duke, and consenting to any
demand he made, though never so great, though contrary to their chief ends and
interests: which was yet more clearly seen in the great ruptures which hapned
at this time in the City of <hi>Genoa;</hi> some of the Popularity whereof
conspired against the publick Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment moved thereunto, partly by private
injuries received from some of the young Nobility, partly for that they
appeared to be excluded from the administration of the Commonwealth; and to
this purpose having held intelligence with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he
promised to assist them with men to execute their designs: moneys under several
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences <pb n="368" facs="tcp:53250:192"/> were disperss'd abroad amongst some of the
meaner sort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who being naturally seditious, they thought might be
easily brought to joyn in the Conspiracy; and moneys were also sent to many of
the neighbouring Villages, making some of them acquainted with the secret; and
telling other some how that they meant to make use of their service, in a
private resentment which they intended to make; and they had likewise got over
unto them some Out-laws, people of a lewd life, and those who for their service
in war had got pardon for enormious faults; and hoping, to boot with these to
get the universali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people to side with them, when the business should
be begun, they resolved to kill the Senate and greatest part of the Nobility,
and to make a new form of Government: but the Plot being discovered, some of
the Delinquents were taken; against which whilst process was making, the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> discovering himself to be the Author of the Conspiracy,
pleaded their impunity, pretending that the conspiracy being contrived with his
knowledge and intelligence, in resentment of what had hapned at <hi>Busso;</hi>
that the Truce insuing afterwards, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution was suspended by his command;
and that he had therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd the Conspirators, that they should enjoy
the benefit of the Truce, as being therein comprehended, in case the conspiracy
should in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim be discovered: he press'd the Governour and the Marquess
<hi>di San' Croce</hi> very much in their behalfs, and engaged himself so far
in the impunity of the Conspirators, as causing the Genoese gentlemen to be
closely imprisoned, who were formerly his prisoners, and whom he had set at
Liberty after the Truce, but upon their Paroll of not going away; he resolutely
promis'd they should all be put to death, in case they should proceed in
<hi>Genoa</hi> to punish the Conspirators; and on the contrary, if their fault
were pardoned, he offer'd peace to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, upon very advantagious
conditions for her. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and the other Agents knew they were in a
great streight; for the Duke building very much upon the Truce made by their
appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pretended these as mediators, were to force the Commonwealth to
observe it, and not to break it by punishing the Conspirators; and those
Agents, whether they approved of this pretention or not, were unwilling to
alienate and distaste the Duke, by denying his request, or by consenting, to
cause new troubles between the Duke and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, by which the King
would be constrain'd to declare in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the one or the other of them,
with great danger to the present Occurrences: yet in this so detestable
example, the new reconciliation and fear of alienating the Duke prevail'd over
the merit of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and uninterrupted friendship of the Commonwealth;
and the Dukes satisfaction was prefer'd before any respect of publick honour,
or of the Kings dignity; wherefore the Governour and other Agents were very
servent in the point of freeing the Conspirators, and used all their endeavours
in obtaining their pardon; insomuch as they presented Letters written by the
King to the Commonwealth for the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors impunity; which by the
circumstance of time appeared to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med upon Blanks. which upon like
occasions are trusted with chief Agents; and the Governour sent <hi>Don Alvaro
di Lusara</hi> to <hi>Genoa,</hi> to treat herein with the Commonwealth;
propounding unto her Senators, <pb n="369" facs="tcp:53250:192"/> how easily they might
obtain a safe and good peace from the Duke by pardoning the offenders; and on
the contrary, how much their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would irritate him, and would occasion
new wars and troubles, worse then the former. The Dukes pretentions appeared to
be false; for the Conspirators forbore not to prosecute the business, after the
Truce, which had it not been prevented, would have been effected within a few
days; and though it did clearly appear that they treated with the Duke in
<hi>Turin,</hi> yet did they never alledg the Truce for their defence, nor any
or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der from the Duke to supersede, nor any promise of pardon from him if they
would desist: so as it appeared clearly that all were but false pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,
which he strove to maintain by his own authority, by the favour of the Spanish
Agents, and by threats: the Commonwealth being scandalized at so exorbitant
pretences, and at the Spanish Agents so strange pressures; the Council, which
by reason of the paucity of the number is called <hi>

to authorize and make our enemy Duke, the Protector of our people, which is the
thing he so much now affects? so as afterwards all rules of respect would be
broken, tho gate would be thrown open to insolency, the fear of punishment
taken away, the Majesty of this Government suppress'd, the Authority of this
Order trode under foot, and the peoples obedience lost; and will any endure to
hear of peace upon these conditions? will there be any one found so little

of</hi> Augustus Caesar, <hi>that having found revenge and punishment to be
rather a spur, then curb to new Conspiracies, he approved of his Wives counsel,
which was, to pardon; and he found it to be a wholsome antidote, and a more
proportiable preservative for the malignant and dangerous dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of those
times; for the good name he got of being merciful and gracious did radicate the
hatred which the people, being grown perverse through fear, did bear him, and
planted in the place thereof cordial affection toward a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigne Prince; who
before by frequent punishment, was abhor'd, and whose death they plotted: what
good will it do to use pardon in these tempestuous times, when it shall be
thought that it is not clemency, nor sparing of humane blood; but fear of the
Dukes threatnings, the fear of greater evils, which hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted it from us?
so all the merit of benignity, all the fame of clemency, will be attributed to
the Duke our enemy: he shall be the pious deliverer, he the affectionate
Protector of the oppressed: not only the guilty, but all the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents
shall thank him only: we poor souls shall, on the contrary side, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
bloody oppressors, we shall be hated by the people, laugh'd at by stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and generally detested by all men: and therefore, if to pardon so enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a
fault, will in other respects be accounted a great errour in us, how much will
that errour be multiplied when it shall be known to be done at the importunity
of the Duke, and of the Kings Agents? therefore the more we are thereunto
prest, the more backward ought we to be in consenting, the more obdurate in
denying it: assuring our selves, that (undoubtedly) we can undergo no
misfortune, and that no greater disaster then this can befall us: good God! did
we not fear the insolent threats of the Duke, for a petty Fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farm, wherein the
main of our affairs were little or not at all concern'd, when he was upon good
terms with the French, without whose help he would never have dared to assault
us? and shall we now succumb to so unjust demands in a thing wherein our vital
spirits are concern'd, after that same Duke hath tried, how hard it is to
justle with our mountains, when we see him inveloped in the wars of</hi>
Montferrat, <hi>irreconcilably fallen out with the King of</hi> France, <hi>and
so unsincerely united to the Crown of</hi> Spain? <hi>but some peradventure may
doubt, that the Crown of</hi> Spain <hi>being incens'd at our denial, may joyn
with the Duke, and appear against us on his behalf. Truly, he that shall doubt
this, will, in my opinion, shew how little he understands the affairs of the

not concern'd in point of State Affairs:</hi> John Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navelt, <hi>the greatest
man amongst the States of</hi> Holland, <hi>a man of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent advice, the
Oracle of the united Provinces, grown old in State Affairs, having past all the
Imployment as well within the Commonwealth as abroad, who had been imploy'd, by
way of Embassie, in all the weightiest affairs, to the Northren Kings and
Potentates; this man, not many years ago, being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the emulation of
Count</hi> Maurice, <hi>and the authority of the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful prosecutor
prevailing over the worth and merit of so gallant a man, he was put to death:
so great was the fame of his worth, such was the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his actions,
as the Princes of those parts did compassionate his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: and the King
of</hi> France <hi>interceded for his pardon, not with his name subscribed to
blanks, but by an extraordinary Embassadour: all men know of what power that
King is with the united Provinces, and how well that Crown hath deserved of
them; and yet the Kings intercessions not being listned to, he lost his head:
what ruine do you hear, Gentlemen, that this repulse brought 
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:53250:193"/> with it to the Hollanders? you may peradventure think
that a French-like fury, more terrible then the raging of the Sea, might devour
those Provinces? nothing less; the King was not all troubled at it, he broke
not with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth which had been a friend to his Crown; nay, he did
not so much as withdraw his wonted favours and succours from them: how unequal
is the comparison, if you consider the quality of the Deliquents, the enormity
of the fault, or the occasion of the demand? and shall we doubt to findless
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration in the Court of</hi> Spain, <hi>in a cause incomparably better,
then the Hollanders did in</hi> France? <hi>shall we think that the King

the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>and of his Agents in</hi> Italy? <hi>or that he
will joyn with</hi> Savoy <hi>against us, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge himself upon us for our
denial? how far do these conceits differ from the ways of that Court? how
contrary to the weighty concerns of that Crown? how repugnant to the Faith and
Magnanimity that his Majesty professeth, and observes to his Friends, and which
(upon all occasions,) but particularly in these last wars he hath profess'd to
us, and effectually maintained? the sencelesse fear of the King if</hi> Spains
<hi>anger being removed, what are we to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, if we consent not to these
so unjust demands? our Citizens lives peradventure, who are Prisoners with the
Duke? where are the</hi> Bruto<hi>'s, where the</hi> Torquato<hi>'s, who for
the preservation of Military Discipline, spared not their own Sons lives? I
call you generous, noble, and truly Roman minds to witnesse, and your</hi>
Curtii <hi>and</hi> Decii <hi>also, who did willingly sacrifice your own lives
for your Country, and for the safety of the Roman Legions; for Gods sake, if
you be called upon, do but only appear, to the confusion of such, if any such
there be amongst us, who can be wrought upon to any sinister resolution either
by neernesse of blood, or tendernesse of affection, or by the vain danger of
the Confederates; but why talk I of the doubt, or danger of our Prisoners
lives? who will ever believe so brute and barbarous an action in a Christian
Prince, which would appear infamous and bestial in a Scythian, Thracian or
Cannibal: I pray you say, if this Prince who hath insidiated our lives by so
horrid a Conspiracy, should bring the business to be doubtful and dangerous;
what should we do? shall we suffer the publick safety to run cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ruine,
for saving the lives of a few, though never so deserving Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens? nor would
they themselves (so much do I confide in their worth) give way thereunto; nay,
were they permitted, upon their promise given to be true prisoners, to appear
before us; I assure my self, that like so many</hi> Attili Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goli <hi>they
would supplicate us, that preferring the publick honour, before their private
safeties, we should shew that constancy which the duty we ow to our selves, and
Country, obligeth us unto; and that having gotten their request, they would
with a generous and constant mind return to receive the punishment which should
be provided for them; and on the contrnry, if by their pardon obtained, they
should find this Commonwealth so shamefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with such a scar, and
miserably perishing, and like to die of such a wound, they would detest their
own lives, and would hate those to death, who should so shamefully have
betrayed the Publick, for their private safety: they would, in fine, (if the
heavens should have so ordered their destiny) not value that life, which when

               <pb n="372" facs="tcp:53250:194"/> This opinion was not only attentively
listned unto, but approved by an unanimous consent of all the hearers: insomuch
as any one repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant voice or suffrage being produced, not any one of the
prisoners kindred, whereof many were present at this Debate, gave their Votes
to the contrary; wherefore in pursuance of the Sentence pronounced against the
Prisoners, (not allowing them any minute of delay more then what is usually
appointed by the Law;) four of the Conspirators were beheaded; who had been
found guilty by former process: at which the Duke being highly incensed, he
gave Order that four of his Prisoners should lose their heads; appearing
resolute to have it done, and the Heads man was even now ready to do his
office: but at last, being either overcome by the intreaties of some of his
followers, or frighted with the unworthiness and atrocity of the action, or
that (peradventure) he did never really intend it, he commanded forbearance;
and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and other Officers, no less incensed, then the Duke, against
the Commonwealth, seemed to be mightily scandalized; not so much for that
adhering to the Duke they desired to make him know, that they joyn'd with him
in being unsatisfied; as for having upon this occasion sufficiently engaged the
Kings Authority, they thought it was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle prejudiced by this the
Commonwealths so absolute resolution: inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as though two of those
Conspirators who were already behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were sent by the Governour to the
Commonwealth, before the Duke appeared to favour the Conspiracy; yet some other
of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come unto his hands, he set them at liberty: not making any the
least account of the Commonwealths intreaties, as he had wont to do upon lesser
occasions: others to the end that if they should be cited they might have
occasion to avoid judgement, were secured in the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and
the Duke entertaining other of the Conspirators with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary favour,
advanced them, and protected them in his Court; and did further suffer them to
publish seditious Papers in Print, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to incite the Genceses to
rebellion: assuring them that the Duke would declare himself in behalf of their
liberty; and which was of more importance, he by means of the great power he
held with the Spanish Agents, endeavour'd to raise enmity between them and the
Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeses, telling them for their better incouragement, that he held many
intelligences in <hi>Genoa,</hi> by which he might easily turn the affairs of
that Commonwealth upside down; and giving an inkling that the French would joyn
with those that should revolt, he strove to make them joyn with him in the same
enterprise, to the end, that they might totally exclude the French from out of
<hi>Italy;</hi> and to keep him from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to recall them once
more thither, that he might work revenge upon the Genoeses. These the Dukes
endeavours did doubtlesly much perplex the Spanish Agents, who by reason of the
present business of <hi>Cassalle</hi> had daily more necessity of keeping the
Duke firm unto them; and <hi>Genoa</hi> appearing to be the stumbling-block
against the which all their corrivals were with all their Forces to give, men
were very doubtful what resolutions the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> would put on
touching these Occurrences; it not being comprehended by their actions, nor
penetrated into by their discourse, to what side they inclined: so
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable were the gainsayings both of accidents and reasons, on either 
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:53250:194"/> side: yet the firm belief, that the addition the Duke
had got by the new acquisition of part of <hi>Montferrat</hi> might cause
jealousie in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> overcame all other considerations: so
as it was not probable, that the Spaniards would add scandal to scandal, and
increase jealousies in <hi>Italy,</hi> and contaminate the glory which they but
a little before had gotten in the defence and preservation of the Commonwealth,
by ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandizing the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and by oppressing a Commonwealth
which had always been so singularly affected to <hi>Spain,</hi> and from whence
that Crown had received such advantages: yet so naturally are men desirous of
novelty, and inclined to sinister interpretations, as many thought that the
Court of <hi>Spain</hi> did not only lend an ear to the Dukes practices, but
consented thereunto: it is true that these men doubted whether that Court
proceeded really and sincerely herein, or cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, only to keep the Duke
well affected to the enterprise of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and to divert him from
the practices which he seemed to be resolute in, and might easily effect by
assistance from <hi>France,</hi> to the prejudice of the Commonwealth: these
sinister reports which were publickly divulged, together with news of divisions
and factions in prejudice to the Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eses negotiated by the Duke, were
occasioned by divers demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that Court: which having notice of what
had hapned, and of the Dukes complements and exclamations, accompanied by the
sinister in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations of their Agents in <hi>Italy</hi> touching the
conspiracy, touching the danger of alterations in that City, and concerning the
inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which might result to the Kings interest, if the affairs of
<hi>Genoa</hi> should be molested; and some memorials of the Conspirators in
<hi>Tori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and of some other popular men in <hi>Genoa,</hi> concurring
herewithall; they made so sinister an impression of the State and Government of
the Commonwealth, as the King, and generally all his Officers, either to secure
the affairs of the Crown, or to keep the Duke true unto them, and for his
better satisfaction, seemed little satisfied with relations to the contrary,
made by <hi>Lucca Pallavicino;</hi> who upon this occasion, was sent once more
Embassadour in extraordinary to that Court; and they complain'd much of the
haste used in executing the Conspirators; and seeming to value the Dukes
satisfaction more then the reasons alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the Commonwealth, they broke
out into words of anger and resentment; which made the Genoese interpret
sinisterly of them, and of their intentions, as if they had been disaffected,
and much alienated from the Commonwealth: to this was added, that the Count
<hi>di Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terei,</hi> President of the Counsel of <hi>Italy,</hi> and Cousin
to <hi>Olivares,</hi> being destined Embassadour to the Pope, was ordered by
the King to be gone presently for <hi>Italy,</hi> and that he should tarry some
moneths in <hi>Genoa;</hi> it being generally thought that he had many private
Commissions given him, and of great importance to the affairs of
<hi>Genoa:</hi> but the Genoeses were yet fuller of jealousies and fears, by
reason of the news that in these turbulent times came to that Court, of a
Victory gotten by the Duke against the French, at the foot of the Alps, who
came to succour the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and to free <hi>Cassalle;</hi>
these were said to be about 12000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, led on by the Marquess
<hi>d'Uxel,</hi> with whom Marshal <hi>Cricky</hi> could not joyn, either out
of some private emulation and distaste which he had to the Marquess, or else
being detained by <pb n="374" facs="tcp:53250:195"/> the Dukes men, under Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> in <hi>Savoy.</hi> The Marquess at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the Pass called
<hi>dell' Agnello,</hi> by which falling into the Vale of <hi>Uraita,</hi> in
the Jurisdiction of <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> you come to <hi>Castel Delphino;</hi> a
passage large enough, and therefore commodious for Horse, and whereby, without
meeting with any obstacle, you may come to the plain of <hi>Saluzzo</hi> and of
<hi>Piedmont:</hi> But the Duke, who had already fortified and munited all the
Passes of the Alps, had not left this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortified; for having built a Fort at
Castle S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Pietro,</hi> neer the mouth of the Valley towards
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> he incumbred that passage, so as it was impossible to
advance further before that Fort was taken; and Artillery being requisite to
the taking thereof, it proved a business of much length, by reason of the
difficulty of carriages, to boot with the uncertainty of the event: and yet the
Marquess being desirous to advance, march'd on; and having first taken three
Redoubts which the Duke had set up upon the Mountains, he fell into the Valley
of <hi>Uraita,</hi> which takes its name from the River which descending from
the Alps runs throughout it, and comes within six miles of Castel S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <hi>Pietro;</hi> whether <hi>D'Uxell</hi> being come, and seeing that the Duke
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd with his men, he placed his men in order upon a little rise. The Duke
had with him about 12000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, those being therein comprehended
who were sent unto him by the Governour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Camp-master <hi>Gill de l'
Arena,</hi> which were 5000 Foot; and immediately sending Prince
<hi>Victorio,</hi> who was best acquainted with the Country, with good part of
his men, to possess himself of the skirts of the Mountain which shape the Vale,
he staid with the rest, and with the Kings Auxiliary Forces, to defend the
plain; where making a Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron in
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ace of the French, he kept a
quarter of a mile off, observing their movings: The Marquess seeing that he had
to do with the Enemy upon the Plain, and upon the skirts of the Mountains, sent
a good Band of men against those that defended the Mountains, and with the rest
charged the Dukes right wing, where the Neapolitans were, who, assisted by the
Piemontese Horse, made stout resistance, insomuch as the Assailants not being
able to stand before them, were forced to give back: A thousand of them, seeing
it was impossible for them to force their way, waded thorow the River, and
getting upon a little hill put themselves there in order: The others, advancing
by the skirts of the Mountains, assaulted the Dukes men, who seeming to give
back, drew them into an ambush which they had prepared; falling wherinto, those
of the Ambush fell upon them with such violence, as being forc'd to retreat,
they were afterwards put to flight, with a great loss of men: Those who were
sent at first against them on the hill ran a fortune not much unlike to this;
for the Prince observing the wind, which blew full in their face, caused some
little Cottages to be set on fire, the smoak whereof affording him to send men
into some ambushes without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discerned, the French men light upon them,
and were severely dealt with, and slain; and being also struck with stones
which were tumbled down from the higher places, they began to run. The
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict lasted from morning to night; and the Dukes men were so well
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of and divided, as not any one of them stood idle. The F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ench seemed that night as if they
would retire; but, as the effects shewed, <pb n="375" facs="tcp:53250:195"/> they resolved
to try their fortune once more; which the Prince having learnt by one that was
run away, he presently sent for fresh supplies of men to the Duke, which whilst
they were expected, the greatest part of the French
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>id themselves that night behind
certain Trees, and the rest upon break of day appeared in a large but very thin
and ill-compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Squadron, shewing themselves to the Prince, to the end that
allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the hopes of Victory, he might assault them, and so fall into an
ambush which they had prepared for him that very night: The Prince who expected
a re-inforcement, stirr'd not, so as those who were in the ambush came out, and
entred into the Squadron, seeming as if they would fight with more Forces then
they had done the day before; but the Prince still keeping in expectation of
succour from his Father, moved not; till finding not long after, that the
Enemies Squadron was much diminished by the retreating of many of their men, he
assaulted those that remained, who not being able to resist, were put to

<hi>France;</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being come, he with held, out of observance of the
Kings Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ving gotten
much baggage, and many Arms, which the French threw away as they fled. After
this Victory the Duke and Prince march'd presently towards <hi>Pinarolo,</hi>
lest the French being beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from hence might attempt that pass; from whence
hearing that they went towards <hi>Savoy,</hi> where Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi>
was, the Duke sent most of his men thither; but it was superfluous; for the
French were so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused and dissipated by the discomfiture, as hardly any four
of them were together in this retreat.</p>
            <p>The Duke won as much reputation, by this happy success, with the
Spaniards, as he ever had purchased the contrary before: He was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
acknowledged to be the Kings right hand, the bulwark of his Affairs in
<hi>Italy;</hi> by this action all offences were cancelled, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was
equivalent to so great merit; the King himself, hearing the news, said in
publick, <hi>That he would have accounted it a great happiness to have been
found with a Pike in his hand by the Duke his Uncles
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ide:</hi> And the <hi>Conde
Duca,</hi> chief Author of the reconciliation; boasted not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, that the
King and Court began now to taste the fruit of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels and negotiations:
But the more favour the Dukes merits found in the Court, the more jealous were
the Genoeses, who saw their own declination joyn'd to the exaltation of their
Enemy: An as the Dukes satisfaction seemed to consist in the Affairs of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and the reward equal to his vast expectation, and to his
implacable hatred to the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeses, which every day grew greater in him; so
such a great conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of will, and so general a disposition as was found to
be in that Court to gratifie him, made it be much apprehended, that some great
mischief would redound thereby, to the prejudice of the Common-wealth: This
suspition was encreased by the <hi>Conde Duca</hi> his not caring for the
Genoeses; the affronts given to the Embassadors of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and the
rigorous proceedings with others of that Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the upbraiding of the
Conspiracy, and of other accidents which had hapned at <hi>Genoa,</hi> which
accidents might by the connexion of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs redound to the prejudice of
<hi>Italy,</hi> did very much perplex the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists of that Court.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="376" facs="tcp:53250:196"/> To these things wherein the publick
Interests were concern'd other sinister demonstrations were added, which
touched the Fortunes and Interests of private men; the rigorous Decrees of the
preceding year, the difficulty in exacting the Revenues, the introducing of
other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to contract with the King, to the shame and exclusion of the
Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eses, and the continual extorting of monies from those Genoeses who
remained yet in Court, enforcing them to contribute great sums of monies for
the urgent occasions of the Crown; by which accidents the face of that Court
being totally changed towards the Genoeses both in publick and in private from
what it had used to be, they put the Common-wealth into some anxiety of their
own safety: And these Novelties and Commotions being known in <hi>Italy,</hi>
they first filled all the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> with admiration, and then
with suspition, what the sequel of so great and unexpected an alteration would
prove. These suspitions had also an influence upon other Nations, which being
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon all occasions, did not pretermit their wonted artifices to make
the rent greater; to the end that they might thereby reap such advantage as
might not conduce a little to the conduct of their Affairs and Interests: And
amongst others, a Spanish Courier being intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Seas of
<hi>Provence,</hi> who was sent to their Officers of <hi>Italy,</hi> the French
gave out, that they had found very strange Negotiation in those Dispatches
which past between that Court and the Duke, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the
Common-wealth; which Dispatch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s
being sent from the Court of <hi>Paris</hi> into <hi>Italy</hi> to the Duke of
<hi>Nevers,</hi> and by him partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated to the Pope, they were by both of
them made known to the Common-wealth; to the end that growing apparently to
distrust they might ioyn with them in the common Cause; which might procure the
lessening of the Spanish Affairs, and the advancement of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cause of
<hi>Italy:</hi> And to this purpose they offer'd with arms thrown abroad to
receive them into their protection, and profess'd readiness to defend her. The
Common-wealth being so ascertained of these advices and accidents could not but
proceed with much circumspecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to the end that on the one side too much
distrust might not drive them from that friendship and ancient conjunction
wherein at all times, and particularly upon these late occurrences, they had
always found so much truth in intention, such constant effects, and such
readiness in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution; nor on the other side, that too much confidence might
not make them run upon those dangers and prejudices whereof they had been
advertised by such a concurrence of probable accidents, with such demonstration
of affection and good will: Not that she ever doubted of the Kings good
intentions, or suffer'd her self to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded that he had conspired with
the Duke to her oppression; all that she feared was, that the Duke being now
free from fears of the French Arms, and secured from any opposition he might
meet with from <hi>Spain</hi> by his new conjunction and good correspondency
with that Court, he might bethink himself of re-assaulting the State of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and might occasion the like damages to those of the preceding
year in that River; and that the Spaniards, either not to incense him in this
present conjunction of Affairs, or by some secret Intelligence, or in
resentment of the small account they made of the Kings Intercession in 
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:53250:196"/> the punishment of the Conspirators, should not be so
much moved thereat as formerly, and foregoing his former care of them, might
suffer the Dukes Forces to take their course, and might less interest himself
in their defence: But because, though they should miss of assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from
<hi>Spain,</hi> yet neither would the French foment the Duke; the Common-wealth
therefore thinking themselves to be upon equal terms with the Duke, if he
should not be assisted by the French, resolved to provide new Forces which
might more immediately depend upon her; and obtain from the Pope, who seemed to
favour them more in this then in the former Occurrences, a thousand Foot, and
as many more from the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> with which, and with many
others that they had taken into pay, and with their own Militia, the Genoeses
re-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the most important places of their State, in their own defence,
and to resist her imminent storm which the cloudes and winds of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
season did threaten: but the coming of Count <hi>Monterei</hi> to
<hi>Genoa,</hi> upon whom all their eyes were fix'd, by reason of the news
which was spread abroad, that he was come to cause some commotions, instead of
apprehended foul weather, brought so clear skies to the Common-wealth, as (the
clouds of sinister impression being dispers'd) the rumours which were given out
appeared to be vain: he tarried two moneths in the City with much satisfaction,
and spoke not any thing tending to the administration of publick Government;
nor did the Duke, by reason of his coming, or by any demonstrations from Court,
do any thing of novelty: nay, the Count being to go into <hi>Lombardy</hi> to
treat of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Affairs with the Duke offer'd his service to the Commonwealth,
touching the compounding of differences which were then on foot; and his offer
being accepted of by the Commonwealth, he was very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and affectionate in
their interests: but the Duke was so exaspera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and incens'd for the
punishment of the Conspirators, as he could do no good by his intercession;
therefore returning to <hi>Genoa,</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented unto the Senate how much
the execution of two other of the Conspirators, who were not yet condemned,
would prejudice the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation and conclusion of peace, which was very hotly
treated of in the two Kings Courts; and interceded for the stay of execution,
which he obtained; and parting afterwards in Embassie for <hi>Rome,</hi> he
left the affairs of <hi>Genoa,</hi> as concerning the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
in a much better dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition then he found them.</p>
            <p>The Siege of <hi>Casalle</hi> continued this mean while in very
bad order, especially after the 5000 men were sent to relieve
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> for Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als were daily brought in, and all kinds of
refreshments, insomuch as the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n
that was brought in during the Siege was cast up to amount to above 18000
Quarters, a good part whereof came out of <hi>Piedmont</hi> by the Dukes tacite
permission, as it was said, and commonly suspected; who (as by many conjectures
was thought,) was not at all troubled that that place should be preserved: no
less negligence was used in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage time for what concerned Grapes and
Wine, which were brought in great abundance into that City. About the end of
<hi>August,</hi> the people that was sent in succour of the Duke, arrived, by
whose coming the Camp was enlarged; and Don <hi>Philippo</hi> Son to Marquess
<hi>Spinola,</hi> who was chosen by the King to be General of the Horse, came
thither; <pb n="378" facs="tcp:53250:197"/> which occasioned the pitching upon two
resolutions; the one, the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise of the Hills; the other, that of
<hi>Punzone,</hi> a strong Town upon the top of a Hill, in the middle way as
you come by Sea from <hi>Savona</hi> to <hi>Acqui;</hi> which Town having yet a
Mantuan Garrison in it, inda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged the neighbouring Towns which did render most
obedience to the Governour, and which might further or impede the succours
which, being ready prepared in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> (was feared) might be brought
by Sea into <hi>Montferrat;</hi> Count <hi>Luigi Trotti,</hi> and <hi>Mark
Antonio Brancaccio</hi> were deputed to this enterprise with their two
Brigades: there were in it about 500 Souldiers in Garrison, together with about
150 Foot, part Towns men, part belonging to the neighbouring Towns; who to
avoid the troubles of war, were come thither, as to a strong place; there were
also about a hundred French got thither, (for the most part) people of account,
who were come from <hi>Mantua;</hi> who having abandoned the service of that
Prince return'd as Travellers into <hi>France,</hi> through the State of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> without any let: these having fortified the highest places, and
cut Trenches round about the Town, did likewise munite a certain Church at the
foot of the Hill, just opposite to where <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caccio</hi> was quarter'd
with his Neapolitans; by whom being assaulted, and not able to resist, they
were forced to abandon that station, and to retreat towards the top of the
Hill; and the Neapolitans possessing themselves of the Church, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed for <hi>Trotti,</hi> who came
thither the next day with two pieces of Artillery: the Batteries were
immediately raised, and for two days they skirmished with those on the Hills,
in several parts; and the assailants being gotten by night to underneath the
Trenches, they appeared on break of day ready for an assault, which being
couragiously fought, the defendants being astonished, partly by the novelty of
the assault, partly suffering by the Artillery (which giving upon the Trenches
drove the dust in their eyes,) and finding themselves to be too few to defend
so great a circuit of Fortification, and therefore fearing that the enemy might
enter, by some part unprovided of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, they retreated into the Castle, and
the Town fell into the hands of the assailants: who sack'd it immediately, and
that night got the Castle upon Articles, that the Officers might march out with
Arms and Baggage, and the Souldiers with their Swords: but they had hardly
march'd two miles when, contrary to conditions, they were barbarously strip'd
by the Neapolitans and others even to their shirts, and many to their skins;
and those that strip'd them got (as it was said) much money, which the French
who came from <hi>Mantua</hi> were furnish'd with by the Duke, not only for
their private occasions, but for defence: returning from the taking of
<hi>Punsone,</hi> they betook themselves, at last, to the taking of the Hills;
which they began at the Town of St. <hi>George,</hi> situated upon them, where
the oppugners made a Magazine of Arms, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Fortifications, not only to
defend themselves from the Garrison which was there, of 300 Foot, but to resist
the insulting of those of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> who sallying out very strong from
the City did continually annoy them on the backs, whilst they were most intent
upon the Siege; and y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t the
Garrison surrendered upon honourable conditions, of being permitted to return
to <hi>Cassalle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From hence they went to <hi>Rossiglione,</hi> a strong place both
by nature <pb n="379" facs="tcp:53250:197"/> and art: the defendants resisted stoutly: but
Don <hi>Philippo Spinalo,</hi> who ordered the busienss, having presented
Battery, and plaid upon it with his great Guns for four whole days, at last he
level'd his great Cannon against the Gate; and the defendants apprehending
Mines, which they saw were begun to be dig'd, they grew distrustful to be able
to defend it, and surrendred it, with safety to their persons. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
being hereby master of the Hills, began to block up all passes and avenues, by
which the City might be come unto on that side: he then drew a long and a deep
Ditch from the <hi>Poe</hi> to a rivulet called <hi>Gat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tola,</hi> which
falling from the Hills, a little beneath <hi>Casalle,</hi> runs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Frascineso,</hi> and disgorgeth it self into the <hi>Poe;</hi> and many
Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were made upon both sides of the Ditch, as also on the outward
side of the <hi>Poe;</hi> whereby <hi>Casalle</hi> was streightly besieged; and
being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed between the fortified Hills, the Ditches and the <hi>Poe,</hi>
it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be relieved: a resolution which if it had been taken at
first, the business had been already ended; but being thus long retarded, it
did little or no good; for much provision was already brought in, and the
compass of <hi>Campagnia</hi> inviron'd by the Governours Works was large, full
of Meadow-ground, Trees and Shrubs; so as the besieged had wherewith to
maintain themselves for all the ensuing Winter, and to wait for succour, that
Campagnia yielding great store of Wood and Roots, Hay and Straw, for the
maintenance of Horse and Castle, and Fewel for Ovens: the which they might the
more easily do, for that the Governour; quitting his former Quarters, went to
Winter between the Hills and <hi>Gatt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>la;</hi> leaving all that Campagnia uninjured, he made a Bastion
upon a little rise, at the foot of the Hills; upon which placing four pieces of
Artillery, he plaid upon the Castle, and part of the Wall which (together with
the Citadel,) invirons the City on the Hills side: but being so far off, it did
but little harm; in this manner he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued all the next Winter: the besieged
drew out the Siege at length, with great good order and vigilancy, and sparing
their Victuals; and the besiegers, with patience and industry, and much
hardship, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to streighten the City, and bring it to surrender. In
this interim several Skirmishes hapned, worthy to be particularly related, if
(as they were valiantly fought,) they had conduced any thing to the main
busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: in one of them the Marquess of <hi>Bevorone,</hi> the head of the
French, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shot with a Musket-shot in the throat, died; which was a great
loss to the besieged; for he was the man who underwent almost the whole burthen
of the defence: but the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>siegers
were no less streightned in all things then the besieged, not only for that
lying (for the most part) in the open air, they were subject to the sufferings
of rain, frost, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers of weather, but by reason of the great want of
Victuals. This years harvest was generally poorer then that of the preceding
year; and (which made the scarcity the greater) those who had corn in
<hi>Millain,</hi> out of avarice, hid it, that they might sell it at a dearer
rate the next year; and the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> to keep Victuals from being
sent from <hi>Genoa</hi> to the Camp, and to the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> did
prohibit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of corn from <hi>Provence;</hi> and detain'd many
boats which were sent from <hi>Genoa</hi> into those parts to fetch Grain; to
the end, that they might not carry any Corn to <hi>Genoa,</hi> and from thence
to the Camp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="380" facs="tcp:53250:198"/> 
               <hi>Cassalle;</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Nevers</hi> blocking up the <hi>Poe</hi> with two Forts upon the Mantuan
side, hindred the carriage of Provisions into <hi>Puglia,</hi> and the other
Maritime parts: so as they were forced to send new Commissions to <hi>Naples,
Sicily</hi> and <hi>Sardinia,</hi> which being brought by the way of
<hi>Genoa</hi> to <hi>Millain,</hi> and so to the Camp, might ease the present
necessity: but the Orders being given out late, and the far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of place,
(added to the scarcity of conduct requiring much delay) the remedy suited not
with the urgent necessity; wherefore the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people of <hi>Millain,</hi>
impatient of delay, and seeing the Bakers shops shut up, began to mutiny; which
made the Governour leave the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the Camp to Don <hi>Philippo
Spinola,</hi> and go to <hi>Millain</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease them, which, by punishing
some, and by sudden prevention, he soon did: but great was the scarcity of
Victuals in the Camp; inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as, though Provision of bread was scarce enough
in <hi>Casalle;</hi> yet bread was cheaper there then in the Camp; so as the
besiegers being rather become in condition of besieged, they suffer'd more
want; and by an unusual, and peradventure unheard of example, they were
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by likely to have abandoned the Siege: many Souldiers died of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and mutinies were much feared; which had certainly insued, had not force awed
the murmurers; some of which not being able to wait for assured death by
famine, chose rather to endeavour their preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the doubtful event of
running from the Camp: so as the Army did daily diminish; and it was impossible
to raise more men, as well for want of moneys as of victuals, which affrightned
whatsoever neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary provision or resolution, there being no means found
whereby to provide for the Forreign Souldiery; and the very Souldiers, who came
from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> were in danger of mutinying: thus weakly
and with so many necessities did the business of <hi>Cassalle</hi> proceed; and
<hi>Cesars</hi> Edicts and Citation proceeded not more fortunately; for the
Count of <hi>Nassaw</hi> being come (as hath been said) into <hi>Italy,</hi>
with title of Cesarian Commissary, and having sent out Monitors twice to the
Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and threatned him with the Imperial Proclamation of
banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unless he would obey <hi>Cesars</hi> will, by f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eely yielding up the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of
those States; and <hi>Nevers</hi> having at first desired, in vain, that his
business might be put over to the Law; and given out writings, and published
the opinions of Civilians in Print, whereby he strove to prove there was no
reason why he should be forced to forgo his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, without the cause given
why; and afterward having complained very much, why the like commands had not
been sent to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to the Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> who had actually and by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence possess'd themselves of
part of his Dominions, and still proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to possess themselves of the rest;
they came to the third Summons, wherein <hi>Cesar</hi> declared that if
<hi>Nevers</hi> would put what he possess'd into his hands, the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> and the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> should do the like with
what they had taken of his. <hi>Nevers</hi> seemed to accept of this offer; and
to this purpose he sent his Son the Duke of <hi>Retell</hi> to <hi>Cesars</hi>
Court, that he might expedite the dispatch of the business by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the
Empress, who was Sister to the three last Dukes of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and did
wish well to <hi>Nevers</hi> his cause, to whom she was neerly allied in blood:
but being come thither, he found that <hi>Cesar,</hi> perceiving that 
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:53250:198"/> neither the Duke nor Spaniards would be brought to make
any restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it was hard for him to compel them to it, had mitigated
the Edict; and accommodating himself to the times had made a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, by
which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the Spaniards were permitted in
<hi>Cesars</hi> name to keep what they had taken, and the Duke of
<hi>Nevers</hi> was to possess the City and entire Dukedom of <hi>Mantua;</hi>
so as the Dutch, who were to be sent by the Emperour into <hi>Italy,</hi> might
have the City, Castle and Citadel of <hi>Casalle,</hi> assigned over unto them,
till cause to the contrary was known. <hi>Retell,</hi> not being able to get
better conditions, and not being received, nor acknowledged by the Emperour as
Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi> by reason of the Spaniards earnest desire to the
contrary, lest by such a Declaration his pretentions might not seem to be
tacitely granted, and the Kings cause in <hi>Montferrat</hi> might in the eyes
of the world seem to be damnified, he departed but ill satisfied from that
Court; and the new Proposals were not accepted of by his Father, whose fear of
the Emperours Edicts were lessened by the weakness of the Spanish Army; and the
King of <hi>France</hi> his prosperous proceedings made him believe more in the
favour and forces of that Kingdom, then in the Imperial D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>crees or Decisions.</p>
            <p>In these Negotiations, and Transactions, the year 1628 ended; and
the King of <hi>France</hi> having at last compass'd his ends upon
<hi>Rochel,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into he entred victorious, and triumphing on <hi>All
Saints</hi> day; he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to pass over the Mountains with gallant Forces,
to assist the Duke of <hi>Nevers;</hi> for the Hugonots of <hi>France</hi>
having received a great blow by the loss of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and the Affairs of
<hi>France</hi> being almost perfectly setled, nothing was heard of in that
Kingdom but preparations for <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> which being divided into two
Armies, the one was to pass through <hi>Dolpheny</hi> and <hi>Syonois,</hi> to
the relief of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> and the King prepared to pass over the
Mountains personally therein; and the other was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance by the County of
<hi>Nizza,</hi> and by the River of <hi>Genoa,</hi> towards <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle:</hi>
the Spaniards, nor the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> could not believe so strange a
resolution; they thought it was impossible that the King having his Kingdom yet
full of troubles, and exhausted of moneys, his Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weary, and wasted
before <hi>Rochel,</hi> could pass over the Alps in the midst of Winter, with
great forces, and carry over Victuals, Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and other necessaries for so
great an action, the Alps being yet load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Snow: Especially when he
should know that he would be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who being
joyn'd in Forces and Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the Spaniards, was to resist him
strongly at the Passes, which he kept well garrison'd and munited: hoping
therefore that the fame of these great preparations would prove but talk, they
continued the Siege: the scarcity of Victuals increased this their confidence,
which scarcity being so great an impediment to their Forces who were masters
and peaceful possessors of the State of <hi>Millain</hi> and of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> it would assuredly prove a much greater hindrance to the
French if they should come into <hi>Italy,</hi> and have occasion to keep
there; for a great conduct of Victuals being requisite to feed so great an
Army, it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for the French to compass it, and consequently,
the greater their numbers were which should pass the Alps, the easilier and the
sooner they would be overcome meerly by Famine: they therefore 
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:53250:199"/> thought that this sole consideration should not only
retarde, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the fury of the French Forces, at least for this year; and
that in the mean while the enterprise of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> undisturb'd by any
Forreign as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, would be happily effected. The Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
confiding in these difficulties did not only not make any necessary
preparations for defence, but forbore to send the Duke the succours which they
had promised, for the maintaining of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to oppose the
French Forces: they forbare also to endeavour diversion, by the Pirenean
Mountains, and by <hi>Burgony,</hi> and by secretly fomenting the Rebels in
<hi>France,</hi> so to keep that King in work and busied with his home affairs,
and consequently from medling with those of Forreigners: the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission of
which provisions did not only facilitate the resolution taken by the French,
but did incite them to it; For the King being firm to his resolution, valued
not any of the difficulties or contrary consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, being confident to
overcome them, and to make his way by the Sword. The fame of the mighty
preparations of this Kingdom increasing greater then those of any of the
preceding Kings, the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and the Duke, began at last to fear not only
the success, but whatsoever might be the result of so great and so neer an
Army. The Duke and Governour were likewise much troubled for not having for a
long time heard from the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> for the Spaniards being
jealous of <hi>France,</hi> through which the expresses used to pass, and the
Sea not being open in Winter, people could not without much difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pass
from <hi>Spain</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> and such had the ill fortune been, as
three several Posts that had been sent from <hi>Spain,</hi> being driven by
violent winds upon the Coast of <hi>Provence,</hi> were detain'd, and had their
Letters intercepted: so as the deliberations of <hi>Italy</hi> depending much
upon the results of that Court, the Duke and Governour knew not in such a
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity of business what to do: nor was it only the scarcity of moneys and
want of advertisment, which kept them from making any provisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but neither
had they time to make new Levies of men for the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary defence of the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> and for the Provisions for the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> and for the Forces which were towards the Cremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese, and
which were already much diminished: it was therefore thought the best expedient
to beat up Drums in the State of <hi>Millain</hi> for Volua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, which might
be sent to the Camp before <hi>Casalle,</hi> and afford commodity of drawing
out the best Souldiery from thence, to bring them into the Field to oppose the
enemy: which provision, though it proved not altogether vain, (for many being
driven away by famine, and hoping to get away by inrolling themselves, and to
get Ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-bread, which though very bad, was made desirable by reason of
the great scarcity;) yet this being but a very slender provision to resist the
great storm which threatned them, the affairs of that State and of
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> were reduced into great danger and necessity; and that the
more, for that they heard the numbers of the Venetians were increased upon the
Confines of <hi>Bergamo</hi> and <hi>Bressia;</hi> and that <hi>Nevers</hi> was
ready to march out at the first news of the Frenches advancing, with about 8000
Foot, and 1200 Horse; and if either joyntly, or separately they should as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> it was feared they might divert the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
Forces from opposing the French; and it was app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Nevers,</hi> as he had threatned the preceding year, would pass into

a thousand men from the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> and 12 Gallies being come at
that time from <hi>Naples</hi> to <hi>Genoa,</hi> with 2000 Foot, he could not
make use of them, for it was necessary to keep them at Sea, to oppose them to
the French Army, being ready prepared in <hi>Provence,</hi> which (was said)
together with the ships that were expected at <hi>Marcelles</hi> from
<hi>Rochel,</hi> would pass by <hi>Nizza</hi> into the River of <hi>Genoa;</hi>
and that landing their men at <hi>Mentone</hi> neer <hi>Monaco</hi> he would
pass into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Seas neer <hi>Savona,</hi> and would
by that way take a shorter and more easie course to relieve <hi>Casalle:</hi>
to this weak condition were the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>fairs of the State of <hi>Millain</hi> reduced, against the Forces
of so powerful an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and it being impossible in so great streights to mind
the relief of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the Governour drew out 4000 of the best Foot
that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Casalle,</hi> to send them into those parts under the
Conduct of Don <hi>Ieronymo Agostini;</hi> and being afraid that the Venetians,
who were joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Arms and Intelligence with the French, might assault the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> he used means to the Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> that
he would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede, and endeavour to make that Commonwealth forbear troubling
the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Dominions in these urgent occasions; on the other
side, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> finding the weakness of his defence and
suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and seeing that his Dominions were likely first to endure the brunt,
before those of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had first sent the Count of
<hi>Verrua</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and afterwards his Son the
Prince, to keep the Army from advancing, by making some composition with that
King: suspending therefore his resolution till he saw what the event of these
endeavours would be, he made Don <hi>Ieronymo Agostini</hi> to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear acting
any thing with the Governours Auxiliaries in the Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Asti:</hi>
but the King being resolved to advance, refer'd the Prince of <hi>Piedmont</hi>
to Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> with whom he treated upon several ways of
composition; but not agreeing upon any one, they concluded a suspension of Arms
for five days, till the Duke his Father might be advertised of what had past.
The Duke seeing the King so resolved, began with great diligence to fortifie
<hi>Susa,</hi> by which way he perceived the King would march with his Army:
the French had had experience how hard it was to separate the Genoeses from
joyning with <hi>Spain,</hi> by way of force; wherefore thinking now to make
use of the present jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies which were risen (as hath been said) and
cunningly fomented, between the Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and the Crown
of <hi>Spain,</hi> they applied themselves to increase these jealousies, which
they began by Demonstrations and endeavours to the contrary, in good will and
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the Genoeses, to try whether they could effect or no; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
King being to send a Messenger to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
them with the ends and intentions of his coming; he dispatch'd 
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:53250:200"/> away Monsieur <hi>di Lande,</hi> commanding him that
when he should be come to <hi>Genoa,</hi> he should not only free those
Senators from any appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of danger which they might apprehend by his
coming; but that he should promise them in his name all assistance against any
who should go about to infringe their publick liberty: which being done, that
he should immediately go to <hi>Mantua,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Venice,</hi> to acquaint that Duke and that Commonwealth with his coming:
which he assured them should, at the furthest, be by the 25th of
<hi>March:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> marching into the Field
on the day appointed, assaulted <hi>Cassalle</hi> the greater, the last Town of
the Dukedom of <hi>Millain</hi> lying towards <hi>Mantua;</hi> and taking it
after some little resistance made by the Towns-men, he sack'd it, and (staying
there a while) brought the neighbouring Towns under contribution: he afterwards
went to <hi>Sabioneta</hi> a strong Castle, which holds in Fee of the Emperour,
but took it not, being stoutly resisted by a Garrison of the
<hi>Parmiggiani,</hi> who were sent thither at the Emperours request by the
Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> The King of <hi>France,</hi> in this interim, having
sent precise Orders to the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> Lieutenant General of the
Army of <hi>Provence,</hi> and to the Marquess of <hi>Coure, Guise</hi>'s
Marshal and Lievtenant, to march along into <hi>Italy</hi> coasting by the Sea
side, he went himself in person by the Alps, towards <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with
the Van, which consisted of about 12000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, the greatest part
of them being of the French Nobles; and having overcome the passage of
<hi>Mongeveura,</hi> he fell, on the sixth of <hi>March,</hi> into the Valley
of <hi>Susa;</hi> where the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having cut a great Trench
upon the way by which the King was to pass, half a mile beyond <hi>Susa,</hi>
he had placed the Camp-master <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> there to defend it with his
Brigade; and behind <hi>Bellone</hi> stood the Duke prepared, with the main
body of his men; amongst which were the Governour of <hi>Millains</hi> men,
under Don <hi>Ieronymo Agostini,</hi> who was fetch'd but a little before from
<hi>l' Astigiana;</hi> and the King having possess'd himself of the tops of the
Mountains, which were all cover'd over with snow, commanded some companies of
the Fore-lorne-hope to assault the Dukes Trench; who not meeting with much
resistance, (for <hi>Bellone</hi>'s men were raw and unexperienced Souldiers)
took it at the first assault: afterwards increasing in numbers by other people,
who came in into them, they assaulted the station where the Duke was with the
main body of his Army; here the conflict was somewhat greater; but such was the
continual confluence of French, who continually came in, as the defendants not
being able to resist their fury, were forced to give back, and to retreat
towards <hi>Auvigliana,</hi> nine miles towards <hi>Turin,</hi> leaving
<hi>Susa</hi> in the Kings possession; which being taken, was by the Kings
express command preserved from sacking and from all other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence: many of
both sides died in this conflict, nine Colours of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi>'s Brigade
were taken by the King, and about 80 Prisoners; amongst which many Captains,
who were presently by the King set at liberty: the Duke ran great hazard in his
own person, and Don <hi>Ieronymo Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustini</hi> was unhors'd.</p>
            <p>At the same time the <hi>Provence</hi> Army, consisting of about
15000 Foot, having brought some Artillery in Barques from <hi>Marselles,</hi>
came neer to <hi>Nizza,</hi> or <hi>Nice;</hi> and having sent a Trumpet to Don
<hi>Felice,</hi> the <pb n="385" facs="tcp:53250:200"/> Dukes natural Son, and Governour of
that City, to demand free passage thorow that County, he was answered, It was
not in his power to grant it without leave from his Father; he therefore had
time allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to know his Fathers pleasure; and the mean while the Army
pass'd over the <hi>Varo,</hi> a little River, which descending from the Alps,
and falling into the Sea two miles beyond that City, divides <hi>Italy</hi>
from <hi>France</hi> in that part. At the same time that the Army having pass'd
over the <hi>Varo,</hi> spread it self along upon the Shore of <hi>Nice,</hi>
the Neopolitane Galleys coming from <hi>Genoa,</hi> with some other Galleys of
<hi>Doria</hi>'s store, playd upon the French Squadrons as they marched towards
<hi>Nice;</hi> to avoid which danger the French went more inward into the land,
and being free from the shot of the Enemy, which could not reach them, the
Galleys retreated towards <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> where they landed about a
thousand Foot, who taking some Stations near the French, had some Skirmishes
with them, at a great distance off, and of no great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; till news
being come to <hi>Nice</hi> of the Agreement made between the King and Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> at <hi>Susa,</hi> they forbare all hostility; and the Galleys
taking in their Souldiers, returned to <hi>Genoa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke finding, after the unfortunate success at <hi>Susa,</hi>
what a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest over-hung his Dominions, and the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
thought it better to stop so great a ruine by Agreement, then to hazard the
total business with so weak and unseasonable opposition; he therefore sent the
Princess, his Sons wife, and Sister to the King, to <hi>Susa,</hi> that by her
neer relation in blood, and by the grace and favour which she received from the
King, she might appease her Brothers anger; and sending the Prince after her,
he by their means came to a Treaty of Agreement; which being at last set down,
was after much debate stipulated by the Cardinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> on the
Kings behalf, and by the Prince in his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Name, in form following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Duke should give free passage to the Kings people
whensoever it should be requisite for the relief of</hi> Cassalle, <hi>and</hi>
Montferrat; <hi>and should also furnish them for their moneys with Victuals and
Munition, for the maintaining of the Kings Army, and of</hi> Cassalle: <hi>That
he should promise that the Governour of</hi> Millain <hi>should rise within
four days from before</hi> Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle, <hi>and should withdraw his men from</hi>
Montferrat, <hi>freeing that City and that State from the King of</hi> Spains
<hi>Garrisons, and should leave the possession thereof free to the Duke of</hi>
Mantua; <hi>together with an express pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise from the Governour, in the King
of</hi> Spain<hi>'s Name, That for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he should not molest the States
of</hi> Mantua, <hi>nor</hi> Montferrat; <hi>and that the King of</hi> Spain
<hi>should ratifie this Agreement within six weeks: That the Duke of</hi> Savoy
<hi>should put 15000 Quarters of Victuals into</hi> Cassalle, <hi>and should
restore all the Towns that he had taken in</hi> Montferrat, <hi>except</hi>
Trino, <hi>and so many other Towns as should be worth 15000 Crowns yearly Rent,
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable, as he said, to what</hi> Nevers <hi>had promised him before the
present War; and, That this should be by him acknowledged to be in full
satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all that he, the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>could pretend unto
in</hi> Montferrat; <hi>That he should assign over</hi> Susa, <hi>and the
Castle of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               </hi> Francesco, <hi>to the King, for pawn of performing what was
agreed upon; in which Forts the King should put a Garrison of</hi> Swissers,
<hi>which should swear to restore them to the Duke when these Articles should
be by him observed: That notwithstanding; <pb n="386" facs="tcp:53250:201"/> it should be
lawful for the Duke to keep all the Towns he had taken in</hi> Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat,
<hi>till such time as those Forts, together with the Town of</hi> Susa,
<hi>should be restor'd unto him: That the King should promise</hi> (as he did)
<hi>not to molest the King of</hi> Spain<hi>'s Dominions, nor those of his
Confederates; That he should take the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>into his
protection, in case he should be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted upon this or any other account, by
any whatsoever Potentate: That in case the King of</hi> Spain <hi>should refuse
to ratifie these Conventions, or should not observe them after they were
ratified, the Duke should joyn with the King of</hi> France, <hi>to force the
King of</hi> Spain <hi>to ratifie and observe them. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, there was one
thing more Articled, which contained a League and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy between the King
of</hi> France, <hi>Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>the Pope, Venetians, and the Duke
of</hi> Nevers, <hi>in defence of the quiet possession of each others
Dominions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Article being agreed upon, it was immediately sent away
to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> who calling to Councel Don <hi>Ieronymo
Augusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and Count <hi>Iovan Serbellone,</hi> the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours Officers, consulted with them, whether
they ought to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of, or no? And the urgency of the present condition
prevailing with all of them, over the utility and honour of the common Forces,
it was resolved they should be accepted of: But the Duke not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal
satisfied, would send the Commendatore <hi>Iovan Thomaso Pesero,</hi> his first
Secretary of State, to the Governour, to know his pleasure more precisely, who,
though with an ill will, yielding to necessity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to it.</p>
            <p>Thus the first Articles being subscribed by the Duke, the Siege of
<hi>Cassalle</hi> was raised, and the Kings Forces retreated to
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> which State was also freed from the Spanish Forces at the
very appearance of the Kings Person. The Duke sent forthwith about 1500
Quarters of Corn into <hi>Cassalle,</hi> as part of a greater quantity by him
promised; and gave passage to 3000 Foot, and 250 Horse, which were sent under
Monsieur <hi>di Toras,</hi> into the lower Palatinate. As for the other
Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, touching the League, the Duke made many excuses to keep from
under-writing it; and being afterwards free from the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, utterly
denied to do it: He went soon after himself to kiss the Kings Hand, and was
upon the way met by the King half a mile from <hi>Susa,</hi> who pretended he
was going to hunt; they both of them turned back; the meeting was full of
reverence and submission on the Duke's part, who was received with much honour
by the King; the Duke stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by all seeming artifice, wherewith he was
naturally very well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, not only to appease the King, but to win upon his
genius, and to captivate his good will.</p>
            <p>Thus by the Dukes dexterity and cunning many thought that the
greatest force of <hi>France</hi> that had for many years past the
<hi>Alpes</hi> was stopt; which finding <hi>Italy</hi> unprovided of defence
might easily have over-run it, to the universal ruine, and particularly to the
danger of the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> 
               <q>But the Duke his having after his opposition found the King
  rather gracious and favourable then angry and incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed; his having received
  honours, rewards, satisfaction, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, instead of revenge and
  resentment; his having by these agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments provided well enough for himself,
  and suffer'd the interests of <pb n="387" facs="tcp:53250:201"/> the Crown of
  <hi>Spain</hi> to be prejudiced, afforded much talk and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring against him,
  not only by the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with his being
  reconciled to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was contrary to the common
  Interest, but even in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> by those that envied the
  <hi>Conde Duca</hi>'s favour with the King; who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to continue, strove
  to make it appear, that the Dukes reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to the King of
  <hi>Spain,</hi> wherein he was assisted, and which was effected by the
  <hi>Conde Duca,</hi> was a cheat to the King, and pernicious to the Interest of
  the Crown: They said that it was he, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who (as might
  be gathered by many conjectures) had made the way plain for the King of
  <hi>France</hi> to enter <hi>Italy,</hi> by his secret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence held with
  the Court of <hi>France:</hi> That it was he, who having covenanted for, and
  secured unto himself the retention of a good part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> had
  before-hand promised not to oppose him in that Enterprize, having therein no
  respect to the Interest of <hi>Spain,</hi> or to the honour of the Spanish
  Forces, by which he had got such a part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and with which
  he was but a little before confederated: That this was the faith of this
  Prince, this the fruit of that reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: For otherwise, how would the
  King of <hi>France</hi> have dared to hazzard his total reputation and glory
  which he had won in so many home actions, and particularly in his late Victory
  at <hi>Rochell,</hi> in so cold a season, against so many difficulties of steep
  and craggy Mountains; and as yet cover'd over with snow; and all this only for
  the freeing of a Town that was not in his Kingdom, nor did not any ways belong
  to him? To this end, they said that the Duke opposed his worst arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, to
  withstand the first violence of the most resolute and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable of the
  French; which was the cause why there was so little fighting, and why the
  strong Pass of <hi>Susa</hi> was rather abandoned then stoutly defended: That
  the Governour, nor other Spanish Agents that were in <hi>Turin,</hi> had not
  consented to those Articles, otherwise then as they were enforced by the Dukes
  peremptory will; who consulting with them in very positive and resolute terms,
  bereft them of the freedom of Election; and that protesting that these
  Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were the only remedy against the imminent ruine of the State, he
  tacitely threatened, that unless they would consent thereunto, they would force
  him to accept thereof without them, and by joyning with the French, to provide
  the best he could for the safety of his own In erest; so as they consented to
  what he would, to keep the Kings Affairs from falling into a worse condition.
  And so far did these murmurings prevail, as the very French being more desirous
  to make the Duke be suspected in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> then zealous of
  their Kings glory, did by their outward demonstrations confirm what was said in
  his discredit. But it was not probable that the Duke by this Agreement should
  so much to his own disadvantage part with what he was to expect from the
  friendship of <hi>Spain;</hi> especially when he was known to be naturally very
  desirous of making new acquisitions, and very tenacious of what he had. The
  loss of <hi>Susa</hi> did yet more gainsay these objections, it being a place
  of great importance by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its situation, and of greater profit then any
  other Town of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> for the Customs which the Fairs that are held
  there do <pb n="388" facs="tcp:53250:202"/> yield, and which are had for the Transportation
  of Merchandize which pass to and fro between <hi>France</hi> and
  <hi>Italy;</hi> which that he should willingly grant unto the King, and commit
  so great a fault, was too far from being believed by any that was but
  indifferently wise; for what Reason would admit, that by the loss of that
  advantagious place, which was one of the gates of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and of
  <hi>Italy,</hi> he should wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly make himself subject to the King of
  <hi>France,</hi> and be less valued by the Italians and Spaniards. To this may
  be added, That when in the preceding years the Duke was assaulted by the
  powerful Armies of <hi>Spain,</hi> and was consequently in great need of being
  sustain'd by the French, yet would he never grant them so much as any one Tower
  in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and how was it likely that upon this present occasion he
  should agree to yield them a place of such importance, before he was assaulted?
  The Fortification also made at <hi>Avigliana,</hi> whilest they were treating
  of agreement; the Artillery which were brought thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after the Capitulation,
  the King looking on; his having always for his own defence entertain'd Spanish
  Auxiliaries, as they were actions of much diffidence, not to say contumacy,
  towards the King, and therefore much to be resented by the French; so they seem
  force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able arguments against that intelligence and collusion which would fain
  have been proved to have been between him and the French: And yet, as men
  incline naturally to sinister interpretations, though the Court of
  <hi>Spain</hi> hearing these bad tidings, and maturely considering the state of
  affairs did approve of the Dukes actions, and rejecting vain rumours caused
  three Pays to be paid unto him before-hand by their Factors in <hi>Genoa,</hi>
  of 25000 Crowns a piece, which were grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for the expences of these
  present occasions; yet the contrary impression not being to be removed, most
  thought that that Court had dissembled more according to necessity and to the
  conveniency of the present occurrences, then done upon any real and intimate
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; as if it were not consistent with the Kings Interests, by
  unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable distrust and resentment totally to alienate the Duke from them,
  but by the contrary appearing well satisfied, not only to keep him their friend
  at such a pinch, but to oblige him still more by new benefits to keep still the
  more united and better inclined to the affairs of the Crown. This is evidently
  apparent in so great variety of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and may be affirmed, that the Duke
  thinking upon new agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which by the Mediation of his Son the Prince
  were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, demanded 4000 Foot, and a certain number of Horse, of the
  Governour, and in his absence of Don <hi>Philippo Spinola,</hi> which at the
  beginning of this War were promised him, in case he were assaulted in
  <hi>Piedmont</hi> by the Arms of <hi>France;</hi> which demand being made when
  the Army before <hi>Casalle</hi> was in greater want of men then ever it had
  been, he wish'd they might not be granted him, that by that denial he might
  have a fair pretence to forego friendship with <hi>Spain,</hi> and to abandon
  the Cause, which till then he held in common with that Crown: And that when
  <hi>Spinola</hi> had punctually satisfied his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and sent the men,
  contrary to the Dukes expectation, he was troubled at their coming; which made
  him not only make them keep upon the Confines, but by hard usage endeavoured to
  make them <pb n="389" facs="tcp:53250:202"/> return back: but when he saw his Counsels
  prevented by the King of <hi>France</hi> his speed, he speedily summoned them
  in to his defence against the Kings Army which he saw came suddenly upon him,
  and by their help made what defence so short a time, and the imminent necessity
  could permit him to make; for though there was no collusion in the conflict at
  <hi>Susa;</hi> yet the unseasonable demand made by the Spanish Agents, the
  little satisfaction he seemed to receive by their coming, the preceding
  Negotiations, and the Conclusion of the subsequent Agreement; shew that the
  Duke was much more inclined to imbrace friendship with <hi>France</hi> upon new
  terms, then (according to the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his Ancestors) to keep union with
  the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> But it may be said that the then so dangerous
  condition of Affairs forced the Duke to put on this resolution; and it being
  usual with Princes to make all change lawfull, not onely when their State is in
  danger, but where they may better, or increase their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there was not
  any one that blamed the Dukes Counsels, nor his Actions.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How ever it was, the King of <hi>France</hi> his name was
generally exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the skies throughout all <hi>Italy,</hi> in several
Writings and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; they said he deservedly merited the title of Just,
for having assisted an oppress'd Prince; the title of powerful, for that he had
opposed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self in Arms to the oppressors; of generous Protector, because
without any private end or interest, nay with such inconveniency to his own
affairs, with so much trouble and hazard of his own person, he could not
tolerate the oppression of a Prince who was his friend. Some praised the speed
of his advancing, others the undaunted execution, others his miraculous happy
success: they wonder'd how so many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties of the season, Alps,
sterility, and opposition, yielded to his fortunate Arms and Genius: how he had
had the courage, being tired both himself and Army in hardships undergone
before <hi>Rochel,</hi> to pass armed over the Alps in the midst of Winter, and
to come into <hi>Italy,</hi> to free her from imminent slavery, and to assist
his Petitioner in his greatest extremity: they could not comprehend how at his
only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence so many Forces, such preparations of Arms, and so many Plots
against a Client of his Crown, should vanish just like a shadow before the Sun:
some called him the Protector of the oppressed; others, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venger of the
liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> and expecting greater proceedings from such a
beginning, they promised unto themselves great alterations: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the
Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> sent Embassadours to him; partly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate his
so happy success, and to thank him for having freed them from the imminent
slavery they apprehended, if <hi>Casalle</hi> should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; partly to
purchase his favour, in case, as it was much feared, he had any further
intentions then the freeing of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and that he might not
prejudice their Dominions: some, and particularly the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, to incite him
(as it was said) to advance further with his Arms, offering to joyn their
Forces and Intelligence with him, against the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, with whom they were
very ill satisfied in what concerned the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and this new
commotion against <hi>Montferrat:</hi> but the King did soon free all men from
such suspitions; and by his sudden and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected resolution broke off the
thred of his so prosperous Fortune; for <pb n="390" facs="tcp:53250:203"/> on the last of
<hi>April</hi> he return'd into <hi>France,</hi> leaving the Cardinal and chief
Officers of the Court in <hi>Susa;</hi> not tarrying till the business of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> should be ratified from <hi>Spain,</hi> but leaving the
things uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded and unperfect, for which he had with so great fervour and
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration entred <hi>Italy.</hi> The Cardinal and the rest soon followed
after the King; leaving Marshal <hi>Cricky</hi> in <hi>Susa,</hi> supream
Governour of the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> with 6000 Foot, and 500 Horse, The
occasion of this so sudden and so unexpected departure was variously
interpreted; some allotting it to the Kings vivacity of spirit, some to his
moderation; as if content with having freed his Friend, with having secured
peace to <hi>Italy,</hi> and to so many Princes, (who apprehended the contrary)
he had with a Prince-like magnanimity let the world see, not only how just his
thoughts were, but how moderate and content, upon such an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and so
great an opportunity of affairs; and how far he was from dreaming of novelties,
or of disturbing the publick peace: but these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences not being
able to prevail with those who could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired more constancy and
resolution in the King, and much less with those who desirous of novelty had
conceived great hopes by the Kings coming, the French gave out, that the Duke
of <hi>Roan,</hi> head of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots in <hi>France,</hi> seeing his party
ruined by the loss of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and that he could not get ready help to
sustain himself from <hi>Spain,</hi> whither he had dispatch'd Messengers of
purpose, by reason of the great scarcity of moneys, began to cry
<hi>Peccavi,</hi> and would render obedience to the King: which because it was
likely to put a final end to the troubles of <hi>France,</hi> was of so great
moment to the Kings affairs, as that, all other enterprises set aside; it
forced him to return to secure them: which though by the soon ensuing accidents
appeared might be true, yet not being then believed, it was not sufficient to
maintain the reputation of the French Forces, which being but a little before
formidable to <hi>Italy,</hi> by reason of so prosperous success, began after
the Kings departure to decline; and the rather for that it was soon known, that
it was a new tumult of the Hugonots, who had fortified themselves in the
Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Auvergnia,</hi> and not <hi>Roans</hi> surrender, which had
forced the King to return thither to suppress them. This the Kings so sudden
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture afforded also occasion of belief (and this was afterwards judged to
be the truest cause) that the King was come into <hi>Italy</hi> with far
smaller Forces then fame gave out; which not being fit for new enterprises, he
had done more wisely to content himself with the glory which he had won, then
to hazard the loss thereof by falling upon new enterprises. But be it what it
would that occasioned the Kings departure, it suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently lessened the
reputation of the Kings Forces; and, on the contrary, the Spaniards, who seemed
to be totally quel'd, began out of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects and other favourable
accidents, to hold up their heads. The Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> though he
appeared publickly to stand to the Articles of <hi>Susa,</hi> yet not being
pleased with the loss of that place, and with the restitution of most that he
had got, was negligent in furnishing the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel of <hi>Casalle</hi> with the
rest of the Victuals promised; and being much troubled that the Pass upon the
Alps had been forced from him, and that he was thereby fallen from that
reputation by which he covered to be thought to hold the Keys of <hi>Italy</hi>
in his hand, and that it was he <pb n="391" facs="tcp:53250:203"/> alone who could either
keep out the French, or let them in, as he listed; desired to regain his former
reputation: to which purpose he used all his best skill: he fomented the
Rebellion of the Hugonots in <hi>France,</hi> and wavering in his friendship
with the French, see<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed better
inclined to the Spaniards, by whom he was to get the greatest part of
<hi>Montferrat.</hi> At this time the Plate-feet return'd to <hi>Spain</hi>
with above ten Millions of money; and the King, urged by necessity, detain'd
above a Million and a half of moneys more then what came to his share, which
belonged to private Merchants; an Argument which proved clearly that he was far
from accepting the Articles of <hi>Susa;</hi> and desirous to repair so great a
blow given to his reputation, and to the safety of his Domimons: nor did his
Agents in <hi>Italy</hi> desire it less then he; for the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi>
as soon as he had heard what had hapned in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and of the lofs
and Capitulations of <hi>Susa,</hi> he sent <hi>Thomaso Caracciola</hi> from
<hi>Naples</hi> with a Galley to <hi>Genoa,</hi> to the end that going thence
to <hi>Millain,</hi> he might hearten the Governour with an offer of 20000
Foot, and 2000 Horse, and of 700000 Ducates, which were ready at his service in
that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. But the Emperours sudden resolution made all men chiefly
won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; who having till now proceeded rather by exhortations, citations, and
in a judiciary way, with the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> then by Arms or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
expeditions, and who moreover had appeared averse to the Governours late
action; as soon as he heard of the King of <hi>France</hi> his coming into
<hi>Italy,</hi> and of the Articles of <hi>Susa,</hi> and of the Duke of
<hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> his contumacy, who with so little respect to the Imperial
Majesty, Sovereign Lord of the Dukedom of <hi>Millain,</hi> was entred
thereinto in hostile manner, and had committed acts of hostility in <hi>Casalle
maggiore,</hi> he thought himself so highly injured in his dignity and right of
the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Empire, as he immediately ordered Count <hi>Merodes</hi> to go into
<hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> with 36000 Foot, and 8000 Horse, of those who were quarter'd in
<hi>Alsatia, Tyrvolo,</hi> and the parts thereabouts, under <hi>Colalto,</hi>
Caprain of the Cesasian Forces in <hi>Alsatia;</hi> which Order
<hi>Merodes</hi> readily obeyed; and having taken <hi>Stainc,</hi> which was
but badly provided, he came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expectedly to <hi>Coira</hi> and
<hi>Mainfold,</hi> two of the chiefest of the Grisons Country; which being
unprovided for so sudden an assault, were easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forc'd to receive him in:
falling from hence with his Van, which consisted of 10000 Foot, into
<hi>Chiavenna</hi> and the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> he drew neer the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> intending to pass on farther, as the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour should direct
him. The Governour, fearing the French Forces, and not being willing to
innovate any thing contrary to the Articles agreed upon, did not only make 3000
Foot, which were sent him readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from <hi>Naples,</hi> stay in the Haven at
<hi>Genoa,</hi> but made the Dutch tarry in <hi>Chiavenna</hi> and in the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> till he should receive new Orders from <hi>Spain;</hi> and
in the mean while furnish'd them with Victuals, and other things necessary. The
Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was much troubled at the business of <hi>Susa;</hi> but
encouraged by so many good chances, she resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to sit down by such an
affront; and neither refusing nor allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Articles of <hi>Susa,</hi> took
a middle way; wherein the King decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that if <hi>Susa</hi> might be
restored, and <hi>Montferrat</hi> put into its former condition, and the French
Forces should forgo <hi>Italy,</hi> he would not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest <hi>Montferrat</hi> by
Arms: the condition was hard, for besides the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty 
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:53250:204"/> of performance, it did almost deprive the King of all
the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of his Victory; wherefore the King of <hi>Spain</hi> thinking it
would not be accepted, knew it would be requisite for him to provide some
sufficient person to repair the affairs of <hi>Italy;</hi> therefore instead of
Don <hi>Gonzalo,</hi> with whom that Court was very ill satisfied, he chose the
Marquess <hi>Spinola;</hi> who being come some moneths before from
<hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> to <hi>Madrid,</hi> kept still there about some private, and
publick busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and furnishing him with almost two Millions, part in ready
money, part in very good assignments, and conferring upon him all supream
Authority and free Arbitrement as could be confer'd upon any one, to make war
or conclude peace; he sent him to be Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> to the end
that he might either compound the present affairs upon ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable conditions;
or repairing the late disorders by Arms, he might restore the Affairs of the
Crown to their former Dignity and Safety.</p>

Decrees and Commandments to be overborn by the contumacy and disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of a
vassal, assisted by Forreign Forces; and that the French should arrogate that
Jurisdiction and Imperial Authority to themselves which did absolutely depend
upon him; it was not likely neither that he should ever appease himself, till
he should see his Imperial Authority restored to its former condition and
reputation, by the suppressing of his contumacious vassal, and by the
abolishment of the Articles of <hi>Susa.</hi> The almost equal fortune of these
two Princes terrified the whole world: who after signal Victories, had just at
this time, happily and miraculously setled the Domestick Affairs, and brought
them into security and obedience, by the former total suppression of the Rebels
of his Kingdom, and the other by re-uniting the Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> by
the peace of <hi>Lubeck,</hi> made between him and the King of
<hi>Denmark,</hi> and the rest of the German Princes who had confederated
themselves together in behalf of the Prince Elector <hi>Palatine:</hi> so as
both of them being free from intestine troubles, they were at leasure to bend
the whole Forces of their Dominions upon this sole enterprize; and what added
wonder to all the mischances was, that it seemed that the same fortune having
thrown open the Gates of <hi>Italy</hi> unto them at the same time, and made
the way plain for them to come thither, did not only lead them by the hand, but
drive them on by a favourable gale; There was not any of so mean an
understanding, who did not foresee, nor of so inhumane sense, who did not
deplore the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate sate of <hi>Italy,</hi> which being destined the
miserable seat of Warr, was exposed to all those evils and calamities which
would flow out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her bosome from those two Nations; Nor was it to be
believed, that the Spaniards who were the chief occasion of these present
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, and who were ingaged in this enterprize, not only in point 
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:53250:205"/> of Honour, but of interest, would by giving way to the
Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> his Solicitors suffer so great an affront as he had
received by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>Susa;</hi> but that, on the contrary, being as
the soul of so great an enterprize, he was to make it good with all the force
and power of his Crown: but the danger was yet greater of <hi>Italie's</hi>
being inslaved by the Austrean Armes, if getting the better of the Duke of
<hi>Nevers,</hi> they should become Masters of his Dominions; and as the
thought hereof did much perplex the very souls of the Italian Princes, so was
it necessary for them to betake themselves to the best remedies for this
threatning evil; it was known what foundation they might lay upon the favour
and assistance of <hi>France</hi> of the unfortunate successe of their union
with that King of late years upon the occasion of the <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline,</hi> and
by the peace of <hi>Monzone,</hi> concluded so little to their satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
and yet not having any better resolution to put on at the present, made it
appear not onely necessary unto them, but the great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that King
in these present occurrences: and the better occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he had to persevere
therein by the now quiet and intire obedience of his Kingdom made it seem more
assured, since the occasions being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the impediments must needs also be
taken away, which might crosse him in the businesse of <hi>Italy;</hi> the
chief point concerning that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the present Affaires; seemed to depend
upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s resolution, who if he should observe the
Articles of <hi>Susa,</hi> and keep firm to the common cause, would secure the
preservation of <hi>Casalle,</hi> and therewith the liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi>
And if he should not observe them, but joyn with the Austrean Forces, the
common cause and the liberty of <hi>Italy</hi> would be much indangered, and
<hi>Casalle, Montferrat,</hi> and <hi>Mantua,</hi> would be apparently lost;
the Duke was not ignorant how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite his friendship was to both parties;
and that he might make his best advantage thereby, he held them both in hand,
making them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hope well in him, sometimes to suspect how he might be
inclined; when he but indifferently succoured the Citadel of <hi>Casalle,</hi>
he excused himself to the Spaniards, upon the necessity of keeping his promise,
upon the fear he stood in of the French which were very strong in
<hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont,</hi> and upon the slender supplies sent thither, which not being
suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient long to supply the Souldiery that were there, would not much import
the main businesse when it should be taken; He sometimes said that victuals
were privately stoln in thither, by meanes either of the Subjects, or of the
French; that it was impossible for him to block up the Avenues so, but that
relief would be brought in contrary to his will and orders; On the other side,
he strove to satisfie the French of his will, and of his constancy in observing
his promise, by his continuing to send in provisions, and by promising to do so
still: that which was conjectured might be his chiefest aime, was, that he sent
but small sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies into <hi>Casalle,</hi> to the end that if it should be
lost, and should fall into the Spaniards hands, it might not prove too
prejudiciall to him; and that supplying it, though but sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nderly, it might be known that it lay in his power,
either to suffer that place to be lost, (whereon he knew that all mens eyes
were set,) or else to preserve it: so as he might be looked upon by all men, as
the absolute Arbitrator in so chief a business. Others were of opinion, that
keeping both the parties doubtful of what <pb n="396" facs="tcp:53250:206"/> the sequel
might be, he might have occasion to treat of demolishing the Citadel, lest it
might fall unto the contrary party, which might prove much to his prejudice: he
also (that he might depend less upon the French, and that the Spaniards might
conceive the better of him) forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and munited <hi>Avigliana</hi> very
strongly, placing 8000. men there in Garrison, to the end that it might be a
good Bulwark against the French, which might exclude them from
<hi>Casalle,</hi> and might make their having of <hi>Susa</hi> very little
advantagious to them; so as he might still be held to be the same thing which
he coveted to be, before the business of <hi>Susa,</hi> &amp; pretend that it
lay in his power to keep out, or to let in the French, and so he might make
himself the more necessary to each of the parties: and consequently meet with
the better dealing in his demands and pretensions, which he reduced to their
accustomed vastnesse; to the getting of a good part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and
to the state of <hi>Genova:</hi> which having once aspired unto, he thought
that as he did desire it, so of reason it did belong unto him, to boot with the
great sums of mony which he demanded from the Spaniards for the maintenance of
the War, and of the French for victuals and the passage of their men; As for
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> arbitrators were already chosen on the King of
<hi>France</hi> his behalf, on his own, and on <hi>Nevers</hi> his behalf, to
rate his Lands which were allotted him by the Articles of <hi>Susa,</hi>
instead of 14000 Ducates; but the Arbitrators when they met differ'd upon the
Rates, so as the arbitrement could not as then be ended; the Duke pretended
that the Lands should be valued according as they were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, when he
first made his pretenosins, and not according to their present estimation; and
the one being incomparably greater then the other, it swallowed up as much of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> as he was to have had by the division made with the
Spaniards; and thinking that the French, by reason of the necessity of his
joyning with them, ought to satisfie him herein in as full a measure as the
Spaniards had done, he was very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate in his pretences; On the contrary
side, <hi>Nevers</hi> having exclaimed much against that part of the Articles
of <hi>Susa,</hi> whereby he lost so much of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the
Agents deputed by him reclaiming yet more against so high, and so unexpected
pretences; The French (who was in the middle between them) thought that if it
should be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto, their Kings Protection would seem to incline rather
to the oppressing, then to the maintaining of his Client: Wherefore they
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whereat the Duke being very much
distasted, and imputing it to the small good will the Court of <hi>France</hi>
had to determine this happinesse; to the end, (as he said) to keep the longer
from restoring <hi>Susa,</hi> he exceedingly complained, and was more reserved
in obse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ving the things agreed
upon: but much greater obstacles ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the other point, which concern'd
the state of <hi>Genoa;</hi> for some distasts and diffidence having past, as
you have heard, between that Common-wealth and the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi>
which upon some fresh accidents were renewed, the Court of <hi>France</hi> made
account to get more advantage thereby.</p>
            <p>The King, before his march, had sent (as you have heard) Monsieur
<hi>di Lande</hi> into <hi>Italy;</hi> who being come to <hi>Genoa,</hi> did
not only secure the Common-wealth from any hostile acts, but offered all favour
and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance <pb n="397" facs="tcp:53250:206"/> to them in the Kings Name, against
whosoever should go about to insidiate their Liberties. The Commonwealth
doubting lest after the Victory and Articles of <hi>Susa</hi> some nearer
conjunction might be made between the Duke and the King, to her prejudice, she
thought her self bound to answer the fair respects the King had used to her;
wherefore <hi>Augustine Palavicino,</hi> who was afterwards chosen Doge, was
sent Embassadour from the Commonwealth unto the King, to thank him for the good
will he seemed to bear unto them, and to desire him to continue the like
favourable inclination towards them still; and to pass the usual terms of
Complement with him: The Commonwealth was the more inclined to send this
Embasie, for that Don <hi>Gonzallo,</hi> when he saw the Enterprize of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> given over, thought the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Italy</hi> to be in
a desperate condition; he wish'd the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth to provide for themselves
the best they could; And yet the fear of the French Forces ceasing by the King
of <hi>France</hi> his return, the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> which could have
desired that constancy and resolution in the Commonwealth which she found not
in their Agent, seemed displeased with this Embasie; which being the first that
was sent by any of the Italian Princes, seemed as if the Commonwealth would at
the very first stormy blast have first of all wavered in her ancient
Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. Monsieur <hi>di Sabran</hi>'s going to <hi>Genoa,</hi> (who was
sent thither by the King of <hi>France,</hi> in appearance to treat of the
safety of coveying Victuals, which he was to send from <hi>Provence</hi> to
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> but in effect to tarry there as his resident) increased
this their displeasure. It was an ancient custom of the Commonwealth, to
entertain no Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour in Ordinary, save only from <hi>Spain;</hi> and if at
any time the Genoese had been desired by the Pope, or by the King of
<hi>France,</hi> to give resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to their Embassadour, they had always
appeared backward in it, out of self-interest. <hi>Sabran</hi> being upon this
occasion received at first, and having his expences discharged, as the Kings
Agent, after some moneths kept open house in <hi>Genoa,</hi> intending to
reside there; at which the Spaniards began to murmure; for their King pretended
and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Commonwealth, That they should not entertain any one in
their City who was an Agent for the King of <hi>France.</hi> The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
did in part admit, and in part not admit of the Kings demands: for as for their
receiving him as Embassadour, or Agent from the King of <hi>France,</hi> being
loth to alter their ancient institutions, they ordered, That he should not be
received as such, either publickly or privately; but as for excluding him from
living in the City, if he would tarry there as a private man, they would not do
so; it being too much contrary to the common liberty of Nations to inhibit any
one to live in a free City, which for the greatness of Traffique was open to
all Nations, and in particular to the French: And as to exclude him only from
being a servant to the King of <hi>France,</hi> was too apparent an affront to
that Crown; so to do it at the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s demand, would not be
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a blemish to their reputation, and without prejudice to the liberty of
the Commonwealth, as if they had done it by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: And yet the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> holding for certain, that
whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever business <hi>Sabran</hi> did negotiate in <hi>Genoa</hi> as a
private man, thought that the Commonwealth did by this declaration satisfie the
King of <pb n="398" facs="tcp:53250:207"/> 
               <hi>France</hi> in effect, and him but in shew;
and he thought himself highly offended; as if to undertake new Intelligence
with the King of <hi>France,</hi> chiefly in a time when the Italians in
general, and particularly those of <hi>Genoa,</hi> were molested by
<hi>France,</hi> was a beginning to fall off from their ancient union and good
correspondency with him: And the less satisfied the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
seemed to be by these proceedings, the more did the Court of <hi>France</hi>
hope to lay new foundations of entertaining new Intelligence with the Genoeses;
and was so far from thinking of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them, as she offered all the favour
and Forces of <hi>France</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Liberties of that Commonwealth
against any whomsoever: The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> finding therefore, that his
plots against the Genoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were not well listned unto by the French,
complain'd, That the Commonwealths Interest was preferr'd before his, and
before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises made him in <hi>Susa:</hi> Being therefore angry that
these his drifts did not succeed prosperously in that Court, he endeavoured by
no favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable demonstrations to the French, to withdraw from favouring the
Interests of the Commonwealth; and finding that their proceedings were not well
received in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> he thought they might produce some
good effects to him; he therefore profess'd more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy to that Court: But
neither did his designs prove succesful there; for that King nor Court would
not upon any sleight occasions, to please the Duke, take off their favour from
the Commonwealth; and they abhorr'd any innovation which might tend to the
prejudice of their good correspondency and intelligence held with the Genoese:
as also because Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> being come, with thoughts as high as
was his Authority, into <hi>Italy,</hi> and indeavouring by all the means he
could to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store the Kings grandezza to its ancient condition, would not
imitate his Predecessor, who, with little honour to the Kings Affairs, had
seconded the Dukes will too much; being therefore rigid in his resolutions, and
seeming to depend only upon himself in the Administration of the Kings
business, he did profess not only not to be governed by the Duke, but thought
to bring him over to his mode; and suspecting the Dukes intentions and actions,
he was very cautious and reserved in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving him, or in doing any thing
whereby he might be forced to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to his will, and quit his own power; and
even in the usual payment of moneys, which were granted him to make
preparations for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent War, as also in sending him men to defend
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> he was very reserved, notwithstanding the Dukes many
pressures: Wherefore the Duke finding that neither of the Courts did much
favour his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, he suspended his resolutions; and carrying himself the
best he could to both of them, he waited till occasion and time might make his
conjunction and actions more desirable then they were at the present, that he
might sell them at the dearer rate, according as the urgency of occasions might
make them more requisite.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> being wholly intent upon the business
of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> that they might divert <hi>France,</hi> resolved to
assault the French on the confines of <hi>Catalognia,</hi> and that the
Emperour should send his Army to the Confines of that Kingdom, on the side of
<hi>Lorrein;</hi> and to his purpose the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had sent the
Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> with 1000 Horse and 4000 Foot to <hi>Barcellona,</hi>
with order to raise more Foot there, and <pb n="399" facs="tcp:53250:207"/> to enter with
them into <hi>Languedock,</hi> and <hi>Provence;</hi> and the Emperour had
commanded the Duke of <hi>Fritland,</hi> the Captain General of his Forces, to
prepare to enter <hi>France</hi> with stout Forces on the side of
<hi>Germany:</hi> And there was no doubt but that the King of <hi>France,</hi>
being held work by these assaults, as he had been the preceding year by the
busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Rochel,</hi> could not have sent much aid into <hi>Italy</hi>
to back the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> in his Affairs; so as it was likely that
the Enterprises of <hi>Montferrat</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> being attempted by
the Spanish, Dutch, and by the Savoyards, could not but succeed well.
Notwithstanding <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi> who was come into the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> about the end of <hi>August,</hi> with ample Authority, as
hath been said, to treat both of Peace and War, bethought himself of many
things which withdrew him from thinking upon the uncertain events of the
present War, to minde the surer counsels of Peace: He saw that the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> which was the chief foundation and prop of the War, was so
exhausted as it could not long sustein the weight of a new War; That
<hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Cassalle</hi> being very strong, the former made so by
the waters, and natural sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, the other by Art and Fortifications, the
besieging of them would prove a business of length, and of doubtful event: That
the enterprise was hateful in the sight of men, suspitious to the Princes of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and generally detested by the whole world: That the French were
resolved to defend those Dominions, and ready to pass over the Alps again: That
small Forces were able to withstand what there was but little hopes of getting,
though with great expence, and preparatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Arms. The Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi>'s various and uncertain genius did confound him, on whose
Friendship and Union nothing could be surely grounded, but a continual
profusion of Moneys to feed him with, whilst the danger was far off; That when
they should draw neerer, his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship would be more dangerous then
advantagious, as might appear by the last years example, which he could not but
think upon. But that which in appearance should have encouraged him most, did
most trouble him: The more powerful the Germane Army was, the more formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
did it appear to him, and the more dangerous for the Kings Affairs; for though
if they should joyn with him they would undoubtedly prove a great assistance to
him in that enterprise, yet did he rather fear than confide in them, by reason
of the pride, arrogancy, and greediness of that Nation, which is naturally
unsatiable, impatient of military discipline, and inclined to mutiny, which
might occasion sad accidents in the heat of War. To this was added the
intollerable expence required to maintain that Army; which being to be paid by
the King, the Royal Treasury being emptied by so many and so long Wars, was not
able to supply them: But (what exceeded all other respects) the Dutch For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
being to wage War in <hi>Italy,</hi> not as Auxiliaries, or as brought in by
the Spaniards; but as Principals, and in the Emperours Name; it was to be
feared, that they would not only not leave the first place in Authority to the
Spaniards, whose intentions they did effectually serve; but that by reason of
the Sovereignty that the Emperour holds in <hi>Italy,</hi> by reason of the
quality and quantity of Forces, by reason of their greater disposition to War,
and through their Commanders ambition, they would be masters, and would force
the Spaniards to fight after their <pb n="400" facs="tcp:53250:208"/> mode; so as he
thought them dangerous in War, but more dangerous in Victory, if
<hi>(Mantua</hi> or <hi>Cassalle</hi> being taken) they should fix their
footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> and settle the seat of the Cesarean Majesty there;
from whence the I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>alian Princes
(being for the most part Feudatories of the Empire) were to take Law, and to
depend thereon, as upon their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord: which consideration, by reason
of the consequences it might draw after it, in prejudice to the Spanish
Authority, afforded no less occasion of fear, then if the French Power should
by the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi>'s means be radicated in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of these respects <hi>Spinola</hi> growing more inclined to
Peace then War, Monsignior <hi>Scappi,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Pacenza,</hi> being
s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nt by the Pope to visit him,
<hi>Spinola</hi> entered upon some Treaties of Accommodation with him, and with
Count <hi>Iacomo Mandello,</hi> who was sent to him by <hi>Nevers,</hi>
offering each of them, That he would procure that <hi>Nevers</hi> might be
invested in his Dominions, upon condition that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and Quarter
part of the Emperours Forces in the Dukedom of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and part of
<hi>Spinola</hi>'s Forces in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> in sign of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to
both their Majesties; to the end that making amends by this his ready
obedience, and publick submission for his former contumacy, they might with
honour receive him into favour, and gratifie him, the one with the Investiture,
and the other with the Protection which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired: <hi>Nevers</hi> would not
accept of this, either out of fear of non-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, or out of his relying
upon the French Forces, and those of other Princes who were joyn'd with him, on
whose pleasure he profest he did in all things depend; so as he was first to
acquaint <hi>France,</hi> and the Venetian Senate, with his offer, without
whose approbation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent he could not resolve any thing in this point;
but being advised to the contrary by the Venetians, who could not endure that
the Dutch Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my should come neer their Confines, and an answer not coming from
<hi>France,</hi> the Dutch not having whereof to subsist amidst the barren
Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Alps, where they had tarried all this while, <hi>Spinola</hi> was
forced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his inclination, to permit them to enter <hi>Italy:</hi>
They came in number 22000 Foot, and 3500 Horse, commanded by <hi>Ramboldo,</hi>
one of the Counts of <hi>Collalto</hi> in <hi>Friuli,</hi> General of the
Cesarean Forces in <hi>Italy;</hi> a Commander of good esteem and Authority,
who had been long vers'd in the Wars of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Hungary:</hi>
They fell down into the Valley of <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> by the Lake of
<hi>Como;</hi> being come to <hi>Lecco,</hi> they pass'd into the Territories
of <hi>Cremona,</hi> and proved prejudicial to <hi>Lombardy</hi> and
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> by their cruelty, rapine, plunder, and contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which
they forced from thence; and fatal to a good part of <hi>Italy,</hi> by reason
of the Plague, which they brought with them, and which burst forth in great
violence throughout all <hi>Lombardie</hi> and <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and then
entring the Venetian Territories, and <hi>Romagnia,</hi> it came into
<hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> and <hi>Tuscany,</hi> causing so great a mortality both of men
and cattel as the better half of these Provinces did not escape the fury
thereof: <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalto</hi> being come into <hi>Italy</hi> spoke with
<hi>Spinola</hi> in <hi>Millain;</hi> by whom being honourably received, after
a long debate about what was to be done, they agreed upon this: That dividing
the Armies and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, <hi>Collalto</hi> (with his Dutch) should
undertake the business of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi> (with the King
of <hi>Spains</hi> men) that of <hi>Casalle</hi> and <hi>Montferrat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:53250:208"/> Having thus distributed the carrying on of
the war, each of them betook themselves to what fell unto their share and the
King of <hi>France</hi> joyning with the Venetians in <hi>Nevers</hi> his
defence left the Venetians to relieve the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and took
the care of <hi>Montferrat</hi> upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Army, (many
Captains and Officers being cashiered) came to 16000 Foot, and 4000 Horse,
wherein were comprehended the Spaniards, Dutch, Neapolitans and Lombards, under
their several Camp-masters; amongst which was the Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi>
Nephew to him who was so great a Favorite to King <hi>Philip</hi> the Third,
and was come to commence his Militia under <hi>Spinola. Spinola,</hi> to give a
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the business on his side sent his Son Don <hi>Philip</hi> to
<hi>Valenza</hi> upon the <hi>Poe,</hi> with part of his Army, which was
distributed in several Towns upon the Confines of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> where
gathering Victuals and Munition he gave out that he would go to besiege
<hi>Casalle;</hi> whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the French, abandoning the Towns of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> retreated in great
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aste with their men to defend
that place; and Don <hi>Philippo,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited by that occasion, sent Don
<hi>Ferrante di Ghirava</hi> his Lieutenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general with 4000 Foot to beyond
the <hi>Tanaro,</hi> to whom <hi>Nizza, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui</hi> and <hi>Ponsone</hi> came
in; and all the neighbouring Towns return'd to be govern'd by the Spaniards:
then bringing his men into <hi>Alessandria,</hi> he went to take in
<hi>Sansalvadore, Lu, Fubine, Vignale,</hi> and the other Towns of that State,
which lie between <hi>Alessandria</hi> and <hi>Casalle;</hi> leaving
<hi>Rossigliano,</hi> St. <hi>Georgio</hi> and <hi>Pontestura,</hi>
unattempted: which being as so many Bulwarks to secure <hi>Casalle,</hi> were
not only not abandoned by the French, as the other Towns were, but were begirt
about with Trenches, and furnish'd with good Garrisons; and yet
<hi>Spinola,</hi> for all his shews to the contrary, forbare to attempt
<hi>Casalle,</hi> being detain'd, partly by the very cold weather which came
on; partly supposing that the French would imploy all their Forces to defend
it, he feared to begin with that as would be a great obstacle to the Treaty of
peace, which he so much desired. Moreover, he doubted much the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> who (were it either that he was loth that that place should
fall into the Spaniards hand, or that he was angry at <hi>Spinola</hi>'s
proceedings with him) began to oppose his ends, and cross his designs; or that
minding the preservation of that place, he aimed at being himself the
Arbitrator of affairs, and to sell the possession thereof at the dearer rate;
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to declare expresly, that by the last agreement at
<hi>Susa</hi> he could not but grant both passage and Victuals to the French
that went to relieve it; wherefore <hi>Spinola</hi> being contented with the
Towns that he had taken, and with having regained those Towns, in the face of
the French, which his Predecessor was forced to quit, at the King of
<hi>France</hi> his appearance in <hi>Italy,</hi> he quarter'd his men in those
Towns which he had taken, where they lay idle all the ensuing Winter. The
Cesarian Army made better proceeding in the Territories of <hi>Mantua;</hi>
where the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> not minding the defence of the chief City so
much as that of the other Towns of the State, had indiscreetly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed the
greatest part of his men within those Towns, which would all of them have been
hardly sufficient to Garrison the chief City: so as the Cesarian Army, led on
by the Serjeant-majors <hi>Mathias Galasso</hi> and <hi>Aldringer</hi> (for
<hi>Collalto,</hi> who was sick at <hi>Lodi,</hi> could not go along with 
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:53250:209"/> them) having taken <hi>Loglio</hi> and <hi>Volengo,</hi>
the chief Towns in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan Territories, went immediately to
<hi>Caneto,</hi> somewhat a greater Town, where were 2000 Foot, amongst which
two Companies of Venetians, under <hi>Angelo Cornaro,</hi> a Gentleman of
<hi>Venice,</hi> to defend it: <hi>Nevers</hi> relied much upon that Garrison,
which being very great, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e hoped
would hold the Enemy play: but it proved otherwise; for at the first appearance
of the Enemy they yielded up the Town, without one stroke striking: the example
whereof, as it is commonly seen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing followed by the other Towns,
<hi>Gazzuolo, Cicognaro,</hi> and <hi>Governolo,</hi> which lies in the mouth
of the <hi>Mincio,</hi> where it falls into the <hi>Poe,</hi> fell also into
the hands of the Dutch; who being by this easiness of the Mantuan Souldiers
become masters of almost all the Country there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, after having miserably
plundred it, had conveniency to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the City, which was in great
confusion to see her men make so little resistance. The City being unfurnished
of the better part of her men would have run danger of being stormed, had not
the Venetians, who were aware of the danger, sent a thousand Foot thither
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, under Colonel <hi>Durante,</hi> with some moneys: the City of
<hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> stands almost in the midst of a Lake, made by the little River
<hi>Mincio,</hi> which comes from the Lake of <hi>Garda:</hi> the Island
whereupon it stands is joyned to the Continent by some Banks and Bridges,
whereof some are greater, some less, according to the distance of place: at the
end of the greatest Bridge, stand the Suburbs of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George,</hi> weakly
walled and without any Plat-form: to which when the Enemy drew neer with their
Cannon, <hi>Frederico Gonzaga,</hi> who had the defence thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to
him, began to treat of compounding, in the Dukes name, with <hi>Aldringer;</hi>
letting him know that <hi>Nevers</hi> being desirous to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear an obedient
Vassal, and to witness his respect and observance to the Emperour, would not
refuse to receive him, and to allow him quarter in that Borough.
<hi>Aldringer,</hi> who knew the place to be untena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, would not accept it
upon those terms, since he saw that in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood it could not escape his
hands; whereupon <hi>Gonzaga</hi> not being able to do any more yielded it unto
him, retaining only the Hold, which is only a Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

City. The Dutch being entred into S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George,</hi> a Truce for a few days
was treated of, and concluded; during which time <hi>Nevers</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

receive it only as a willing and honourable surrender: but <hi>Aldringer</hi>
replying that he offer'd a thing which could not hold out two hours assault,
the business proceeded no further, the rather for that a new accident which
hapned broke off both the Truce and all the Treaties; for at the same time that

               <hi>Georg's</hi> Borough with the Van, the

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e,</hi> a Borough upon the Bank of the Lake, wherein was no
Garrison or any other defence: but upon a bank which leads from the Borough to
<hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> a Rampier was begun to be made in form of a Half-moon, which
opposed those who would pass that way into the City: some of the 
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:53250:209"/> Dutch coming to this Rampier, which was basely abandoned
by the Venetians who defended it, they without any opposition became ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
thereof; and might easily make themselves masters of the Island of <hi>Te,</hi>
which was disjoyn'd from the City only by a large Ditch: This caused great
confusion in <hi>Mantua;</hi> wherefore thinking themselves to be assaulted
during the time of Truce, the Town sent Colonel <hi>Durante</hi> immediately to
defend that part: fire was also given to the Cannon from the City against the
Borough or Suburbs of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>George;</hi> and those who guarded the Hold,
hearing the noise, shot off their Muskets against the Magazine of Arms which
was beneath, where many of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Officers of the Camp were sporting
themselves, trusting in the Truce; and amongst them Colonel <hi>Coloredo</hi>
was sorely wounded. The Dutch being hereat moved, who knew not what was done at
<hi>le Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reggie,</hi> nor the occasion thereof, assumed their Arms, and fell
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon those of the Hold, which they soon made themselves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
of, with the death of many of the defendants; and then passing forwards took
the Bridge, till they came to the Draw-Bridge; which being timely hoisted up by
the Mantuans kept the Dutch from entring the City: so as not able to get
further they began to fortifie, and to turn their Cannon upon the City, and to
play upon it: whilst things went thus, <hi>Mantua</hi> was again relieved with
another 1000 Foot, with ten pieces of Artillery, and with 100 carriages of
Victuals and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, beside some moneys. A succour which was sent by the
Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to <hi>Goito,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Mantua:</hi> the Dutch
perceived how fit a place <hi>Goito</hi> was to send relief, being seated upon
the <hi>Mincio</hi> before it falls into the <hi>Poe;</hi> so as being to take
it, that they might streighten the City the more, they sent the Baron
<hi>Galasso</hi> to view it: there was in it a good Garrison, and it was
sufficiently munited; so as the cold season being considered, it might have
held out till the Spring: but when <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasso</hi> came neer it with some few
men, he by some tokens found how base and fearful the defendants were;
wherefore hoping for good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and having seen some of those Barques which
serve to bring in the Vintage, in some of the neighbouring Cottages, he made
use of them, and of some ropes, to pass over the <hi>Mincio,</hi> and to get
neer the Town: which whilst he successfully did, those within began to parley;
and two pieces of Cannon which <hi>Galasso</hi> had sent for before he had past
the River, being come from the Camp, they agreed to surrender the Town; which
accordingly was done, and proved no little prejudice to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, being
thereby deprived of so important a place for succour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Goito</hi> being taken, and the Dutch finding that the Battery
of S. <hi>Georgi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> against the
City, by reason of the far distance, did no good, they

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ell to expugne <hi>Porto,</hi>
which is another Town neerer the City, reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Fort, with Walls,
Bulwarks and Ditches, and partly secured by the neerness of the Lake, from
whence you go to the City by the Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and by a bank at the head of the
Bridge: Being gotten by their approaches to the Ditch, they would have drained
it, and then have come to Battery, and to Assault; which if they could once
have done, they had great hopes, by reason of the Defendants cowa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dize (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they had had so many
proofs;) and the Artillery being already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, they were ready to begin
Battery. But the Winter coming on, <pb n="404" facs="tcp:53250:210"/> and the weather
growing very cold, the business began to appear to be longer &amp; harder then
it was thought it would have been, especially, since the City, being secured
every where else, might make use of all her men to defend this place. To this
was added the great scarcity of victuals and straw, which grew daily greater in
the Army; and the plague, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many in the camp dyed: Wherefore altering
their minds, they resolved for that Winter to minde only the keeping of what
they had got; and distributing their Army in the neighbouring Towns, to keep
<hi>Mantua</hi> besieged at a distance, and to possess themselves of the
Ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and Passes which were fittest for relief; and they quarter'd their
Horse so as they might scoure the Country, and keep back relief.
<hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lalto</hi> went to winter in <hi>Reggio,</hi> where he quarter'd one
Regiment, the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> not knowing how to refuse them, as being
Feudatory to the Empire, as neither could the other Feudatories of the Empire
do, some allowing Quarter, some Contribution, in what quality or quantity
<hi>Collalto</hi> pleased to take it. The Army being in their Quarters, the
besieged sallied out in great numbers, and molested the stations held by the
Enemy, not without some advantage to themselves, and prejudice to the Enemy.
<hi>Nevers</hi> going out himself in person with the Prince his Son, and a good
Band of men, fell upon <hi>Mormitolo,</hi> a place some five miles off, where
about one hundred Dutch were quartered, who yielded unto him upon discretion:
He afterward went to <hi>Casti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glione,</hi> which he likewise took; whereby
making way for relief from <hi>Verona,</hi> the Venetians had conveniency to
convey victuals into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: they met with contrary fortune at
<hi>Rivolta,</hi> on the left bank of <hi>Mincio,</hi> where it falls into the
Lake; which Town rising in Insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by the fomentation of the Venetians
was recovered by the Dutch, who went thither, with the death of all the
Towns-men, who refusing to surrender the Town were, even to the very Infants,
put to the Sword: and though the Dutch Horse foraged the Countrey, yet some
suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours were brought in from the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> which being done
by stealth were not sufficient by much for the need the City was in; which
being begirt by the Enemy wanted food, and was also hardly handled by the
Plague, which was very great here, as also in all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Towns and
Cities; insomuch as getting into the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> people died so
fast, as the care thereof was almost quite given over by those that had the
looking to it: the like hapned in <hi>Millain, Bullognia,</hi> and in all the
Cities of <hi>Lombardy, Romagnia,</hi> and <hi>Tuscany:</hi> but whilst the
Cesarian Army winter'd in the State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi>'s
Forces in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> provisions for war, as also Negotiations for
peace ceased not: in both which not only the Commanders in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but the
Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> laboured. The Pope, seeing the Dutch forces so neer
the Church-Dominions, sent about 18000 Foot into the parts about
<hi>Bullognia,</hi> under his Brother Don <hi>Carlo,</hi> and 2000 horse; and
sollicited the building of Fort <hi>Urbano,</hi> which he had resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon
two years before, and was begun at <hi>Castel Franco,</hi> upon the way that
leads from <hi>Modena</hi> to <hi>Bullognia,</hi> and was a good and fitting
Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark to <hi>Romagnia,</hi> and the Church-Territories on that side: but
that he might likewise by his authority and endeavours stop the evils which
threatned <hi>Italy,</hi> he made Cardinal <hi>Antonio,</hi> his Brothers
second Son, <pb n="405" facs="tcp:53250:210"/> Legate; who being also come into
<hi>Bullognia,</hi> where his Father go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd the Ecclesiastick Forces, he
sent Monsieur <hi>Iovan Iacomo Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciruolo</hi> to <hi>Mantua,</hi> to treat of
some suspension of Arms, between the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> and
<hi>Collalto,</hi> to the end, that in the interim they might the more
commodiously and with the better hopes treat of peace. But this was but in
vain; for <hi>Collalto</hi> growing proud with suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, made still higher
demands; and the Duke, who had nothing more to grant but <hi>Mantua</hi> and
<hi>Casalle,</hi> had not wherewithall to satisfie his demands and pretensions;
so as there was no middle way left for them to meet in, and the lesse, for that
the siege of <hi>Mantua</hi> being given over with so little honour to the
Cesarean Forces; and <hi>Casalle</hi> not as yet attempted by <hi>Spinola,</hi>
the new Dukes hopes were not a little comforted, nor his confidence a little
increased, of being sustained by them who fomented him, and were his
well-wishers. For whilst these two places held good, all the other Town taken
by the enemy, either in the state of <hi>Mantua,</hi> or <hi>Montferrat,</hi>
made but little for the main concernment of the Warr: and it being very
probable that the Armies being afflicted by the Pestilence by the Winter
inconveniences, and by those of the <hi>Campagina,</hi> they would in time
lessen; and it was to be hoped, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much diminished of themselves they
would be reduced to such a condition, as not being able to withstand the French
Forces which were to passe over the <hi>Alps</hi> very strong the next Spring,
they would be easily driven from their quarters, a consideration which did must
afflict <hi>Spinola;</hi> For having two Armies on his back, which he was to
furnish with expences and provisions, he feared he must be forc'd to squander
out monies to no purpose this Winter, and have need of it himself af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
when there should be occasion to lay it out with profit; Wherefore growing very
sparing thereof, he was lesse carefull in satisfying the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi>'s demands and necessities, though he had other greater respects
to keep him from furnishing him with monies, which he proceeding from distrust,
did daily increase by reason of his continual treating with the French;
Sometimes by means of the victuals which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>as bound to furnish the Army
with, which was to passe over the Mountains; Sometimes by doing the like to
those of <hi>Casalle;</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by the conduct-monies which were agreed
to be given them, when they should be come into <hi>Piedmont;</hi> Sometimes by
the negotiations which daily past, touching the Dukes joyning his Forces with
the French, whereof there were pregnant suspicions, by many demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations
made by the Duke, on purpose to make <hi>Spinola</hi> jealous; Wherefore these
actions being really repugnant to that good corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency and inclination
which the Duke profestto the Kings affairs, when he demanded monies of
<hi>Spinola:</hi> and it seeming somewhat hard to <hi>Spinola</hi> that he
should feed one with monies who continually fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the enemy, and who held
continually so close intelligence with them, he demanded from the Duke some
cautionary Townes in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> if he would be furnished with monies,
for security of his profest good will, and inclination to the King of
<hi>Spaine</hi>'s affaires. The demand did very much trouble not onely the
Duke, but all the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> for it increased the jealousies of
the Italian Princes, if <hi>Spinola</hi> should get yet further footing in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> to boot with what the Spaniards <pb n="406" facs="tcp:53250:211"/>
pretended to in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Duke in whom the Italian Princes
did confide, that he would not forgo the common cause, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of
his own, as of the common interest; Having complained to the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> of the demands made by <hi>Spinola,</hi> he obtained Orders from
the Court to <hi>Spinola,</hi> that he should desist from such demands; and
<hi>Spinola,</hi> that the Duke might not be too much exasperated, received
some check for his too much severity.</p>
            <p>Great Preparations for Warr were not only made in <hi>Italy,</hi>
but also elsewhere. The King of <hi>France</hi> raised a mighty Army, to come
stronger then formerly into <hi>Piedmont:</hi> and the Emperour and the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> to keep the French from opposing the Duke, and from forcing him
to joyn with the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, prepared to
assault <hi>France,</hi> the one on the side of <hi>Spain,</hi> the other on
the side of <hi>Germany:</hi> But both these proved rather Rumours then
Reallities; the want of money was the cause why on the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
side, he having hardly sufficient to supply the Warrs within <hi>Italy,
Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> so as he had not where withall to begin
and maintain a new Warr with <hi>France;</hi> And also the scarcity of
Souldiers, wherein <hi>Spain</hi> was much wanting, her men being exhausted by
Warr in several Nations, in the Ocean, Mediterranean, and by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Transmigrations from <hi>Spain</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> and to the <hi>East
Indies;</hi> To this was added the driving out of the <hi>Moores,</hi> in the
time of <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, wherein more then two millions of Souls were
said to be sent out of <hi>Spain:</hi> a people who though they were generally
train'd up in servile Arts, and particularly in cultivating the ground, and in
feeding Cattle; yet these, by supplying the meaner imploiments, afforded
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience for the Natives, being unimployed in those services, to betake
themselves to military affaires; So as the Natives, after expulsion of the
<hi>Moores,</hi> being to reassume Husbandry, and the feeding of flocks,
(wherein <hi>Spain</hi> doth abound) a very great scarcity of men began to be
found in all the King of <hi>Spaine</hi>'s Dominions, especially of such as
were Military, to be sent out to make new acquisitions, or to maintain what
they had gotten; Out of these respects, and because the <hi>Catalonians</hi>
were not inclined to make War with the French upon those Confines, to keep from
losing Traffick which passeth with interchangeable profit between them and
<hi>France,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> could raise no Souldiers; and not
thinking it fit to begin War with so weak Forces, the diversion did not only
saile on that side, but occasion'd the like failing on the <hi>Germans</hi>
side. But many greater, and more important accidents, kept the Emperour from
falling foul with <hi>France</hi> at this time: which since, for their weight,
and for the great concernment therein of <hi>Italy,</hi> they deserve a
particular discription; It will not be amiss to make a little digression; and
whilst there is little done in <hi>Italy,</hi> by reason of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive cold
Winter, to make it not a distinct and particular relation of them, at least to
give you a brief view of them, to the end that reserving them to the times
wherein they happened, they may not break off the Narration of the chief
Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Austrian Authority, the greater it was grown by the continued
succession of so many Emperours, the more odious and insufferable it grew to
the German Princes: and the so many victories obtained by this present Emperour
had made him so formidable, as the German <pb n="407" facs="tcp:53250:211"/> Princes joyn'd
in nothing more then in finding out some meanes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to lessen, and
moderate the power of that House, so as they might vindicate their ancient and
former Liberty; which after so great an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of power they had almost
lost; finding themselves now treated by this present Emperour, not as Princes,
and, as it were, Confederates of the Empire, but little better then Subjects.
To the desire of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical liberty so much wish'd for by the Catholick
Princes, liberty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was added by the Hereticks; for the present
Emperour, being more religious then many of his Predecessors, had in several
manners curb'd their licentiousness, and restrain'd that liberty of Conscience
which they had enjoyed for above a hundred years: so as they were doubly
inclined to novelty. The dissatisfaction of both these parties was occasioned,
yet more, by the great Army consisting of above 100000 fighting men, which the
Emperour kept quarter'd in several parts of <hi>Germany;</hi> but more
particularly in their Territories, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worst satisfied with the present
affairs, he knew to be worst affected towards him, more contumacious towards
the house of <hi>Austria,</hi> and readiest to rise; and this he did, not so
much in resentment of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligne intentions, as to keep them the more
curb'd in, and to take from them the means of plotting innovations: the common
people were not therefore only burthen'd with quartering Souldiers, but the
Princes also with Contributions, &amp; by not being able to get their usual
Tributes and Rents from their Tenants, who were afflicted and exhausted by
unusual free-quarter. To these mischiefs was added th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> juries done by the Cesarian Souldiers
and Commanders; and chiefly by the haughty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Duke of
<hi>Fritland,</hi> Captain General of the Imperial forces: who having the
Supream Power and Authority given him over all the Armies, and in the
management of the war, kept all <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and the Princes of the Empire
under his command. This man was by Nation a Bohemian, of private birth, and but
of mean fortune, but who by his valour had raised himself to this greatness: to
his pride of nature, to his fierce and terrible genius, great valour, great
daring, and an extraordinary judgment in Military Affairs was annexed; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he was confirm'd by his signal Victories gotten against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours Enemies
and Rebels: whereby he had rendred the Authority and Majesty of the present
Emperor to as high a pitch as ever any of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors had been: so as his
name grew not only odious to the Hans Towns, but even to the Princes Electors;
to whom bearing no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, he
contrary to their antient Institutions quarter'd Souldiers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, as well
as upon the more petty Princes. The Emperours new Decree (who confiding upon
his power, and drawn by zeal to Religion, commanded that to the Catholick
Churches should be restored the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient possession of all those goods whereof
they were bereft at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Heresies; which goods having been
possess'd by many Princes and Lords for above one hundred years, were partly
alineated, partly converted to their own uses) encreased their indignation, and
brought some of them almost to the point of despair, and all <hi>Germany</hi>
was much offended thereat; and because there were many Princes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in
this Edict, who adhered to the house of <hi>Austria</hi> (amongst which the
Duke of <hi>Saxony)</hi> they began all of them joyntly to plot mischief 
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:53250:212"/> against the Emperour, endeavouring to lessen his power,
and to free themselves from such oppression; and the Emperour, likewise, did
extreamly desire that his Son, whom he had made King of <hi>Hungary,</hi>

               </gap>ng able to compass it without the Electors free
suffrages, the business in these commotions met with many disturbances;
especially for that all men hated that the Imperial diadem should continue in
one Family, whereby their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties became not only inslaved, but many
Families and Persons, (who thought themselves as well deserving as the
Austrians) were excluded from this Grandezza: it therefore became the Emperour
to sweeten them, that he might incline them to chuse his Son: he therefore
sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned a Diet in <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> to settle (as he termed it) the affairs
of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many.</hi> The Electors chief intention was to disarm him, to the
end that his Forces being weakned, he might not use the like authority as
formerly; they therefore desired that <hi>Wallestein,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Fritland</hi> might be no longer General, and that the Army might be
dissolved: they accused <hi>Wallestein</hi> of barbarous cruelty towards the
people, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable pride towards the Princes, of insatiable extortion,
and of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of fierceness in making Towns desolate, and in subjugating
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; for the dissolving of the Army, they alledged that,
<hi>Germany</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to a quiet and safe condition by the peace made
at <hi>Lubeck,</hi> the Army was not onely superfluous, but grievous to the
people, and prejudicial to <hi>Germany,</hi> which ought now to be eased of so
great a burthen, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> permitted to
injoy the fruit of peace. The Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did not incline to these so weighty and
important demands, knowing very well whereunto they tended, nor yet the Spanish
Agents who were resident in that Court; who were much concern'd in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Emperours authority, and the Austrian name, wherein their King was
interessed: but the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> a powerful Northern King, having
about this time past the Baltick Sea, and being come into the lower
<hi>Germany</hi> with an Army of 20000 Foot and 2000 Horse; the Electors made
Protestation, that they would never contribute to the charge of that new war,
unless they were satisfied in their demands. The Empeour and Spanish Agents
being badly advised, gave way thereunto at last: but it was not long ere he
repented himself soundly; for though Arms were laid down by by the peace of
<hi>Lubeck,</hi> yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents and hatred were not laid aside, nor yet the
ardent desire of more absolute liberty, and the conditions of that peace being
advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious for the Austrian Empire, did rather serve to incite the
male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents to novelties, then keep them within the limits of that peace:
the disarming of the Emperour was no better then to put Arms into the Swedes
hands; and into those of the male-content Princes, and such as were mortal
Enemies to the Austrian name. The Electors, having obtain'd their desire, were
backwards in chusing the King of the Romans; which though it were not openly
desired by the Emperour, yet being negotiated privately, began to be found so
hard a business, as the Emperour thought it not fit to demand it openly; and
the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors made use of several pretences to put off the Election: nor now
that the Emperour was disarmed, did they let slip the occasion of shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their resentments, and of endeavouring some better condition of 
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:53250:212"/> liberty. The Protestants began to lay plots against the
Austrian power, and by little and little began to hold intelligence with the
King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> who having by their adherence gotten greater forces in
a short time took many Cities, subdued many Provinces, and having gotten many
famous Victories, overran <hi>Germany</hi> within the space of a few moneths,
not without great danger to the Austrian authority, and to the Catholick
Religion: nor content with such a continued course of Victory, he drew neer
<hi>Italy,</hi> and made her fear the renewing of those miseries which she had
formerly felt by the Goths, and the other Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren Nations. The affairs of the
Empire and of the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion were never so perplex'd in
<hi>Germany,</hi> nor brought to so neer a ruine, as after the coming in of
this Northern King: all the Hereticks and male-contents adhered to him, who in
his Military Ensigns writ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Defender of the Faith, and Protector of
the German Liberty. The Duke of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> first of all, and
afterwards the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburge,</hi> and lastly, the Elector of
<hi>Saxony</hi> joyned openly with him against the Emperour; and after them
many other lesser Princes, and almost all the Hans Towns of the Empire, joyned
with him, as with their deliverer; and the Emperour having laid down his Arms
could hardly raise a new Army to withstand so apparent ruine: almost all the
Souldiers that he had cashiered took pay under the Swede, allured by the fame
of his valour, by the Victories he had got, by his grateful genius to the
Souldiery, who was received and followed with unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able applause, as if the
heavens had sent him to be their Deliverer. The Armies of the Catholick League
and of the Emperour, which were joyn'd together, were defeated in a great
Battel before <hi>Lypsick;</hi> and <hi>Tilly,</hi> chief Captain of that
League, a famous Commander for many Victories which he had gotten against the
Protestant League, and against the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> and who now
succeeded dismiss'd <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestein,</hi> was therein hurt: so as the Emperour
seeing no other way to withstand the ruinous condition of the Empire, nor how
to defend the Austrian Dominions, was forc'd to recall <hi>Wallestein</hi> from
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> whither after his being dismiss'd he had withdrawn himself to
lead a private life; and restoring him upon what condition he could desire to
his former dignity, he opposed him to the Swede, who like a swift torrent
overrun all <hi>Germany.</hi> The Emperours Army commanded by
<hi>Fritland,</hi> and the Swedish Forces led on by their King, came to a
pitch'd Field neer <hi>Lutsen,</hi> a City in <hi>Misnia;</hi> wherein the King
being victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous had prescribed Laws to <hi>Germany,</hi> had he not been
slain by some Musketiers, whilst with his wonted valour he pursued Victory: he
died in the latter end of the year 1632, thirty moneths after he had set his
foot in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to re-assume the thred of my Discourse, the Diet at
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> freed <hi>France</hi> from being insulted over by the
Germans; for <hi>Fritland,</hi> who had order, as hath been said, to fall upon
<hi>France,</hi> expecting what would be the issue of that Diet, instead of
turning with his Forces upon <hi>France,</hi> would be himself present at
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> to obviate the violence which he foresaw would fall upon
him: but not being able to decline it, and the Emperour being forced not only
to depose him, but to cashier his Army, and foreseeing another war threatned
from the North, <pb n="410" facs="tcp:53250:213"/> 
               <hi>France</hi> escaped being assaulted
also on that side; and the Electors, who held intelligence with the King of
<hi>France,</hi> favouring <hi>Nevers</hi> his Cause, as the most just,
approved not of the Emperours actions; but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd, that contrary to the
Laws and Institutions of the Empire, he had sent Armies into <hi>Italy,</hi>
without participating the business with them: wherefore the resolutions and
provisions of that Court growing colder, the King of <hi>France</hi> had better
conveniency to mind the wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> and to send strong succours to
<hi>Nevers:</hi> he destined the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> to be the
Captain General of the Forces which he sent into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with full
power to manage war and peace. The Army (those being comprehended who were in
<hi>Susa</hi> and <hi>Montferrat)</hi> consisted of 22000 Foot and 2000 Horse;
and the Cardinal had three Marshals of <hi>France</hi> for his assistants,
<hi>Cricky, la Force,</hi> and <hi>Scomberge.</hi> The King had already
bargained with the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> for provision of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, and
Ammunition for war, together with conduct moneys for the passage of his Army,
and had agreed with the same Duke that he should assist in the enterprise with
15000 men; and as for Victuals, he had agreed to deliver unto him 15000 sacks
or quarters in <hi>Nizza di Provenza,</hi> which the Duke was to present unto
the Army in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> three crowns of gold being allowed for the
conduct of every sack or quarter: so as the Cardinal being very hot upon the
business, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find all things ready for the enterprise in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> parted from <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> in the time of
<hi>Christmas;</hi> and coming to <hi>Lyons</hi> in the beginning of the year
1630, tarried there some days to receive the people, who had orders to come
thither from several parts of the Kingdom: he by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing so strong, and
with such resolution, in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to terrifie the Duke so as to make
him not only forward to observe all that had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, but willing to
yield to whatsoever he should require; he nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish'd this opinion, not only out
of the extraordinary confidence which the French have naturally in their own
Forces, but also by reason of the Dukes Embassadours endeavours, who was at
<hi>Paris</hi> to delay this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; for when he saw all things ready for
the voyage, he went to the King, and to the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dinal, and confidently assured them, that he had received news from
the Duke, by a Post that was newly come, of a suspension of Arms made in
<hi>Italy,</hi> for two moneths, and agreed unto by the Venetians, between
<hi>Nevers</hi> and the Cesarian and Spanish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders: according whereunto
<hi>Collalto</hi> had withdrawn his men from <hi>Mantua,</hi> and
<hi>Spinola</hi> from <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and that the general peace would be
shortly concluded: but the vanity of this advertisement was soon discovered,
and was reputed as tricks used by the Duke, who out of his excessive fear of
the French Forces strove to keep them as long as he could from
<hi>Piedmont:</hi> wherefore the Cardinal hastned his journey the more, and
being come to <hi>Lyons</hi> sent very precise Orders away to the Duke with
advertisement of his coming, to the end, that he might be ready to receive him
with Victuals, and other Provisions, and to joyn his Forces with the Kings in
this enterprise; in whose behalf he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him, absolutely to declare
himself: but the Duke seeing the Cardinal engaged upon his promises, thought it
a very opportune oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for his purposes; for the Cardinal passing the
Mountains with a great Army, without Victuals or other Provisions, he knew that
the <pb n="411" facs="tcp:53250:213"/> prosperity, or ruine of the enterprise, lay in his
power; for if answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his promise he should furnish him with all things,
and should joyn his Forces with the Kings, <hi>Casalle</hi> would be happily
relieved: on the contrary if he should not furnish him, and instead of joyning
with him, should bring the Spanish and the Dutch Armies into <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and should with them oppose the French Army, all the Cardinals plots and
threats would prove nothing; thinking therefore to reap good by the necessity
whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>einto he saw the Cardinal was
ready to precipitate, he sent his Son the Prince unto him, to put new
conditions to him, and to propound unto him the old flim-flam of the
enterprises of <hi>Genoa</hi> and <hi>Millain;</hi> and on the other side, that
in case the Cardinal should should not grant those his desires, he might have
means to oppose him, or that out of fear of his stout resistance he might force
the Cardinal to give way unto his will; he at the same time sent the Abbot
<hi>Scaglia</hi> to <hi>Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> and to <hi>Collalto,</hi> to invite them
to advance with their Forces, and joyntly to oppose the French, who coming into
<hi>Italy</hi> upon the assurance of his joyning with them, and of finding
those Victuals and Provisions, which he would never furnish them withall, they
should be forced, when they should see such an Army before them, either to
retreat shamefully, or being block'd up in <hi>Susa,</hi> to perish miserably
for want of Victuals, and other conveniences; or if they should give Battel, to
be undoubtedly overthrown: he likewise, to incite them the more to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
told them that <hi>France</hi> was at this time in great troubles, by the
departure of the Kings only Brother, the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> from that
Court and Kingdom, by the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s retiring from the Court;
by the dissatisfaction of many Princes and Lords; who not being able to end<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e, that even in the conduct of the
Kings Arms (which in all reason belonged unto them) a Cardinal, of Priestly
profession, should be prefer'd before them, (one unexperienced in Arms, whose
ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grasp'd at all things, and who through the Kings favour would usurpe
those imployments, which were due to them by the merits of their ancestors, and
by the dangers they had run, and blood which they had shed in war;) would by
all means endeavour that he should not come off with honour in this enterprise:
he acquainted them with the Insurrection of several Provinces of the Kingdom;
for that the people could not bear with such great Contributions as were laid
upon them, to maintain a war out of the Kingdom; and making it plain unto them
by these so many Demonstrations, how easie, and sure, the result of the
business would be if they would oppose it, he press'd them not to let slip so
happy an occasion of doing their Kings business: but both these expeditions
proved vain; for the Duke being become suspected to both parties by his double
dealing, had wearied them all: nor could he carry his neutrality so cunningly,
but that his ends were discern'd, which were conceived to be nothing else, nor
to tend to any thing, but to be the Arbitrator between two great Kings Armies,
and to be he who should cast the ballance as he should like best, be
Superintendent in all businesses, give the Law to all, treat of his own affairs
with most advantage, better himself by the perils and labours of them both, and
secure the advancement of his own fortune, and the increase of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
by the equal counterpoise of each of them: by which way <pb n="412" facs="tcp:53250:214"/>
of proceeding being become not only suspected, but hated by both parties, who
thought themselves injured by this his jugling, they ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred to have him
their Arbitrator, grew more confirm'd in their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust, and more resolved
that he should depend upon their resolutions, and not they be wheeled about by
his words and cunning. Thus keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the superiority, they would treat with him
upon such advantage of power and authority as did become their Kings Grandezza,
and the Majesty of their Masters Arms: so as so many Negotiations and pieces of
cunning being discovered, instead of the advantage that was thereby hoped, he
reaped loss and danger: <hi>Spinola</hi> had found out his continual treating
with the French under one pretence or another: he knew what Victuals and
Ammunition he had promised, and what moneys he had received for them: he saw
him continue to provide for <hi>Cassalle,</hi> prepare conduct moneys for the
passage of their men, and make many shews of being in favour with that Court,
or of not being able to be otherwise; he grew very jealous also of the Prince
his going into <hi>France,</hi> which though it proved to no purpose, yet it
was very probable that he was sent thither to treat of some great concernment:
so as <hi>Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> was so far from crediting the Dukes Proposals, and from
believing that he would appear against the French; as the same change which his
Agents promis'd in his behalf lessened his belief, and made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with
more circumspection, fearing, and notwithout reason, that the Duke would
promise as much to the French against him, by whom he had already been so
severely dealt with; and that, either out of resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or for the imminent
danger of the French, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r for the
high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions the Cardinal would give him, he would do the same
Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis against him, as he now promised to do in prejudice to the
French; and being loth to hazard the main point upon such uncertainty, he
waited for better counsel and safer resolves, as the event should fall out: but
the Cardinal did no less abhor the Dukes ways then did <hi>Spino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> since
they tended to bring him to follow his will, to wage war as he listed, to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n the Kings Forces, which were
destined to protect an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed Prince, to the profecution of his vast ends
and his revenge, and that against other Princes, against whom they were not
intended; and in fine, to change the Kings designs and enterprises with those
of his own, and (as if he were his servant) to be ready to do what the Duke
listed, if he would have his friendship: holding therefore these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
to be too high, and the price of such an union too exorbitant, he would not
listen to new Treaties, but threatned to force him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Agreement;
wherefore he would not so much as speak with the Prince, who being come to
<hi>Savoy</hi> desired to Negotiate with him, but refer'd the Treaty till he
should be come to <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter proof of his
resolution, endeavouring to make the Duke the more afraid, he went from
<hi>Lyons</hi> towards the Alps, leaving the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal <hi>dela Force</hi> there
to gather the Army together, and to bring it to <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Duke had fortified <hi>Auvigliana</hi> (as hath been said) and
had well munited it, and was gone thither with the body of his Army to defend
it; his Army consisted of 12000 Foot, and about 3000 Horse: and knowing that
the Cardinal must needs drive him from thence if he <pb n="413" facs="tcp:53250:214"/>
would relieve <hi>Casalle,</hi> and that he could not sit down before
<hi>Auvigliana</hi> for want of victuals, nor relieve <hi>Casalle,</hi> he
feared not his threats; for not having wherewithall to feed his Army, nor
wherewith to succour <hi>Casalle,</hi> he must either agree with him, or waste
himself idly in <hi>Susa,</hi> or return with shame into <hi>France;</hi> and
therefore the nearer he saw the Cardinal come with a numerous Army, the more
advantage he thought he had of treating, or certainty of victory; and
consequently he continued the stiffer in his pretences, and propounded the more
difficulties in what he was much prest unto by the French, and by Marshal
<hi>Crickey;</hi> So as the Cardinal being come from <hi>Lyons</hi> into
<hi>Ambrano,</hi> and hearing there, much contrary to what he expected, that
the Duke continued in his obdurate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and that it was impossible to alter
him, he for a while forbore the course which, when he parted from
<hi>Lyons,</hi> he thought would be so dreadful to the Duke; For finding that
to go against the Dukes will, to relieve <hi>Casalle,</hi> (which was the chief
cause of that expedition) was no better then to hazard himself and his Army
upon manifest ruine, as also the Kings Honour, and the whole enterprize, he
began to find by experience, how unreasonable it was, upon these termes, and in
the present conjuncture of affairs, to justle with him when he was back'd by
the Spanish and Dutch Forces; Wherefore allaying his heat, he began to treat
more moderately with him, and endeavour'd to make him pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with
satisfactory proposalls, that he might bring him to joyn with the Kings Forces
in that enterprize, and interest himself really in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Casalle;</hi>
but his lenitives proved as vain as did his threats; For although the Duke had
all his demands, (how strange, and how extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary soever) granted him, yet
still pretending greater things, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back from what he had agreed
unto, he used delayes, to the end that thereby the difficulties and necessities
of the French Army might the mean while grow greater, insomuch as the Cardinal
being come to <hi>Susa,</hi> where he spoke with the Prince, who was come to
<hi>Bossolano</hi> to visit him, he did not only not come to any conclusion,
but did not so much as begin to treat; For the Prince, who when he went to
<hi>Savoy</hi> to negotiate with him could not so much as be allowed audience,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to resent that usage, the ceremonial part being past, would not
propound any thing, pretending that it was the Cardinal who was to make the
first proposals, and make an overture to the businesse. The reasons of this
obdurancy, and so great aversion in the Duke, may, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, be gathered
from the then present circumstances and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions: For to the many injuries
received from the French and from the Cardinal, and to the abusive peace of
<hi>Montsone,</hi> was added the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals proud carriage towards the Prince,
not admitting him, when he came to treat, so much as to come within his
presence, whereof the Duke had wont to complain much; and conceiving thereby,
and by other proceedings, that the Cardinal was not only very averse to his
interests, but bent to ruine him, he thought that no offers nor agreements
would be observed unto him: nay, the greater the things were which the present
necessity might force him to, he thought the effecting of them would be the
harder afterwards, and the more odious; Wherefore fearing that he might be
deceived, he would not change the present time for the future: the Kings coming
to <hi>Susa,</hi> and the conventions which he was <pb n="414" facs="tcp:53250:215"/>
forc'd to give way unto there, touched him to the quick; and as
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e thought himself fallen from
that opinion, wherein he desired to be held, of being able to keep the French
out of <hi>Italy,</hi> or bring them in as he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted: so he imagined there was
no better, nor no more opportune re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy to he I so sore a wound, then to
oppose their passage now, &amp; by the total ruine of the enterprize and of
their Army, to leave a perpetual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to the French, how necessary it was
for them to esteem him as the only Porter of the <hi>Alps;</hi> and for the
Spaniards to put a value upon him, and to treat him with advantagious
conditions, as the Bulwark of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the state of
<hi>Millain;</hi> this was the highest pitch of his Grandezza, this the very
sence of his soul; and having fixt his eye upon this, as upon a mark to shoot
at, he thought that if he should hit it, all occasions that could be from the
French came short of it; it was also thought that he feared lest when the
Cardinal should see himself in great power and safety by his joyning with him,
he might afterwards make peace with the Spaniard, excluding his interests; just
as it hapned at the peace of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone;</hi> so as hating to joyn expresly
with either party, whereby he was to make himself subject to one of them, and
an enemy to the other, he was constant to his neutrality, whereby he was
superiour to them both; yet he broke not with any of them: but cloaking his
actions with neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, he fenced himself with tergiversations. Neither would
the French, who needed him exceedingly, break with him; but dissembling all the
hard usage they met with, endeavoured to win him over to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for them; and
they (so well knew they the advantage of his joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them) abusing their
patience, left nothing undone which might not prejudice them, though little to
their honour; the Cardinal agreed for provision of victuals, with some of the
Dukes subjects, and bargain'd with some others for the conducting of such as
were in <hi>Nizza,</hi> to ease his present necessities. The Duke made them all
be imprisoned; but not being able without apparent contumacy to deny the
conduct of such as were in <hi>Nizza,</hi> since he had already received monies
for their conduct, he would appoint the conductors himself; who depending
wholly upon him brought more or lesse, according as he pleased. But the Army
not being able to continue longer thus, and the Cardinal being either to break
with him, or unworthily waste his Army, or return with shame to
<hi>France,</hi> before he would break, he would make the last trial; He
promis'd that he would assault some place in the state of <hi>Millain,</hi>
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the Duke would furnish <hi>Casalle</hi> with victuals, the Duke
either did not, or did not seem to refuse the proposals; Whereupon the Cardinal
made his Van advance, consisting of 7000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, under Marshal
<hi>Cricky;</hi> and going himself out of <hi>Susa</hi> with the body of the
Army came to <hi>Cazalletto,</hi> a place near <hi>Avigliana;</hi> and the Duke
sent good store of victuals to <hi>Casalle:</hi> which finding that the Van
being come to <hi>Rivas,</hi> a Town in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> did not prosecute
the voyage, he made them stay; pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ending that the Van alone could not do any thing of moment against
the state of <hi>Millain,</hi> so as it was necessary that the rest of the Army
should follow: The Cardinal was mightily troubled to be thus used, perceiving
that those very tricks were used to him, which he used to others; For as this
marching of the Van was feignedly pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>formed by the Cardinal, to make the Duke put victuals 
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:53250:215"/> into <hi>Casalle;</hi> so the Dukes sending of victuals
appeared to be counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, to the end that he might make the Cardinal come
out of <hi>Susa</hi> with his Army, where he had as yet some provisions
wherewith to subsist, to the end that he might bring him to before the Spanish
and the Cesarean Armies without victuals, and be but badly backt by the
remainder of his Army which tarried behind; So as he might either be overcome
by Famine without fighting, or (if he should fight) he might be miserably
destroyed: And the more to witnesse the Dukes bad intentions, it was added,
that notwithstanding that he had good store of monies disburst unto him <hi>per
le Tappe,</hi> and other quarterings, he would not permit that the Army should
passe by the usual way that it was to march, and which leads from <hi>Susa</hi>
to <hi>Avigliana,</hi> where the way was more commodious, broader, and where
there was better quartering, but made it passe by the way of <hi>Condove</hi>
and <hi>Cassalette,</hi> which lies on the left hand, very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for the
Foot, much more for the Horse, and for the carriage of the Artillery; where
there was no order nor provision for quarter, and where they were to suffer
both hunger and cold: insomuch as the Army which tarried here some dayes had
perished, had not some remainder of victuals which were yet left in
<hi>Susa</hi> been brought thither; But this not being able to maintaine them
long, and the Duke pressing them to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, the Cardinal thought it not fit
to pursue that voyage, and leave <hi>Avigliana</hi> behind him, where the Duke
was with all his men: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he answered, that if the Duke would have him
advance, he must furnish him with victuals, and declare openly for the King,
and remove the impediment of <hi>Avigliana,</hi> which (in the condition it was
in) would not suffer him to advance; The Duke reply'd, that the great scarcity
of victuals must excuse him from sending in provisions, that he could not
declare against the Emperour who was his Sovereign Lord, from whom he held so
many Territories in fee; and as for <hi>Avigliana,</hi> that he was not bound,
as the Rebels of <hi>France,</hi> to demolish his Townes to pave the way for
the Kings Army; but (that to free himself of all jealousies) he was ready to
take some of his men out of <hi>Avigliana;</hi> to which purpose he drew from
thence about 7000 foot, but he placed them in the guard of the Bridges and
Passes, by which when the French should be past <hi>LaDora,</hi> they might
assault him; which the Cardinal perceiving, he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to use force, and to
go against the Duke when he should be past <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> who tarried with
some of his men in <hi>Rivoli:</hi> and to this purpose was <hi>Cricky</hi>
sent for back from <hi>Rivas,</hi> where he continued still, with the Van; the
Duke was aware of this, and did not fear it; for having mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited
<hi>Avigliana</hi> and <hi>Torino</hi> well, the places whereupon he thought
the French were likeliest to fall, he hoped he might hold them play there, till
such time as the Cesarian Army, and <hi>Spinola</hi>'s might advance; and
finding them incamp'd before those places might easily rout them, in case they
should not long before be made to quit the enterprize for want of victuals. But
a new and unthought of accident alter'd the state of affairs; the Duke going
that very night from <hi>Rivoli,</hi> went to <hi>Torino,</hi> and abandoning
the Bridges and Passes of the River, which the French were to assault the next
morning, he afforded them conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency to passe over the River without any
impediment; This so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and unexpected change was attributed to some
knowledge that the <pb n="416" facs="tcp:53250:216"/> Duke had got of some treaties held by
the Cardinal in <hi>Torino,</hi> where there were then many French, and amongst
them two of <hi>Cricky</hi>'s Sons; who as soon as they heard the Duke was
entred the City retired to the Army; whereat the Duke being mightily offended,
he made the chief of the French that remained in the Town be imprisoned, as
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices of plots and treaties, and published a manifesto in print; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he complained bitterly of the Cardinal, that whilst he was entred his Dominions
as a friend, and whilst he had furnish'd him with victuals and other things, to
the great prejudice of his own people, (from whose mouths he had pull'd it) he
had endeavoured to oppresse him with plots and treaties within his own doors,
only for not having joyn'd his Forces with the French, against his Sovereign
Lord the Emperour, and against the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to whom he had no
reason to professe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an Enemy; wherefore declaring himself openly for
the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and King of <hi>Spain</hi> against the French, he made new and
more urgent dispatches to <hi>Spinola</hi> and to <hi>Collalto,</hi> to make
them advance with all possible speed to relieve <hi>Piedmont;</hi> promising
them full and assured victory over the Enemy, who were streightned by so many
necessities: of which victory the happy end of the enterprizes of
<hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Casal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> would be the undoubted result. The
Cardinal was in great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion at this the Dukes sudden and unexpected
resolution, his Army being in great danger to be lost for to send men to
<hi>Casalle,</hi> and no victuals would rather be a trouble then an ease to the
Town; to keep idle where he was was impossible, for want of victuals; and
dangerous, lest the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might come upon them; to sit down before
<hi>Avigliana</hi> or <hi>Torino,</hi> would be a desperate and ruinous
businesse; So (as in so great confusion and difficulty) he knew no better
course to take, then to send a Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Duke; who treating with him,
and with the Princesse Royal of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> might mitigate the Dukes
severity, and bring him to more moderate counsells; But neither did this do any
good; for the Duke being angry with the Cardinal, minded nothing but revenge,
and the total ruine of that Army, and utterly to overthrow the Cardinals
fortune; who out of private Emulation, and big with Hatred and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
brought the Kings Forces to triumph over his, and thought to make his Name
remarkable to the Princes of the present age, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal to future times; He
therefore neither admitted of the Messenger, nor would he suffer him to speak
with the Princesse Royal, nor with the Embassadours of other Princes, who were
resident in his Court. Wherefore the Cardinal, forced by necessity, changed the
defensive war which was intended in favour to <hi>Nevers,</hi> into war
offensive against the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by whom he held himself to be so
unworthily dealt with; he therefore sack'd <hi>Rivoli</hi> and the neighbouring
Townes: but thinking this too weak a resentment, and unworthy his Grandezza, he
turned upon <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> whither having sent <hi>Cricky</hi> with the
Van, he followed him the next day with the rest of his Army; a resolution
wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ch was certainly necessary in
so desperate a condition, but very uncertain and dangerous; for if that place
had been so well provided as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portancy thereof, and the present condition
of affairs required, and consequently the Cesarean and Spanish Armies had had
time to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour it, the French must necessarily either have come to a battle
upon <pb n="417" facs="tcp:53250:216"/> disadvantage, or have foregone the Enterprise with
much danger and confusion, and have shamefully returned to <hi>Susa,</hi>
where, if assaulted, they could hardly have held out, but must have been
enforced to receive such Laws as the Conquerours should please to prescribe
them, to the intire loss of that Glory which they had won upon that very place
the year before: But Fortune, which useth to change in points of extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
raised the Cardinals condition to the highest pitch of felicity, which appeared
to be ruined; and precipitated the Dukes Affairs almost into utter destruction,
which seemed to be placed on the height of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness: For the Duke somewhat
doubting that place, where he knew there was no other defence but the Garrison
which was usually kept there in time of Peace, sent thither a great recruit of
men the very day that the Army removed from <hi>Rivoli;</hi> but it being given
out in the Army, that it went to <hi>Turin;</hi> and those that went with the
Artillery thinking that they were to continue their march according to their
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Orders, before the consultations had against <hi>Pinarollo</hi> were
disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, drave on to <hi>Turin;</hi> and the Duke, who by reason of the
said consultations doubted lest he might be assaulted, recall'd that recruit of
men which he but a little before had sent to <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> and kept them
to defend the chief City; so as <hi>Pinarollo</hi> being deprived of that
recruit, and the Duke not being of himself able to march into the field to
defend it, could not hold out long against the French; for the Van being come
thither on the 20<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> and having placed their battery upon
the ditch, the City yielded without making any resistance: They had somewhat
more to do to take the Castle, which held out somewhat longer for the Duke.</p>
            <p>This success did totally alter the face of Affairs; the Cardinal
having time to breathe amidst so great streights, to boot with having made way
for the bringing of victuals and provisions from <hi>France,</hi> brought the
neighbouring Towns of <hi>Piedmont</hi> to Contribution, which abounded in
Victuals; and by keeping that and <hi>Susa</hi> in his possession, might not
only advance to further acquisitions, but secure the restitution of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> if it should be taken by the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> and now
that he had so good pledges in his hands, he might treat of Peace upon better
condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the relief of <hi>Cassalle</hi> not being so necessary as before.
On the contrary, the Duke being by the loss of this place faln from his
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious condition, could no longer keep the French Army from Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
nor make it depend upon his will, as formerly, in respect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
<hi>Cassalle;</hi> nor could he keep the Spaniards any longer from being
jealous of his joyning with the French; but on the contrary, it behoved him not
only to depend upon the Cardinal, and be subject to his will, who being Master
of <hi>Pinarollo</hi> might prejudice <hi>Piedmont</hi> in several manners; but
also upon <hi>Spinola</hi>'s pleasure, by the necessity he was in of being
assisted by his Forces against the French, who were got into the bowels of his
State; so as being of a sudden saln from being the Arbitrator of Peace and War
(as he held himself to be) to be subject to the pleasures of both parties, it
behoved him wholly to forego those high conceits by which he thought to give
Law to all, and to submit himself to be disposed of by those who could readily
and powerfully either defend or indammage him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="418" facs="tcp:53250:217"/> 
               <hi>Spinola,</hi> who being wholly bent
upon Peace, would never supply the Duke either with men or moneys, being
awakened by the coming and the progress of the French Army, began to be of
another mind, and to make more haste in providing for War; he therefore sent
into <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> to hasten the coming of the men that
were ready there, and into <hi>Spain</hi> for more moneys; and minding chiefly
the safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> he began to build a great Fort
neer <hi>Sarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranna,</hi> and another upon the <hi>Poe,</hi> over against
<hi>Valenza,</hi> and a third at <hi>Villata;</hi> he threw one Bridge over at
<hi>Villata,</hi> and another between <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenza</hi> and the new Fort; so he
thought that that part of the State which was neer the great Garrison of
<hi>Cassalle</hi> was safe enough; and hearing that the French were gone to
<hi>Pinarolo,</hi> he sent Don <hi>Martin d' Aragona</hi> to assist the Duke
with the Van, consisting of 4000 Foot, and 600 Horse; and he himself expecting
the Legate in <hi>Alessandria,</hi> who came to treat of Peace, tarried there
to assemble the rest of the Army, and therewithal himself in person to defend
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> but were it either that the ways being broken down by
continual rain hindred the speed of his march, or that thinking it impossible
to come time enough to relieve the Castle of <hi>Pinarolo,</hi> he thought that
the Castle, since it was to be lost, might be lost before his Kings Forces
appeared; or else, (as many were of opinion) that <hi>Spinola</hi> was not yet
very sure of the Dukes Friendship, and that therefore he was not displeased
with that loss, which forced the Duke to joyn with the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
party, out of necessity of being assisted in recovering what he had lost; the
Affairs belonging to that expedition went not on so fast or with such fervour
as was outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profess'd.</p>
            <p>When the Legate was come to <hi>Alessandria,</hi> he spoke with
<hi>Spinola,</hi> and with the Marquess of <hi>San Croce,</hi> who was come
from <hi>Genoa</hi> to be present at that Conference; he found a great
inclination to Peace in them, and was therewith well pleased; for
<hi>Spinola</hi> and <hi>San Croce</hi> offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do any thing so as the
French would restore the Towns in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> and would return into
<hi>France:</hi> they promised to restore <hi>Nevers</hi> into peaceful
possession of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and to invest him duly
thereinto; to restore the Forts and Places taken from the Grisons; that the
Emperours Army should return to <hi>Germany;</hi> and the disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the
Spanish Army which was in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cardinal parted from <hi>Alessandria</hi> with these
Proposals, and went towards <hi>Piedmont</hi> to treat with the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and with the Cardinal of <hi>From,</hi> in whom he found not
such a willingness to Peace; first, the Cardinal alledging, That it became not
the honour of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Forces to enter into a Treaty,
whilst the enterprise which they had in hand, of the Castle of
<hi>Pinarollo,</hi> was not finished; and he would not enter into discourse
with the Legate, who tarried fifteen days in <hi>Turrin</hi> to that end; at
the end whereof the Castle being surrendred, the Cardinal fell to begirt the
Town with Bulwarks Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and fortified the Castle, making that Town
impregnable; which (as it was then judged, and was afterward better confirm'd
by success) the French never intended to restore, but to make it a Rendezvouz
for Arms in <hi>Italy,</hi> which might serve as a curb to <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and to the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> keep the State of <hi>Millain</hi> in a
perpetual jealousie, and <pb n="419" facs="tcp:53250:217"/> might serve for an excellent
door to the King of <hi>France</hi> for greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprises, which he might
design unto himself, if he should have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to send his Armies over the
<hi>Alps. Bricherasco</hi> was taken soon after, being neer <hi>Pinarollo,</hi>
at the foot of the <hi>Alps,</hi> well fortified and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: not long after
the surrender of the Castle of <hi>Pinarollo, Colalto</hi> and <hi>Spinela</hi>
came to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and with <hi>Spinola</hi> came <hi>San Croce</hi>
and the Duke of <hi>Lerma;</hi> and after them some of the Cesarian and some of
the Spanish Army: a Consultation was held in <hi>Carmagnuola</hi> touching the
whole affair: The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s opinion was, that foregoing the
enterprises of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Casalle</hi> for the present, they
should go with all their joynt Forces to the recovery of <hi>Pinarollo</hi> and
<hi>Susa,</hi> and that they should endeavour to drive the French beyond the
Mountains; for when <hi>Italy</hi> should be freed of them, both
<hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Casalle,</hi> as not being able to hold out without
them, would fall of themselves, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially since <hi>Casalle</hi> not having
victuals, would soon surrender; and the Duke promis'd on the faith of a Prince,
that it should not be relieved with victuals; and to the end, that each
Commander of each Army, as well the Emperours, as the King of <hi>Spains,</hi>
might willingly agree to this, he offered to leave <hi>Piedmont</hi> free to be
disposed of by them, to the end, that they might manage their war there as they
listed; and that he, contenting himself with 12000 Foot and 1500 Horse, would
go with them into <hi>Savoy,</hi> and from thence into <hi>Dolpheny;</hi> where
mastering the ways which lead to <hi>Italy,</hi> he would hinder Commerce
between <hi>France</hi> and the Army which was busied in defending
<hi>Pinarollo,</hi> in such sort, as that Army not being able to be recruited
either with Men, Victuals or Money from <hi>France,</hi> should either be
forc'd to perish there, or aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
should return to <hi>France;</hi> and the French being thus kept from making
opposition, <hi>Casalle</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily be reduced: all
of them except <hi>Spinola,</hi> did in part approve, and in part disapprove of
the Dukes Proposal: all of them agreed that for the present they should forego
the enterprises of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Casalle,</hi> and that they should
march with their joynt Forces to recover the Dukes Towns, and to drive the
French out of <hi>Italy;</hi> but the other part of the Dukes advice was not
generally agreed unto, for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned carrying the war with part of the
Forces beyond the Mountains; for this opinion appeared to be as dangerous, as
the other of joyning in the recovery of the Towns of <hi>Piedmont</hi> was
useful and requisite: but <hi>Spinola,</hi> were it either that he knew the
mind of the <hi>Spanish</hi> Court, or out of the apparent advantage which
would be had by the getting of <hi>Casalle,</hi> or that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e thought it but vain to go about
recovering the places which were lost, whilst the way for relief was open
behind them, or that he was jealous that the Duke might change his mind if the
French should offer to restore his Towns, held it better not to expose the main
Forces, the safety of affairs, and of the Kings Dominions, and his own
reputation, upon the Dukes bare word, which he did not much relie upon, upon
the uncertainty of Success, lest the Kings men might be worsted by the French,
and that they should find difficulty in retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in case that any agreement
should be made between the Duke and the French; wherefore opposing the opinion
of the whole Council, wherein the chief Commanders of the Army did intervene,
and also <pb n="420" facs="tcp:53250:218"/> opposing <hi>San' Croce,</hi> he was of
opinion, that <hi>Colalto</hi> should tarry with the most of his men to oppose
the French, and that he himself should with the remainder attend the expugning
of <hi>Casalle:</hi> from which reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution neither the Dukes intreaty, nor the
contrary opinion of the whole Council, nor any other inconvenience which was
urged might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the common affairs, could divert him: he
therefore sent his Son Don <hi>Philip</hi> with 5000 Foot and 500 Horse to the
recovery of <hi>Pontestura, San' Georgio,</hi> and <hi>Lusignano,</hi> all of
them being neer <hi>Casalle,</hi> which (as hath been said) were held and
garrison'd by the French; and he himself staid in <hi>Turin,</hi> to assist, in
the Treaty of peace, which after the loss of <hi>Pinarollo</hi> was reassumed
by the Legate.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Savey</hi> was not a little incens'd at this
constant resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Spinola;</hi> and that not so much for that he saw
himself deprived of his assistance and of a good part of the Spanish Army, as
for sear that if <hi>Casalle</hi> should be taken, the Spaniards would be less
fervent in defending him, and in recovering his lost Towns: A consideration
which had he not been blinded by his own interest, he might suppose might
oblige <hi>Spinola</hi> as much to endeavour the taking of <hi>Casalle</hi>
antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pately, as it was probable that the Duke, whose Interests the taking of
<hi>Casalle</hi> did oppose, when he should have recovered his Towns in
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> should use his best means to keep <hi>Casalle</hi> from
being taken, as he had done formerly. <hi>Colalto</hi> was likewise much
troubled at this resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Spinola</hi>'s, being wrought upon by the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and as some will say, by his great
donatives; for he, favouring the Dukes Cause, as if the Common Cause were
concerned therein, desired it might be taken into consideration in the first
place; so as to boot with the emulation which was already grown between them,
not only diversity of opinions, but distastes arose upon this occasion, from
whence much prejudice did r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dound
to the main affair; which being distracted by the several interests, and
emulations of private men, was subject to great hazards, just like a Ship which
is agitated by contrary windes: so as <hi>Collalto</hi> not willing to be left
alone to prosecute the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> withdrew to the Army
before <hi>Mantua;</hi> saying pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly, that if others would prefer their
Prince his particular cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what was the common concernment, he was
likewise obliged to prefer the business of <hi>Mantua,</hi> wherein the
Emperour was particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interessed, before that of <hi>Casalle</hi> or
<hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Legate being this mean while gone to <hi>Pinarollo,</hi>
had acquainted Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> with what had been agreed unto in
<hi>Alessandria</hi> by <hi>Spinola,</hi> and <hi>San' Croce:</hi> he found him
willing to yield to all save to what concern'd the restitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
<hi>Pinarollo;</hi> which he said it was necessary for him to keep, as well out
of the pretences which the King of <hi>France</hi> laid thereunto, as for the
security of <hi>Nevers</hi> his affairs, and of the peace which was to be
concluded, which having been violated many times (as he said) on the Spanish
side, he might justly fear it might meet again with some trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, when he
should be past back over the Mountains: but it was rather thought that he
refused to restore <hi>Pinarolio,</hi> out of private ambition; for he was very
proud of having gotten a place of such importance for the Kings affairs; and as
<hi>France</hi> was much grieved when <hi>Pinarollo</hi> was restored to the
Father of this present Prince, by <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, King 
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:53250:218"/> of <hi>France,</hi> so being now as much pleased with
the recovery thereof, the Cardinal would not, together with the advantage of
the acquisition, lose the perpetual glory of having done so great a benefit to
the Crown or <hi>France:</hi> but this being a point of such importance for the
conclusion or exclusion of peace, in which things belonging to others are
usually restored, the retaining thereof was now discuss'd, only as being
contrary to the title pretended unto by the Kings Forces; wherein
<hi>Richelieu</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated the Proposal, and reduced the retention thereof
to the space of two years, offering the Duke <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> and some other
Towns in <hi>Montferrat</hi> in pawn for the restoring of it: but this being
held to be yet too hard a condition, wherein the observance of the agreement
was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Arbitrement of the French, who when <hi>Casalle</hi> and
<hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> should be freed, it was hard to say what they would have done;
it was finally proposed, that the Dutch should keep the Towns taken from the
Grisons, and the French those of the Dukes, till such time as the affairs of
<hi>Italy</hi> should be adjusted within fifteen days; which when they should
be adjusted and composed, whatsoever was retained should be by both sides
restored. <hi>Spinola</hi> listned to this Proposal, which he thought to be
more moderate, insomuch as discoursing thereof in the presence of the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and of the other Commanders, he said that he would readily
agree thereunto, if the time of restitution might be prolonged for the space of
two moneths; the Duke who was alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy very much unsatisfied with
<hi>Spinola,</hi> could not give way to such a length of time; but letting his
anger burst out which till then he had kept in, he exclaimed very much upon
him, as did <hi>Colalto</hi> also; and it being discovered that there was
speech of a meeting between the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and <hi>Spinola,</hi> and that
intelligence was held between them, the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie grew greater; both of them
being found to be no well-wishers to the Duke. This suspition was much fomented
by the friendship which was contracted between them, when <hi>Spinola</hi> in
his passage from <hi>Flanders</hi> to <hi>Spain,</hi> went to the Camp before
<hi>Rochel,</hi> to kiss the Kings hand; where being received with unusual
favours by the Cardinal, the Cardinal was much commended by a relation which
<hi>Spinola</hi> made to the King of the well ordering of that Siege, and by
his assuring him of happy and speedy success, if the same course should be
still taken; and to all this it was added, that a dispatch which was at this
very time sent to <hi>Spinola</hi> being intercepted, <hi>Richelieu</hi> sent
it to him close sealed as it was, and unbroken up, which being known by the
Duke, afforded him much cause of jealousie. Thus the Treaty of peace being
broken, prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made for war; and the Duke resenting
<hi>Spinola</hi>'s usage, sent the Abbot <hi>Scaglia</hi> to complain unto the
King of <hi>Spinola</hi>'s strange and rigorous proceedings, tending not onely
to the prejudice of him the Duke, but to the dis-service of the Kings affairs,
and of the common cause, which could receive no advantage by the Dukes
dis-satisfaction; and he made his Daughter in Law complain of the Cardinal in
the Court of <hi>France,</hi> but particularly to the Queen-Mother; who though
she had been very well pleased formerly with the Cardinals greatness, began to
be jealous of him now, by reason of his too great authority, and of the credit
which he had won with the King; so as it was in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral manners ill spoken of;
some accusing him of too great hatred to <pb n="422" facs="tcp:53250:219"/> the Duke; that
being ordered to deal friendly with him, his only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in this
expedition had been to incense him, and by his ill usage to alienate him from
the Kings interest: some accused him of want of experience in Military affairs;
some of injustice and violence, who had turned those Forces which were destined
to defend an injured Prince, to oppress another who was so neer allied to the
King, a Friend and Confederate of the Crown, to the great scandal of the Kings
Forces, to the danger of the enterprise, and of that Army, wherein were so
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lords and Commanders; wherefore finding himself complained of, and
apprehending the Kings displeasure, whereinto he might run by his absence, he
left the management of affairs in <hi>Piedmont</hi> with the Marshals <hi>dela
Force</hi> and <hi>Scomberg,</hi> and return'd with <hi>Cricky</hi> into
<hi>France;</hi> whither when he was come, and had given an account of his
action, and of what streights the Duke had put him in, he had much adoto clear
himself from the faults which were laid to his charge by his ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willers.</p>
            <p>Thus went the Duke about to prejudice the Cardinals fortune by his
endeavours, which he could never overthrow by his Forces, nor by his so many
Plots and Stratagems. Whilst the business of peace was deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in
<hi>Turin,</hi> Don <hi>Philippo Spinola</hi> was got neer <hi>Pontestura,</hi>
and had begirt it on all sides; and began his Batteries: the French had begun
some unperfect Fortifications, and those of <hi>Casalle,</hi> that the longer
that place held out, the longer might they themselves be preserved; they
thought good to lessen their own Garrison and Provisions, and imploy them in
the defence of <hi>Pontestura,</hi> hoping that by gain of time they might the
better mind their own Fortifications: but the effects proved otherwise, for on
the fourth day the defendants began to parly, and on the fifth, agreed to
surrender the Town, upon all the conditions they could desire, except that they
were not to enter into <hi>Casalle,</hi> nor tarry in <hi>Italy,</hi> and they
were bound to leave all their victuals and provisions behind them. Thus Don
<hi>Philip</hi> became master of this place, and made the French go to
<hi>Finale,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Marcelles,</hi> with little reputation:
from hence he went to St. <hi>George</hi> his Castle, which was not above a
mile and a half from <hi>Casalle,</hi> where there were but twelve French men
in Garrison, besides the Towns-men, who were very well armed and prepared for
defence: here they met with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, for the defendants refusing to
surrender, Don <hi>Philip</hi> began his Mines, which he began to make upon the
Flank of a Tower; but they did no good, by reason of artificial fire-works,
which being thrown from off the Walls, burnt the pent-houses which shelter'd
the work-men; so they were forced to work further off, in a better co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
place; where being safer, they slew some of the defendants, amongst which the
Captain of the French; whereupon the rest fearing to be served so likewise,
surrendred upon the same Articles that <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testura</hi> had done, but not
with the like infamy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rossigliano</hi> remained yet untaken, where there were about
300 French and Montferrians; this place being cut off from <hi>Casalle</hi> by
the loss of St. <hi>Georgio,</hi> it was thought it would be loss of time to
attempt it, since it could not prejudice <hi>Casalle:</hi> but
<hi>Spinola,</hi> to whom Don <hi>Philip</hi> writ, sending word that they
should proceed on, they went thither; <pb n="423" facs="tcp:53250:219"/> the place was
strong enough and seated high; Marquess <hi>Moncausier</hi> the chief of the
French Garrison was Governour, a young sprightly man, desirous of fame, and to
make amends by his valour for the obloquie that was laid by all men upon the
French for having defended <hi>Pontestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> so poorly: so the business
proved somewhat longer and more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult: the defendants upon the enemies
appearance came forth, and after some skirmishing retreated into the Town; to
which the enemy drew neer, making their approaches on three sides, and on two
sides their Batteries: but all their attempts, which were many, were man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
withstood, and the Siege was held out for 15 days: but at last, a mine being
made in the third approach, to boot with their batteries, they were forced to
yield upon the same conditions as <hi>Pontestura</hi> had done, only
<hi>Moncausier,</hi> with some others, were permitted to go into
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle;</hi> which being block'd up by the loss of these places, and kept
from all succour and victuals, and fearing to be shortly assaulted by
<hi>Spinola</hi>'s whole Army, it was not likely to hold out long: yet the
French that were in it were not dismaid, but hearing that a company of the
Dukes Horse were quartered in <hi>Morano,</hi> beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> they
went out by night, and passing over the River in Boats, they fell upon them at
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, kil'd many of them, and brought many of them prisoners into
<hi>Casalle. Spinola</hi> seeing the peace not effected, left about 6000 Foot
in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> under the Camp-masters, Don <hi>Martined' Aragona,

Gambacorti,</hi> Governour of the Neopolitan Horse, with Orders to them all to
obey the Prince of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and he himself went to the Siege of
<hi>Casalle;</hi> and taking his leave of the Duke, he excused the necessity of
this his resolution, upon the account of the great Garison of French which was
in <hi>Casalle,</hi> which keeping the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and part of
<hi>Piedmont</hi> in jealousie, no reason of war would permit that that
Rendezvouz for the enemies Arms should be suffered, by reason of the great
inconveniences which might result from thence; all their joynt Forces being in
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and being confident, out of his expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in taking in of
Towns, and by the opinion of his Captains, that the Town could not hold out for
above 40 days: he promised the Duke that when it should be taken, he would
return with all his Forces to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist him: <hi>Colalto</hi> also parted from
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> leaving between three or four thousand Dutch there under the
Baron <hi>Gallaaso,</hi> who were put in Garrison in <hi>Avigliana.
Spinola</hi> begun the taking of <hi>Casalle</hi> about the end of
<hi>May,</hi> not being resolved whether he should attempt it by Storm or by
Siege: though they hoped the Siege would not prove long, by reason of the small
quantity of victuals that were in it; yet calculating that the number of
defendants were lessened, by the sending of men into the Towns which were taken
but a little before, it was judged that storming would prove the safer and the
shorter way; the rather for that the Forces of the French Army being
sufficiently diminished, the fear of their opposition was proportionably
lessened: wherefore it was thought better to dispute the business by force of
Arms, then streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it by Famine to depend upon the success of a Siege,
which through uncertain and false calculations proves more uncertain and more
fala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious: but were it either that his felicity followed him not, but was 
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:53250:220"/> fix'd to the Belgick soil, or that the several ends and

that his d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ath, which shortly
hapned, cut off the thred of his excellent fortune, he was forc'd to succumb in
this. The Duke <hi>di Mena, Nevers</hi> his second Son, commanded in
<hi>Casalle;</hi> a young man, and but little experienced in Arms; so as his
person served for little more then for the authority and reputation of the
Government and conduct of Affa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>rs,
and to keep concord amongst the Captains, and Military obedience: in the
Citadel was only a Garrison of Montferrians, under the same Marquess of
<hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vara,</hi> who had withstood the former oppugnation: the French, being
2000 Foot and 300 Horse, defended the City and the Citadel, who were commanded
by Marshal <hi>di Toras,</hi> one who had won the same of much valour, and the
opinion of being excellent at the keeping of Towns, by his singular and valiant
defending of the Isle of <hi>Rees,</hi> which lies over against
<hi>Rochel,</hi> against a treble assault of the English Fleet: the chief
Fortifications, when <hi>Toras</hi> came thither, were only towards the
<hi>Poe</hi> and towards the Plain, where it was assaulted by Don
<hi>Gonzal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo:</hi> it was but little or not at all fortified towards the Hill;
and <hi>Toras</hi> searing to be assaulted on that side, was very industrious
in fortifying it: the Citadel had no out-works nor Fortifications, save two
Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moons; the one of which shelter'd the Gate whereby relief was brought; the
other that which was towards the City. <hi>Toras</hi> made another very great
one, doubly begirt, between the two bulwarks of the Citadel, where he
apprehended to be assaulted. Neither were these provisions made in vain; for
<hi>Spinola</hi> thinking this the fittest place, began four approaches from
thence; the first whereof was committed to the care of the Camp master
<hi>Filomarini</hi> his Neapolitans, and was directed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that part of the
City which is called <hi>de Treventi,</hi> and lay under some Fortifications
which were built upon a rise without the City; and the wall of the City,
together with that of the Castle, making an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle inwards, which the
Assailants were to play upon, the on-set on that side was the more hard and
dangerous: the other approaches led straight upon the two Bulwarks of the
Citadel, betwixt which <hi>Toras</hi> had made his Half moon: to the first
whereof, which was more inward, and neerer the Gate which leads to
<hi>Turin,</hi> were two approaches made, the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>st by the Spaniards commanded by the Duke of
<hi>Lerma,</hi> the other by the Dutch who were commanded by <hi>Shamburgs</hi>
Lieutenant: the fourth approach, which was against the Bulwark, from whence the
Campagnia is first discovered, fell to the Lombards share, under the two
Camp-masters, <hi>Trotti</hi> and <hi>Sforza.</hi> Thus the Trenches being
begun to be opened, every one endeavoured to come speedily to what was
intended; this mean while Don <hi>Ieronymo Augustini,</hi> being left in
<hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Frontier, by <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Order drew neer the <hi>Poe,</hi> over against
<hi>Casalle;</hi> and that he might streighten the Town the more on that side,
he took up his Quarters there, wherein he was not well forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when he began
to attempt the neerest Island, upon which those of the City had made some
Fortifications, for it was of great consequence for the safety of the City and
of the Mills which were not far from thence; foo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ding over the River with his Horses fastned together,
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that he was plaid upon by Musket-shot from the Walls 
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:53250:220"/> and from the Forts, he advanced so far as he became
master of the Island, with the death of 300 French, part whereof were slain,
part drown'd in the <hi>Poe,</hi> which is very deep, and runs very swift
between the Island and the City: This being the first action attempted by those
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out upon such disadvantage, and yet with such courage and vigor, and
proving so fortunate to the assailants, and so prejudicial to the assaulted,
did much discourage the <hi>Cassalians,</hi> who were not accustomed all the
preceding year to so fierce and bloody sport; and the basenesse of the French,
here, being added to that which they shew'd in defending <hi>Pontestura,</hi>
they began to fear the worst, and to confide but little in the Souldiers of
that Nation, upon whom they had formerly built so much: But <hi>Toras</hi> had
occasion soon enough to signalize himself and his Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, in an other
action which he attempted with no lesse Judgement and Valour then Fortune,
whereby he won Reputation to himself and to his men, and revived the almost
extinct credit of the French in the <hi>Montferrians;</hi> he was aware that
the <hi>Lombards</hi> that were working upon the fourth approach had not as yet
finish'd a redoubt, and that those who were to guard it were negligent,
believing that those who were within, having already lost their Reputation,
would not dare to assault them, he sallied forth with about 400 of his best and
most experienced Foot, and with 50 Horse; and falling upon them at unawares,
cut them all in pieces; And not tarrying here, he past on to the second
redoubt, which being abandoned by three Ensignes, who with some of their
companies had the keeping thereof, he easily master'd it; Then passing forward
to the third, with like Valour and like hope, he failed in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent by the
resistance he met with there, and by reason of the Horse which came in, led on
by <hi>Count Soragna;</hi> so as being forc'd to give back, he retreated to
underneath the shelter of the Citadel, with more prejudice to the Enemy then to
his own men, having slain three Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and many Officers, and having wounded
<hi>Count Soragna</hi> mortally, who died soon after, and kill'd above
fourscore Souldiers, and wounded many more. This action did much incourage the
defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants, and made the enemy more cautious, and delay'd the making of the
approaches; the which the more they advanced, were more subject to danger, to
losse of men and delay; the defendants failed not to sally out both by day and
night, with sometimes greater, sometimes lesser losse to each side. Whilst they
wrought thus with more toile and danger before <hi>Casalle,</hi> businesse
cooled in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> when the Cardinal and <hi>Cricky</hi> went away,
the managing of the power was left (as you have heard) to the Marshals <hi>De
La Force</hi> and <hi>Scomburg;</hi> and <hi>Scomburg,</hi> who went afterwards
to <hi>France,</hi> was succeeded by the Duke of <hi>Momo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy;</hi> who
distributing their men in <hi>Pinorollo,</hi> and in <hi>Brischerasco,</hi>
stood more upon defence then offence; For many of their Commanders and Officers
were gon from <hi>France,</hi> many of their Souldiers had done so likewise, or
were run away, and the Plague had play'd his part amongst them, and the Duke
having sent about 10000 Foot into <hi>Savoy,</hi> under Prince
<hi>Thomaso,</hi> to defend <hi>Savoy,</hi> fearing lest it might be invaded
and possest by the King, made of the rest of his Souldiery a body of 15000
Foot, and 3000 Horse, made up of his own men, and of the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s men which were left him by <hi>Spinola;</hi> which together 
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:53250:221"/> with the Dutch were still increased, by the continual
recruits which were sent in by <hi>Spinola</hi> and <hi>Collalto:</hi> And
going into the field he incamped at <hi>Pancareli,</hi> a Town beyond the
<hi>Poe,</hi> towards the <hi>Alps,</hi> 15 miles from <hi>Pinarollo;</hi> and
fortifying it with Trenches, he stood observing what the French would do, that
he might oppose them. The French had their eyes upon <hi>Vigone,</hi> which
though it were an open Town, yet of much concernment for the Corn that was in
it; they went thither very strong and assaulted it; But the Prince of
<hi>Piedmont</hi> coming in with some companies of Carabines and Musketiers,
they were repuls'd. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they turned to <hi>Cercenasco,</hi> a Castle not
far from thence, very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for their falling down into
<hi>Carignano,</hi> where there is a wooden Bridge over the <hi>Poe,</hi> which
the French desired to be Masters of, it lying conveniently for them to passe
unto <hi>Casalle,</hi> they took it, and left some to defend it: But the Duke
being desirous to recover it came before it with many men, when the French were
retired to <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> and at the same time sent Marquis <hi>Villa</hi>
with 1000 Foot, and 100 Horse, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt <hi>Bricherasco,</hi> formerly
taken, as hath been said, by the French, and fortified. The event of these
enterprizes were different, for <hi>Cercenasco</hi> yielded to the Duke within
three days, and the Marquess though he fell upon the Fortifications by night,
and was gotten a good way into them, yet was he forced quickly to retreat,
through his mens faults, who being wholly intent upon booty, afforded those of
the Garrison conveniency to make head and to assault them, and to repulse them
whilst they were in disorder busie about booty: The French not content to have
beaten them back went with all their Forces to recover <hi>Cercenasco,</hi>
which they could not indure to loose.</p>
            <p>The Duke who was ready with almost all his men to receive them,
though he was inferiour to them in Horse, those which were sent to
<hi>Bricherasco</hi> not being yet returned, <hi>Momorancy</hi> was desirous to
give battle, which if it had been done, would have been upon much disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to the Duke; but <hi>La Force</hi> would not give way thereunto; Wherefore they
retreated to their quarters about <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> and the Plague increasing
very much in both Armies, they kept in their quarters, for many dayes, in the
face of one another, as if they had been in tacite League, not doing any thing
of moment. The King of <hi>France</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded more hotly beyond the
Mountains, who entring into <hi>Savoy</hi> with 8000 Foot, and 2000 Horse, had
reduced all <hi>Savoy</hi> into his power, unlesse it were <hi>Mommiliano,</hi>
for Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> made no opposition, he resolved to begirt
<hi>Mommiliano</hi> on all sides, and to besiege it a distance; for it was a
strong and almost invincible place: For being inclosed on all sides by his
Forces, and impossible to be relieved, it must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity fall into his
hands for want of victuals; So as needing not many men for that enterprize, he
sent part of his Forces to recruit his Army in <hi>Italy,</hi> which had need
enough of help: And Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> being sent for back by his Father,
carried his men with him from <hi>Savoy</hi> to defend <hi>Piedmont.</hi> Thus
both Armies b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ing reinforced, they
prepared for greater enterprizes, the French to relieve <hi>Casalle</hi> the
Duke to withstand them. This recruit was sent under <hi>Momorancy,</hi> who was

for <hi>Momorancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> who did not much value <hi>Avigliana,</hi> there
being almost no Garrison there, for the Duke had sent for the greatest part
thereof to <hi>Pancaler:</hi> Wherefore he easily took it, he like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
believed he should easily passe through the <hi>Canevese</hi> to <hi>Casalle,
Spinola</hi> and the Duke were much troubled at the coming of this recruit, but
much more with the news of the Kings coming with a greater force; who having
possest himself (as you have heard) of <hi>Savoy,</hi> was come neer the
<hi>Alpes,</hi> and was at the same time seen upon the Mountain S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <hi>Barnado;</hi> So as the Duke perceiving that the King was offended with
him, knew not how to fence himself against this third coming of the French; and
<hi>Spinola,</hi> who was ingaged before <hi>Casalle</hi> but with a few men,
fearing lest, little to his honour, he might be forced as his Predecssor had
been, to abandon that enterprize; (which contrary to the opinion of all) he had
of himself undertaken, knew not what to do; Yet b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ing much prest by the Duke, he sent 6000 Dutch to the
Mountain, who were brought at the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s charge, but very
then, from <hi>Germany,</hi> and six Troops under <hi>Pagan Doria,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Avigliana,</hi> in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and Brother to Prince
<hi>Doria</hi> a young man, and who the year before had entred into the Militia
under <hi>Don Gonsallo,</hi> and was in the first businesse of
<hi>Casalle;</hi> and <hi>Spinola,</hi> to the end that if the King should come
he might not be inforc'd to raise the siege, or fight, took the Souldiers from
working in the approaches, and imploy'd them in making a crooked and high
trench, wherewith he invironed the whole Camp. And seeing that by this new
work, and by the men which he had sent the Duke, the siege would be slackned:
and having in vain desired a thousand of his Dutch from <hi>Collalto,</hi> he
sent to the Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa</hi> for a thousand men, which he would
take into his pay; But neither was this granted him; for hearing of
preparations of Armes in the <hi>Provence,</hi> the Common-wealth would not
disfurnish her self; and this the rather for that having formerly sent men to
before <hi>Casalle,</hi> she could not receive them back when she needed them,
without manifest danger of infecting the State, the Plague being very hot in
the Camp before <hi>Casalle:</hi> So <hi>Spinola</hi> was forced to make use of
those men to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his own Camp, which he had begun to oppose others with;
and the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> fearing <hi>Avigliana,</hi> sent <hi>Count
Verr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Pancaleri</hi> with 3000 Foot, and <hi>Gambacorti</hi> with 400 Hose, to
possesse themselves of the abandoned Trenches and Fortifications, that shut up
the valley which leads from <hi>Susa</hi> to <hi>Avigliana.</hi> As they went
thither, they found the Enemy very neer; but having possest themselves of the
Trenches first, the Prince came in with a great body of men, who reinforcing
those stations with 2000 Foot, incamp'd himself with the rest at
<hi>Riano,</hi> within two miles of <hi>Avigliana:</hi> both parties kept
within their quarters, facing one another two dayes, some sleight skirmishes
passing between them; the third day the French finding it impossible to advance
and storm those quarters, resolved to give over their going that way to
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle,</hi> and endeavoured to retreat joyntly by the Mountain to
<hi>Pinarollo,</hi> 
               <pb n="428" facs="tcp:53250:222"/> and passing over the Mountain
<hi>Giavenna,</hi> to joyn with <hi>La Force,</hi> who was yet there with his
men, the way by the Mountain <hi>Giavenna</hi> was very narrow and hard to
passe; so as two Brigadoes being already past over, the rest remained yet in
the plain, in danger of being routed if they should be assaulted, for that they
could not well be succour'd by those that were already past. The Prince thought
it not fit to let slip this occasion, but without tarrying for more of his men,
who were not above a mile off, would fall upon them with those that he had
ready, hoping that they would suffice to get the victory; He had with him about
5000 Dutch, two of the Princes Troops of Horse, and <hi>Doria</hi>'s six
Companies which were new men unexperienced, and were not above 300 Horse; The
French reere which remained in the plain, was 3000 Foot, and about 400 Horse,

Dutch, in a close Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>aglione, and
with the Prince his Troops of Horse, by the other the Prince himself in person,
with the rest of the Dutch commanded by <hi>Gallasso,</hi> and with
<hi>Doria</hi>'s Horse. The skirmish being begun, <hi>Momorancy</hi> divided
his Horse into two squadrons, and took a little compasse upon the left hand
towards a neighbouring Town called S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Ambrosio,</hi> which led to the way
of the Hill: The Prince conceiving that the French fled, and would climbe the
Mountain by that way and get into a place of safety, or recover <hi>Susa,</hi>
ordered <hi>Doria</hi> to fall upon them with his Horse, and <hi>Gallaso</hi>
that he should send 200 Muketiers to back <hi>Doria</hi>'s Horse; The Muketiers
went not, either for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion into which <hi>Gallasso</hi> fell, or for
that he would not lessen his squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron: so as <hi>Doria</hi> fought
<hi>Momorancy</hi> without his Musketiers, and fought very stoutly, with an
equal number of Horse, but upon great disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, for that both he and his
Horse were new men unexperienced, and guided for the most part by Leiutenants;
whereas the French were veterane Souldiers, choice men, and commanded by
<hi>Momorancy,</hi> a Commander of approved and try'd Valour: so as two of
<hi>Doria</hi>'s Troops running away at the very first encounter, the rest were
presently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, and <hi>Doria</hi> having received many wounds was taken
Prisoner, together with Captain <hi>Robustelli,</hi> who was shot with two
pistol bullets. <hi>Rainero Guasco,</hi> Captain of the Carabines, who fell on
first, escaped, but was sorely wounded: The Dutch that were on that side, when
they saw the Horse run, threw away their Armes, and fled out-right without
fighting, though the Prince did all he could to stop them: The other Battaglion
which marched on the other side, fought valianly, and slew many of the Enemy,
chasing them for a while; and had they been assisted by the other squadron,
they would assuredly have got the victory; But seeing their companions run
away, they also retreated to their quarters at <hi>Avigliana,</hi> and left the
French free to pursue their journey: So as though all the rest of the Princes
Army were now come in, yet the French having already mounted the Hills, and it
being therefore impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to pursue them, he forbore to do it. There dyed on
the Prince <pb n="429" facs="tcp:53250:222"/> his side about 500, and about 400 were taken
Prisoners and wounded; 400 were wounded and slain of the French; and the Prince
lost 10 Dutch Colours, and one Corner of Horse: Being come to
<hi>Pinarollo,</hi> they found it as hard to get to <hi>Casalle</hi> by that
way; for the Duke, to whom many of those were returned from <hi>Avigliana</hi>
who were sent thither at the coming of the French, coming into the field,
coasted continually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long by them on the Plain within 3 miles, to keep them
from victuals as much as he could; for being hindred from getting any by the
way of the Valley, they could get but very little by the way of the Mountains,
and from <hi>Dolpheny</hi> or <hi>France</hi> very few were sent them; so as
what by Famine, what by Pestilence, they were much lessened: Wherefore desirous
to get out of these streights, and to come into a more fruitful Countrey, (for
they saw it was impossible for them to get to <hi>Casalle</hi> without passing
over the <hi>Poe,</hi> and it was as impossible for them to pass the
<hi>Poe,</hi> being therein opposed by the Duke) they turned towards the
Marquisate of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> where they knew they might have store of
vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, where they might have conveniency to refresh their wearied Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and which had suffer'd much by Famine and Sickness; and where they knew they
might pass over the <hi>Poe,</hi> which takes its beginning from thence, almost
dry-foot, and without any opposition. They therefore came to <hi>Ravell,</hi> a
Town in that Marquisate, where passing over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they went directly to
<hi>Saluzzo:</hi> The Town yielded immediately, and sent them the Keys of the
Gates, that they might get the better conditions: When they were come in, they
found very good Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and refreshments of all sorts. They came afterwards
before the Castle, whither the Duke had sent 300 Foot but a little before under
Cavalier <hi>Balbiano,</hi> which was within three days surrendred to them;
whereat the Duke was much grieved, not being able to endure that that Town
should be taken from him before his eyes, and his Army looking on. The Duke
also past over the <hi>Poe</hi> afterwards, and went with his Army to
<hi>Savigliano,</hi> fearing to lose that place also, which though it were weak
and open was yet of concernment; for not being above 15 miles off, and seated
diametrically opposite to <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> as <hi>Pancareli</hi> to
<hi>Pinarollo,</hi> so was <hi>Savigliano</hi> a fit place from whence to
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the moving of the Army which was lodged in <hi>Saluzzo.</hi> The Duke
was sufficiently ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>led at the
loss of so many Towns, and at the receiving of so many blows on both sides of
the Mountains; and being desirous to vent his anger in a battle, he sought all
occasions to do it; for examining well his own and his Enemies Forces, though
he came somewhat short of them in Foot, yet was he stronger in Horse, which was
no little advantage for the Victory upon the Plain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spinola</hi> heard of the Dukes intention, who fearing the
success, and the prejudice which in such a case might redound to the Enterprize
of <hi>Casalle,</hi> he strove by reasons and by perswasions, and with
protesting that he would recall the Kings men, to remove from that resolution:
He bad him consider, that the men which he had sent him to defend
<hi>Piedmont</hi> were the Garrison of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and the
safety of the Kings Dominions; that they were granted him, to the end that he
might by them encamp, and face the French till he might recover his Towns, and
to block up the way to all relief, and not that he should <pb n="430" facs="tcp:53250:223"/> adventure them in a battle: That therefore he should forbear till
the business of <hi>Casalle</hi> were fully perfected; and that then he himself
would concur with all his men in recovery of the Towns that were lost, and in
the entire freeing of <hi>Piedmont</hi> from the French. The affairs of
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and of <hi>Casalle</hi> were reduced to this condition; and
to this point was the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> brought; so as to boot with seeing
part of his Territories lost, part of them incumber'd by the Spanish Army, he
was put to wage War in his own Dominions, not as a Prince or Ruler of the
Militia, but as a Captain at the will of others; and to back the taking of
<hi>Casalle,</hi> contrary to his own Interest, with the evident loss of so
much of his State, and with the danger of his own person; when having long
disputed with himself touching the business of <hi>Casalle,</hi> he had
designed (whilest he should be the Arbitrator of Affairs, as he thought to have
been) to handle the business so as without him no peace should be made. These
were the acquisitions hoped for by the present War, this the arbitrement
pretended unto between the two Crowns at the beginning of the War. These
distastes, and some other high carriages in <hi>Spinola</hi> did daily adde to
the Dukes disgusts, who was wonted to wage War according as he listed, and
being impatient to be govern'd by the Spanish Agents, to shew his resentment
against which he had not forborn to draw upon him the anger of that Crown; nor
had he stuck to provoke the anger of <hi>France,</hi> that he might resent the
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s strange and severe Proceedings against him and
his Son; and therefore it was conceived by many conjectures, that sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maching
these rigorous dealings, he was inclined to close with the French; and his
chief Captains and Officers were often heard to say, that their Prince had lost
too much in serving the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that he ought to think how
he might recover himself; that <hi>Piedmont</hi> was ruin'd, as not being able
to maintain so many Armies; that the loss of <hi>Casalle</hi> made not for the
Dukes Interest; and that therefore it was necessary to close with the French,
who had offer'd him great and advantagious conditions, if <hi>Casalle</hi>
might be preserved: to this was added, that amidst all these molestations of
the two Crowns, it was sufficient for the Duke to keep his Towns, and to Munite
them well with Garrisons; and that his betaking himself to the Field was only
to please <hi>Spinola;</hi> and <hi>Massarine</hi> being at this time come from
<hi>France</hi> with new Proposals, the Prince was heard to say, that the
French began to do reason: so as the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Commanders, whose
ears were continually fill'd with these reproaches, began to mistrust the Duke,
and to fear lest he might make an Agreement, not unlike to that of
<hi>Susa:</hi> but the news which was divulg'd throughout the Camp and all
<hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Wallesteins</hi> approaching, and that he would shortly
appear in <hi>Italy</hi> with a powerful Army; the taking of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
which soon after hapned; and chiefly the Dukes death, which succeeded not long
after, freed the Spaniards from these suspicions; whereof they might have been
secure enough by the aversion which had been formerly between
<hi>Richelieu</hi> and the Duke: but as for <hi>Wallesteins</hi> coming, though
he had earnestly desired to en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

armed into <hi>Italy,</hi> and to wage War there like another <hi>Totila,</hi>
and had much importuned the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> to that purpose, without
whose consent the Emperour would not give way <pb n="431" facs="tcp:53250:223"/> thereunto,
and offered his best service to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> for the
preservation and encrease of his Majesties Power and Authority, against the
Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> hoping to be as succesful therein as he had been
to the Emperour and House of <hi>Austria</hi> in <hi>Germany;</hi> yet the King
and Court foreseeing the ruine which this mans fierce nature threatned to
<hi>Italy,</hi> and abhorring to have their Authority increased by laying
<hi>Italy</hi> waste, and by so much shedding of Italian blood; but fearing
much more that his Authority would rather be suffocated then sublevated, by
introducing so many Forces into <hi>Italy,</hi> they would never yield
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who by secret Intelligence (as it
was thought) held with <hi>Wallestine,</hi> and for the emulation and
contentions which he foresaw would arise between him and <hi>Spinola,</hi> and
who hoped to have occasion to put in practice his plots which he had contrived
with <hi>Wallestine,</hi> being prevented by death, failed the witnessing his
being displeased with the present Affairs.</p>
            <p>At the same time the business of <hi>Mantua</hi> proceeded more
fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Imperialists; who, after having had the better in some
Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, had the fortune to
surprise the City, and to make themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of it. The Cesarian Army had

Victuals and provisions from b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

brought thither; but the Spring coming on, it afflicted the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged in
several manners, and brought them into great streights. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers</hi> was
aware that the Dutch having abandoned <hi>Rodigo,</hi> had fortified themselves
in <hi>Goito,</hi> a place not far from <hi>Rodigo;</hi> and cosidering, that
if he could take that place and fortifie it, it would be a very fit place to
exclude Commerce between <hi>Goito</hi> and the Dutch Quarters, which were in
<hi>Gozzoldo,</hi> and that consequently <hi>Goito</hi> not being to be
relieved, he might easily recover it: He sent five hundred of his best
Souldiers thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who, entring <hi>Rodigo</hi> without any opposition, began
to fortifie it; but this business proved prejudicial to the Mantuans; for
<hi>Galasso</hi> going thither with a good strength of men, and having first
furnish'd <hi>Goito</hi> with vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the Kings men in <hi>Rivolta,</hi> he came with 200 Horse, and about 800 of his
best Foot Souldiers, to <hi>Rodigo,</hi> and having first possess'd himself of
all the parts thereabouts, he tried whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Defendants would surrender or
no, who coming to parley, and finding it impossible to defend the place, and
despairing to be relieved, (for some Barques coming from <hi>Mantua</hi> with
Souldiers, and some Troops of Horse which were to have assisted them, were with
much loss repuls'd by those that were left in <hi>Rivolta)</hi> they were
forced to surrender upon sad conditions, all o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The Mantuans had the like fortune, who in great numbers were led
on by the two Marquesses <hi>Alfonso Guerriero</hi> and <hi>Carlo de

Serravalle,</hi> from whence, and from a Tower not far off, some of his party
were much <pb n="432" facs="tcp:53250:224"/> Prejudiced, he, from some of the neighbouring
houses which he took annoy'd those that were in the Trenches with his Musket
shot; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving sent some of his men to cut off the way from the Defendants,
they, fearing to be inclosed, forsook the Trench, and fled towards
<hi>Hostiglia,</hi> and elswhere; but being pursued by the Dutch, many of them
were slain; which being known by them who were before <hi>Hostiglia,</hi> they
likewise gave over the Siege, and fled away with like fortune: For being
pursued by those who were in <hi>Hostiglia,</hi> and by some other Dutch, who,
crossing the <hi>Poe,</hi> came from <hi>Rovere</hi> to aid them, 300 of them
were slain, and <hi>Guerriero</hi> and <hi>Rossi</hi> were wounded; and the
Quarters about <hi>Hostiglia</hi> were not only freed from danger, but better
secured by new Fortifications and Garrisons: He went from thence to
<hi>Serravalle,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and in some houses thereabouts, were many
Souldiers; and because it was hard to take it, nor could it be done without
loss of men; by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of its so strong scituation, which incouraged the
Defendants to hold out, it was resolved to set it on fire, whereby many of the
Defendants perished; and those who escaped the fire fell into the hands of the
Dutch, and were forthwith slain.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> having lost many of his men by these
misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, and by the Pestilence, which encreased much in <hi>Mantua;</hi>
and the affairs of that City being daily reduced to greater streights, the
Siege still continuing, though at a distance, the Defendants began to distrust
their safety; and those likewise did distrust it to whom the loss of that City
would prove as prejudicial. The Venetians, to whom it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sustain it
more then any others, had at first been very forward in imploying all their
Forces to defend it; but their succours proving as yet not answerable to the
others necessities, or their promises, they had afforded sinister, discourses
of their intentions: Some alotted the slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness of their supplies to the
difficulty of introducing them; others, to their backwardness; many, to that
they did not desire to declare themselves openly, and contrary to the Emperour,
of whose greatness they were still jealous, and had great reason to apprehend
it; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, to more hidden and malign ends, of reducing that Duke into a
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of throwing himself into their Arms, and of yielding up that City to
the Commonwealth, if, not being able to hold it, he should be necessitated to
yield it to the Enemy. <hi>Nevers</hi> complained much here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and the
Embassadour of <hi>France,</hi> then Resident in <hi>Venice,</hi> no less then
he; and threatned, That if the Commonwealth should proceed so cooly on her
part, his King also, who was less concerned in the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi>
then they, would do the like in <hi>Cassalle</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and
would leave them both to the pleasure of the Spaniard. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth being

sent thither with his Brigade; and that of <hi>Marengo</hi> by <hi>la

followed the Croats, the Venetians wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, and were pursued to their
Trenches, where the Souldiers that guarded them, being afraid, began to run;
but being rallied by their Captains, and made to take their former stations,
they did a while withstand the Dutch, who strove thrice, but in vain, to gain

the Field and fought; but not being able to withstand the Dutch, and being
gauled by Musketiers, which the Dutch had placed in some little houses hard by,
they likewise ran away to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the Ditches of <hi>Valleggio,</hi> where
being defended by the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, which held the enemy a while at a distance, they
secured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; the rest who were in <hi>Vallegg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend their own men, nor to enter into the Fight, nor to defend the Towns
which were taken whilst they looked on, and were plunder'd, with great
slaughter of the Inhabitants: the Dutch were quarter'd a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle way off, and
stood all night within sight of <hi>Valleggio,</hi> inviting the enemy to
fight, who withdrawing their men into their houses, dreamed not of coming
forth, but looking to be assaulted in their own Quarters placed their Souldiers
to defend their Rampiers: but the Captains fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they should not be able to
make the place good, by reason of the cowardize and fear which they discover'd
in their Souldiers counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, they resolved to abandon the Town; which
whilst they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to do without confusion, and in good order, and had
given fitting directions to that purpose; the Souldiers had hardly notice
thereof, when being surprised with greater fear then formerly, they began to
run away in greater fear and disorder then they had done the day before: no
commands of their Captains being able to stay them, they all fled to
<hi>Peschiera</hi> and <hi>Gallasso,</hi> who had expected all night, and till
four hours after Sun-rising the next morning, that they should sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out,
began to distrust: he had precise Orders from the Emperour, not to enter or
indamage the State of <hi>Venice;</hi> wherefore not thinking to assault the
enemy in that station, lest he thereby should disobey the Emperours command, he
thought to turn upon <hi>Mormirvolo,</hi> whither he heard that 3000 of the
Commonwealths Souldiers were gone: but finding by the firing of the Ammunition
in <hi>Valleggio,</hi> that the enemy had abandoned the Town, he altered his
mind, and return'd upon <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leggio;</hi> whither being come, and finding it
forsaken, he fell immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

pursue the enemy, and advanced a little towards <hi>Peschiera:</hi> before he
was come half way, he got to the Reer, which was led on by <hi>Candale,</hi>
wherein most French were; and after that <hi>Candale</hi> had fought, and made
some resistance, at last, being forsaken by his men, part where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of yielded,
part fled, he was forced to retreat with the rest; some of which got to
<hi>Peschiera,</hi> part to <hi>Castel nuovo,</hi> and others to
<hi>Garda,</hi> strong Towns of the Venetians, &amp; were no further pursued by
the Dutch: about 4000 Venetian Souldiers died in this conflict;
<hi>Gallasso</hi> sent 26 Colours (four of which bore the French Lillies) and
three Coronets of Curassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to <hi>Colalto,</hi> who lay sick in
<hi>Marignano,</hi> upon the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the number of those that were slain and wounded on the Dutch side amounted not
to 400, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which the Serjeant-major to <hi>Frederick,</hi> of
<hi>Saxony;</hi> great was the <pb n="435" facs="tcp:53250:225"/> reputation of the Dutch,
after this success, answerable to the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression into which the
Venetians fell; upon which almost all the hopes of the Mantuans depending, were
totally lost; and there not being any in the field who could defend that City,
her condition was thought to be sad; her safety being reduced to this point,
whether the besieged or besiegers could longer suffer or resist the hardships
of the Siege; for the former had no hopes of relief, nor courage to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ree themselves; nor had the
others hopes of taking the City, or of ending their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, by reason
of the Cities strong situation; Famine, Pestilence and Military actions had
reduced the defendants to so small a number, as they had not enough to supply
the Guards of the City; there was no good intelligence between the Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi> and the Venetian Resident. The Duke required many things, and
the Resident limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting many of the demands, and of the needs that the City was
in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated them to the Commonwealth much lesser then they were; so as the
Commonwealth did not sufficiently provide for the urgent extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of the
City: it was therefore necessary to give over much of the defence; which the
enemy perceiving, and minding their business, they watched all occasions to
make themselves masters of the ill guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and worse provided City, and to end
their enterprise by surprisal, wherein they had good success; for having caused
six Barques to be brought upon Carts from the greater <hi>Casalle,</hi> a Town
in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> to St. <hi>Georgio,</hi> they put them into
the Lake, and put some fourscore Souldiers into them; which making a little
before Sun-rising towards the Gate of the Castle which answers upon S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

being had by reason of the water, there was but little or no guard kept; and an
assault being furiously given at the same time on the opposite part of the
City, the Souldiers in the Barques clap'd a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ard to the Castle Gate, which being ill kept and worse
defended, was soon beaten down and master'd; where whilst they were fortifying
St. <hi>George</hi> his Bridge, which (as it hath been said) was cut in sunder
in the midst, was cross'd over by great Planks, brought to that purpuse, over
which the Dutch Horse pass'd, and entred by the Gate which was opened, and
possess'd but a little before, meeting with no resistance: the Dukes Palace was
presently taken, which was neer that Gate, and as rich formerly in Jewels and
Houshold-stuff, as any other Princes Palace in <hi>Italy;</hi> though for some
late years the continual wars had wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted much of her precious things: what was
left was sack'd, together with the whole City: the Princess got into the Fort
<hi>di Porto,</hi> whither the Princess <hi>Mary</hi> was forc'd to fly with
her tender Babe; the assault gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven lasted till the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> hour; but the
defendants yielding at the last, who heard that the Dutch were entred on the
other side, were pursued by the assailants, to the Church of St.
<hi>Agnese;</hi> and those who could get into the same <hi>Porto;</hi> which
when they saw the City lost, they strove to make good by some works which they
made toward the City; but wanting both Counsel and Provisions, and the
defendants being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, they listned willingly to Articles of Agreement,
which were quickly propounded by the Dutch, who were desirous to compleat the
enterprise: which Articles being agreed upon, the Fort was delivered up to the
Imperialists. The Duke and his Son, with some of their fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,

matter for a Tragical Poem rather, then for an Historical relation: it was
really a miserable thing, and much to be compassionated, and of great
consideration, that that City which was by reason of its situation thought
impregnable, and by experience <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

before) should fall into the hands of the oppugners within less then one year.
This loss was very ill resented by the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> who had not
much endeavoured to defend it, by reason of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Forreigners
that were then in <hi>Italy:</hi> nay, it became odious to to the Spaniards,
who had so much endeavour'd it, and been at such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in fomenting it; by
reason of the concurrence of authority and precedency of place: the news
thereof coming to <hi>Casalle</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> did equally afflict
both the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Spinola:</hi> the latter not so much
for his Kings Interests, for which it made not that the Dutch should get so
much footing in <hi>Italy,</hi> as for the emulation he bore to
<hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latto;</hi> who proving more successful in what he took in hand, then
he had done: he much maligned that fortune should be so favourable to him in a
much harder business then that of <hi>Casalle;</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> for that judging that the fury of the Forreigners would turn
upon <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> he foresaw that his State, by becoming the seat o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

ever to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain again to his former condition and grandezza, he fell mortally

            <p>THe death of the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> proved not so great an
alteration to the main of Affairs, by his being succeeded by his Son, who was
now almost 40 years old; bred up in his Fathers School, a great Prince, and
gallant Commander: so as being instructed by so excellent a Master in the Art
both of War and Peace, none doubted but that he would equal his Father in both;
and being knowing and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Affair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

having for many years being vers'd in publick affairs, as well Civil as
Military; the Principality seemed not to be any thing changed by this new
succession, but to be continued in the successor; and his contrary conditions
to Duke <hi>Emanuel</hi> afforded better hopes of peace and concord; for
instead of the hatred born by the Agents of both the Crowns to the deceased
Duke; in his Son the strict bond of Affinity with the King of <hi>France</hi>
was to be considered, and of Consa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity with the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> so as it was to be
believed, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer would not easily consent to the depression of his
Sisters Husband, which drew along with it inseparably the like of his Sister:
nor that the other would refuse any thing which might make for the good of a
Prince annex'd to him both in blood and Interest; and yet as Councils of State
which give motion to all things, and whereby Princes govern themselves, do not
contract Parentage, it was ere long known, how weak curbs Kindred or
Conjunction in Blood are, to hold back the force of Domination, and the desire
of enlarging Confines, and of bettering the condition of Principality.</p>
            <p>The French having pass'd over the <hi>Poe,</hi> and refresh'd
themselves in <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> could not go to the relief of <hi>Casalle</hi>
by that way, neither by reason of the enemies Army which was quarter'd in
<hi>Savigliano;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they resolved to repass back again over the

they incamped under <hi>Ravil;</hi> but finding it to be too strong they
tarried not long there, but returned to <hi>Pinarollo;</hi> and finding the
Towns of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> for the most part desolate and void of Inhabitants,
by the Plague; and that the new Dukes Army was quarter'd in
<hi>Savigliano,</hi> beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> they fell down upon <hi>Vigone,
Villa franca,</hi> and <hi>Villa nuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> and upon other Towns which lay
lower; and taking them without any resistance, they came to <hi>Pancaleri;</hi>
where they took up the same Quarters, and lodged in the same Fortifications,
wherein the Duke had incamped a little before against them: they then had a
mind to take <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rignano,</hi> which lay a little lower within two
Musket-shot of the <hi>Poe,</hi> 
               <pb n="440" facs="tcp:53250:228"/> where the woodden
Bridge was, indeavouring to pass by that way to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle;</hi> they
therefore sent some of their Horse, under Mounsieur <hi>De la Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moville,</hi>
to <hi>Corignano,</hi> where taking a strong house which served for a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
they advanced to the Bridge. Duke <hi>Victorio</hi> being aware of their ends,
came out of <hi>Savigliano,</hi> and marching with his Army on the hither bank,
he made two companies of Carabines advance, that they might come the sooner to
the Bridge, which got thither just at the same time that the French were come
neer, the outer-more head of the Bridge; and lighting off Horse back they
placed themselves to defend it: And the French lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Commander with a
Troop of Horse in <hi>Carignano,</hi> retreated to <hi>Pancaleri:</hi> The
Spanish Horse came the same night to the Bridge, which the Carabines defended,
and the next day the Duke coming thither with his Army, quartered upon the bank
opposite to <hi>Carignano,</hi> keeping the Bridge in his poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

other side towards <hi>Carignano,</hi> so as the Duke might open the way to his
men, and keep it shut from the Enemy. About 4000 Dutch were to come to
<hi>Avigliana</hi> under <hi>Count Verrua;</hi> by which recruit the Duke
became stronger, he would not refuse to fight the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, but resolved to
quarter on the other side of the <hi>Poe,</hi> that he might be neerer them; to
the which purpose he sent 500 hundred Foot, and a peece of Cannon, under the
Camp-Master <hi>Luigi Ponse</hi> a Spaniard, to recover <hi>Carignano;</hi>
after the which he sent <hi>Gerardo Gambacorti</hi> with 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>0 Horse, to the end that coming to the Capuchins place
they might shelter the 500 foot busied in the taking of <hi>Carignano,</hi> and
might also back the Dutch who were to come to <hi>Avigliano</hi> without any
convoy of Horse, to the Camp. <hi>Ponse</hi> went with his men to force
<hi>Carignano;</hi> and whilst he was hottest in the business,
<hi>Gambacorti</hi> who found that the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour was come, he left a company of

               </gap>towards
<hi>Pancaleri;</hi> where meeting with the Enemies Van led on by Marquis
<hi>Diffiate,</hi> he began a stout skirmish, at the beginning whereof
<hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacorti</hi> sent to the Duke to advance with the whole Army, or that

would come neither that day, nor by that way; but answered, that he would not
advance with the Army, but wish'd him to entertaine the Enemy, till the Cannon
were withdrawn; The conflict lasted four hours, wherein the French increasing
in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Gambacorti</hi> to the Port-cullis of <hi>Carignano,</hi> where by reason
of the narrownesse of the place he could hardly have retreated without
disorder, had he not been seasonably succour'd by <hi>Martin d' Aragona,</hi>
who was sent to him by the Duke with 400 Spanish Musketiers; so as being
incouraged by this new recruit, the French were easily repressed; who thinking
that the Enemies whole Army had past over the River, together with the recruit,
were slacker in their pursuit, and afforded conven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ence to <hi>Gambacorti,</hi> and to <hi>Don Martin</hi>
of <hi>Aragon,</hi> to retreat back in good order by the Bridge, all the Cannon
and Foot which were gon to the taking of <hi>Carignano</hi> being drawn off
before them. The numbers that dyed in this conflict were equal on both sides;
the Duke of <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muglia</hi> 
               <pb n="441" facs="tcp:53250:228"/> received a sore wound in
the knee, by a Musket-shot, and a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Horse was also sorely wounded;
the French quarter'd in <hi>Carig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano,</hi> and the Duke on the opposite
shore, observing one anothers wayes, and expecting another occasion for action,
which it was not long ere it presented it self very singularly for the French.
For the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impatient to tarry on this side the <hi>Poe,</hi> and not
being contented with his being fenc'd by the water, had a desire to go to the
opposite shore, and to fortifie the head of the Bridge towards
<hi>Carignano;</hi> the businesse being argued, met with variety of opinions;
as for the new Fortification, it was considered, that by making it the Enemies
army would be in a manner besieged, for it would be forced by the Garrison of
that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification to live closer and more united, and would consequently find
greater scarcity of Victuals and Forrage: And in case it should go to
<hi>Turin,</hi> as it was feared it would, or would attempt going to
<hi>Casalle</hi> by the <hi>Canevese,</hi> they might the easilier keep behind
them, hinder their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and
oppose all their attempts. On the contrary it was said, that the fitter, and
more opportune the fortification should be, the harder and more dangerous it
would be to begin it, and bring it to perfection, by reason of the Enemies
being quartered so neer in <hi>Carignano;</hi> who, were it only for
Reputations sake, could not possibly suffer that fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be made
under their no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es. Moreover, that
the intended work being divided, and separated by the water from the Army, it
would be hard to succour it; that therefore being content to keep the Bridge in
their power, which afforded them sufficient convenience to keep behind any
motion of the Enemy, they should make use of the safety that the River afforded
them, against whatsoever the French should do. The contrary opinion prevailed
for fortifying, which was thus devised; that a half Moon should be made on the
head of the Bridge towards <hi>Carignano,</hi> which should be flank'd on both
sides, which were to be made on a little Island which the <hi>Poe</hi> makes
nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the banks; the care of the
half Moon was committed to the Spaniards, and the trench on the right hand to
the Dutch, and that on the left to the Italians; and they were all ordered,
that if the Enemy should assault them before they were fortified, they should
retreat by the Bridge without making any resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; if after they were
fortified, that they should<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> defend themselves. They wrought two days
quietly in their works, without being troubled by the French, who did but laugh
at them; but considering the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence better afterwards, and knowing what
prejudice it would occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion when it should be perfected, especially if they
should be inforced to remove from where they were; They sent for a good
strength of men from <hi>Pancaleri,</hi> and sallied on the sudden forcibly
from <hi>Carignano,</hi> to distribute them whilst the work was imperfect; 1200
of the best and bravest French gave the first furious assault, the Dutch making
but bad resistance, those very same who behaved themselves so bravely in the
conflict at <hi>Avigliana,</hi> began to quit their stations and fled, without
almost striking a stroke; so as the half Moon which lay open on that side,
after a long and valiant resistance, was lost, together with many men.
Whereupon, the other Trench made by the Italians, who were not able to
withstand the brunt, was also abandoned; nor could the Duke send any to succour
them though he endeavoured it: For the Bridge being <pb n="442" facs="tcp:53250:229"/> too
narrow to passe over many a-brest, the succour was too slender for such an
assault; nay, the confusion of those that came in to succour was prejudicial to
themselves: for thronging together upon the Bridge, many of them fell into the
water and were drowned; those that dyed and were drown'd, on the Dukes side,
were 500 foot; those of quality that were slain, were <hi>Don Alphonso
Swasso,</hi> Leiutenant to the Camp-Master General, and some Foot Captaines;
<hi>Don Martin d'Aragona,</hi> after given great trial of his Valour, was sore
wounded and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, Camp-Master <hi>Nicolo Doria,</hi> being shot by a
Musket, dyed soon after, 200 of the French were slain, and yet both sides were
equally affraid, for each party cut the Bridge in two on their side; The French
feared another better regulated assault, being very weak, and having lost many
men; and hearing that the whole body of the Dutch who were before
<hi>Mantua,</hi> was come to the Enemies Camp: And the Duke that the French
passing over the Bridge in the heat of victory, might cause great disturbance
in the Camp, which was full of fear and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Thus both of them being
divided by the River, both of them were Masters of the Field; the French, on
that side the <hi>Poe</hi> which was towards the <hi>Alps,</hi> the Duke, on
that side which lay towards <hi>Casalle;</hi> the Armies increased almost at
the same time; for <hi>Collalto</hi> having taken <hi>Mantua</hi> came into
<hi>Piedmont</hi> with 8000 Foot, and 1500 Hose, under Marshal
<hi>Scomberg,</hi> who being to passe thorow the vally of <hi>Susa,</hi>
Marshal <hi>De la Force,</hi> and <hi>Momorancy,</hi> after having tarried ten
or twelve dayes in <hi>Carignano,</hi> and having well refresh'd their men with
the victuals which they found there, went towards that valley to encounter
them; and the Duke, when they weregon, quitted his quarters, and took up new
between <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Moncaleri:</hi> and having sent 2000 Foot to
defend <hi>Turin,</hi> he betook himself to defend the stone Bridge, which was
built over the <hi>Poe,</hi> neer <hi>Moncaleri,</hi> quartering 2000 Foot upon
the Hill which overlook'd the Bridge on <hi>Moncaleri</hi>'s side. When the
French Army was come to <hi>Viola,</hi> it heard that <hi>Scomberg</hi> being
come with new Forces from France had taken <hi>Avigliana,</hi> whereinto he
entred without any opposition, finding it infected with the Plague and void of
inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, as many other Towns in <hi>Piedmont</hi> were; he came before the
Castle, which trusting to the strength of its scituation, stood upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
though the Plague was got amongst the garrison, and though the Castle was onely
fortified after the ancient manner; the Duke would have advanced to relieve the
Castle, but he was perswaded to the contrary by <hi>Collalto,</hi> who was not
naturally given to love danger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Collalto</hi> foresaw, that by going
to relieve the Castle they might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance come to a battle, wherein the Dukes
men being discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by the unfortunate successe of the two last actions,
would not have behaved themselves better then before, and ruine depending upon
the loss, he thought it would not be wisely done, to adventure the main
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nment upon a battle. So the
Castle wanting relief, and more streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for want of water, then by the
Enemy, it fell into the hands of the French. This acquisition opened the way
for the French into the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revesa</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Cassalle;</hi> and it was not unlikely but that they might easily passe
over the <hi>Poe</hi> over against that City, where being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the shelter of
the Cannon of that pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ce, and
joyning with the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison <pb n="443" facs="tcp:53250:229"/> which was there, they might
easily pass the foord, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently relieve <hi>Casalle:</hi> which the
Duke apprehending, he sent <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacorti</hi> with 400 Horse into the
Canevese, to the end, that passing over <hi>la Dora,</hi> they might master
that way; and Marquess <hi>Spinola,</hi> fearing the danger, munited the bank
of <hi>Poe</hi> with a double Trench, the one against the River, the other
against the City and Citadel, before which they wrought continually, bringing
on their approaches; insomuch as the Spaniards, to whose share the taking of
the Bulwark of <hi>San' Croce</hi> fell, were advanc'd so far as they were
ready to fall into the Ditch, and attempted the Wall; and when by the strong
oppugning and by the scarcity of Victuals, the Town was not likely to hold out
long, the Siege, defence and succour, were delaied by a Treaty of Truce, which
being formerly begun, was not long after perfected; and that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and
progress of this Treaty of Truce, and of another Negotiation of Peace which was
at this time very hotly handled, and not long after concluded in the Diet at
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> may be the better known, it will be necessary to take the
business a little higher.</p>
            <p>The Electors not being content to have made the Emperour lay down
his Arms, by cashiering <hi>Wallestein,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Fritland,</hi> and
by dissolving that Army which was so formidable to all <hi>Germany:</hi> they
demanded that some order might be taken about the setling of the affairs of
<hi>Italy,</hi> especially those of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat:</hi>
they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nested this their demand with the justice of <hi>Nevers</hi> his cause,
who, as they said, was not to be put out of possession of his Dominions
unheard: th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y said likewise, that
it was a great prejudice to the jurisdiction of the Empire, that the Spaniards,
under the name and authority of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, should bereave a Vassall of the
Empire of those States; to make themselves masters thereof; for if they should
fall into their hands, it would be hard to exercise the Cesarean authority
against them, and they would hardly be brought to acknowledge that they held
them as in Fee from the Empire: they likewise complain'd that Armies were sent
into <hi>Italy</hi> without their knowledge or consent; alledging that this was
contrary to the ancient institutions of the Sacred Empire, which they publickly
said were broken and violated, as well in this, as in many other things: they
tacitely reproved him for having by the Cesarean Arms and Authority assisted
the rather violent then just ends of the Spanish Agents, against a Vassal who
was ready to acknowledge that he held those States from <hi>Cesar,</hi> and did
with all submission desire to be invested thereinto: they exaggerated the
strange consequences which would result to <hi>Germany</hi> from these
commotions; for the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Italy,</hi>
being desirous for their own safety sake to maintain those States, and that
Duke, though they could not directly oppose the Cesarean and Spanish Forces in
his defence, did notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hold intelligence together, and did assist
the German Princes underhand, who were desirous of novelties, that they might
alienate themselves from the Emperour, and incite the people against him; and
that they did also administer aid to the King of <hi>Swedland,</hi> to the end,
that the Emperours Forces being held play in <hi>Germany,</hi> might not foment
the Spaniards in <hi>Italy:</hi> they persisted the more confidently in these
their complaints, for that they saw the Emperour unarmed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:53250:230"/> themselves favoured, and set on by the King of
<hi>France,</hi> with whom they held strict and secret Intelligence. That King
had sent Monsieur <hi>Leon,</hi> Embassadour to the Diet, to justifie in
appearance his assisting a Vassal of the Sacred Empire, against the Spaniards,
who under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of the Sacred Empire, strove to oppress him, and to
possess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of his Dominions, to make way for the Monarchy of
<hi>Italy,</hi> which they so much coveted: but in effect to sollicite the
Electors and Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> who were ill satisfied with the
present condition of affairs, and to encourage them to joyn in beating down the
Austrian greatness, and to favour the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> his cause; which
the Pope did also favour, who was ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to the end, that by excluding the Spaniards from thence, <hi>Italy</hi> might
not hazard the loss of Liberty: but he chiefly favoured the emulation which all

which the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Agents arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

pretending to be above all, they seemed as if they would govern the affairs of
<hi>Germany</hi> as they listed; and the Emperour as well for his conjunction
in interest, as for his necessity of being supplied with moneys, was forc'd to
adhere unto them: which the Germans not being able to tolerate, they did oppose
their ends and interests: so as under colour of the justice of <hi>Nevers</hi>
his cause, and of preserving the rights of the German Empire, they cross'd the
Emperor in this very cause, and would maintain it against the Spanish Agents,
who endeavoured to suffocate it by power in <hi>Cesars</hi> Court, as they did
to oppress it by Arms in <hi>Italy:</hi> wherefore they reiterated their former
Protestations, not to joyn in the defence of the war made by the King of
<hi>Swedland,</hi> whose actions increasing in fame and reputation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to
make men bethink themselves. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> also and
<hi>Collalto</hi> fomented the speedy conclusion of the peace, who both of them
writ to that Diet, and told the Emperour and the Electors, that
<hi>Piedmont</hi> could no longer maintain the war; whose affairs running
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest ruine, the Duke was forced either to succumb to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> or to agree with him: if either of which should happen, all
things would necessarily be ruined. The Emperour, who had no Forces on foot,
and saw such an aversion in the Electors, and in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Princes to the
wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> being scandalized at the unjust proceedings against
<hi>Nevers;</hi> the Emperour being also touched in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, and desirous
of his Sons election, for which he had already given way to much greater
things, easily consented to all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires: many things were therefore
treated of, many things pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and neer concluding, in favour to the Duke
of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and to the great prejudice of the Spanish pretensions. Don
<hi>Carlo Doria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Turcis,</hi> was then Embassadour in
extraordinary from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Ratisbone:</hi> being
sent to that Diet to further the Election of the King of the Romans, in the
person of the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> Son to the Emperour, married at this
time to <hi>Mary, Sister</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> but this Election
not being to be treated of in this Diet, because it was not in imated therein,
as was necessary by the Laws of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and for that the Electors of
<hi>Saxony</hi> and of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> (disgusted by the Emperour, and
almost quite alienated from him) were neither <pb n="445" facs="tcp:53250:230"/> come
thither, nor had sent their Proctories thither: And after Orders taken in the
Diet for the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> and of the Empire, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations
were reduced to the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> and particularly, to the Duke of
<hi>Nevers</hi> his Cause.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doria,</hi> who saw upon what disadvantagious terms the Peace
was treated on for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and how far the French prevailed
by the help and Intelligence held by the Electors; and that the Emperour being
forced by the leudness of the Times, and of his own Interests, could not govern
his pretensions as he would have done, but was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to incline towards
giving them satisfaction, even much to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his own Affairs; he
earnestly desired, and obtained it, That he not being sent to Treat of Peace in
the Kings Name, might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to acquaint the King upon what Conditions
the Agreement was negotiated, before it was concluded. Thus having gotten a
suspension for two moneths, they forbare to conclude what they were already
agreed upon.</p>
            <p>Whilst the peace was treated on in <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> it was not
abandoned by the Nuntio <hi>Panciru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lo</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> wherein all parties were well inclined
unto it: the King of <hi>France,</hi> Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
<hi>Collalto,</hi> for the same reasons for which they did sollicite it in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and the two last, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they liked not the business of
<hi>Casalle.</hi> The Duke, by reason of the great prejudice which would result
to him, if it should succeed happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and <hi>Collalto,</hi> out of the
emulation he bore to <hi>Spinola,</hi> and his hatred to the Spaniards; which
respects, on the contrary, made <hi>Spinola</hi> very much desire it, lest that
the bad correspondency with the Duke, and <hi>Collalto</hi>'s emulation, might
ruine it, to his great discredit, <hi>Collalto</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving appeared so averse
unto it, as that he would not grant him one bare thousand men, though he
cashiered them after <hi>Mantua</hi> was taken, and <hi>Spinola</hi> needed
them much before <hi>Casalle:</hi> so as <hi>Spinola</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd by so
many difficulties and diffidences, had promised the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio to quit the
enterprise, if the French would forego the Dukes Towns which they had taken,
and would retreat to beyond the Mountains: which Agreement being accepted by
the King of <hi>France,</hi> would have been effected, had not his authority
been restrained by new Orders from <hi>Spain;</hi> for Abbot <hi>Scaglia,</hi>
who was sent, as hath been said, by the late Duke into <hi>Spain,</hi> had
acquainted that Court with <hi>Spinola</hi>'s aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to the Duke; with the
bad intelligence which pass'd between him and <hi>Collalto,</hi> and what sad
consequences might thereupon insue to the prejudice of the common cause: he had
also accused <hi>Spinola</hi> of being too apparently inclined to making peace,
upon any whatsoever condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, such as would not only be dishonourable for
their Forces, but apparently dangerous for the common affairs; and that it
could not be known whence this should proceed, unless it were from his bad
inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards the Duke, with whom he had proceeded so seve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ely: so as nothing but ruinous effects
to the common affairs could be expected from so great a discrepancy of humours,
ends and wills; since the Duke not being able any longer to endure it would be
forced to use any means for his own honour and safety: to these powerful
reasons, he added no less prevailing proofs: amongst others, the rough draught
of certain Capitul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tions of Peace,
written by <hi>Spinola</hi>'s Secretary, <pb n="446" facs="tcp:53250:231"/> whereby though
the King of <hi>France</hi> was obliged to free the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi>
Dominions, and to withdraw his Forces into <hi>France,</hi> yet was there no
caution mentioned for the observance thereof; so as it was in the Kings will
and choice whether or no he would observe what he was bound unto by the
Articles, though all things should be punctually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served by the rest: nor was
this all: he covenanted by the same Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations that all the Potentates of
<hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> the Electors by name, should favour the
States of <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> in case they should be
molested by any; and the Duke obliged himself to afford pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage and victuals
to the French Armies, if they should be sent to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour those States: a
League, or rather a Conspiracy, of all these Princes against the Emperour and
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> if at any time the Emperour should upon any just cause
proceed against his Vassal, or if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should assist the
Emperour; and yet, said <hi>Scaglia, Spinola</hi> winking at so great
indignities and prejudices, would willingly have accepted and subscribed it,
had it not been abhorred by the Duke and by <hi>Collal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> with the
unanimous consent of all the Captains, as being too inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and too unworthy
of the Cesarean authority, and repuls'd as too prejudicial to
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> These and other
reasons prevailed sufficiently with the <hi>Conde Duca,</hi> who was more
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> then to <hi>Spinola:</hi> so as there
needed not many perswasions, to induce him to limit <hi>Spinola</hi>'s
authority in the point of making peace: so as when <hi>Mazarine</hi> going into
<hi>France</hi> to Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate with the King, return'd to <hi>Italy,</hi> with
the conclusion agreed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the King, he found all broken off and in
disorder by new Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: in this interim the old Duke being dead, a
suspension of Arms was treated of by the new Duke, between himself and the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders of <hi>Cesar,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spains</hi> party, on one
side, and the French Commanders on the other side, as well in <hi>Italy</hi> as
out of it: by which all hostility and innovation of the Fortifications, hostile
acts, and taking of Towns was inhibited: that the City and Castle of
<hi>Casalle</hi> should be assigned over to <hi>Spinola,</hi> and that he
should furnish the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, being paid for it, with Victuals during the time
of Truce; that if the peace should be concluded in <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> it
should be observed on all sides; if not concluded by the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
<hi>October,</hi> that the Truce should cease, and that it should be lawful for
the French afterwards to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour the relief of the Citadel, and for the
others to defend it; and that each of them might use their Arms, and do all
hostile acts, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Truce; that if the Citadel should not be succoured
during the whole moneth of <hi>October,</hi> it should be delivered over to
<hi>Spinola,</hi> who was to have Hostages given him, for the performance
thereof: that if it should be succoured, <hi>Spinola</hi> should re-deliver the
Castle and Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. The French Commanders durst not accept of this Truce,
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out express order from the King; though <hi>Toras</hi> inform'd them often
what want they had of Victuals, Moneys and Men, many whereof were dead of the
Plague: protesting that he could not keep it longer then <hi>September:</hi>
this Proposal being sent to <hi>Paris,</hi> it was easily agreed to; for there
they desired time for the delivery of <hi>Casalle,</hi> to the end, that
thereby they might make the peace which was in treaty at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi>
upon bette<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> conditions; or might
have time to relieve it, if peace should <pb n="447" facs="tcp:53250:231"/> not be
concluded: Whereupon Monsieur <hi>di Bresse</hi> was immediately sent to
<hi>Italy,</hi> with express Orders to the French Commanders and to the Duke
<hi>du Mayne,</hi> who, as hath been said, was in <hi>Casalle,</hi> that they
should accept of it: but some time being this mean while past, <hi>Casalle</hi>
was not in the former condition; for the besiegers, as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
said, were gotten into the Ditch, and the Neapolitans, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged the City,
were fallen upon the Walls; and the Plague having consumed many of the
defendants, it might probably be supposed that for want of men the like might
befall that place, as had hapned to <hi>Mantua;</hi> it being likewise known
that those within the Town were in great scarcity of Victuals; wherefore
<hi>Spinola,</hi> making his advantage thereof, would no longer listen to any
suspension, to any Truce or peace; especially as concerning making the Citadel
longer-liv'd, by furnishing it with Victuals, and not innovating any thing
during the Truce, nor making new defences against such succours as should come
when the Truce should be expired.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Spinola</hi> was at this time much wearied both in body and
mind, by the labours he had taken, and by the agitation of spirit which he had
suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in these present Occurrences: the lessening of his power had wounded
him sorely: wherefore falling sick, and his malady both of body and mind
encreasing, he soon became unfit for managing so important an enterprise, or
indeed for any other enterprise: it was therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to send for the
Marquess of <hi>San' Croce,</hi> who was then at <hi>Genoa,</hi> and for the
Lord Chancellor and those of the Cabinet Councel, from <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> who
being come to the Camp, opened the Kings Orders, which provided for a
successour in case <hi>Spinola,</hi> should die; and therein they found
<hi>San' Croce</hi> nominated; to whom <hi>Spinola</hi> relinquish'd the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of all things. <hi>Spinola</hi> went from the Camp, and retired to
<hi>Castel nuovo di Scrivia,</hi> in the <hi>Tortonese,</hi> to be cured of his
sickness; but being ancient, and his sickness encreasing, he dyed on the 25th
of <hi>September,</hi> two moneths after the late Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The
Affairs of War and Government went less in reputation by <hi>Spinola</hi>'s
death: the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> wearied with the troubles of a long war,
which he saw was still maintained in his Country, and not being pleased that
the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards should suffer him to lose his State, so they might get
<hi>Casalle,</hi> list<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned willingly to the offers of <hi>France;</hi> which
promised to restore him to the entire possession of all that had been taken
from him, and, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, satisfaction and recompence for his pretences to
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> for the King of <hi>France</hi> finding what difficulty
and danger there would be in relieving <hi>Casalle,</hi> by reason of the Dukes
opposition, laboured to win him over from the contrary party; and if the Duke
could be safely re-possess'd of his own by peace wherefore should he wait for
the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y thereof by the
uncertain and ruinous events of war? moreover, by favouring the business of
<hi>Casalle,</hi> he made fetters for his own slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; since then by
preserving that place, he might recover his own State, and have satisfaction
for all his pretences, what reason had he to endeavour the getting of it, with
so much loss to his Subjects, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jucice to his own Dominions: but these
practices met with these diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties: the Duke would not part from the
Cesarean and Spanish side, without being effectually restored to all that had
been taken from him; <pb n="448" facs="tcp:53250:232"/> and the King would keep it as a
pledge for the restitution of <hi>Mantua</hi> already lost, and of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> if for want of relief it should chance to be lost. Yet this
treaty being on foot made the Duke more remisse in his joyning with
<hi>Spain,</hi> and desirous to handle the businesse so as that the Spaniards
should desire a general peace, whereby he was sure to be restored to his former
condition, and that <hi>Cassalle</hi> should not fall into the Spaniards hands:
yet he wisely cloked these his ends with seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral artifices. He answer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d the French, who promising speedy possession of all
that he had lost, earnestly prest him to declare for their King, that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e could not in honour passe so
suddenly from the friendship of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to enmity with him;
and that it would be too great an indignity that the same Sun, which at his
rising saw him a Friend to that King; should at his setting finde him his
Enemy. That there should some time be allowed between the one and the other; as
Summer turnes not suddenly to Winter, without the interposing of Autumn; nor
Winter to Summer, without the like interposal of the Spring; he offer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d notwithstanding, to declare himself
neutral for a while, till businesse might be brought to some reasonable
composition, and that in case the Spaniards should fail of doing what became
them, he would be ready to declare for <hi>France,</hi> and to oppose those who
would oppose reason. These were the points discus'd in these present
negotiations; but neither was <hi>Collalto</hi> right to the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s cause; for though now that his rival <hi>Spinola</hi> was
removed, it appeared that he might more favour the enterprize of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> had it been for nothing else but that the easinesse of the
success wherein he had cooperated, might double the glory which he pretended to
by the taking of <hi>Mantua;</hi> yet through the hate which he bore to the
name of <hi>Spain,</hi> he held better intelligence with the new Duke then with
the Spaniards; and persisting in his first resolution of minding the defence of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the opposing of the French more then the taking of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> he would not afford any help thereunto.</p>
            <p>This his ill will proceeded not from the aversion of the Cesarean
Officers to those of <hi>Spain,</hi> but from ill offices done him by the
Spanish Agents to the Emperour; for thinking that he bore no good will unto the
King, they had used all the means they could to remove him from his charge, and
that he might be sent for back into <hi>Germany;</hi> and eertainly it had been
done, had it not been for his Wife, whose favour with the Emperour defended him
against the endeavours of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards. The Duke being therefore inclined to
the French, for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of his State, or to the preservation of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> for his own indemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and knowing that the losse of that
Town would mar the general peace, which was the onely thing which could put him
into his former condition: and <hi>Collalto</hi> being totally inclined to
favour the Dukes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, and <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> not being of so warlike a
disposition as was <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi> but being rather mild and remiss, and
much addicted to civil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, much lesse to the troubles and dangers of
war; it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary that those that looked asquint upon the taking of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> having more field-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>oom allowed by the weaknesse of the present Government, should
openly vent their dissatisfaction, and shew the greater resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The first
action of want of respect towards <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> and 
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:53250:232"/> of great prejudice to the main affair, was the Truce and
suspension of Arms, which <hi>Spinola</hi> refused, and which was now accepted
of by the Duke in favour to the French, and by <hi>Collalto</hi> in favour to
the Duke, which had it been never so little a while delay'd, the City and
Citadel of <hi>Cassalle</hi> would certainly have been surrendered. This
suspension being by them accepted, and subscribed without <hi>Sancta Croce</hi>
his knowledge, nay contrary to his will, was presently sent to <hi>Sancta
Croce</hi> to be by him sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. This appeared to <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi>
and to the other Commanders, to be an action, as indeed it was, so proud and
arrogant, as if the Duke and <hi>Collalto</hi> did thereby arrogate unto
themselves the supream arbitracy of things, even about <hi>Sancta Croce</hi>'s
self; Yet wanting Courage to contradict it, or to resent it, he unwillingly
gave way unto it; and the fear of the Dukes and <hi>Collalto</hi>'s alienation
prevailing over his dignity, he subscribed the Truce and suspension of Arms;
For had he done otherwise, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cause being by them abandoned, or indeed
cross'd, might be reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o
great streights. The Truce being thus by common consent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Forces quit <hi>Piedmont,</hi> &amp; retreated to the State of
<hi>Millain, Collalto</hi> staying behind with the Cesarean Forces. Those who
were before <hi>Cassalle,</hi> retired likewise into the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> to refresh themselves, after the labour which they had taken
in the siege, except 2000 who entred the City &amp; the Castle, which by the
Articles of Truce were assigned over to <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> and some few
Foot, who stay'd to guard the Artillery and quarters. <hi>Sancta Croce</hi>
spake with the Duke, and with <hi>Collalto,</hi> in <hi>Pontestura,</hi> after
that the Truce was subscribed. They seemed to be both of them willing to refer
all things belonging to the management of the war to him, and by respectful and
reverent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, sought to mitigate his anger, and to excuse what they had
done; it was not known whether they did this really to make satisfaction for
what they had done, or to draw money from him, which they very much prest for;
for they were known to be in truth otherwise minded. Yet so weak of counsell
was he, as he did not onely take all in good part) but sought to buy their good
wills with ready moneies; (whereof though he himself were in great streights,
he disburs'd 200000 Ducates, part whereof the Duke received, part
<hi>Collalto.</hi> And because by the Articles of Truce all making of
Fortifications was forbidden, <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> imploy'd himself in making
provision of faggots, and of other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, upon any occasion which might
happen when the Truce should be expired; which notwithstanding he proceeded in
but slowly, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t hopes he had of peace, which being joyned to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of war and expences, all
provisions seemed superfluous.</p>
            <p>These hopes accompanied and nourish'd with great desire, had also
made the Court of France negligent in making new recruits for <hi>Italy,</hi>
had not Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> contrary to the opinion of the whole
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, laboured to perswade the King to the contrary: Shewing him that in
case Peace should not be concluded in the time prefixt for <hi>Truce,</hi> it
would be necessary that the Citadel should be surrendred; which being come into
the Spaniards hands, the state of affairs would be reduced to such a condition,
as it would be bootlesse to hope for any sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sfaction or peace; and that so the great expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ience, the so great labour and troub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e which they had been at for the
maintaining of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> would together with the reputation and honour
of the Armes of <hi>France</hi> be lost; the King <pb n="450" facs="tcp:53250:233"/> being
perswaded by these reasons gave order for the levying of as many Souldiers as
could be, whereof a body of 1200 being raised was sent to <hi>Pinarollo,</hi>
under Marshal <hi>Marigliack,</hi> which was a good recruit to the French Camp,
it being much diminished. The 15 of <hi>Octob.</hi> drew neer, and no news
being heard of Peace, they treated of proroguing the Truce, whereof <hi>Sancta
Croce,</hi> who naturally abhorr'd the thought of War, and the Commanders and
Council no less then he were desirous, by reason of the confusion and
difference of opinions and humours which was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them, and for the
distrust they had of the Duke and of <hi>Collalto,</hi> which made them despair
of good success; but the French, whose num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers were increased, fearing that
they might dissolve by delay, and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much upon the necessities and
weakness of the Enemy, refused it; as did also the Duke and <hi>Collalto,</hi>
being displeased that the first suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion granted by them was ill resented.
Wherefore because the world thought, and the Spaniards seemed assured, that
what they had done was a that time very seasonable, they were now very
backward; to the end that the good of the former suspension might appear by the
contrary effects, and that so <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> and the rest who had
blamed it, might learn at their own cost to listen better in the future to
their Counsels. But the condition of affairs being much alter'd from what it
was when the Truce was made, made the present refusal be approved; the French
were then weak, and despaired of relieving the Town, by reason of the stout
opposition; the City &amp; Citadel were reduced to the utmost extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for
want of victuals, &amp; by the advancing of the siege: it was now clean
contrary; the French were very strong in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they met with
little or no opposition, the City and Citadel were that mean while maintained
with victuals by the Spaniards, and they had some provisions lay'd in for the
future; The fiege was much lessened, their courage cooled, prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
slackned, and, in fine, the affairs of the Camp were much worse in Counsell,
Courage, and Union, and the reputation thereof was much diminished. The Truce
being expired, and nothing that was done in <hi>Ratisbone</hi> being known in
<hi>Italy,</hi> the French betook themselves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Town, but without
victuals, or any other provisions for suste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Citadel which they
were to relieve; their whole Forces consisted of about 15000 Foot, and 2000
Horse, to boot with some 4000 which were left in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> under
Monsieur <hi>Di Tauanes,</hi> to entertain or to give pretence to the Duke, and
to the Dutch who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in <hi>Piedmont</hi> after the Truce, to keep from
joyning with <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> if he should oppose the succour; and to
infuse more terror into the Enemy, they used many tricks and inventions to make
their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations appear greater, and the number of their men more, as well
of those who remained in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> as those who went to the relief;
There were three Marshals chose, who were to manage the whole busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
<hi>Sforza, Scomberg,</hi> and <hi>Marigliack,</hi> and these were to command
every day by turnes; the Duke demanded men from <hi>Sancta Croce</hi> to oppose
them, but did not obtain them, were it either out of distrust, or that knowing
all the Dutch were in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> would have the remainder for his own
safety sake keep before <hi>Cassalle.</hi> Wherefore seeing that neither the
Dutch nor the Duke moved, the French Army past over the <hi>Poe</hi> a little
below <hi>Saluzzo</hi> without any opposition, and came to
<hi>Scarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixo,</hi> where they mustered on the fifth of <hi>Octob.</hi> and
march'd on the next <pb n="451" facs="tcp:53250:233"/> day, having with them only six small
pieces of Artillery. The Duke of <hi>Momorancy</hi> being gone to
<hi>France</hi> after the Truce was concluded, was not present in this action.
The marching of this Army, and the so constant resolution to relieve the Town,
afforded much discourse touching the Duke and <hi>Collalto,</hi> whether they
held private intelligence with the French or no; it being thought, that
otherwise it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble three Marshals should take a journey of fourscore
miles in an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Countrey, where they had no strong Holds for the safety of
their march, or upon any occasion, for their retreat; and therefore subject to
be assaulted not without manifest danger, and forc'd to fight in any
disadvantagious place with a fresh, nimble Army, stronger then theirs: An<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> say they had been sure to meet with
no opposition, or had had a safe Conduct sent them by the Enemy; yet they might
have supposed that they should meet with greater difficulties and dangers when
they should be at the end of their march, and be come within sight of the
Enemies Camp: For the Enemy being very well intrench'd, munited with Artillery,
and being possess'd of the City and Castle of <hi>Casalle,</hi> they must
necessarily either assault them upon too much disadvantage within their
Quarters, or besiege them there; either of which would certainly have been a
desperate business; but it was a no less dangerous and ill advised Enterprize
to attempt the relief of a famish'd place with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out victuals, which had more
need of speedy food for nourishment then of men to defend them: Whereinto if
they should have gotten, who sees not they must have surrendred the Town the
sooner, being to be the sooner famish'd by the entrance of so many men, and
would have stood in more need of victuals. The Army being parted from
<hi>Scarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixo</hi> march'd to <hi>Raconiggi,</hi> from thence to <hi>Somariva
del Bosco,</hi> then to <hi>Cerexola,</hi> that they might from thence come
into the County of <hi>Asti,</hi> getting victuals from the neighbouring Towns:
Whilest they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced apace, and in good order, without any opposition, the
others were n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t idle before
<hi>Casalle;</hi> for having notice of the Enemies coming, they began to make
Trenches, as well against the Citadel as against the coming of succour, but
more diligently on the side of the Hills, by which way they thought they would
march, it being the higher and more advantagious; they therefore placed many
pieces of Artillery there; they likewise sent for those men back who were at
the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Truce sent into the Territories of <hi>Millain;</hi> and
upon dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether or no they should meet the Enemy if they advanced, it was
resolved to wait for them in the Trenches, that they might not lose tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> advantage by going to meet them which
they were sure to have by waiting for them. Whilest these Preparations were
making came news of the peace which was made between the Emperour and the King
of <hi>France</hi> his Agents at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> by which many things were
stipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated: Those wherein <hi>Italy</hi> was concerned, were,</p>

to the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>together with as many Towns of</hi> Montferrat
<hi>as might be worth 18000 Crowns year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vent. The Emperour being desirous to

he thought no account was made of that Treaty, it being made without his

the present Wars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had been ever constant to the Imperial Party, he
ordered so many Towns of the Dutchy of</hi> Mantua <hi>to the Duke of</hi>

Garrisons, as his Predecessors had done. These things being done, that the
Emperour should cause the City and Forts of</hi> Mantua, <hi>and the Town
of</hi> Caneto, <hi>to be assigned over to the new Duke; and that at the same
time the King of</hi> France <hi>should restore the four Towns held by him
in</hi> Piedmont <hi>to the Duke of</hi> Savoy; <hi>and that the new
Fortifications which were made in them since they were taken should be
demolished: When this should be done, that the Emperour would a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

should not be made use of by any: That the Emperour and King of</hi> France
<hi>should give Hostages to the Pope, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of what was agreed
upon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the contents of the agreement, and conditions of the
peace of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> for what belong'd to the affairs of
<hi>Italy:</hi> And many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things relating to the affairs of
<hi>Germany</hi> were likewise stipulated, which because they concern not our
History, we will pass over.</p>
            <p>It was evidently seen what use the French Agent made in this peace
of the Emperours necessity, and of the desire he had to have his Son chosen;
and how much the Electors were swayed by the interest of the Crown of
<hi>France,</hi> being desirous to allay the great ends of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, and
to moderate the Emperours Authority and Inclination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them;
confiding-upon the tacite Intelligence held by them and the other Germane
Princes with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and upon the helps which they hoped
for from him in these present occurrences. The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was not
well satisfied with this peace, thinking that the Emperour without any respect
had unto the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> so many moneys, such
Forces, and so many men, had not only not produced the fruits by them desired,
but had irreconcileably alienated from them an Italian Prince, Lord of two
States confining upon that of <hi>Millain;</hi> had not got <hi>Savoy;</hi> had
scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized <pb n="453" facs="tcp:53250:234"/> the world; raised jealousies in the Princes
of <hi>Italy;</hi> and which most troubled them, had more confirmed, and almost
established and radicated the power of <hi>France,</hi> not only in
<hi>Italy,</hi> but in <hi>Germany:</hi> So as the Italian Agents, not knowing
whether they ought to accept of this peace or no, especially since they were
sure it was not accepted nor approved of by Don <hi>Carlo Doria,</hi> the
Embassadour for <hi>Spain</hi> in that Diet, they forthwith sent to
<hi>Spain</hi> to know that Kings pleasure; and expecting Orders from that
Crown, they continued the Siege before <hi>Casalle,</hi> and kept out the
French succour. <hi>Collalto</hi> was sick at this time in <hi>Vercelles,</hi>
and having accepted and published the Capitulations with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out participating them
to S<hi rend="sup">ta</hi> 
               <hi>Croce, Iulio Massarini,</hi> the Popes Agent, went immediately
with them to the French Army, to the end that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them that all things
were agreed upon, they might proceed no further: He found it in
<hi>Canale,</hi> a Town in the Territories of <hi>Asti;</hi> and desiring to
know the pleasure of the Commanders, he received a very doubtful answer. The
French alledged, That the command to relieve <hi>Cassalle</hi> was immediately
from the King; whereas the Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> came not from
the King, but was made only by the Kings Agents: And therefore not knowing what
to do in this case, they seemed much perplexed and irresolute: The truth was,
that being uncertain whether they would be accepted or not accepted by the
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, by reason of the disadvantagious Conditions for them, whom they
found not any way obliged thereunto; and finding that the time prefix'd for
putting what was agreed on in execution, touching the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi>
his Interests, which was the chief point of the present War, was somewhat long;
they had reason to doubt, That should they super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sede never so little, their
Army might be dissolved before the time of executing the Articles; and it was
to be apprehended, That when the Spaniard should be free from fear of their
Forces, they might know the advantage, and make use of the occasion; by
continuing to besiege the Citadel, now that they were sure not to be molested;
which if they should once be Masters of, there was no hope, no means left, to
see the Peace performed. They therefore resolved to advance to relieve the
Town, without losing any time, thinking, that if they should succeed therein
they could not miss of some advantagious Composition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the State of
Affairs might be compounded with more reputat on and safety. The small opinion
they had of the Spanish Army, and their firm belief, that neither the Duke nor
Dutch would joyn there with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Casalle,</hi> did the more encourage
them, and made them hotter upon the Enterprise. <hi>Mazarine</hi> wrote from
the French Camp to the Duke, That in respect of the Peace made at
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> the French would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no further: And the Duke shew'd
this Letter to <hi>Galasso,</hi> who was head of the Dutch that remained in
<hi>Piedmont:</hi> And that they might have no occasion to remove, he, contrary
to what he had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, immediately allotted them excellent Quarters.
And though the Duke appeared to have done all this for the safety of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> against the French, who were yet there under
<hi>Tavanes,</hi> yet the jealousie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing daily, that he held
intelligence with the French, hoping to be by them restored to his State, he
was suspected to dissemble therein: Nor was <hi>Mazarine</hi> exempt from like
suspition, who, though as <pb n="454" facs="tcp:53250:235"/> Agent from the Pope, he seemed
to be a friend and mediator between all parties, yet the Pope himself appeared
to be inwardly more incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the preserving than to the taking of
<hi>Cassalle;</hi> and his trusting to the French too much, when he writ to the
Duke that they should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance no further, not suiting with the wariness and
sagacity of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, made the Spaniards suspect the more that he did not
proceed sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely with them. But the streights that the Spanish Commanders
were in forc'd them to swallow down any thing, and with less specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> considerations, to dissemble also,
and to minde the Kings business, which they saw was in too apparent danger; and
their perceiving that both Friends, and Enemies, and Mediators, and all, both
internal and external accidents, did conspire and co-operate the ruine of the
Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, did weaken their Counsels, and confound their Resolutions. At the
first news that was heard, that the Enemy, being entred into the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
of <hi>Asti,</hi> did advance, <hi>Ieronymo Gambacorti</hi> was forthwith sent
against them with a thousand Horse, with whom the Dutch Horse which were
quartered in <hi>Acqui</hi> were ordered to joyn; and the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> was also to send them 3000 Foot from <hi>Piedmont</hi> side, to
the end that with this body of men they might, if not directly, at least
indirectly, oppose the French, by molesting them on the Rere, on the flanks,
and by keeping them from Victuals: But neither did the Dutch Horse nor the
Dukes men appear; the Horse being past over the <hi>Tannaro</hi> at
<hi>Govone</hi> was entred into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and was joyn'd to the others
of their Nation; and the Dukes men went not past S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Damiano:</hi> And the
Duke trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perhaps to <hi>Mazarine</hi> his Advertisement, did not only not
think of making any opposition, but indeavoured to keep the Dutch in
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> so as <hi>Gambacorti</hi>'s Expedition wrought no effect at
all; onely that watching the Enemies ways, and finding that they advanced, he
spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily gave notice thereof to the Camp, that they might be prepared to
receive them; whereupon it was necessary to have recourse to <hi>Collalto,</hi>
and to get him to send for all the Dutch from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to joyn with
the Kings Forces against the French: But <hi>Collalto</hi> shrinking up his
shoulders, and persisting in his opinion, would have the Dutch stay to defend
<hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont;</hi> and the Peace made at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which he had
proclaimed, whereby all hostile acts were forbidden him, did honest his denial:
Wherefore the Camp being full of confusion and terrour, by reason of the
uncertainty of the coming of the Dutch, and the certainty that the French did
advance, quaked for fear. All men laid this hard dealing of <hi>Collalto</hi>
to a tacite Intelligence with the Duke, and (by the Dukes means) with the
French: But provision came seasonably from <hi>Germany</hi> against this so
bitter and necessary accident. Don <hi>Carlo Doria,</hi> seeing it was
impossible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>or him to hinder the
conclusion of Peace at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which he judged to be so prejudicial
to the Kings honour, &amp; to the safety of his Affairs, and that he could not
stave it off till the Citadel of <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle</hi> should be taken, obtained
Letters from the Emperour to <hi>Collalto,</hi> wherein he was ordered, Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t since by the Articles of Peace he
could not have to do in that business in his behalf, and since it was not known
whether the King of <hi>France</hi> would accept of the Peace or no,
especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not being obliged to do it, That in ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e the French should not allow thereof, he should obey
<hi>San Croce,</hi> and assist him with all his Forces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="456" facs="tcp:53250:235"/> Thus the Cause and Title being altered, the
War which was made before in <hi>Cesar</hi>'s Name, was made in the Name of the
King of <hi>Spain;</hi> and the Emperours Forces, which were Principals at
first, became accessory to the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s; and the Kings, which
were accessory, became upon this occasion Principal. <hi>Collalto,</hi> who
before refused to send a thousand men to <hi>Casalle,</hi> and suffered all
things to run to ruine, having received new Orders from the Emperour, summoned
all his men into the field. <hi>Galasso</hi> was come thither the night before
the French appeared, with some of them; the rest came the night after.
<hi>Gamba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corti,</hi> after he had coasted along the French Army to the
Confines of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> retreated to the Camp: And the
French parting from the Territories of <hi>Asti,</hi> went to <hi>Annone,</hi>
where finding the Gates shut, they agreed for passage with the Towns-men,
without giving or receiving any molestation. They came from <hi>Annone,</hi> by
the Valley of <hi>Grana,</hi> to <hi>Occimiano,</hi> where staying that night,
and the day following, they had notice, That the Spanish Camp was well
fortified with Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Artillery towards the Hills, and that therefore
they might with less danger assault them on the Plain, where the Fortifications
and Trenches were weaker, and imperfect: Wherefore they resolved to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance by
the way of the Plain. Advancing thus on that side where they were least
expected, they took <hi>Frassinetto,</hi> together with the neighbouring Bridge
over the <hi>Poe,</hi> by which Victuals and forrage were brought to the Camp
from <hi>Allessandrino</hi> and <hi>Occimiano,</hi> and whereby the Spanish
Army was debarr'd Commerce with <hi>Allessandrino;</hi> and there not being
many Carriages nor Barques in the Camp, wherewith to throw over another Bridge,
they began to want Victuals; and the penury grew the greater by the coming of
the Dutch; nor had they draught Horses for the Train of Artillery, so as it was
hard for them to bring them from the Hills, where they were already planted, to
the Trenches towards the Plain, where there were not above eight little Pieces.
All of them were so troubled with doubt, whether the Dutch would come to the
Camp, or no; and with fear, That if they should not come all would be ruined;
as their coming was not sufficient to cancel their fear, nor to curb their
confusion: They wanted old and experienced Camp-Masters, and Serjeants, to put
their men in Battle Array: <hi>Galasso</hi> was the only man who, by order from
<hi>San Croce,</hi> took that care upon him, and who discharged it like a
Souldier. The French seeing that, contrary to their opinion, the Dutch were
come unto the Camp, found the disadvantage of their own Forces; they were not
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly much inferiour to the Enemy in number, (20000 Foot and 5000 Horse being
computed to be in the Spanish Camp) and for that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards Horse were
better then theirs, and in better order, but for that though their Trenches
were imperfect towards the Plain, yet were they so high as they were able to
withstand the first on set, wherein the French are usually the best: But the
good order wherein the Spanish Army stood did chiefly amaze them, which was
thus; A great number of Pikemen and Musketeers stood on the front of the
Trenches, behind which were two ranks of Battaglions in order, but at such a
distance from the Trench as the Horse which were on the Wings of the
Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and had their out-lets, might manage themselves in the space 
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:53250:236"/> which was between the Trench and the Squadrons, and
might commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously go out and annoy the Enemies on the Flank who should
assault the Trenches, or over-run the Country as occasion should require. It
was, notwithstanding, impossible to <hi>Spuntare a Francesi,</hi> who advanced
in a double Front, divided into three Bodies, each one led on by a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal,
with the Horse on their sides, and preceded by some forlorn hopes; and yet the
diffidence, irresolution, and the fear of what might happen, in <hi>San
Croce,</hi> kept things equally ballanced; these desired Agreement rather then
Battle; and the others, though they more needed Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet seemed they
less desirous of it; and the seeing the Enemy so forward to accord, made them
the more backward; and God knows whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>her the Mediators dealt sincerely in the business, or no:
<hi>Mazarine</hi> went several times between the one Camp and the other, but in
vain, the French being still resolute to relieve the City, and to fight; at
last, being got neer the Trenches, their Horse on the left Wing were set upon
by some few Horse led on by <hi>Octavio Picolomini,</hi> who was advanced with
them rather to discover then to fight; so as all men thought they would have
joyn'd Battle; for some of the French Horse went to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them, and they
came to the giving of fire; but <hi>Mazarine</hi> coming at the same time from
the French Camp, cried aloud, <hi>Halt, Halt;</hi> whereupon all hostile Acts
ceasing, they came to this Agreement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That</hi> Toras <hi>should come out of the Citadel with all
the French, where the Duke</hi> du Mayne <hi>should tarry with 1000
Montferrians; and, That they should swear to keep the Town in the Emperours
Name; That the Spaniards should do the like for what concern'd the Castle, and
the City, and the Towns which they were possess'd of in</hi> Montferrat;

Count <hi>Iohn Serbellone,</hi> and about 30 other Lords; the three Marshals
came out of the French Army, with the like number of Lords and Commanders; and
here in the same place which was intended for Battle, they mutually embraced
each other; and Peace was established on the 26 of <hi>October,</hi> the year,

so easily grant unto them that main point whereupon the whole success of the
present War did consist, and which being still maintained, would have
established the foundation of the grandezza of all the Kings 
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:53250:236"/> Affairs, and would have kept his Dominions in perpetual
security; and which being quitted, occasioned the loss of regal authority and
of that preeminency and safety of the Kings States, for the maintenance
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Arms had with so much scandal been taken up; and which was the greater
wonder, that they should abandon their own and their Kings pretensions, then
when they were upon the point of obtaining them; for it was most certain that
the French Army was weary with so long a march, was less in number then what it
appeared to be, worse in order for Arms, Horse, and all things appertaining to
war, then upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent occasion was requisite; so as if the Spaniards had
been more reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and bold in their proceedings, the French would either not
have dared to have hazarded a Battle, wherein they were to fight against
well-armed Trenches; or if they should have fought, they must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily have
been defeated: but <hi>San' Croce,</hi> who was not any ways experienced in
matter of war, apprehended, and was afraid of all things.</p>
            <p>The two Armies being retired from <hi>Casalle,</hi> the Duke
<hi>de Mayne</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with the Montferrians master of the City, Citadel
and Castle of <hi>Casalle,</hi> under the Cesarean Commissary; who though he
was above all others, and had the chief command in outward appearance; yet
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to command such things as <hi>du Mayne</hi> would obey, he was
su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour rather in shadow and ceremony, then in substance: so little good was
got by what was agreed upon. <hi>San' Croce</hi> went to <hi>Sartiranna,</hi>
and brought his men back into the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> the French
divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their men into two parts; the one part whereof marched under Monsieur
<hi>d' Arpasone</hi> through the Territories of <hi>Asti:</hi> the other,
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were the three Marishals, through the <hi>Canevese;</hi> the
restitution of the Towns in <hi>Montferrat</hi> remained for the full and
perfect execution of the Agreement: but Letters being come this mean while to
<hi>San' Croce</hi> from <hi>Spain,</hi> with particular Orders what he was to
do with the Citadel, which was undoubtedly held in that Court, that it would be
lost, as not being to be succoured; <hi>San' Croce</hi> doubted that the new
agreement would not be well resented there; and as in great resolutions the
thing chosen is almost always repented, the difficulties of what was found
fault with being always imagined to be past; and the consideration of what
convenience might have resulted from the thing rejected entring in the place
thereof: so <hi>San' Croce</hi> having forgotten the dangers and difficulties
of war, and being fuller fraught with the conveniencies and advantage of
Victory, being also strucken with the Letters from Court, began to repent what
had been done: wherefore he made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral excuses to keep from restoring the
Towns of <hi>Montferrat:</hi> which the Nuntio and <hi>Mazarin</hi> perceiving,
they entred their protestations against the danger which might insue by the
re-entrance of the French into <hi>Casalle,</hi> they not being yet gone far
from thence, and who might bring things into greater confusion then they were
before: the success differ'd not from the supposal; for the Marshals sent
Monsieur <hi>di Grange</hi> immediately thither with 2000 Foot; who observing
the time when the Cesarean Commissary was gone out, entred by the gate of the
Citadel, and shut it upon the Commissaries face, who returned; at which the
Spanish and Dutch Commanders were much amazed, and <pb n="458" facs="tcp:53250:237"/> very
angry; and to boot with their many complaints of it, the Dutch pursued those
French which marched through the <hi>Canavese;</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Lerma,</hi> and Duke <hi>Nocera,</hi> march'd after those that were gone by
<hi>Astigiana,</hi> with intention to fight them, and to vindicate the affront:
but the former having pass'd the <hi>Dora Baltea,</hi> and broken the Bridge,
and the others being already come to <hi>Villa nuova,</hi> it proved all in
vain: upon consultation of this new accident, several things were propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
amongst the rest, that since for certain there was but little Victuals in
<hi>Casalle</hi> nor in the Citadel, and that the French who were entred
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into had brought none with them, the Victuals which were already there
would soon be spent: so as falling to the Siege again, and the Winter coming
on, it was probable that the French, whose weakness was better known after the
Town was gotten, then it was before, would not be able to relieve it; that it
would be sufficient to imploy the Dutch in the Siege, and that the Kings men
might be withdrawn to Winter in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and so be ready
to succour the Dutch if they should be assaulted by the French; and that if the
Dutch should tarry, or perish in that Siege, it would be of more advantage,
then prejudice, in regard of the jeajousie that the State of <hi>Millain</hi>
had of them. It was therefore concluded that, since the place could not hold
out long, it must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily soon fall into their hands; and that the French
mens cunning would redound to their own apparent loss and prejudice: yet the
weariness of war having corrupted the Commanders taste of Victory, it was
carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that affairs should again be composed; whereunto the French, who were
gotten into the Citadel, were not averse, for the danger of the the Siege, they
being victual'd but for a few days: so as by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of the Nuntio
and <hi>Mazarine,</hi> they came to this agreement, that the French should quit
<hi>Casalle,</hi> that the Spaniards should bring in a thousand sacks of Corn
into the Town, and should restore such places as were to be restored; to see
which agreement performed, the Marshal sent Monsieur <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Freshe</hi> into <hi>Casalle,</hi> who was very neer
breaking it again; for upon the entring of the Corn, and going out of the
French, <hi>Fresche</hi> hearing that the Spaniards, who had already quitted
<hi>Rossigliano,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Georgio,</hi> and other places, were not yet gone
out of <hi>Villa nuova,</hi> took occasion not to go out, but recalled the
French who were already gone: but <hi>la Grange</hi> being against it, who
would observe the agreement, and would not suffer his men to re-enter; the
Spaniards being incens'd at this second action, made their Souldiers return
into <hi>Pontestura</hi> and <hi>Ros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sigliano,</hi> and their men dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>w neer <hi>Occimiano, la Villata,</hi>
and other Towns neer to <hi>Casalle,</hi> seeming as if they would reassume the
Siege: but the Nuntio <hi>Pancirolo</hi> and <hi>Mazarine</hi> interceded
again, and they and <hi>Grange</hi> laying the fault upon <hi>Fresche,</hi> the
same agreement was again made, and was duly kept. The French went out of
<hi>Casalle,</hi> and the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards out of the Towns whereinto they were
re-entred; and <hi>San' Croce</hi> ordered <hi>Carlo Guasco,</hi> Governour of
the lower <hi>Montferrat,</hi> that he should remove the Ammunition out of
<hi>Nizza,</hi> quit the Town, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign it over into the hands of those, to
whom it should be ordained by the Cesarean Commissary. Affairs being thus
accommodated, the Dutch went to quarter some of them in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi>
some in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan Territories, and some under <hi>Gallasso</hi> in the lower
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <pb n="459" facs="tcp:53250:237"/> Contribution from all the
Feudatories of the Empire in <hi>Italy,</hi> and quarter; raising great sums of
money from them: they put for the like with the Genoese, desiring quarter of
the Commonwealth for part of their men: but the Genoeses refused, and prepared
Forces to repulse them, being more afraid of the Plague which they might bring
with them, then their Arms; therefore by the interposition of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
<hi>Millain</hi> the Dutch were satisfied with some drinking money given to
their Captains; another accident hapned, which afforded new cause of complaint,
for the not observance of agreements. The Duke <hi>du Mayne</hi> was in the
Citadel with some few Souldiers; for <hi>Montferrat</hi> being partly incumbred
by the Dutch who were quartered there, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possess'd by the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> could not furnish men enough for the Garrison, it being also
much impoverished of people by the Plague: fearing therefore some bad accident,
especially since the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, nor King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces were not
yet disbanded; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the Marshals with the danger, who were quartered
with their men, according to Articles, in the Towns of <hi>Piedmont:</hi> the
Marshals dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd 400 Swissers, who were of the Kings Guard, and who were
under them, and went by their tacite Commission into <hi>Casalle,</hi> and were
there received: but the Spaniards exclaiming against it, to appease the
rumours, they were soon sent out: the resignation of the Towns of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> remain'd for the intire execution of the peace of
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which resignation was much sollicited by the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> out of a desire that he had to end the differences, and his
pretences to <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> that thereby he might have <hi>Savoy,</hi>
and his Towns in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which were still detain'd by the French,
restored; who not being able to quarter their men commodiously therein,
disposed of them, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Articles, in many of the neighbouring Towns: at
this time <hi>Collalto</hi> died, who was the third Captain General of this
present war: he died of the disease whereof he had been almost always
afflicted, and much more by reason of the distaste he had received; for at
last, by the much pressure of the Spanish Agents, he was sent for back into
<hi>Germany</hi> by the Emperour, to give an account of his actions, and of his
unfavoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble proceedings in the business of <hi>Casalle,</hi> and in the King
of <hi>Spains</hi> affairs; he having done little else in all his Government,
but disturb'd and hindered <hi>Spinola</hi>'s and <hi>San' Croce</hi>'s
designs, in keeping that Siege from success; and this not so much to vent his
emulation, as by the unfortunate success thereof to signalize his glory the
more in taking <hi>Mantua:</hi> wherein notwithstanding he had imployed little
more then his name and authority; having been almost always sick, and for the
most part but o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Mantua:</hi> the business being still ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by <hi>Gallasso</hi> and
<hi>Aldringer.</hi> To this was added that that City be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather taken by
stealth then by force of Arms, and that stealth suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, when the City by
reason of the great mortality of Souldiers and Inhabitants was like an expiring
carcase, it lessened much the glory of the Victory; and take away the
difference of success, their glory will assuredly be greater, that suffer'd
before <hi>Casalle,</hi> then theirs who had the Victory at
<hi>Mantua.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Collalto</hi> being dead, who had full and free authority from
the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour to make peace, and to set a value upon the Towns of
<hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat</hi> 
               <pb n="460" facs="tcp:53250:238"/> which were to be restored, they
sent into <hi>Germany,</hi> expecting new Commands, and new Deputations from
the Emperours Court: they were likewise to expect the same from
<hi>France;</hi> for it was known that that King sent Monsieur <hi>di
Servien,</hi> Secretary of State, into <hi>Italy</hi> with full authority.
<hi>Cesar</hi> soon confer'd the Command upon <hi>Gallasso:</hi> but the
Secretaries not appearing after many days expectation, made it be much
suspected what the Kings mind was touching the observance of the peace; to
which he profess'd publickly he did not hold himself bound; and therefore men
knew not what to think touching the resti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Towns in
<hi>Montferrat:</hi> the reason alledged by the King of <hi>France</hi> why he
held himself not bound, was, that he having made ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther League with the King
of <hi>Swedland,</hi> in favor of the German Princes, against the Emperour,
much about the same time that the peace of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone</hi> was in treaty,
or was as good as concluded; and the Articles of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> repugning
this League and Union, as also the King of <hi>France</hi> his protection of
the German Princes, that King not willing to part from the League, nor from the
protection therein contained, pretended that his Embassadour who under-writ the
Articles of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Commission nor Command to oblige
him the King touching the affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> but only for those of
<hi>Italy:</hi> so as being question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly free from those of <hi>Germany,</hi>
he alledged he could not be bound to observe those of <hi>Italy,</hi> by reason
of the correspondent connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the one had with the other: he therefore
protested, that if he should agree to that peace for what concern'd the affairs
of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he would not do it, as bound thereunto by the Articles of
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> but out of his meer well-wishing to the peace and quiet of
<hi>Italy.</hi> The Spaniards suspected also, that the delay made by the French
Deputy proceeded from some end the King might have to keep the Spanish and
Dutch Forces idle in <hi>Italy:</hi> which, the peace being once agreed upon,
were destined, the Spanish for the relief of <hi>Flanders,</hi> against which
the Hollanders made great warlike preparations; and the Dutch, to suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour
<hi>Germany,</hi> where the King of <hi>Swedlands</hi> proceedings prospering

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dingly, they very much press'd
for assistance and succour: so to hinder the hazardous affairs of the Emperour
and of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> in both these places, from being relieved by
those succours; for nothing being to be treated of in <hi>Italy</hi> without
the French Deputy, the Spanish and Dutch Forces were necessarily to remain in
<hi>Italy</hi> till that business should be perfectly ended: only in favour to
the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Agents who were in <hi>Italy</hi> chose
<hi>Cherasco,</hi> a Town in <hi>Piedmont</hi> for the place of conference,
where the Duke kept his Court, it being a place least infected with the Plague;
wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>o weighty and
important a business be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be made in the face, and before the eyes of his
so great contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, the ballance would not be so rightly guided as it
ought: at last, the French Deputy appeared in <hi>Italy;</hi> who being kept
some days in <hi>Susa</hi> by the Marshals, came to <hi>Cherasco</hi> about the
midst of <hi>Febr.</hi> in the year 1631: where Monsieur <hi>Pancirolo,
Mazarine, Gallasso, Toras,</hi> the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Embassadour for <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and Marshal <hi>Scomberg,</hi> were present:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Negotiation being begun, the first thing that was handled
was that <pb n="461" facs="tcp:53250:238"/> which concerned the Duke of</hi> Savoy<hi>'s
pretensions to as many Towns of</hi> Monserrat <hi>as were to be assigned over
to him, to the value of</hi> 18000 <hi>crowns annual revenue. And the Duke
persisting that the Towns reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues should be rated according to the ancient
Rent, and not as they went now; contrary to what the</hi> Mantuan <hi>Agents
pretended, as an expedient for this and all other differences and pretensions,
the annual Rent of</hi> 18000 <hi>crowns was by the Deputies reduced to</hi>
15000, <hi>according as the King of</hi> France <hi>had declared by the
Articles of</hi> Susa; <hi>For payment whereof fourescore and foure Towns were
assigned to the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>amongst which</hi> Alba <hi>and</hi>
Trino; <hi>But because it appeared that the revenue of these Towns came to much
more then</hi> 15000 <hi>crowns, the Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>was injoyn'd to pay
for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus</hi> 500000 <hi>crowns to</hi> Nevers, <hi>and to quit
the</hi> Infanta Margarit<hi>'s portion, which</hi> Nevers, <hi>as heir to
Duke</hi> Francis, <hi>did owe; In lieu of which portion, the Duke of</hi>
Savoy, <hi>and (in his name) the Deputies and Arbitrators did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to the
said</hi> Margarite La Motto, Riva, <hi>and</hi> Costanza, <hi>three of those
Towns which were at the present assigned to the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>it
being lawful for him to redeem them at any time upon payment of the portion.
And by this assignation all the Duke of</hi> Savoy<hi>'s claimes and
pretensions to</hi> Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat <hi>were understood to be fully satisfied. As
for the performance of the other points, it was agreed, that within two moneths
space</hi> Nevers <hi>should be put into possession of all his Dominions,
except what was assign'd to the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>that between the eight,
and the twentieth day of</hi> Aprill, <hi>all the Dutch and the French should
foregoe</hi> Italy, <hi>that the first should return to</hi> Germany, <hi>the
others to</hi> France; <hi>leaving those who were in the</hi> Mantuan
<hi>Towns, which were reserved to the Emperour, and those in the Town of</hi>
Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont, <hi>which were reserved for the King of</hi> France. <hi>That the
Duke of</hi> Savoy <hi>should also withdraw all his men into</hi> Piedmont,
<hi>not removing those who were in the Towns assigned now unto him: That
within</hi> 25 <hi>dayes the Duke of</hi> Nevers <hi>should be invested into
his two Dukedoms, in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as his Predecessors had been. That this
being done, the Forts which have been erected upon occasion of these present
Wars, in the States and Towns which had been taken, should be demollished by
the</hi> 23 <hi>of</hi> May, <hi>on which day</hi> Mantua <hi>and the Forts
thereunto belonging, and</hi> Caneto, <hi>should be consigned to</hi> Nevers;
<hi>and the Towns in</hi> Piedmont, <hi>which were held by the French, should
also on the same day be delivered to the Duke of</hi> Savoy, <hi>and presently
after all the</hi> Grisons, <hi>Towns, and places which were held by the
Emperour, as well in</hi> Rhetia, <hi>as in the</hi> Votuline, <hi>should be
set free. But the difficulty consisting in the sure performance of what was

doubting that the Towns of</hi> Mantua <hi>and</hi> Piedmont <hi>being to be
restored on the</hi> 23 <hi>of</hi> May, <hi>it might so fall out that neither
of the parties, either out of their own wilfulness, or for fear of being
deceived, would make restitution; or that if the one party should do it, the
other party might not do so, which would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound much to the prejudice of the
things agreed upon, as also of the satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of all, and of the publick
peace: it was therefore concluded, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the</hi> 15 <hi>dayes prefix'd
for the demollishing of the Forts, Hostages should be delivered up to the Pope
by the Emperour, and by the King of</hi> France, <hi>to be detained by the
Pope, till all things were performed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope refused to receive Hostages for restitution of the Towns
in <hi>Rhetia,</hi> for that it did not suit with Religion, nor with the

co-operate in making Towns be restored to Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, <pb n="462" facs="tcp:53250:239"/>
which were posses'd by Catholicks; and the French not being to be satisfied in
this point without caution, it was agreed upon by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle apart, between
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the French Agents, to which <hi>Gallasso</hi>
seemed to give his consent; That the Duke at the same time should restore his

               </gap>cause, for assurance of this
agreement, it was resolved in the 16 Article of the Peace at
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> that hostages should be given, who were to be named by the
I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>alian Agents, who were likewise
to chuse to what Prince they should be given; and moreover the said A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents
were allowed liberty to do any thing else therein, which should seem best and
safest to them; and they choosing the Pope, who refused to receive Hostages;
This accommodation was found to satisfie the French, who received some
prejudice in the point which concerned the Grisons; but the more the French
were therewith satisfied, the more unsatisfied were the Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>niards, and by their means the Emperour. The judgement
given at <hi>Chirasco</hi> was also suspected by reason of the exorbitant
assignment made unto the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> of so many great and noble
Towns in <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which to boot that by the common present
calculation they came to 100000 ducates annual revenue, it was too prejudicial
to the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> and weakned the rest of his State so much, as
not being able to undergo the burthen of maintaining <hi>Cassalle,</hi> nor to
supply it with sufficient victuals; the Arbitrators who were aware of it,
ordered that the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> should permit <hi>Nevers</hi> to
extract 10000 sacks of corn yearly, at the price of the Market; which
extraction, to boot with the limitation of time prefixed, reduced the
maintainance and nourishment of that Town to be at the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s
pleasure; who by denying it, might besiege it, and bring it into great
streights. It therefore seemed strange, that the Agents of the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who had by his Arms profest himself to be <hi>Nevers</hi> his
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, should consent to what was so prejudicial to their Kings Client;
and the restoring of 500000 ducates, together with the freeing of
<hi>Nevers</hi> from payment of the <hi>Infanta Margarits</hi> portion, being
nothing else but a forcing of <hi>Nevers</hi> to alienate so great a part of
his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ate at so mean a price as
those two sums came to, made more for <hi>Nevers</hi> his prejudice, and
consequently made the Arbitrement more exorbitant, and the conditions more
unjust.</p>
            <p>At this time the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> was again made Governour
of <hi>Millain,</hi> in the place of <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> with whom the Court
o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Spain</hi> was very ill
satisfied by reason of his ill government of the Kings busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: And though
<hi>Feria</hi> did not like the thus dismembring of <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi>
especially since the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> being possest thereof by the King
of <hi>France</hi> his means, he was in appearance likely to depend more upon
him then upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who would never condescend 
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:53250:239"/> that he should be Master of one foot of ground in
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> yet <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> and the other Spanish Agents,
dissembling their inward resentment of this point, as not appertaining to their
King; they exclaimed main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and protested against what concern'd the Garrison
of <hi>Susa</hi> and <hi>Avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliana;</hi> and <hi>Feria</hi> writ to the
Emperour and to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> that they should not allow of the
Articles of <hi>Chirasco,</hi> nor to the restitution of <hi>Mantua;</hi> he
also complained of <hi>Gallasso</hi> in the Emperours Court, as if adhering too
much to <hi>Collalto,</hi> he had inclined more to the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
then to the King of <hi>Spain:</hi> And it was bruted abroad, that
<hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasso</hi> having received great sums of money from the Duke, had
joyned with the French, in being so favourable to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
in the assigning of the Towns. And, as if affairs had been in a worse case then
ever, <hi>Feria</hi> staid the Brigadoes which were sent for <hi>Flanders,</hi>
and the Dutch, who according to the Articles of <hi>Chirasco</hi> were ready to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part; notwithstanding that the Emperours affairs being ill handled by the
Swedes at this time did very much require succour. The business being thus
interrupted, and all parties being much incens'd by this backwardness in
<hi>Feria,</hi> it was thought he the more desired to embroil business, that he
might have occasion to exercise his warlike
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>alent, then to appease them;
wherefore as a friend to novelty he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly noted to be of an unquiet
spirit: And this was observed even in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was
held to be very ill satisfied with the peace of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and worse
with the agreement of <hi>Gasalle;</hi> it was therefore thought that
<hi>Feria</hi> coveted to repair his Predecessors fault, and to signalize the
beginning of his Government by actions contrary to his. But a Decree made by
the Emperour after the peace of <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone</hi> did much trouble all mens
minds, by which he conferr'd all the authority of the Sacred Empire which could
be conferr'd, in amplest manner, upon the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> against
contumacious and rebellious Subjects: A Decree commonly practised in
<hi>Germany</hi> against disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Princes, by which that Prince who is
warranted to make War is permitted to possess himself of the disobedient Prince
his Dominions, no restitution being to be made till he have paid the whole
charge of the War: By virtue of this Decree, all Princes and Officers who are
Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Empire are bound to pay obedience to him who hath this
Commission, as they should do to the Emperour, and also to deliver up unto him
all Towns and Forts, and without making any reply, to turn their Arms and
Forces whithersoever that King commands.</p>
            <p>This Decree was occasioned by what had hapned before
<hi>Casalle,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter peace was made, by the King of <hi>France</hi> his
protesting that he held himself not bound to observe the Articles of that
peace, and by the agreement of <hi>Chirasco</hi> which gave little
satisfaction; for the Emperour finding that the French were not content with
the peace, but that the King of <hi>France,</hi> at the same time that that
peace was made, had made a new League with the Swedish King, clean contrary to
the Articles of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and that he furnish'd him with mone<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

possibly repair the affairs of the Empire both in <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Italy</hi> at one and the same time, he thought fit to leave the care of
the affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the greatest
Prince and Feudatory of the Emp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e:
And the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> 
               <pb n="464" facs="tcp:53250:240"/> being substituted by the
King in this Commission, <hi>Gallasso</hi> who mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the War, and
<hi>Aldringer</hi> who had <hi>Mantua</hi> in possession, as also all the

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Princes, Feudatories to the
Empire, were to obey him, and to assist him, as they would have done the
Emperours self; and <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dringer</hi> was bound to deliver <hi>Mantua</hi>
unto him, and all the Towns which he held in that Dukedome; for that
<hi>Nevers,</hi> who having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curr'd the penalty of High Treason, by reason of
his contumacy and disobedience, had no right to that peace, but was relapsed
into his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fault; and the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> by virtue of that Decree
might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against him with all the Forces of the Empire. For fear that
this should be put in execution, the Venetians, the French, and all Princes who
cared for the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> apprehended that all things would be
ruined, if <hi>Mantua</hi> should be assigned over to the Duke of
<hi>Feria;</hi> they were therefore necessitated to endeavour by all means that
the peace might be observed and ratified in the first place, and afterwards
reform the Articles of <hi>Chirasco,</hi> in satisfaction to the Emperour and
Spaniards. Thus the agreement of <hi>Chirasco</hi> being of force, it was
instituted touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the restitution of the Towns and places belonging to the
Grisons, whereof the doubt remained, that the French, instead of the Garrison
which by the agreement they were to put into <hi>Susa,</hi> might keep
<hi>Briche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasco;</hi> but that <hi>Gallasso</hi> should be constituted in
<hi>Mantua,</hi> and <hi>Toras</hi> in <hi>Turin,</hi> for hostages; the one
for the restitution of <hi>Bricherasco,</hi> the other for the Towns and places
belonging to the Grisons: And because this new agreement was made on the 19<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
of <hi>Iune,</hi> the time of the former agreement being already expired,
others were made like unto the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. In this second agreement the Duke of
<hi>Feria</hi> was likewise limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted more precisely touching the Garrison of
<hi>Millain,</hi> and the number of the men were lessened which he was to keep
there for Garrisons, contrary to what in the preceding peace, and particularly
in this last of <hi>Chirasco,</hi> was observed; for whereas in the former it
was said, that the Kings Forces should not so tarry in the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> as to cause jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie in the Neighbours, in this last they
obliged the Governour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely, to send 6000 Foot and 1000 Horse out of
<hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Rhetia,</hi> of the extraordinary Forces which were in
the State; and that if after the restitution of the places there should yet
remain a greater number of Horse or Foot then is usually kept in that State,
they should be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss'd, or should be so disposed of as no more should remain
there then was usually kept in Garrison in the time of peace. This agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
was perfectly observed: At the time appointed the Duke of <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua</hi> was
re-invested and restored to the City and State of <hi>Mantua,</hi> freed of all
the Dutch, who shall for the future be no more called the Duke of
<hi>Nevers,</hi> but Duke of <hi>Mantua:</hi> The Towns of <hi>Piedmont</hi>
were also restored to the Duke of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and lastly, for full and
entire perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of what was cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>anted, the Hostages were set at liberty; so as <hi>Italy</hi> was
likely to return into her former serene peace.</p>
            <p>But new clouds soon appe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s eyes upon them; and seeming big of thunder, lightning
and storms, made it be feared they would break out into some dangerous tempest.
The King of <hi>France</hi> some few days after the Towns and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages were
with satisfaction to all parties restored, demanded some <pb n="465" facs="tcp:53250:240"/>
things of the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> which being directly contrary, not only
to the Covenants, but to the fundamental points of the peace of
<hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> and of the Agreements made at <hi>Cherasco,</hi> did
disturb the Affairs in several manners, perplex'd the minds of the Italians,
and gave the Spaniards more cause of complaint, and greater reason to think
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves injured then before: he demanded the assignment over unto him of
<hi>Susa</hi> and of <hi>Avigliana,</hi> or <hi>Pinarollo</hi> and
<hi>Perosa,</hi> or of <hi>Dimone</hi> and <hi>Cunio,</hi> or lastly,
<hi>Savigliano,</hi> together withall the Towns that are upon the passage to
Castle <hi>Delphino:</hi> the reason of these his demands, he said, was, that
he might have a way open to come into <hi>Italy,</hi> upon any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty that
might be attempted by the Spaniards, to the prejudice of his Confederates, and
to secure himself of the Dukes friendship; whom he once more saw inclined to
joyn with the Spaniards against him. The occasion of these demands were
alledged to be, for that together with the ardent desire which the Spaniards,
as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e said, seemed to have, to
exclude the new Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> out of <hi>Italy,</hi> that they might
unjustly usurp the States which did by right of succession devolve upon him;
and besides, that they for the same purpose had gone against the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of
<hi>Susa;</hi> and with their own Forces, and those of the Dutch, called into
<hi>Italy</hi> by them, and paid by their moneys, had assaulted his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and taken <hi>Mantua</hi> from him; they now endeavoured to come to a third
assault, when by reason of the restitution of the Towns of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and the French their retiring into <hi>France,</hi> they were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves alone
in <hi>Italy,</hi> arm'd in the Field, the Duke being weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to
resist them, for want of moneys and men, who were consumed by War and by the
Pestilence, wherewith his States had been so sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflicted. The King
justified these his doubts and jealousies; for that though the Duke of
<hi>Feria</hi> had given his word to <hi>Galasso,</hi> that he would cashier
the extraordinary Forces out of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and reduce the
Souldiers to the number that were usually kept in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in time of peace,
according to the last Article of <hi>Cherasco;</hi> he, on the contrary, had
retained most of the Foot, to boot with <hi>Scomburgs</hi> Regiment, and the
Neapolitan Horse, which he had not only not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd as he was obliged to do;
but had raised others by the Marquess <hi>Rangone,</hi> and drawn them neer the
Confines of <hi>Millain;</hi> and that many Captains and Officers, under colour
of Reformadoes, were sent by him to <hi>Naples,</hi> to raise more men, and
bring them into the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> that <hi>il Signore
Merodes,</hi> a Captain of the Emperours in <hi>Alsatia</hi> had encreased his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>roops with the men that were sent
into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that joyning with Archduke <hi>Leopold</hi> he
threatned innovation against the Grisons; and that in the mean while,
<hi>Merodes</hi> and his Lievtenant did by several ways molest those people,
and pick new occasions to break the peace: that the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi>
being desired by the Nuntio <hi>Panciruolo,</hi> and press'd thereunto by the
F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ench, to cashier those men, so
to remove all occasions of new jealousies, he openly den<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed to do it; and this for nothing else, but for that,
as he sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d, the new Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi> had put new Garrisons of French Souldiers into
<hi>Casalle,</hi> contrary to Covenants; and for that the Grisons, contrary to
the Articles of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the passes of
<hi>Stainc,</hi> and of other places; and that therefore it was necessary to
provide against these inconveniences by way of anticipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:53250:241"/> lest other more great might follow thereupon: that the
Spaniards, who were now more powerful in the Emperours Court then the Dutch
themselves, had labour'd very much, even since the Treaty of peace, that the
Emperour would deliver the City of <hi>Mantua</hi> into their hands; and that
not being able to obtain it, they had treated with the Imperial Officers who
had the Government of that City, to deliver it up unto them; and that they had
proceeded so far therein, as they failed but a li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tle of having it done, had they not been hindred by
such Officers as were faithful to the Emperour, and who would not consent to so
great a piece of treachery: he also said that the Emperour bare no good will to
the new Duke, nor was pleased with the peace that he himself made; for that the
next day after the investment was granted, he by a secret Article, procured by
the Spanish Agents, had declared the investment should be null and of no
effect, if at any time the Articles of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> should not be
observed; and, as if this were directly contrary to the same Articles, wherein
he in express words covenanted that the invest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be granted in the
same manner as it had been formerly granted to the former Dukes, the King
alledged that that Declaration was procured only to serve for a pretence that
the Spaniards might once more assault that Duke, and bereave him of his Dukedom
upon any slight occasion: since they and the Emperour, who were parties in this
business, were made judges of the breach thereof, and accusers of those that
should break it: he further argued that the Spaniards fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the civil
dissentions of his Royal Court, and were of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with his Brother and
Mother, who were at this time fled from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and were
gone into <hi>Flanders:</hi> to the end, that he and his Kingdom being troubled
with intestine dissentions, might not apply themselves to the Affairs of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and so they might assault the Duke the third time with greater
Forces: nor herewithall contented, that they endeavoured to draw the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> to joyn with them in their Plots contrived against the quiet of
his Kingdom, as was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by Letters of the Spanish Embassadours Resident
with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which were intercepted; and as might be better
compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by the Abbot <hi>Scaglia</hi>'s going into <hi>England:</hi>
which Abbot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Embassadour from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> in
<hi>Madrid,</hi> at the same time when the Towns of <hi>Savoy</hi> and
<hi>Piedmont</hi> were restored, was sent at the King of <hi>Spains</hi>
charges into <hi>England</hi> to treat of new Leagues against <hi>France:</hi>
he further urged the Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> his going into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> at the same time that the Queen-mother was to be there, and
the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment of the Baron S. <hi>Romano,</hi> who after having treated in
<hi>Millain</hi> with <hi>Feria,</hi> and afterwards with the Spanish
Embassadour in <hi>Turin,</hi> was gone into <hi>Languedock</hi> with the Dukes
Pass-port, and with Order to raise men for the Kings Brother: moreover, Orders
given for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of 500 Spaniards, and 2000 Italians, at the same time, to
<hi>Barcelona,</hi> to put those designs in execution which might by all men be
imagined. Monsieur <hi>di Servien,</hi> who was the Kings Embassadour in
<hi>Turin,</hi> hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ng delivered
the Duke a long Discourse in writing upon these and other lighter complaints,
he at last required an answer from him to these the Kings demands, within three
days, to the end, that the King might know how to dispose of his Forces that
were yet in the Provinces which <pb n="467" facs="tcp:53250:241"/> confine upon
<hi>Italy;</hi> putting him also in mind, that he the Duke having gotten so
great a part of <hi>Montferrat</hi> by the Kings means, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the only man that had got advantage by the late war, he was bound, both for
convenience and gratitude, to do some thing for the safety of the Affairs of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and for the satisfaction and reputation of the Kings Forces.
The Duke immediately acquainted the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> with the
Kings demands, and with the threats which might apparently be seen, in case he
should deny them: adding, that he the Duke not having wherewith to resist, must
be forc'd to chuse the lesser evil, and to comply with the Kings will, unless
he were furnish'd with 10000 effectual Foot, and 1000 Horse for the defence of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and with 6000 Foot and 1000 Horse for the defence of
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and if they were paid what was their due; he should submit
to the Kings will. The Governour not being able to furnish him with so many men
at the prese<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t, offer'd to send
him as many as he was able now, and that he might be su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e that for the future he would procure him what
assistance he could for the preservation of his Dominions. The Duke, not
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with these uncertain generalities, agreed with the French Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
to assign over <hi>Pinarollo</hi> and <hi>Per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Susa</hi> was assigned the year before, upon Oath that they should hold
them for the King, for six moneths space; and that time being ended, that they
should re-assign them over again to him the Duke, unless by his own consent the
time of assignment to the King should be prorogued; that the King might put a
Governour into them, who should take the same Oath. The Duke obliged himself
also, and promised not to co-operate with them who should go about to trouble
the peace of <hi>France,</hi> during the Kings Mothers, and his Brothers
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and to give free passage for the French to enter <hi>Italy,</hi> if
they should be brought thither by any novelty against the Duke of
<hi>Mantua.</hi> There was not any one who did not resent this so sudden and
unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed demand, and who did not wonder, and were not amazed at the Dukes so
ready yielding thereunto: so as none were so void of reason, as not to think
that it was agreed upon long before between him and the King; especially by the
many accidents and circumstances which went to the approving thereof. The
Cardinal of <hi>Savoy</hi> went to <hi>Paris</hi> a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the French
restored the Towns of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>
               </hi> with his Wife and Children, on
whom, the Duke having no Children, the succession of <hi>Savoy</hi> fell: the
occasion of the Cardinals going thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was given out to be, for his own

did not pursue his journey, but tarried there with his Brother, till such time

being done, they all returned to <hi>Piedmont:</hi> the going of these Princes
to that Court, and their tarrying there till the assigning over of

               </gap>acite threats in case of denial,
he endeavoured to perswade the Duke to give way unto the demands, by way of
gratitude for the great obligation which he had to the King, by whose favour

               </gap>e had gotten so great a part of
<hi>Montferrat.</hi> The Kings suffering himself for so frivolous and sleight
occasions, which by treaty might easily be compounded, to be brought to resolve
upon a thing of so great moment, when <hi>France</hi> which required peace and
restauration, broke forth into combustion of Civil War by the flight of his
Mother and Brother, made all men believe that without assurance of having it
readily granted, he would not have adventured to make such a demand: which if
it had been denied, obliged him to undertake greater wars then those which,
after so much expence of moneys and blood, he was to thank fortune for his
coming off with honour, with Forces already wearied, and little better then
beaten, and upon a less just title then the former. On the other side, the
great respect, not to say fear, which the Duke when he was already restored to
all his Dominions, shew'd to have of those Forces, which when he was in a worse
condition he had so boldly resisted; his so much distrust of aid from
<hi>Spain,</hi> by which being assisted, he nor his Father fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

desired those succours from the Duke of <hi>Feria,</hi> which he might have
received, and was bound to accept of, rather then to quit so many places of
importance.</p>
            <p>The Duke not being moved at so unjust demands, which rather then
to have granted he was upon all accounts to have run any whatsoever Fortune his

resentment after such an assigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but his pretending a reward for it from
the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> as if he had once more thereby secured the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> confirmed the general prejudiciate opinion, that this

confirmed by the sale made by the Duke the next year of the same Towns to the
King, and of their Territorie, wherein many other Towns were con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

comprehended, that it was not his alledged zeal to the publick peace, nor the
security of his Client and Friends, but his desire to have a gate alwayes open
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <pb n="469" facs="tcp:53250:242"/> 
               <hi>Italy,</hi> which caused the King to make such
high and strange demands, and so contrary to the Covenants of
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> and <hi>Chirasco,</hi> agreed unto by his Agents in his
name, and ratified by the King himself, in the effectual restitution of the
Town of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> the 500000 Ducates which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
was to restore to the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> for the overplus of the Towns in
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> assigned to him by the Arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Chirasco,</hi>
the which the King being obliged to make good to that Duke, he afterwards
profes'd that he kept them against the same Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> for the
charges he had been at in making war for the defence and maintaining of his
dominions, was considered in the price of so many important Towns. The Duke
granted, and afterwards sold unto the King those Towns upon which the liberty
and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of <hi>Piedmont</hi> did depend, and wherein his sovereignty
did consist, and his not being onely a great and free Prince and master of
himself, but an Arbitrator of great affairs between two mighty Kings; and their
worth being inestimable, the Towns of <hi>Montferrat</hi> which were assigned,
were sold at a very under rate. For if Duke <hi>Charles Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel</hi> did grant
all the Country of <hi>Bresse</hi> to the King of <hi>France,</hi> a large
Country and of great revenue, onely that he might keep <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> and
thereby remain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ree and absolute
master of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the French being excepted; what comparison is to
be made between <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> and all the valley of <hi>Perosa,</hi> in
consideration of the Marquesate of <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> especially the great
opportunity and consequence of <hi>Pinarollo</hi>'s scituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being
considered; and what proportion can the Towns assigned in <hi>Montferrat</hi>
beat with <hi>Bressa</hi> which was granted, so great a Country and so full of
numerous Towns? Yet the now Dukes action was excused by the necessity he was in
to comply with the Kings pleasure, who being posses'd not only of the Towns
lately granted in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but of all <hi>Savoy,</hi> and so many
other Towns of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and having no hopes ever to regain them by
force, it behoved him to do as the times requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and of two evils, to chuse
the least; since affairs were brought to such a condition, as he was rather to
thank the King for what was in the Kings power to deny him, then to forego what
not being able to regain, was really rather to be esteemed the Kings, then his;
and which being denyed gave occasion not onely to retain that, but all the
other Towns that the King was posses'd of. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> being
proud of so advantagious an acquisition, cove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed that it might never be can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel'd out of the memory of man, but
remain in perpetual witnesse of what he had done for the Crowns advantage; he
also had contracted a particular and intense hatred against the Duke upon many
accounts, but more particularly for having been brought to great extremities,
both by the last Duke, and by this; when he went the preceding year with an
Army into <hi>Piedmont:</hi> so as Revenge being added to the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of
the King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> affairs, he thirsted to
see the House of <hi>Savoy</hi> reduced to such a weak condition and
subjection, as the Dukes thereof should never be able to hold up their heads,
or to gain-say the Kings pleasure; nor ever to put such tricks upon any of the
Kings Officers or Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as they had done upon him; and so to leave the
impression of his resentment for ever engraven in the depression of that
Principality; and not finding any better means how to effect it, he inform'd
the Duke <pb n="470" facs="tcp:53250:243"/> that he had no other way to regain what he had
lost, then to lose <hi>Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollo,</hi> and the valley of <hi>Perosa:</hi> For
the King, who profess'd himself not bound to observe the peace of
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> was not to receive any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ce by not accepting thereof, save only that
<hi>Mantua</hi> should not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to the Duke of <hi>Nevers;</hi> a losse
wherein his Kingdom was but little concern'd, that City being so far distant
from the confines of <hi>France;</hi> Whereas by keeping <hi>Savoy</hi> and
<hi>Pinarollo,</hi> with all the Towns he had in <hi>Piedmont</hi> in his
possession, he got incomparable more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which might largely make
amends for the losse of <hi>Mantua,</hi> as well for what concern'd himself, as
for what concern'd the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> to whom he might procure whole
<hi>Montferrat</hi> in lieu thereof, together with <hi>Savoy</hi> in fee, and
so better both his own and his Clients condition: For if <hi>Nevers</hi> should
be Lord of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he would become a greater Prince by the vicinity of
his French Dominions thereunto; and the King by retaining the sovereignty of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and possessing <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and the Towns he had taken
in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he would extend the skirts of his Dominions, and his
authority equally on both sides of the <hi>Alps,</hi> with much advancement of
Majesty and Reputation, by the great adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence that he would thereby get in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and with much prejudice to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which being
surrounded by the Kings Forces, would in many respects be subject to the Crown
of <hi>France;</hi> and therefore the King being to receive such advantage by
not accepting the peace, he would not by accepting it deprive himself thereof,
unless he might be sure to retain <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> and the valley of
<hi>Perosa.</hi> To these so hard and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere conditions it may be believed,
that fair promises were added of allowing the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> a good
part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> if he would give way to the Kings will: Wherefore
the Duke being forced by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, and incited by appearing advantage, could
not but consent to what was demanded.</p>
            <p>Thus the King of <hi>France,</hi> under the colour of maintaining
the liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the Italian Princes, and under pretence
that the Spaniards should not curb the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> did himself
first curb the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and made a Prince almost his Subject,
who was not only an Italian, but one so neerly allied unto him: but neither was
the Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> when he was restored to his State, in free and
full liberty of Principality; for besides the so great dismembring and
lessening of his restored State, he being to receive a French Garrison in
<hi>Mantua</hi> and in <hi>Casalle</hi> (for that it was impossible for him to
keep those places well Garrisoned) became so dependant upon the Kings pleasure
and will, as the Kings profess'd protection to him, did almost impose as much
subjection upon him, as the Spaniards could have done: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing likely that
the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> which, as hath been said, was at first so neer
granting him free and unconditional possession, would have consented thereunto
much more willingly, if the new Duke should but have permitted them to put a
Garrison into <hi>Casalle:</hi> in which case the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would,
moreover, have been bound to protect him and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> just as he
had done the Dukes his Predecessors, which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e had so constantly done, with
such profusion of his Subjects blood, and of his own moneys, as without ever
pretending any recompence, he kept their State untouched against the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> a Prince so <pb n="471" facs="tcp:53250:243"/> neerly allied in blood unto
him; and the subjection of the Duke of <hi>Mantua<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> in respect of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> did double the subjection of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> for as
<hi>Pinarollo</hi> being assigned over unto the French<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> opened a gate of
free entrance into <hi>Piedmont</hi> whereby to be oppress'd: so was
<hi>Casalle</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er gate,
which kept the Spaniards from coming to succour <hi>Piedmont</hi> when it
should be infested by the French; and neither of these Princes being any ways
able to resist the French, if once they were masters of these places, it was
cleer enough seen into what condition the Liberty of their Principalities was
reduced. The Grisons fell upon no less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences; for under colour that
the places that were restored might not be again seized on by the Austrians,
the King kept means how to enter there, by putting French Garrisons into them:
The King of <hi>France</hi> his authority did hereby so encrease in
<hi>Italy,</hi> if not in Propriety and Dominion of State, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> least in such adherence, as they not
being able to do withall, he might make use of his adherents States, as of
those that were Patrimonial to his Crown: but the more the Duke was to be
excused for his being necessitated to yield <hi>Pinarollo</hi> to the King, the
less was his loss therein compassionated; for he and his Father, whilst he was
alive, had made that Principality hateful to the Italian Princes, by their
joyning with the Austrian Forces, whilst they were thought to aspire after the
oppressing of <hi>Italy</hi> by oppressing the Duke of <hi>Nevers:</hi>

rejoyced, that as those Dukes had co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to enslave <hi>Italy,</hi> they

themselves taken in that snare of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, in which, so they might have
part of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> they cared not though others, together with
themselves, had been taken; and the same Italian Princes were not displeased to
find that there was a means found to fix the staggering of their conceits,
wherewith they had tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented others; and would not suffer any secure
foundation to be laid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that the more they saw the Duke waver in the favour of the French, they thought
the commmon affairs the safer; and they were the surer that the Spaniards
having lost all hope of winning that Prince over to them, and knowing that the
French, by the Territories of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> did
almost confine upon the State of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> they would be forc'd to be

clandestine deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the King and Duke were contrary to the peace of
<hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisbone,</hi> and to the Treaties of <hi>Cherasco,</hi> yet winking at
so great a gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saying, they allowed of the Kings justification; and, on the
contrary, the Declaration made by the Emperour touching the investment of the
Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> the day before, was judged to be clandestine; and yet
he who shall justly consider the cause which moved the Emperour to make that
Declaration will find that he was not to be blamed for it; nor had any, and
much less the King of <hi>France,</hi> reason to complain of the Articles which
were granted before; for the Articles of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> being reciprocal
between the Emperour and the King, it was clear that the one party observing
them when the other did not, it was lawful for <pb n="472" facs="tcp:53250:244"/> the
observer to withdraw from what he had on his side done: but the original fault
of the first moving against the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi> conveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sinister
influences into all actions which did depend upon that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, did little
justifie any action which might any ways prejudice the Dukes interest; and the
Italians minds being incumbered by fear that the former wars of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> and then those against <hi>Mantua</hi> and
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> aimed at the inslaving of <hi>Italy,</hi> they allowed no
place to any more subtile interpretations or considerations, to define what was
just and honest; since justice and honesty seemed to have taken up the highest
seat in the balance, which did secure the Liberty of <hi>Italy;</hi> and
whatsoever co-operated to lessening the Spanish greatness, being held good for
the common liberty and safety, was esteemed just and honest; according to that
saying, <hi>salus populi suprema lex esto:</hi> for this respect the Duke of
<hi>Feria</hi>'s suspition was not thought just, who seeing the French brought
into <hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Casalle,</hi> and the Grisons parts garti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd
with French, pretended that it was against the Article of Peace, the events
soon shewed that the pretence was not vain, since it was seen that those places
fell into the hands of the French: so as their actions were applauded, and the

the ill advised, ill govern'd, and worse justifiable Spanish Forces; this was
the fruit they reaped of their so much stirring, to no other end, but that they

but in effect to have a Protector of their greater liberty to which they
aspired against the Austrian authority. Much about the time that the Peace of
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> was concluded, a League (as hath been said) was made between
the King of <hi>France</hi> and the King of <hi>Swedland,</hi> in defence of
all common Friends, and of all the German Princes in their oppressed Liberties,
and to restore <hi>Germany,</hi> and the Princes thereof, to the same condition
they were in before the war be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: in which League the King of <hi>France</hi>
obliged himself, to pay 400000 Crowns a year unto the Swede for maintenance of
his Army: which was as much as to set up a Standard in maintenance of the
Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Rebellion, unto which all male-contents might have recourse: nor did
the design prove vain; for after the famous Victory of the Swede and Duke of
<hi>Saxony,</hi> before <hi>Lypsick,</hi> as hath been elsewhere said, wherein
the Emperours Army and that of the League was discomfited, and almost all
slain, and wherein <hi>Tilly</hi> was also sorely wounded; the Protestant

unsatisfied with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian Dominion; taking pretence from their fearing the
Swede, had recourse to the King of <hi>France,</hi> by whom being taken into
protection, they covenanted neutrality between the Swede and the Emperour, and
to permit the King of <hi>France</hi> to pass armed through their Territories;
by means of which protection they were secured from the Swedish Forces; and the
Emperour who was by this means bereft of the adherence and help of almost all
the German Princes, and also openly assaulted by the Swede, and his adherents,
and molested under-hand by the King of <hi>France,</hi> was brought to so low a
condition, as not being well able to withstand so many enemies, the affairs of
the Empire were in a very sad condition; to this was added, that the Duke of
<hi>Bavaria,</hi> who was head of the Catholick League, and the greatest
maintainer of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, and who next to the Elector of
<hi>Saxony</hi> was the greatest support of the Empire and of the house of
<hi>Austria,</hi> especially after <hi>Saxony</hi> his revolt, was also, though
very secretly, confederated with the King of <hi>France;</hi> which King by
Articles of Confederacy was bound to maintain the upper <hi>Palatinate,</hi>
and the Electoral Dignity, for ever, in this Duke, and in the house of
<hi>Bavaria;</hi> which State and Dignity being forfeited by the Prince Elector
<hi>Palatines</hi> Rebellion, were for some years before confer'd by the
Emperor upon this Duke of <hi>Bavaria:</hi> the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which moved this
Prince to this resolution was commonly attributed to jealousie of the peace
made at this time at <hi>Madrid,</hi> between the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and
<hi>England;</hi> for knowing that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
at the con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

State and Dignity upon him, and that the authority and power of the house of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> should be so encreased, and that he had opposed the Emperour
in confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it upon him; and knowing that the King of <hi>England,</hi>
whose Sister was Wife to the Palatine, labour'd hard that the Palatine or his
Son might be restored to their former condition, he thought he had just
occasion to doubt, that the Peace made between the two <pb n="464" facs="tcp:53250:245"/>
Kings, who were for several respects desirous to deprive him of it, might
tacitely contain some Agreement between them, to his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Peace was concluded sent the Abbot <hi>Scaglia</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> in
appearance to treat of Truce and Peace in the Kings Name with the Hollanders,
but in effect to treat o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

against him, as he complain'd, and as the King of <hi>France</hi> had heard;
therefore both <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> easily joyn'd
in this Convention, for their own safeties sake, and that they might make plots
not inferiour to those that were plotted against him. And that they might the
better alienate the Bavarian from the Emperour, the Kings of <hi>France</hi>
and of <hi>Sweden</hi> promised him the Imperial Crown, whereof (when the
Emperour should be beaten) no Germane Prince seemed to be more capable then he,
as being the most powerful of all the Catholick Princes, and who had most care
of the Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and for that he, as one of the Electors, had a Vote
in chusing the Emperour; and his Brother, who was Elector, and Arch-bishop of
<hi>Collen,</hi> another Vote; with whom the Arch-bishop and Elector of
<hi>Triers</hi> would joyn, who was the first that had joyned in League with
the King of <hi>France,</hi> and had received a French Garrison into that

               </gap>ed with these hopes, and

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>'d in his intelligence with the Emperour, and met with a new
accident, which gave him more and better reason to alienate himself from the
Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. The Emperour being reduc'd to great streights by the Swedish Forces,
by the rising of so many people, and by his being deserted by so many Germane
Princes, had (as hath been elsewhere said) for the last remedy of the imminent
danger the Empire was then in, which also threatned him, sent for
<hi>Wallestine</hi> Duke of <hi>Fritland,</hi> and had once more made him
general of all his Forces; for he was the only man on whom it was thought the
welfare of the Empire might sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eliest depend. There had been such high distastes between this
<hi>Wallestine</hi> and <hi>Bavaria,</hi> as the Bavarian in the Diet of
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> had been the chief cause of his being laid aside; and,
doubtlesly, had the Bavarian openly declared against the Emperour, and had
adhered to the contrary Parties, the Affairs of the Empire would have been but
badly sustained: But were it either, that he received such assurances from the
Emperour as took from him all distrust, or, that his hopes of attaining the
Empire seemed but small, especially since both the Kings who offered and
promised it unto him were known to be ambitious of it themselves; or, that he
was at last wisely aware, that the two Kings did desire to separate him from
the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> only that they might weaken it, and so the more
easily suppress it, whereupon his ruine would assuredly succeed; 
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:53250:245"/> he medled not with any novelty, but stood firm and
constant in defence of the Catholick Religion, and of the Imperial Majesty. To
this was added, that the chief ends of the two Kings, and of all the German
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nces, was to restore the
<hi>Palatine</hi> to his former state and dignity: whereof they were much more
troubled then was the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Bavaria</hi> master. He therefore had no reason to
trust them in what was directly contrary to the end of the common Arms, and to
the universal desire and consent of whole <hi>Germany,</hi> which for the
common concernment could not see the <hi>Palatine</hi> deves<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed of his Dominion, and
<hi>Bavaria</hi> indued the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ewith;
and as it might be supposed, that the two Kings, out of these respects, did
promise that unto him which they could not possibly effect; so it might also be
comprehended, that the same <hi>Bavaria</hi> seemed to make league and union
with the two Kings, so to keep the Austrians from depriving him of the State
and Dignity which they had confer'd upon him; so uncertain and fallacious are
the unions and confede<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>acies of
Princes.</p>
            <p>In this wavering condition were the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi>
whereof the King of <hi>France</hi> seemed to be become no lesse Arbitrator,
then of those of <hi>Italy;</hi> for the Swede differ'd much from him in point
of Authority, and profes'd to depend much thereupon, notwithstanding all the
victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries he had gotten, and all the happy course of his prosperity; and the
King of <hi>France</hi> his being deeply ingaged in the affairs of
<hi>Germany</hi> took him much off from the Wars of <hi>Italy;</hi> whereat,
though the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of <hi>Millain,</hi> and the Spanish Agents, were much
troubled, fearing his Forces which they saw were received into the Towns of
<hi>Italy,</hi> yet did not his Forces do any thing after the assignment of
<hi>Pinarollo;</hi> all things passing quietly on, unless it were the
preparations, and several levies of men, the Spaniards being obliged to keep
greater Garrisons, upon occasion of <hi>Pinarollo, Cassalle,</hi> and
<hi>Mantua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The new Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> though peacefully possess'd of
his States, was not at all happy in injoying them; for, not to mention the
troubles which he past thorough, the monies spent, and the dangers which he ran
in arriving at the succession thereof; his Dominions were so lessened, so
dismembred, so consumed and wasted both in men and monies, as his need of
assistance from other Princes, to maintain them, was greater then the authority
or Grandure that he got by them; and having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged his Lands in
<hi>France,</hi> in defending and maintaining his Dominions in <hi>Italy;</hi>
he lost the advantage of both his chiefest Towns, being possess'd by others, he
had little more then the bare name of Principality left him: Nor was he in a
more free and absolute condition of Prince, then when he was a Subject in
<hi>France,</hi> and vassal to that Crown; so as, he who would justly consider
this Prince his condition, must think that his happinesse, in so great
possessions, redounded to his greater misfortune, and that it had been better
for him to have wanted them. To so many calamities and miseries was added the
death of his two onely Sons; the Eldest, who was Prince of <hi>Mantua,</hi>
dyed in <hi>Goito</hi> six dayes before that Town was

his Family fell upon a young Infant, and Son to Princess <hi>Maria,</hi> who

composure of the differences between the Common-wealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> and
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> yet remained; which being severall times treated of,
given over, and re-assumed, could never be brought to perfection. For after
that by Marquess <hi>Rambollie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi>'s departure from <hi>Madrid</hi> the businesse was left
unperfect; <hi>Dom Ramires de Prado</hi> was sent by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
to the Camp before <hi>Rochell,</hi> with commission from the King and
Common-wealth, to negotiate and to conclude that peace: Where, after much
discourse, they came to this conclusion; that <hi>Zuccarello</hi> should remain
to the Common-wealth, upon the payment 100000 Crowns to the Duke, but with
conditon that the Dukes right should be preserved to what soever more monyes he
had disbursed, when he first bought that Marquesate. Neither of the parties,
nor yet the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> were pleased with this peace. For the
Common-wealth was not only troubled at so excessive a sum, at which they
themselves against reason were assessed, but much more for that a gate was left
open for the Duke to make new pretentions, which might occasion new Wars. The
Duke, on the contrary, complained that his interests were valued at no higher a
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ate, and moreover did not accept
of the Peace, because the conspiracy of <hi>Genoa</hi> hapning at the same
time; he took new occasion of complaint, and altercation, upon the impunity
which he pretended unto of the Conspirators, which was denyed by the
Common-wealth: And pretending that their punishment was a breach of the Truce
agreed upon but a little before, he thought that so great an innovation not
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing imbra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>

the peace of <hi>Rochel,</hi> that capitulation was void; which did not
perfectly compose the ancient grievances, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eft the greater and more modern
complaints undecided. And he being at that time joyn'd with the Crown of
<hi>Spain,</hi> upon occasion of the Wars of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> neither had
the King of <hi>France</hi> any authority to make him observe it; nor would the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> exasperate him, to the prejudice of the new conjunction:
And therefore easily laying aside the Common-wealths complaints, touching the
prejudice which she pretended to receive by that peace, he did not inforce the
execution thereof upon her. Thus this peace by the repugnancy of the parties,
and by the tacite consent of the Arbitrators, remained unperfected; and the
continuing of these differences seemed then to make for the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s advantage; for the Common-wealth being necessitated to keep in
Arms, and to entertain many to defend her, the King had an Army maintained at
the Common-wealths charge, whereof he might make use according as the Wars of
<hi>Montferrat</hi> should succeed; this agreement then not being admitted of,
and new occasions of distastes hapning, the Affairs between these two parties
were in greater disorder then ever, and the Spaniards were not well looked upon
by the Common-wealth, for having sided with the Duke in his complaints. In
these difficulties did things continue during Duke <hi>Emanuels</hi> life; when
he was dead, the composure of all differences was by his Son absolutely refer'd
to the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> Wherefore the Common-wealth willingly accepted
of the bargain, but with very expresse and precise exclusion of that 
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:53250:246"/> point which concerned the impunity of the Conspirators,
of whom they would not suffer any mention to be made, it being so exorbitant a
thing, of so bad example; and so contrary to the dignity and safety of
Princes,</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was not well satisfied with this
exclusion, as if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

the Common-wealth should proceed with such limitations and reservations, when
the Duke referr'd all things absolutely to the King; at length, after many
replies, the Commonwealth yielded, and put her self freely upon the

Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, in the composure of differences, acquainting her, that they
would give her better satisfaction then she could hope for from the Court of
<hi>Spain:</hi> But the Common-wealth, which had already referr'd all unto the
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> thought her self not in a condition to accept these
offers; wherefore thanking both of them for their favour shewed towar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Duke, on the contrary, exclaimed against this Decree, and refused to accept of

complained, that the King had been too sparing in limiting the Conspirators, as

backward by the Court of <hi>France</hi> its suggestion; and it seemed that
that Court thought her self prejudiced by this Decree; for that these
differences being to be determined, according to the Peace of <hi>Monsone,</hi>
by both the Kings, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had ended it himself, without
participating therein with the King of <hi>France,</hi> not making any account
of the Peace of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sone,</hi> nor yet of the Peace of <hi>Rochel,</hi>
which by common arbitriment was adjusted between the Commonwealth and the Duke.
It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore suspected, That the Duke, in favour to the French, to whom by
the assignation of <hi>Pinarollo</hi> he seemed to be joyned, would never be
sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with any Declaration that the King could make, to the end that by
this Appeal he might be loose, and, with scorn to the Spanish Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, put
the whole negotiation and decision into the arbitriment of the King of
<hi>France.</hi> This suspition was increased by the King of <hi>France</hi>
his offer to the Commonwealth, That he would end this business with more
satisfaction to her, if she would put it to his arbitriment.</p>
            <p>Affairs stood thus in suspense for some moneths, during which time
the Duke complain'd that so many of his Patrimonial Towns should be de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

by the Abbot <hi>de la Torre,</hi> Resident for the Duke in <hi>Millain,</hi>
the Cardinal declared, That as for them who had served either party with Sword
in hand in the wars, the Pardon should be understood to be free and general;
but as for those who had been guilty of any Commotion since the year 1625. it
should be in the King to declare, whether they should be comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the
Pardon, or no: That the Galley should be restored in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion that it was in at present: That
the Artillery should be delivered by the Commonwealth in <hi>Savona;</hi> and
by the Duke in such places as should be neerest the Commonwealths Territories:
That the Crowns <pb n="479" facs="tcp:53250:247"/> should be understood, according to the
Spanish valuation; and that no mention should be made of the Dukes putting in
security. The Duke accepted of this Declaration, but not the Commonwealth, in
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the first point, wherein power was reserved to the King, if it
should so fall out, whether offenders should be pardoned or no; as well because
the arbitrement seemed to exceed the Articles of <hi>Madrid,</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that
they desired the business might at once be wholly decided, and that no power
should be left in the King to meddle any further in the Commonwealths
jurisdiction, by any Declaration: especially since the general word Commotion
might be understood to reach to many other things, not at the present thought
upon; in respect whereof the Commonwealth held it not good to have any occasion
of coming to dispute with the King; whereupon the Cardinal made a new
Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein he pronounced, that none of those who were Prisoners for
any commotion or other fault, unless such as were named in the peace of
<hi>Madrid</hi> should be conceived to be comprehended in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, save
only such as were Prisoners of War; and that the King should make no further
declaration touching any that were guilty of faults; all things were hereupon
ended, and put in execution; and an end was put to this War made by the Duke,
upon account of <hi>Zuccarello</hi> in appearance; but in effect, by many
Princes who envied the Spanish grandezza, that they might lessen it by
lessening the power of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> so annex'd and so
opportune to the power of <hi>Spain.</hi> The Commonwealth spent in this War
above ten millions of Crowns, which were raised, partly by Taxes from private
Citizens, partly by Gabels and new Impositions: true it is, that many
Fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were computed into these expences; for, not to mention the
les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, <hi>Porto Mauritio, Gavio</hi> and <hi>Savona,</hi> were fortified
with Curtains and Bulwarks Royal; but sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ely and worthy of wonder is the compass of the new Wall made about
the City of <hi>Genoa</hi> its self, upon Mountains which do inviron it, which
beginning from <hi>Capo de la Lanterna,</hi> which is on the West, and going
round upon the back of the Mountains to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, terminates in the
Valley of <hi>Bisagno,</hi> and joyns with <hi>Capo di Carignano,</hi> which is
the utmost and most Easterly point of the City; and turning from thence inward,
along the Maritime shoar, joyns with the ancient Walls, incompassing about
eight miles; the whole Work is almost of Free-stone; and so is, for the most
part, the very Castle it self, which serves for Curtain and Bulwark; except in
some places, where being unequal, it is fil'd up with a strong Wall; which
being pargeted with Lime and Mortar, is not only strong, but very beautiful:
this Fortification is exactly help'd by nature; for the Mountains upon which
the new Walls are built, to boot with their great height, are so steep and
craggy on the out side, as the Walls need fear no assault; the foundations so
sound and firm, as they fear no mining, and seated so far off, as they are

for Souldiers, digging Cesterns in the very Rocks: so as there is nothing left
unprovided for, either by Art or Nature, which may make for the safety and
defence of this great Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick. Art and Nature have been no less propitious and
favourable in the Valley of <hi>Bisagno,</hi> where the situation is plain, and
where there are no Rocks: the Plain lies between two little Hills, which
thrusting out like two wings; serve to the inward Works for two Flanks or great
Bulwarks, from whence the Artillery may clear all the parts below; for the
currant of the River being for the most part gravelly, defends it; moreover,
the Bullets of the Artillery lighting from the two Hills upon the stony bed of
the River would scatter such store of gravel upon the assaulters, as it would
be impossible for them to advance: so as this part, which otherwise would be
less defensible then any other part, is as strong as the rest; nor hath so
large a circuit need of many defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants for being almost unaccessible every
where, the only Sentinels which keep from Scaladoes, and stoln accesses by
night, which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be feared, are sufficient to guard it from any other
misfortune: few and slender <hi>Corps de guarde,</hi> disposed in fitting
places, will suffice to keep off any unexpected attempt; for those mountainous
and rocky places are not subject to any long thought on assaults: there were
divers Inscriptions engraven on the Gates; amongst which this, made by the
Author of this present History, was reputed none of the worst.</p>

            <p>The Commonwealth having thus by peace put an end to the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
of War, might with much reason hope for better time for the future: the
Commonwealth was at this time likewise free from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imminent which
threatned her; the Plague which, as hath been Formerly said, raged in all that
part of <hi>Italy</hi> which lies between the <hi>Alps</hi> and the
<hi>Apenine,</hi> even to the Adriatick, pass'd also into <hi>Tuscany:</hi> so
as the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> being every where begirt by so pestilential a
disease, <pb n="481" facs="tcp:53250:249"/> it seemed almost impossible she could escape
it; and yet such diligence was used, so good Orders given and observed for
three years space, as the State of <hi>Genoa</hi> was not at all touched
therewith, except in some part of the Western River, and beyond the
<hi>Apennine.</hi> The Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> being thus peaceably setled,
this present History might seem to end opportunely here; but three things
(which for not interrupting the History, have not yet been spoken of, and which
may fitly be brought in here) may not be pretermitted, without a blemish to
this Narration. The first whereof is, that the <hi>Infanta Maria,</hi> Sister
to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> Wife to <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> and Son to the Emperour, came from <hi>Spain</hi> into
<hi>Italy,</hi> the year 1631, to pass into <hi>Germany;</hi> and thinking it
dangerous to go through <hi>Lombardy,</hi> by reason of the Plague which was
then very great there, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he thought
to come in her own Gallies through the Adriatick to <hi>Trieste:</hi> but the
Venetians not being willing upon any whatsoever occasion to wave their
pretensions; and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> not being able by reason of so many
Wars to assemble a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Fleet; and howsoever not thinking it fit to expose
his Sisters life to the hazard of a Naval fight; and the Venetians on the other
side, to conveigh her with their own Gallies to <hi>Trieste;</hi> she therefore
parted from <hi>Naples,</hi> where she had been all that Winter, and came to
<hi>Ancona,</hi> and there going into the Gallies of the Commonwealth she was
brought in great glory and splendor to <hi>Trieste<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

name whilst he lived, and in the name of the Church when he should be dead: he
had that happiness dying, which did sufficiently make amends for the loss of
his State; for though that State could not come to his Niece after his death,
he saw her Mistris of a much greater, having married her to <hi>Ferdinando</hi>

Arms, or trouble, or any of those great oppositions which he would have
certainly met with, had they not been wisely foreseen and diverted: by this

of great preemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, worth 12000 Crowns a year, which was hereditary, and

Torrent, fell into the neighbouring Sea, to the infinite prejudice of many
people, and of some Towns, which were thereby burnt. The same Mountain, on the
opposite side belch'd out a swift River of water, which, causing great
inundations, occasioned no less mischief then that of the fire, which burst out
on the other side. The Sea, were it either by reason of the Earthquake, or for
some other hidden cause, fled from the shore; in <hi>Naples</hi> the Ships lay
on ground; and had not the Sea suddenly returned to its former Channel, they
would have incurr'd danger of being broken. Neer to <hi>Sorento</hi> the Sea
flew a mile from the shore; and (which is most miraculous) the rosin, which
being fired fell from the Mountain into the Sea, kept burning for above twelve
miles, insomuch as when the fire ceased, great store of Fishes, rosted by the
fire, floated upon the superficies of the Sea; but none would eat them; for
that very ancient Writers witness, That the like accidents having hapned in the
Seas of <hi>Sicily,</hi> the eating of such Fish caused death.</p>
            <p>It would be tedious to relate many other monstrosities which

upon it, with many Philosophical and Natural Observations, and Considerations,
which are indeed rare and curious, but not worth an Historical Narration.</p>

            <p>THe Peace of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> had it been readily embraced, and

would have put an end to all the troubles and commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Italy</hi> and

<hi>Germany,</hi> and excused but in appearance only, and in respect of the
business of <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> for what concerned the Affairs of

things which hapned afterwards in <hi>Italy,</hi> and which will be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

though they were somewhat molested after the assignment of <hi>Pinarollo,</hi>
yet being somewhat more quiet for a few years, they will afford a fit
opportunity for a short and succinct relation of the warlike actions which

            <p>The League which was made between the King of <hi>France</hi> and
the <hi>Swede,</hi> not long after the Peace of <hi>Ratisbone;</hi> and the
same Kings taking the German Princes into his protection, to the prejudice of
the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours authority, obliged the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to provide for,
and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to watch over the maintaining of the Austrian Empire in
<hi>Gemany,</hi> against which all the Plots and Forces of the King of
<hi>France</hi> were seen to be prepared. For the Declination of the Catholick
Religion, which ran a hazard amidst so many troublesome Wars, did not onely
depend thereupon, but even the declination of his own Dominions, and of the
chiefest concernments of his Crown. Moreover the assignment of
<hi>Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollo,</hi> which was rather forced from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
then voluntarily yielded after the peace was made: and the Citadel at
<hi>Cassalle</hi> being still possess'd and garrison'd by the <hi>French,</hi>
though the King of <hi>Spain</hi> seemed to wink at them; yet since they struck
so sor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> at the very foundation of
his affairs, and of his Dominions in <hi>Italy;</hi> they necessarily invited
him to resent, or to repair these so high attempts against the Peace of
<hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> 
               <pb n="485" facs="tcp:53250:251"/> and the treaties of

            </p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> his continual succouring and fomenting
of the Hollanders did likewise prepare things for a manifest breach of the
common peace; yet both these Kings shun'd coming to an open declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> War; but inwardly hatching their
reciprocal injuries, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared either to revenge received wrongs, or to
keep off those which were threatned. But the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was at the
present troubled most, to see that the King of <hi>France</hi> joyning with the
Hollanders, and Protestant Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> prepared to oppose his
Brother the <hi>Infanta</hi> Cardinal <hi>Ferdinando,</hi> his journey into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> wherein the Cardinall was first to advise, and then to
succeed his Aunt <hi>Clara Eugenia,</hi> who was now grown very old in the
government of those Provinces: And the King thinking that by reason of so many
oppositions, it would be safer for him to go by <hi>Italy</hi> and
<hi>Germany</hi> then by Sea, he knew that it was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to make way for
him by powerfull Armies; wherefore to boot with the great preparation of Arms
and Men, made to this purpose by the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> in the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> it was also thought necessary to molest <hi>France</hi> on
the parts towards <hi>Spain,</hi> as well in regard of this expedition, as for
relieving <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> opposed by the French, that
thereby the King of <hi>France</hi> being strongly assaulted on that side,
might not onely be diverted from opposing the Cardinals journey, but also from
fomenting the Wars of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Orleans,</hi> Brother to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was already gon,
together with the Queen-Mother, from the Court into <hi>Flanders,</hi> was
thought to be a proportionate means, answerable to the assistance given by the
King of <hi>France</hi> to the Rebel Hollanders: Who by making head, and
holding intelligence with many French Lords that were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased at Cardinal
<hi>Richelieu</hi> his too great authority, and at the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of those
times, plotted new broyles in <hi>France;</hi> he holding intelligence with the
Duke of <hi>Momorancy,</hi> Governour of <hi>Languedock,</hi> and peradventure
with the Duke of <hi>Guise,</hi> Governour of <hi>Provence,</hi> obtained 2000
excellent Horse from the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> with which passing at unawares
thorough <hi>France,</hi> without any opposition, (for none durst take up Arms
against the Kings Brother without express com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the King) he came to

                     <desc>•…</desc>

assistance of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Army in <hi>Catalognia,</hi> he
thought to raise commotions in the Kingdom, and to make a strong faction,
whereby he thought to allay the Cardinals authority, and to alter the
Government quite; But being at the very first overcome by the Kings Forces, and
taken Prisoner together with <hi>Momorancy,</hi> that fire was quench'd almost
before it was kindled, which would otherwise have held <hi>France</hi> long in
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion, and consequently have kept the King and <hi>Richelieu</hi> from

               </gap> against the
House of <hi>Austria.</hi> Yet this did not retard the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s
journey; who mounting into the Gallyes at <hi>Barcellona,</hi> some moneths
after <hi>Orleans</hi> his imprisonment, came from thence to <hi>Genoa</hi> the
year 1633. where being received with great pomp, he saw and admired the great
Fabrick of the new Walls, passing from thence to <hi>Millain,</hi> he found the
Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> busie in raising an Army for his conduct, and so
intended to go speedily for <hi>Flanders.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>War grew hotter in <hi>Germany</hi> after the battle of
<hi>Lutzen,</hi> and after the <pb n="486" facs="tcp:53250:252"/> King of <hi>Sweden</hi>'s
death; for neither the Swedish Commanders, nor the German Princes who were
alienated from the Emperour, were any whit dismaid after the Kings death; for
the Swedes, as if their dead Kings Spirit were revived in them, continued the
War with the like Courage and Fortune, and the Princes and people of
<hi>Germany</hi> being desirous of their pretended Liberty, to the recovery
whereof they were with much satisfaction led on by the King, and almost put
into possession, being resolved not to fall from so exalted a beginning by the
death of their Leader, were wholly intent upon this, and joyn'd in heart and in
intelligence; and avoiding all Strife and Emulation, they formed a Faction
which maintaining the dead Kings Quarrel might quell the Austrian Authority,
and might bring them to their desired Liberty.</p>
            <p>Duke <hi>Bernard Waimer,</hi> descended from the ancient Dukes of
<hi>Saxony,</hi> was chosen somewhat tumultuously by the Swedish Army to be
their Captain General, the next day after the battle of <hi>Lutzen;</hi> he was
a Captain of Courage and Authority, and very highly esteem'd in the Army for
his experience and Valour; and moreover a great Enemy to the Austrian Name, for
that his great Grand-Father had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft by <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth of
the Electorall dignity, and of the Dukedom of <hi>Saxony;</hi> and he himself
as descending from him, was kept from it by the subsequent Austrian Emperours.
He muster'd the Souldiers that remained after the battle, and finding them to
amount to the number of 16000 he went with them to joyn with that part of the
Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi>'s Forces, which not being present at the Bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>le was yet fresh and intire; and
entring therewithall into <hi>Saxony,</hi> he drove out the Cesarean Garrisons
who were possess'd thereof before, and did not onely recover the City of
<hi>Lipswick,</hi> but all the rest of the Dukedom, not meeting with any
opposition; for <hi>Wallestein</hi> the Emperours Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, being rather
conquered then Conquerour, had quitted the Field and his Cannon to the Enemy
after the battle, and was retreated with the remainder of his Army into
<hi>Bohemia;</hi> where (partly) minding the recruiting of his Army, (partly)
detain'd by the rigor of the Winter, he suffered the Enemies Army to go whither
it listed. But the German Princes having obtained the same assistance from the
Deputies of the Crown of <hi>Swethland,</hi> which was given them during the
Kings life; and seeing the League confirm'd between the King of <hi>France</hi>
and Crown of <hi>Swethland;</hi> for the affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> they met
in a Dyet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of the year 33, with the chief Officers and
Captains of the Swedish Army, wherein they agreed upon Nine Articles, for the
maintaining of the common cause; and for the maintenance of the War, which they
resolved to continue in <hi>Germany</hi> with like fervour. They made
<hi>Oxenstern</hi> supream Governour of the common affairs, who was Chancellor
of <hi>Swethland,</hi> and who coming into <hi>Germany</hi> with the King,
never parted from him; a man of excellent Wisedom and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Counsell, very
valiant, and long experienced in Civil and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Government; to whom they
gave a certain number of Deputies, chosen out of divers Provinces of
<hi>Germany,</hi> which the Dutch call Circles, who were as so many Senators to
assist in Counsell with him. They then divided all the Forces of their joynt
union into four parts, <pb n="487" facs="tcp:53250:252"/> and made four Armies of them,
which were to carry on the War in four parts of <hi>Germany</hi> under four
Commanders. <hi>Arnheim,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony's</hi> General, a stern
Captain, and little short of <hi>Wallestein</hi> in Military Affairs, was to
enter <hi>Slesia</hi> with the first Army, of which Province the Duke of
<hi>Saxony</hi> meant to make himself Master. The second was given to the Duke
of <hi>Lunenburg,</hi> who was therewith to fall upon <hi>Westphalia.</hi> The
third was assigned to Duke <hi>Weymer,</hi> who falling from the General-ship,
to which he was chosen by the Army by this reformation, was to enter therewith
into <hi>Franconia.</hi> Marshal <hi>Horne,</hi> and Col. <hi>Bannier,</hi>
were appointed to command the fourth, two of the most famous Captains of the
Swedish Army; and <hi>Suevia</hi> and <hi>Alsatia</hi> fell to their share.
These going into their several divisions, kindled a fire like so many Infernal
Furies in four parts of <hi>Germany;</hi> which bursting forth into a greater
flame afterwards did lay it so waste and desolate, as the desolations made
during the Kings life were far inferiour to them. For overrunning several
Provinces, which were sometimes taken by the Swedes, sometimes retaken by the
Imperalists, these Provinces served onely for a Theatre or Scene, whereon
horrible spectacles of sad events were represented: it would be tedious, and
not suiting to our purpose, to relate distinctly the encounters, losses, and
victories, or the ruine of the poor people, the surrendrings, sacking, and the
firing of Cities which were taken, and of making Provinces Widernesses; for the
several actions of every several Army, would administer subject enough for a
particular Story. We will therefore limit our selves to those which were most
famous, and which belong chiefly to the main of the Empire, and particularly,
to such as may by connexion participate with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures of <hi>Italy,</hi>
or which may have some influence upon them: And so keeping to this, as to the
main body of the Tree, since we cannot im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the rest, we will leave out the
Boughes and Branches, which will contribute but a little to the structure of
this Digression; the intention whereof is onely (as hath been said) to make the
way plain for the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what hapned afterward in <hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Horne</hi> and <hi>Banniere</hi> having done many things with
good success in <hi>Alsatia</hi> and <hi>Suevia,</hi> sate down before
<hi>Brisack,</hi> a very strong Town up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the left side of the
<hi>Rheine,</hi> between <hi>Basil</hi> and <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>asburg,</hi> a place of great consequence, not only by
reason of the neighbouring Bridge, but for the situation thereof, which lay
very convenient for <hi>Italy, Burgondy, Alsatia,</hi> and <hi>Lorrain;</hi>
and having made good progress before it, they had brought it unto great
streights: it therefore behoved the Emperour and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
for their joynt interest, to have an eye to it, and to endeavour, that the loss
thereof might not redound to the too great prejudice of the confining
Provinces, and to both their affairs; and particularly, that the loss thereof
might not be too great an obstacle to the Infanta's journey; who thinking to
enter into <hi>Lorrain</hi> by <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and from thence into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> by the Dukedom of <hi>Luxemberg,</hi> which was his shortest
and safest way; could hardly prosecute this his intent, if that Town should be
taken by the enemy. The Emperour had no Forces in those parts, save what were
under <hi>Aldringer</hi> in <hi>Bavaria;</hi> the gross of his Army wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
towards <hi>Bohemia</hi> under <hi>Wallestein;</hi> and <hi>Aldrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> 
               <pb n="488" facs="tcp:53250:253"/> Forces not being sufficient of themselves to relieve
<hi>Brisack,</hi> it was resolved that the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> should in all
haste joyn with <hi>Aldringer,</hi> and go together with him to the relief of
so important a place; and thus as a forerunner make way for the Infanta's
passage: the Swedish Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders had intelligence of this, and of what Forces
were to come; and finding themselves too weak for them, they thought they might
easily hinder them by making themselves masters of <hi>Constance,</hi> an
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial City, seated upon that Lake which the neighbouring <hi>Rheine</hi>
makes, and which taking its name from that City is called the Lake of
<hi>Constance;</hi> wherefore <hi>Horne</hi> leaving <hi>Banniere</hi> before
<hi>Brisack,</hi> with as many forces as were sufficient to maintain the Siege,
went with the rest to the taking of <hi>Constance,</hi> which if he should do,
he might keep the two Armies from meeting; and hearing that <hi>Feria</hi>
advanced apace with a powerful Army, he would not betake himself to the
tediousness and uncertainty of a Siege, but fell to take it by assault, before
that by <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>'s coming the two Armies should joyn; but his design
proved vain, as did also his fierce assaults wherewith he thought to effect his
intent; for the defence being stronger then the assaults, by reason of the
conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual re-inforcement of munition that entred the City daily, the business
drew on in length, till such time as <hi>Feria</hi>'s Army appeared.
<hi>Feria</hi> came from the State of <hi>Millain</hi> about the end of
<hi>August,</hi> and passing through the <hi>Valtoline</hi> was come to the

Trenches, by some Troops of Dragoons, and Files of Musketeers, which advanced
from the enemies Camp; after which they retreated to beyond the <hi>Danow,</hi>
burning the Bridge which they pass'd over, to keep themselves from being
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the enemy; so they retreated into the Country of
<hi>Wittenberg,</hi> thinking that the enemy being to take <hi>Rinfeld,</hi>
and three other lesser <pb n="489" facs="tcp:53250:253"/> Cities, before they could come to
<hi>Brisack, Brisack</hi> would be forced to surrender for Famine, before the
succour could come: but <hi>Rinfeld</hi> and all the other Cities yielded at
the first appearance of the enemy, within 24 hours; and <hi>Feria</hi> and
<hi>Aldringer</hi> made such haste, as coming to <hi>Brisack,</hi> they found
the enemy retreated from thence; having brought in the succour, they made not
any abode there, but hardly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording their men leave to breathe, they went
towards <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained many Towns which had been taken by the
enemy; and made good progress in those parts; and had made greater, and
peradventure had wholly defeated the enemy, if <hi>Aldringer</hi> had
co-operated sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the begun enterprise, and in their ruine; or had not
the Dutch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, naturally averse to that of the Spaniards, gain-said so
gallant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. <hi>Feria</hi> was entred <hi>Germany</hi> with Title of
the Emperours Commander, from whom he had received ample Letters Patents,
whereby he was not to be subject to the command or superiority of any other
Captain: this so large and independent authority of <hi>Feria</hi> caused not
only envy and emulation in <hi>Wallestein,</hi> who hated the name of a
Spaniard, but jealousie and despite; for not being able to indure that by the
entrance of another Army into <hi>Germany,</hi> which should have no dependence
upon him, that supream and universal authority should be lessened in him,
without which he profess'd he would not have taken upon him the Generals
command, and therewith the defence of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> he began to doubt that
that body of armed men, which had no dependence upon him, had been secretly
procured by the Spaniards, who much distrusted his intentions; and been brought
into <hi>Germany</hi> by them, not only to moderate his authority, but his
actions also; and to oppose his forces and his ends, and his too high
machinations, which he found the Spaniards feared he had plotted in his mind;
and by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press Order from the Emperour, not being able to keep
<hi>Aldringer</hi> from going from <hi>Bavaria</hi> to joyn with <hi>Feria</hi>
in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> yet he sent him such Orders (as <hi>Aldringer,</hi> in his
own discharge and justification, made known after <hi>Fritlands</hi> death) as
the execution thereof was likely rather to occasion the ruine of that Army and
Enterprise, then the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; he could not tolerate that that
Army should advance with such success so far into <hi>Germany,</hi> whilst he
stood looking on: whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Aldringer,</hi> that he might obey the Orders
of the General (whose excessive authority, joyn'd to his fierce genius, was
more formidable, and more punctually observed, then the Emperours benign
Orders) did not co-operate sincerely in enterprises with <hi>Feria;</hi> but
abusing the best occasions of warfaring, was not only a hinderance, but a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, and prejudicial to the proceedings which had been effected, if he
had proceeded sincerely with <hi>Feria:</hi> the necessity that both of them
were in to pass with their Armies into <hi>Bavaria,</hi> whither they were sent
for with much anxiety and eagerness, by the Emperour, occasioned yet more harm,
and had likely to have been the whole ruine of <hi>Feria</hi>'s Army; which
that it may be the better understood upon what occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they hapned, we must
leave <hi>Alsatia</hi> and the parts of upper <hi>Germany,</hi> and pass into
<hi>Saxony</hi> and the lower <hi>Germany;</hi> and anticipately relate some
accidents which hapned there.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Wallestein,</hi> having tarried after the Battle of
<hi>Lutzen</hi> almost <pb n="490" facs="tcp:53250:254"/> all the Winter in
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> though he was very sollicitous in raising men, and in
recruiting his Army, that he might come into the Field in the beginning of the
Spring; yet reflecting upon the miserable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Germany,</hi> upon
the uncertainty and danger of War, and upon the ruines which might thereupon
ensue, he applied himself to reduce the publick safety into some sort of
security, by counsel, and without effusion of blood; he therefore laboured to
bring the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> off from the League of the German Princes,
and to reunite him upon any terms to the Emperour; which if he could have done,
he verily believed that that Prince being the fundamental Basis of the
aforesaid League, he being removed, the League would immediately fall to the
ground; and that the Ele<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tor of
<hi>Brandenberg</hi> and many other lesser Princes would follow his example: so
as that faction which joyn'd in Arms with the Swedes against the Emperour,
being weakned, would infallibly be dissolved; and that the Cesarean party being
so encreased, the lesser Princes would come in to <hi>Cesar,</hi> some suing
for pardon, some for composition; and then the Swedes being but few in number,
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of the German assistance, and bereft of the Maritime parts, would be
brought to such a condition, as not being able to receive any supplies from
their own Kingdom, they would be shut up, and as it were, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned in
<hi>Germany,</hi> and left to the discretion of the Cesarean party. Thus he
thought it a better and a safer way, for the publick safety, to quench so great
a fire of War by these Articles, then by the shedding of blood; this which
might really have been believed to be an assured wholsome Counsel, if it had
been practised by fitting and adequate means, would doubtlesly have brought the
Affairs of the Empire into a better condition of safety; but being endeavoured
by odd and foolish ways it did no good, but injured the publick welfare very
much, and wronged the Inventer thereof much more; for <hi>Fritland</hi> coming
out of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in the beginning of the Spring, in the year 1634, with
a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Army, he pass'd therewith into <hi>Slesia;</hi> where lighting upon
the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in the parts about <hi>Suainitz,</hi> who were far short in numbers
to him; instead of giving them battle, wherein he might have been sure of
Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, he was the first who desired agreement and composure of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences:
to which purpose a Truce was appointed for 15 days, to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate it; during
which time, so shameful Agreements were capitulated, as it was reported,
between General <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>llestein</hi> and <hi>Arnheim,</hi> and other of the Colleagues
Deputies, as none more pernicious, nor ruinous for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the
Sacred Empire, could have been made; thereby whole Province; of the Empire,
were divided to the advantage of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Princes. <hi>Wallestein</hi>
claimed the Kingdom of <hi>Bohemia</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in just reward of many
labours undergone, and dangers by him run for the good of the Empire; many
other things were agreed upon in favour to Heresie; such Laws were given to
<hi>Germany</hi> as pleased the Confederate Princes, enemies to the Emperour;
and for the upshot, General <hi>Fritland</hi> obliged himself to joyn his
Forces with those of the enemy, against whosoever should dare to oppose the
putting of those Capitulations in execution, not excluding the Emperour
himself, who received so much prejudice thereby, and whose concernments were so
ill dealt with: these Capitulations being agreed upon, which seemed 
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:53250:254"/> rather to be horrible treasons and seditious Rebellions,
were subscribed by General <hi>Wallestein,</hi> and were delivered to
<hi>Arnheim</hi> and the rest who negotiated therein; which when they were
divulged, gave, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reason, great cause to suspect and distrust the
actions and intentions of the Propounder, and who being servant to the Emperour
had agreed thereunto; whereupon, though <hi>Wallestein</hi> did afterward
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, that his intention in propounding them was to deceive the enemy, and
to induce them by so large concessions, to drive the Swedes out of
<hi>Germany;</hi> which when it should be done, <hi>Cesar</hi> would be
superiour in Forces, and might give them the Law, and force them to accept of
any conditions. <hi>Arnheim</hi> and the other Deputies having received the
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations took their leaves of <hi>Fritland,</hi> and were already gone;
when not being gone one league off, they were troubled, that in this Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
no mention was made of the Swedes, whether they were to tarry in
<hi>Germany,</hi> or to go out: which hapned, because each party standing upon
their advantage in the Negotiation, desired that such proposal should be made
by the other side; but being afterwards aware, that what was agreed upon was
not safe, unless the establishment of this point were therein comprehended,
they resolved to return to the Camp, and have it cleared by the General; who
being interrogated thereupon, it is not known, whether as being terrified
thereat, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting what he had done, he imbraced the occasion which might
make for his justification; or whether continuing in his first design of
bringing the business to that good end for which he profess'd he had moved it;
he freely answered, that the Swedes were to be prosecuted with the common
forces, and ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>irpated as
disturbers of the publick peace of <hi>Germany;</hi> and he was so resolute in
this point, as no reason which could be alledged to the contrary being able to
alter his determination; (and <hi>Arnheim</hi> and his companions consenting,
by no means, that the Swedes should be driven out) the Capitulations were
cancel'd, and the Treaty of Agreement was at the same time almost concluded,
and broken: yet the Capitulation was so detestable, as all men were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
much scandalized with it: the rather for that <hi>Wallestein</hi> strove not to
regain his credit afterwards by contrary actions, nor to cancel the sinister
opinions which he had thereby purchased: but, as if he scorned the vulgar
opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> giving them new colours, he did consolidate them more and more,
till in time they proved pernicious to him. The Capitulations being broken,
<hi>Wallestein</hi> sent part of his Forces to assault <hi>Saxony;</hi> which
made the Duke thereof recall his men from <hi>Slesia</hi> to defend himself;
<hi>Arnheim,</hi> immediately after he had received his Princes Orders, marched
with his Army towards <hi>Saxony;</hi> leaving a Garrison in <hi>Slesia</hi>
under the old Count <hi>de Toure,</hi> a chief Lord of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> whose
authority was so great in the Diets of that Kingdom, as the <hi>Palatine</hi>
acknowledged his promotion to that Crown from thence, which made the Count be
declared a Rebell by the Emperour: <hi>Arnheim</hi> also left Colonel
<hi>Tubal</hi> one of the chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>est
of the Swedish Commanders, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the Count. <hi>Wallestein</hi> kept
behind <hi>Arnheim,</hi> having also left as many men in <hi>Slesia</hi> as
<hi>Arnheim</hi> had done; but when he saw <hi>Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heim</hi> so far advanced,
as he could not return to succour the Count in <hi>Slesia,</hi> he faced about,
and returning speedily to <hi>Slesia,</hi> he came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:53250:255"/> just then when his men were ready to fight the enemy;
and he did so surround the enemy, as he took the Count and Colonel Prisoners,
and gave life and liberty to all the other Souldiers and Officers, upon
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that they would march into the Emperours quarters, and joyn
themselves to the Cesarean Army; but the Colonel finding a means quickly how to
escape, made men suspect that <hi>Wallestein</hi> had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand given him his
liberty, as he had openly given him his life. The Count having bargained for
his own liberty delivered up the Towns in <hi>Slesia</hi> which were yet in his
power; and those of least consequence being delivered up, the <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and which commanded all the Province, and which by agreement was to be

were not effectually delivered up: which not being done, and the Count not
returning, <hi>Fritland</hi> was still more blamed of collusion with both the
prisoners; and much more, for that having sent so many of the enemies to the
Emperours Army, he was thought to have done it, for that owing their lives to
him they should upon all occasions depend upon him; yet professing himself
abused by the Count, and breathing out nothing but revenge, he went with his
Army to <hi>Turingia</hi> and <hi>Lusat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> Provinces which belonged to the Emperour, but
were in the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> his possession; and prosecuting his former
designs he seemed resolved to make that Duke and the Marquess of
<hi>Brandenberg</hi> make peace with the Emperour; he therefore made much
progress there, took many Towns, amongst others, <hi>Franckfort</hi> upon the
<hi>Od<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r,</hi> and
<hi>Lansperg</hi> in <hi>Marca di Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> both of them great Cities,
and of much consequence; whereby he made way for passing further into the march
in the Country of <hi>Brandenberg</hi> and in <hi>Pomerania;</hi> in which case
if he should come to the Coasts of the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, he would keep (as
he threatned to do) the Swedes from being relieved from that Kingdom, and from
retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereinto: these threats, accompanied by the multitude of his
Forces, and by his happy success, did so terrifie those Electors, as finding
themselves unable to make resistance, they press'd very eagerly for relief from
the Confederates; protesting that that if they were aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, they must be
forc'd to abandon the Common Cause, and joyn with the Emperour.
<hi>Oxenstern</hi> and the other Heads of the League were divided in their
judgements, not knowing whether they were to abandon or to relieve those
Princes; for by abandoning them, to boot with the great errour they should
commit therein, and to boot with the loss of reputation, they foresaw the
manifest ruine of their party and union. On the contrary, if they should
relieve them, they must quit all upper <hi>Germany</hi> to the Emperour, so
full of Cities and Towns upon the <hi>Rheine</hi> and the <hi>Danow,</hi> which
so much to their praise and encrease of Dominion they had won; and from whence
they got infinite contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Moneys, Men, Victuals and Munition; which
Towns and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories being abandoned were necessarily to fall into the
Emperours power, if they should go to relieve <hi>Saxony;</hi> and they should
thereby infinitely weaken themselves and strengthen the Emperour: so amidst
these streights they pitch'd their thoughts upon <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which
<hi>A'drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> 
               <pb n="493" facs="tcp:53250:255"/> being gone into <hi>Alsatia,</hi>
was bereft of all defence; and they held it their absolute best course to fall
upon it with all the Forces they could assemble; taking it for granted that
when they should have won that Dukedom, the way would be open for them to enter
<hi>Austria,</hi> and to come even to <hi>Vienna;</hi> they were confident that
by this noble and generous diversion, without loss of honour, or of any thing
they had gotten, nay by making yet much greater acquisitions, they might bring
that relief to the Electors which they could not do if they should go direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to their relief with all their Forces, without manifest loss of honour and what
they had gotten; for the Emperour being assaulted in the midst of his Empire
would be forced to recall his Army from offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Electors, to defend
himself; so as <hi>Fritlands</hi> cunning would be deluded, and his counsels
countermined wherewith he had fancied unto himself to destroy their League: The
success out-did the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of so noble and generous a resolution; for
Duke <hi>Weymer</hi> being deputed to execute it, he with 50 Cornets of Horse,
and 15000 Foot, took both sides of the <hi>Danow,</hi> and coasting along came
to <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> where sitting down at unawares, he after several
batteries forc'd it to surrender within 12 days: having gotten it, he advanced
and took <hi>Strau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingen</hi> and <hi>dechendorfe,</hi> great Towns upon the
<hi>Rheine,</hi> and with such gallant acquisitions advanc'd towards
<hi>Austria;</hi> so as the Court of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> was in more fear then the
Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Brandenberg</hi> had been by
<hi>Wallesteins</hi> proceedings: it was therefore resolved to send him precise
Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to return, and relieve <hi>Austria;</hi> who being unwilling to
give over so happy success, and the great advantage which he hoped to reap
thereby for the publick welfare, was troubled much at <hi>Cesars</hi> Commands;
thinking that if that part of <hi>Germany</hi> should withstand the enemies
assaults a little longer, the assailants would be forced to change their
course, and leave <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Austria</hi> free to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
so to relieve <hi>Saxony</hi> and the lower parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> which
for their own safeties sake they could not abandon; but this his backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
being badly interpreted by the Court, which was not well satisfied with his
late and former actions; as if being more desirou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that <hi>Bavaria</hi> should be lost, then relieved,
he valued not the danger of <hi>Austria,</hi> so as he might revenge himself
upon that Prince; he was at last, but much against his will, forced to obey the
Emperours re-iterated Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: he therefore abandoned that Country, and
quitted the so many Triumphs which he had won; and when he was come within
twenty leagues of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> hearing that that Town was surrendered,
he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced no further; but finding that the enemy drew neer <hi>Passao,</hi>
a very strong place, situated upon the <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

for <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and less for <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia,</hi> he retreated into
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> and came with all his men into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Pilsen:</hi>
the loss of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which forced the Emperour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<hi>Wallestein</hi> from <hi>Saxony,</hi> forc'd him also to send for
<hi>Aldringer</hi> from <hi>Alsatia,</hi> to relieve <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which
was powerfully assaulted by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues; whose departure was necessarily
accompanied by <hi>Feria,</hi> who wanting men, and being abandoned by
<hi>Aldringer,</hi> could not tarry long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with safety in that Country; nor
could <hi>Aldringer</hi> tarry safely in <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satia</hi> 
               <pb n="494" facs="tcp:53250:256"/> without <hi>Feria,</hi> nor retreat safely into
<hi>Bavaria:</hi> so as, for their joynt security, which by disunion would have
been indangered, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved them to joyn in abandoning <hi>Alsatia,</hi> and
in prosecuting that voyage; and <hi>Feria</hi> being necessitated to follow the
same way that the Dutch had gone in the midst of Winter, to the great hardship
and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of his men, who begging quarter and lodging, which were
ransack'd and ruin'd by the Dutch who had gone before, and quite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of all
provisions, they could not get victuals for any money; by which sufferings, and
by reason of the cold weather which was very great that Winter, and which the
Spaniards and Italians, who are born under more benigne heavens, could not well
endure, and being also often gauled by the enemy, that Army was miserably
wasted, great hardships having occasioned frequent and dangerous sickness in
it: being at last, after so many sufferings, gotten into <hi>Bavaria,
Feria</hi> died of a Fever in <hi>Monaco,</hi> and left the charge of his men
to Count <hi>Serbellone;</hi> and as by <hi>Wallesteins</hi> departure from the
parts neer <hi>Saxony</hi> all the acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions which he had made returned to
their former condition, so by the departure of these two Armies all
<hi>Alsatia</hi> reverted into the Swedes possession, who returning to
<hi>Brisack</hi> soon brought it into the former streights: The
<hi>Infanta</hi> not being able therefore to build any longer upon that Army,
for his journey into <hi>Flanders,</hi> nor for the freeing of that Town; and
it behoving him to take his journey the sooner, for that in the beginning of
<hi>December</hi> 1633, the <hi>Infanta</hi> his Aunt left this world; and the
Provinces of <hi>Flanders</hi> wanting a supream head by her death, press'd
very much for his coming; new Orders were therefore to be given, and new levies
of men were to be made; wherein neither the <hi>Infanta</hi> nor the Spanish
Agents in <hi>Italy</hi> were slack, who diligently sent out Orders, some for
men, some for other necessaries for that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; and though the Crowns,
Provinces and Kingdoms, were much exhausted by the select choice made by
<hi>Feria,</hi> the year before, yet ere <hi>May</hi> was over, the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> was full of new Military men, most whereof were old Souldiers
of several Nations, commanded by men very considerable, not only for noble
birth, but for valour and long experience in war. Count <hi>Monterei</hi> sent
6000 Foot, and 1000 Horse from <hi>Naples,</hi> all good men, and excellently
well armed, under his Heir, the Marquess of <hi>Torazzona,</hi> two Brigades of
Foot were raised in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> the one by Prince <hi>Doria,</hi> at his
own expence, who were commanded by <hi>Carlo Gausco,</hi> Camp-master, the
other in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> by Marquess <hi>Lunato.</hi> Marquess
<hi>Spinola</hi> raised also 500 Horse at his own cost; and moneys were paid
out of <hi>Cesars</hi> Court for recruiting Duke <hi>Feria</hi>'s Army:
<hi>Wallestein</hi> was demanded to send 4000 Horse of those that were in
<hi>Cesars</hi> Army; which he refused to do, pretending that he could not
lessen his Army; but indeed, because he did not like that this other Army which
had no dependency upon him should enter <hi>Germany;</hi> fearing that the
Authority and Grandezza of such a Prince might eclipse his; and moreover, that
the Spanish Agents against whom all his thoughts were bent, might triumph over
him. The <hi>Infanta</hi> therefore, that he might take from him his pretence
of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, gave order that moneys should be issued out of the Cesarean Court,
for the raising of so many Horse in <hi>Hungary,</hi> which should sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

drew after it; and for the discourse and impression which it occasioned in the

thereof; though it was occasioned by many things which have already been spoken

into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>road, will delight to be joyntly instructed with the German
events, and with the sinister contrivals of this Commander, which brought him
to his end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Albertus Wallestein,</hi> Duke of <hi>Fritland,</hi> being
deposed in the Diet at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> as hath been said, from being
General of the Cesarean Forces, and being afterward out of urgent necessity
recalled to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer charge by the Emperour, was a man of much valour, and
of no less fortune and authority; and such a one, as if the things done by him
in <hi>Germany</hi> be well observed, he certainly deserves the first place of
as many Dutch Commanders as ever arrived at the height of fame and glory: he
deserved well of the Empire, but much better of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, whose supream
authority upheld by the valour and fortune of this Commander, rise to as great
a height as did the like of any Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for many late years: he held that
place with so absolute command and independency, as his not valuing even the
Emperours commands was not imputed to him for disobedience or contumacy, but to
his greater zeal of good Government, and to his better steering of affairs;
which being govern'd as he listed proved better for the Grandezza of the
Empire: so as whatsoever transgression being done by another 
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:53250:257"/> would not only have been accounted a fault, but would
have been se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely punished, being done by him was exempt from all suspition
of errour: nor was his fidelity less then his authority, whereby he won so much
credit of the Emperour, as his Imperial Majesty could never believe that any
spot of Felony could ever enter so faithful a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders breast: yet could he
not continue so long the course of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted credit and sovereign
authority, but that he wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

last, forc'd unfortunately to submit to the natural vicissitude of all humane
things; and though experience teacheth us, that it is a natural and fatal
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety for all things, when they are come to the height of greatness, to be
subject to declination and ruine, yet if we will abstract the fall of this so
great and worthy Commander from the hidden, and by us unknown properties, of
humane vicissitude, and shall seek for any more apparent cause of so great a
down-fall, it may be imputed chiefly to two things. First, to his zeal of
sustaining the Cesarean dignity against the prime Princes of <hi>Germany;</hi>
who thinking the Emperours greatness to be a lessening of theirs, set
themselves fiercely against him upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as against him who valued
not the abasing of the common liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Germany,</hi> so as he might
maintain the Emperours greatness; to which was annex'd a second cause, his
fierce and arrogant nature, by which he regula<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed his actions; for seeing himself firmly seated in the Chariot of
supream authority, he was so encouraged, as knowing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self able to do all
things, he thought he might lawfully do so: so as when his authority was not
grown to that height, nor so generally ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, his faults were imputed to the
pride of his imperious genius, and therefore easily pardoned, the greatness of
his merits being considered; so when the chiefest men found themselves thereby
injured in their power, and that they began to examine his faults with spleen
and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, they turned them into disloyalty, perfidiousness, sedition, and
into affected tyranny, procured by mis-becoming and scandalous ways: when the
Command<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

from the haughtiness of his revengeful spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; it was thought that like an

endeavour'd to get the Imperial diadem for himself: so as not unlike
<hi>Narses,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with the Barbarians against the Emperour
<hi>Iustinian,</hi> he was suspected to hold secret intelligence with the King
of <hi>Swedland,</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and with the other Confederates,
against the Emperour, and that he plotted the ruine of <hi>Germany;</hi> for
the invading, and taking of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> by the Swedish and Saxon Forces,
which hapned a little after his deposal, and the rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to <hi>Tilly,</hi> who was made General of the Emperours Forces, was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
attributed to his counsel and instigation: but he evidenced his si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
intentions yet more when the Emperour recalled him, when after the loss of
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> the affairs of the Empire were in very bad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: 
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:53250:257"/> he was doubtlesly upon that occasion bound willingly to
offer his endeavours for the sustaining of his Prince and Country, even with
the hazard of his life; but the haughtiness of his proud spirit kept him from
doing so noble and worthy an action; for being re-called he seemed so far from
accepting it, as at the first he absolutely refused it, and at last, making use
of the streights and ruine whereinto he saw the publick safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was brought,
and of the necessity which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ad
of his assistance, he had the boldness to demand so insolent and arrogant
conditions from the Emperour, as one that had conquer'd his Sovereign could not
have propounded prouder: 
<q>Amongst other things he required (and such was the necessity, as
  it must be granted him) that his Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trement might be absolute, not only over
  the Arms and Souldiers, but in making war and peace, insomuch as it should not
  be lawful for the Emperour to give him any Order or Commission which might
  con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the manner of making war, or the negotiating or concluding peace;
  which wars or peace he might conclude or exclude without the Emperour, but not
  the Emperour without him: he would have the choice and disposal of all Captains
  and Officers of the Army; the like of the Governours of Provinces, even such as
  were patrimonial to the Emperour; that the exacting of Tributes and Revenues,
  the distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of Goods gotten or confiscated by war, might absolutely
  be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him; and finally, that it should not be in the Emperours power to
  deprive him of the Authority of being General, unless he should give him six
  moneths warning thereof before hand.</q> A greater Authority certainly then
Dictatorship, which if it were always thought dangerous in a Commonwealth, it
was not only incompatible under a Sovereign Prince, as being d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

altogether unsufferable and unpracticable; and the granting thereof being
nothing else but the bereaving a Prince of the essentiality, and the leaving
him scarcely the bare name and meer semblance of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty; it could not
only be practised without manifest injury to Sovereign Power, but not so much
as fall within the thought of a good Subject: so great a concession forced by
himself was therefore unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, dangerous to the whole Empire, and the more

of injuries received, so inexo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

according to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; wherein he had no moderation of counsel, nor curb
to his ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: to this was added, for the greater prejudice of the present
conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affairs, the great sway which he had purchased with all the
Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary men of <hi>Germany,</hi> who appeared ready to obey his beck; every
one therefore foresaw, that the excessive authority which of meer necessity was
granted him, would rather make him aspire to greater things, and putting
himself in a posture of giving Laws to <hi>Germany,</hi> rather then to free
her from the calamities which she lay under. He was not wanting in co-operating
to these Prognostications; for his having abandoned the Field in the Battle of
<hi>Lutzen,</hi> and his Artillery to the enemy, who might easily have been
then vanquished, if instead of retreating he had sent for <hi>Gallasso</hi>'s
intire and fresh Forces, and those of other Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders <pb n="498" facs="tcp:53250:258"/>
who were not present at the Battle, and recruited his Army there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and
assaulted the enemies Camp, without giving them leave to breathe, whilst it was
astonished by the Kings death, and by the loss of so many men who were slain in
that conflict, was an action badly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, and which argued much errour: his
having after this canto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized himself in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and suffer'd the
enemy which was confused and half routed to ralley, and to recover
<hi>Lypfick</hi> and almost all <hi>Saxony</hi> so easily, which were before
possess'd by the Cesarean Forces; and on the contrary, his having recalled
<hi>Aldringer</hi> from <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and his hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring <hi>Ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ere</hi> at the same time from
recovering his own State, were circumstances, which added to the former
appeared very strange, and did more aggravate his conduct of Forces which were
so freely and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely refer'd to him: but what hapned afterwards before
<hi>Suainitz,</hi> and those infamous Capitulations stipulated therewith the
Emperours enemies did more undeniably convince his loyalty, who had first let
slip so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> an occasion of
quelling the Emperours Enemies and Rebels: his not having afterward suppress'd
Count <hi>Torres</hi> and Colonel <hi>Tubal,</hi> as he easily might have done,
and his having let them both escape when they were his prisoners, and his
having listed the enemies Souldiers in the Cesarean Militia, were great
inforcements for the staining the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of his fidelity: his appearing
afterwards so repugnant to <hi>Cesars</hi> Commands, when seeing
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> assaulted by the enemy, and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi> cry for
succour when in such danger, not caring for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that so noble
Province and important City; and after the loss of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> his so
little care to recover it, whilst the enemies were not yet fortified there; and
his not betaking himself to defend <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which after the loss of
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> was subject to the enemies inroads; but having in lieu
thereof cantonized himself again in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> without acquainting the
Emperour therewith, did yet more aggravate the suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, not to say the
faults, of his preceding actions: being come into <hi>Bohemia</hi> with all the
blame which was laid upon him, he took no care to acquir himself thereof, but,
as if all things had been lawful for him, he fell into greater and more
important errours: he had (as hath been said) drawn the hatred and anger of the
Electors upon him; for having contrary to custom quartered his Army in their
Dominions; he now began to take the same license in the Emperours Hereditary
Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie; an action which as it redounded much to the prejudice of his
Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Majesty, so was it diversly construed; some attributed it to pride
and neglect of the Emperour, as if by reason of the supream power which he had
obtained from the Emperour, he cared not to use that power against the Donor;
some, to his resentment for having been drawn contrary to his genius from the
war against lower <hi>Germany,</hi> to defend <hi>Bavaria;</hi> the greatest
part suspected that under presence of quartering his Souldiers in the Cesarean
Territories, he intended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt the City and Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> and
to imprison the Emperour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Forces: moreover, the jealousie which he
had conceived a little before at the entring of the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi>'s
Army into <hi>Germany</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Empire, and of <hi>Constance</hi>
and <hi>Brifack,</hi> and his yet greater apprehension and incensement which he
shew'd afterwards against the Army led by the <hi>Infanta:</hi> having so
perfidiously endeavoured the raine <pb n="499" facs="tcp:53250:258"/> of the former, and
the exclusion of the other out of <hi>Germany,</hi> were evident signs of his
being highly displeased with those Forces, thinking that they were brought into
<hi>Germany,</hi> only to curb and counterpoise his Army, and to secure the
Empire against the novelties and revolutions which all the world apprehended
from his scandalous and abusive Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and though these and the like
actions of this great Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, being weighed in a more curious balance,
might seem to have their defences (as all humane, but especially Military
actions never want) yet did they not at all lessen the finister impressions
radicated and accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by his so many misdemeanors in mens minds, wherewith
they were generally so scandalized, as not admitting any defence, they all
stood expecting some monstrous and formidable products of so immense
au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in a man so fierce, so irritated, and so apparently ill inclined;
and the total of Religion, and of the Empire, being treated of, they thought
their suspicions certain; every one therefore had a lash at him, all men
exclaimed against him; and with open months desired that provision might be
made against the so neer and so certain danger: only the Emperour, who still
confided in his loyalty whom he had ever found faithful to him, was of a
contrary opinion, and would not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out manifest proofs condemn his Officers;
and some of the chief men who assisted the Emperour, prevailed upon either by
great rewards or promises, approved of the Emperours disposition, and excusing
the faults which were imputed to him endeavoured by many arguments to assert
his innocence: there were two sorts of persons that this mighty man had made
his enemies, the Spanish Agents, and the Jesuites; he was not mealy-mouthed
towards either of these: of the former he was wont to say, That it was better
being succoured by them with moneys, then with men; and that both of them were
to be absolutely banish'd out of <hi>Germany;</hi> and it was said, that the
banishment of the Jesuites was expresly articled in the Capitulations of
<hi>Suainitz:</hi> so as the Spanish Agents, thinking that he sowed discord
between the Empire and Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end that he might weaken
them both, and so destroy them; and the Jesuites thinking that he was resolved
to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the Catholick Religion, which though in appearance he professed to
worship, yet many of his actions having another aspect, he was no less
suspected to be an enemy to Religion, then to the Empire; and it was thought
that he profess'd the Catholick Religion, only outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to keep in
credit with the Emperour, who was a pious Prince; but that, for the rest, that
he intended to take away all the supports from the Catholick Religion, and from
the Spanish Authority, that he might the more easily effect his designs against
them. All of them therefore used their power with the Emperour, to contaminate
these his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; amongst the Spaniards there was the Count
<hi>d'Ognate,</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadour in ordinary with the Emperour, and the Marquess
of <hi>Castegnada,</hi> also Embassadour in extraordinary with the King of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> both of them indued with excellent Counsel and Judgement; who
were very careful of the main Affairs. <hi>Fritland</hi> had made both these
his enemies, no less then he had done the Duke of <hi>Bavaria;</hi> but he had
incens'd him now more then ever, for that after the loss of <hi>Ratisbone</hi>
he would not give the least assistance to his State, which was then more in
danger <pb n="500" facs="tcp:53250:259"/> then ever: wherefore the Duke exclaimed against
him in <hi>Cesars</hi> Court; his keeping still in <hi>Bohemia</hi> added to
his being hated and suspected; as also the probable doubt, that he had still
some design to make himself King thereof; and that he tarried therefore there
in these perturbations of Affairs, to execute this his design now, when in
likelihood he might easily effect it: not so much in respect of the Authority
he had over the Souldiers, who called him their Father, and were ready at his
least beck; as that all the Princes and Hans Towns of <hi>Germany</hi> being
much inclined to abate the Austrian name and authority, would not only be well
pleased therewith, but would favour it, and assist him therein: but the more
necessary provision appeared to be had against the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of so many
mischiefs, the harder was it to finde them out. <hi>Cesars</hi> Decrees were of
small validity against him who had the supream and absolute arbitrement over
all <hi>Cesars</hi> Forces: so as the remedy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more dangerous then the
disease; and the Emperour still perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in his resolution of not
condemning one of disloyalty, of whose fidelity he was so well satisfied, he
seemed not capable of putting on so stout a resolution; but being at last
overcome by so many exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reiterated protestations, or were it that
the prejudice he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the quartering of his men upon his Territories
grieved him; when he saw the very City of <hi>Vienna</hi> environed with his
quarters, and himself and his Court in a manner besieged; before he would come
to more sharp and severe courses, he made his desires known to him by Father
<hi>Chiroga,</hi> a Spaniard, a religious Capuchin, and Confessor to the Queen
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> that in consideration of his being so grievously troubled
with the Gout, which was a hindrance to him in his Military actions, he would
be content to give over his Command of being Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and retire himself, as
he had done formerly, to a private life: but were it either that he thought
this desire was made at the instant pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures of his enemies, or that he still
persevered in his machinations, he would not be perswaded thereunto, but
answered, that he had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to serve the Emperour against the Emperours
will, that he was therefore ready to obey his commands; but that it was also
true, that as well he himself, as his Commanders under him, had upon his Paroll
been at great expence, in raising men, for the recruiting of the Army, and that
he was to see them paid for the expences they had been at, as the Emperour was
to see him satisfied: that therefore he thought it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, that, in the
first place, his Majesty should finde means to pay what he ought him, and to
his Captains; and that convenient satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being given in this point, he
would give over his charge, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw himself to a private life: but the
Emperour not being in a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of disbursing so great a sum of money, and
the jealousies, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent protestations multiplying, he betook himself to
somewhat a more severe way: he sent the Baron of <hi>Questemberg,</hi> who was
his chiefest Officer, to him, and his chiefest Court-confident, and through
whose hands the Affairs of greatest consequence passed; willing him to
complain, in his name, against his pass'd actions, and particularly for his
quartering his Army in his the Emperours Patrimonial Dominions, and chiefly in
the parts about <hi>Vienna,</hi> and he gave him also a very resentive
instruction, whereby the Emperour complaining very much of the loss 
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:53250:259"/> of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and of <hi>Wallesteins</hi> not
recovering it, he added, that those quarters did so much trouble his Imperial
Majesty, as he would rather lose a Field Battle, then indure them any longer:
when <hi>Questemberg</hi> came before <hi>Fritland,</hi> were it either that he
had always shew'd himself much devoted to his greatness, or were it that he
feared to exasperate him too much, if he should deliver him his message by word
of mouth; judged it better to give him his instructions to read; at the reading
whereof <hi>Fritland</hi> being mightily incensed, said, that he would renounce
his charge of being General, for he clearly saw all his enemies used their
uttermost power to make him do so; whereupon he published this his resolution
in writing; and (which made much for irritating the Souldiery) he caused
several Copies of this instruction to be dispers'd amongst them; he also gave
Order to his Cousen the Count of <hi>Tersica,</hi> and General of the Horse,
and to Count <hi>Chiuschy,</hi> his great Favorite, both of them Bohemians, who
possess'd great Lordships in that Kingdom, and to the Marquess <hi>Illo,</hi> a
Burgondian, and one who was also much his favorite, to negotiate with the
Captains and Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of his Army, and make them not consent to his laying
down his charge: these obey'd the Generals commands, and began seditiously to
publish throughout the Quarters and Precincts of the Army the wrongs and
injuries which were done to their General by his enemies, the which not being
any longer able to resist he was forced to renounce his charge, and once more
to give way to the apparent hatred of the Court; 
<q>Saying that he who was a Captain loaded with Victories and
  Triumph, and who now was arrived at that height of greatness whereunto any
  humane thought could aspire, was not troubled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to a private life,
  that once more, after having undergone so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny labours, he might injoy the
  quiet due thereunto; wherefore he was not troubled to disrobe himself once more
  of that command which against his will, and inforc'd, he had revested himself
  with; that he was only troubled, even to the soul, to think that he must
  abandon so well deserving Souldiers, whose deserts he had upon so many
  occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons known, and whose valour he had tried; but that he was much more
  displeased, and that it did very much afflict his soul, that by aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning
  them he should be a means of their losing so excessive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, which by his
  Orders, and upon his Paroll, they had been at in the raising of men; which
  expences, together with the pay, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards due for so signal service, who
  was it that would pay them if he should abandon the Army? who was better
  acquainted with the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of every particular man then he? who had seen what
  pains they had taken, what blood they had shed, what dangers they had run,
  ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding their lives so often, and so generously, for the common safety: that
  they might easily see how little the Emperour valued their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, the blood
  which they had spent in his service, the sorrow they had suffer'd, and dangers
  they had undergone, for the safety and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his Imperial Diadem;
  since he more esteemed the keeping of every Housholder of his Patrimonial
  Dominions from being never so little troubled, then the disbanding of that Army
  which had done, and suffer'd, such things for his service: that these were the
  things wherewith their General was grieved, and not the laying down his 
  <pb n="502" facs="tcp:53250:260"/> charge; that upon this occasion he wish'd he had the
  wealth of <hi>Croe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> or the Mines of <hi>Potosie,</hi> that he might
  make good his word unto them, so to satisfie them for what he ow'd them; but
  that having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now left after so many disbursements, which he also had
  been at for the common cause, unless it were the Plate destined for his own
  use, he was very ready to offer it them to satisfie them in part, for a much
  greater sum which he acknowledged he ow'd them: that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them they
  would accept of it, at least as an argument of his good will; that as he was
  always desirous to remunerate them all, and each of them, for their deserts; so
  did it much afflict him, that through the injuries of the times they were to be
  defrauded of their merits, as well as he: to these and the like Speeches sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

  necessities, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fability and humanity; and, on the other side, they

  finally, they instil'd into the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery all the affection, tenderness and
  piety, which might make them compassionate their Generals misfortune; and all
  that might move them to sedition, so far as to exhort them to joyn with them,
  and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest themselves in his just cause; that they should not suffer
  themselves to be abandoned by their General, nor consent to so unworthy, and so
  unjust, oppression of a Commander so full of Victory, Merit and Valour; who for
  his part would always side with the Emperour, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whom he had waged war so
  faithfully; that he would persevere in his innate devotion towards his Imperial
  Majesty, but that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, they were obliged not to suffer him to be
  trampled upon by the common enemies, and not permit that he, who was the
  upholder of the Empire, the honour of the German Nation, and who was the common
  safety, should be unworthily suppress'd by the envy of a few strangers, and
  enemies to the German Nation.</q>

               <hi>Wallestein</hi> was wont to confer the Captains places and the
Offices of the Army upon such as did wholly depend upon him; insomuch as if any
were recommended to him by the Emperour, they were sure to be denied; wherefore
these things prevailing much with the Army, the Souldiers were all joyntly
ready to go to the Generals quarters, ready to offer up their lives and bloods
in preservation of his welfare and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to vindicate the offences which
were unjustly done him, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the sign of sedition from him: but it
was thought a more moderate way, that the Capta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ns of the Army only should acquaint the General with
the common sence of the Souldiery, and with their earnest desires that he would
not abandon their hope and interests, by laying down his place of General. The
General seeming at first unwilling to grant their desires, said, he would once
more readily obey the Emperours commands; but seeing the Souldiers pressures
more fervent by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, he suffered himself to be overcome; and, as if
inforced, condescend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <pb n="503" facs="tcp:53250:260"/> to the general desire of the
Souldiery: 
<q>But upon condition that the Captains of the Army should

  to keep firm to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occurrences; and to follow him in all enterprises
  which might tend to the preservation of his Person, State and Dignity, and to
  the good of the Army; in observancy whereof they were to spare neither blood
  nor life; and in the last place, they protested they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute those as
  Traytors, and disloyal persons, and punish them se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely in their lives and

the Camp readily underwrit this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and it was said, that some would not
swear, but upon condition that this new Oath should be understood in service to
the Emperour; and that this condition was rejected: but in fine, all swore in
the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals words, some willingly, some for fear of their lives; for the
Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers stood in a tumultuous manner about the Generals Lodging, ready to
make those that should not subscribe pass the push of Pike. <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasso</hi>
and <hi>Picolominy,</hi> who were present underwrit, as did the rest: but
instantly going from the Camp, under pretence of going to their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, to
gather all their Forces into a body, they went to the Emperour to acquaint him
with what had hapned, complaining and protesting that they were compel'd to do
what they had done; and offering their ready service to obey his Imperial
Majesties commands, in extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing this commencing sedition.
<hi>Aldringer</hi> was not then in the Camp, though <hi>Wallestein</hi> had
used all means to have him there; the Emperour being much moved at this
novelty, presently published a Proclamation, wherein he proclaimed
<hi>Fritland</hi> a Traytor, making <hi>Gallasso</hi> General in his place, and
freeing the Commanders from the Oath they had taken, and pardoning all such as
had subscribed, so as they would in a short time joyn with the new General, and
swear loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to him in <hi>Cesars</hi> name: but he excepted
<hi>Fritland</hi> out of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and some few who were his confidents,
and had incited him to this sedition and conspiracy. At the first news of this
Edict divulged through the Army, every man began
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> bethink themselves; some for
fear of punishment, some out of hopes of pardon: <hi>Wallesteins</hi> self
thought himself not safe amidst his souldiers, chiefly when he found that his
chief confidents, <hi>Gallasso</hi> and <hi>Picolominy</hi> had abandoned him,
and that <hi>Picolominy</hi> came with 3000 Horse to take him prisoner;
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going out of <hi>Pilsen,</hi> a City of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> where the
Conspiracy was plotted, and accompanied by those who were excluded pardon, he
suddenly withdrew towards <hi>Egra,</hi> a strong Town of <hi>Bohemia,</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining upon <hi>Saxony,</hi> wherein was a Garrison add a Governour, who
were much his friends; and hoping to be assisted by the Duke of
<hi>Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and by Duke <hi>Weymer,</hi> in this misfortune, he
dispatched expresses to them, acquainting them with his condition, and making
them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see that this was the time to quell the Austrian power; he
desired them either to come speedily, or send to <hi>Egra,</hi> where they
might ripen the yet unperfect Counsels, and joyn in a solid union against the
Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: he sent the like advertisements to others of the Swedish Army, with
whom he had had some such intelligence before; but being come with his
associates to <hi>Egra,</hi> instead of finding any that would side with 
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:53250:261"/> him there, he found his murderers, and those who came to
nip this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion in the bud; for the Governour of that place, and those who
were there, hearing of the Emperours Edict, received him within their Walls
joyfully, but conspired his ruine. The Governour invited <hi>Fritlands</hi>
associates to a splendid Supper, where whilst they were at the Table, they were
slain. <hi>Fritland</hi> who being ill of the Gout rested in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lodging,
hearing an extraordinary noise at his Gate, got out of Bed, strove to open the
Window, and to endeavour an escape out of it, the Window not being very high;
but the Door being broken open, he was knock'd down with Halberts.</p>
            <p>This was the end of <hi>Albertus Wallesteine,</hi> Duke of
<hi>Fritland,</hi> and thus ended his vast and immense Plots; a Commander who
certainly deserved any other death then this: he was worthy to be compared to
<hi>Stilico,</hi> one of the Emperour <hi>Honorio</hi>'s chiefest Commanders;
not so much for the greatness of his Military actions, as for his misfortune of
having stained them at the last with Treachery. This <hi>Stilico</hi> waging
war, 1200 years ago for the Roman Empire against the Barbarians, was then, as
<hi>Fritland</hi> now, the only support of the Empire, which was in a tottering
and sad condition by the inundation of the Barbarians; and being arrived, as
this man was, to the greatest height as a private man could come to, he
unfortunately lost his life for Treachery and affected Tyranny: and yet, as the
spots which by our modern Mathematicians are round in the Sun, are so buried in
the refulgency of the Sun-beams, as they are not of force enough to obscure the
light and splendor of so great a Planet; so <hi>Stilico</hi>'s faults being
out-done by the beams of his Valour, and by his famous Victories, did not at
all blemish his memory to posterity; wherefore we may hope that this our
Commander may fare accordingly. The two <hi>Scipio</hi>'s after the Victories
won, and famous actions performed on the behalf of the Commonwealth of
<hi>Rome,</hi> were likewise accused, and ended their old age miserably, the
one in prison, the other in exile: <hi>Hannibal</hi> proved the like fortune
amongst the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians: <hi>Bellesarius</hi> and <hi>Narses,</hi> two
famous Commanders, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>an the like
misfortune under the Emperour <hi>Iustinian;</hi> and to come to later times,
<hi>Gonzallo Fernandes di Cardova,</hi> surnamed <hi>il Gran Capitano,</hi>
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either guilty, or suspected by his Prince to be so, died banish'd from
the Court, and not much better then Confined to a poor little Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage.
Howsoever, this our Commander wanted not authentick testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of his
fidelity, even after his death: the confederates Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders with whom it was
thought that he had plotted so hamous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracies, having always found
themselves deluded by these feigned Treaties, did not believe him when he
invited them this last time to <hi>Egra;</hi> but not trusting him any longer,
and fearing to be abused as they had been formerly, they moved not at all, but
proceeded so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderately, as his speedy death freed them from that
misfortune, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into had they been more credulous, they had undoubtedly
fallen; and as his most suspected actions, and those whereon his being guilty
of high Treason were most grounded, are accompanied by several Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of
his innocency, and seem not sufficient to convince him; so those good wits have
not been wanting, who by their eloquent decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations have endeavour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d to prove his accusations false, and
have <pb n="505" facs="tcp:53250:261"/> vindicated his innocency: but, howsoever; all that
can be said in his justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication cannot so far free him, but that his
publishing the Instructions brought him by <hi>Questemberg,</hi> and the
subscription under-written by his Captains, and accepted of by him, together
with all that was done at <hi>Pilsen,</hi> must convince him of a manifest
attempt against his Prince, it not being lawful for a Vassal, under whatsoever
pretence, to jest in so nice Affairs; and the unworthy Conditions which he
extorted from his Prince before he would re-assume the place of General, and
those hateful Conventions agreed upon with the enemies to the Empire, before
<hi>Suainitz,</hi> were so enormous and scandalous as they are not to be
defended: Moreover, who can doubt, but that his endeavours to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
<hi>Feria</hi>'s Army, and to keep out that of the Infanta, the one whereof was
to bring so much endammagement to <hi>Germany</hi> and the other would have
been manifest and cleer evidences of Treachery in a much meaner Officer then
he? It being a no less hostile Act to endeavour the destruction of any ones
Forces and Armies by secret plots and machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, then by weapon in hand.
The same may be affirmed of his persecuting the Spanish Agents, who were so fit
instruments for the Emperours service, and for his contrivals against the
Jesuites, who are so great maintainers of the Catholick Religion; it not being
to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that the one was a manifest attempt against the Divine, the
other against Humane Majesty; for which certainly any of a meaner condition
would have been blamed.</p>
            <p>Now let us reassume the thred of our Narration. The flame of this
horrible Rebellion, which was likely to have undone all <hi>Germany,</hi> and
therewith the Germane Empire, being extinguished almost before it was kindled,
and sedition being also ceased in the Camp, the Army returned to the Emperours
obedience, who being freed from so dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a storm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> made his Son the King of
<hi>Hungary</hi> go into the Field with no less applause then success, who (as
you have heard) was chosen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Emperours Forces after <hi>Walle
stines</hi> decease, to whom the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> presently joyn'd with
his Army, and with the Army of the League, and being desirous to illustrate his
first fruits by some sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal service, he began with the recovery of
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken by the Swedes: This is a Hans
Town of <hi>Germany,</hi> scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the <hi>Danube,</hi> almost in the
bosome of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> a very oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune scituation for the safety of
<hi>Austria,</hi> and for the regaining of <hi>Bava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria;</hi> there was in it a
Garrison of 3000 Foot; and <hi>Weymer,</hi> who was formerly made General of
the Confederates Forces, desired by the perservation of that place not only to
preserve the glory of having taken it, but therein also the honour of his
commencing General; and being gotten thereinto before the King came before it,
he lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> a recruit of 1000 Foot,
together with some Ammuniton, there; and then leaving it, he used all diligence
in raising as many men as possibly he could, to relieve it; but it was too
strongly opposed; for at the very name of the Kings going to the Field, all the
Nobility and Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> strove who should first joyn with him;
he had with him his own Army, and those of <hi>Bavaria</hi> and the Catholick
League; he still abounded in men, and had brought along with him a hundred
pieces of battery; yet the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants were not at all dismay'd, but continued
their defence undauntedly <pb n="506" facs="tcp:53250:262"/> for many days; but their
Ammunition falling short, they were at last forced to yield upon honourable
Conditions, being still playd upon by 100 Cannon, and seeing no succour come;
for <hi>Weymer</hi> could not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble Forces sufficient to relieve it; he
could not get Marshal <hi>Horne,</hi> nor the Lan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>grave, to come to that enterprise, though he had sent
for them, they being both of them much displeased with his being chosen
General, and were not willing to be under his command; only <hi>Horne</hi>
coming in at last, brought so few men with him, as, being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to
<hi>Weymer</hi>'s, they amounted not to 16000 fighting men, too small a number,
and much inferiour to the Opposers. This Victory gotten so succesfully, under
the first Auspice of a young Prince, of great Birth, it is impossible to
express how much spirit it restored to the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarean Forces, and how much it
revived their valour, which, <hi>Wallestine</hi> being dead, seemed almost
quite extinct, conceiving, that he being gone who was thought to be the only
support of <hi>Germany,</hi> no action of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could be expected from
<hi>Cesar</hi>'s Forces. On the other side, that Victory did sufficiently abate
the pride and haughtiness of the Enemy, who, puff'd up with success, were
victorious every where; and <hi>Fritland</hi> being dead, they thought they
could meet with no opposition; the Name of this young Prince was therefore not
only exalted to the skies, but he was received and cry'd up as a new deliverer
of afflicted <hi>Germany.</hi> On the contrary, the Confederates Forces, having
lost much reputation by this action, forsook <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and retreated
towards <hi>Aus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>erg,</hi> and
<hi>Swevia,</hi> thinking that the Infanta would come by that way, and joyn his
Forces with those of the victorious Kings they therefore betook themselves to
hinder their joyning, from whence they foresaw great ruine and prejudice would
ensue to their Affairs. The King, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, hearing that <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> was assaulted by the Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>on Forces, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready marching to
relieve that Kingdom; but understanding by the way that it was sufficiently
defended, and that the Assailants had been repuls'd with great loss from before
the Walls of <hi>Prague,</hi> he sent some Regiments thither to strengthen it,
and returned back; and joyning with <hi>Bavaria,</hi> went to before
<hi>Donavert,</hi> a strong in <hi>Bavaria,</hi> upon the banks of the
<hi>Danow,</hi> which was yet held by the Confederates, and which confining
upon <hi>Franconia,</hi> and the Country of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> was the key of
<hi>Bavaria</hi> on that side, a place of great importance; and having
reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered it also happily by assault, he also forced some other Towns to
surrender: Wherefore having recovered almost all <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and left the
Duke to recover the rest, the King went with his Army, and with that of the
League, against the Country of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> a fruitful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and
which being till now untouch'd by the present Wars of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> was
thought to be the Magazine of the Confederates Army; for the Duke of that
Country being a Protestant, and having always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be a capital Enemy
to the Catholick Religion, and to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e, furnish'd the Armies of the League with all things
neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: Wherefore the King having refresh'd his men a little, went against
<hi>Nordling,</hi> the chief City of that Dukedom, which joyning with
<hi>Ulmes,</hi> not far off, was of great concernment for the Affairs of
<hi>Germany.</hi> This the Kings resolution made the Chieftains of the contrary
party very sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to relieve it, lest it might be lost, as well as
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> and <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert;</hi> 
               <pb n="507" facs="tcp:53250:262"/> so as they
thought them bound to do their utmost to defend it. Express Orders being
therefore sent to all the Forces, even those of Garrisons which were in several
parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> they commanded them expresly to quit the places and
Towns wherein they were, and to joyn with them immediately in so necessary and
important a succour.</p>
            <p>The King, on the other side, hearing of so great an union,
dispatch'd away a Messenger immediately to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who was then
come with his Forces to the Confines of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> desiring him that for
the present he would give over prosecuting his journey, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for
<hi>Alsatia,</hi> and joyn with him in the common enterprize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the
common Enemy: <hi>Alsatia</hi> was then abandoned, for almost all the Garrisons
of the Towns thereof, upon General <hi>Weymers</hi> command, were marched
towards <hi>Nordlingen;</hi> so as the <hi>Infanta</hi> might more easily, and
more securely, march thorough <hi>Alsatia.</hi> His chief intent was, to get as
soon as he could into <hi>Flanders,</hi> where he was much desired by those
Provinces which wanted a Governour; but
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>hearing no better harmony then
what concerned the defence of the Catholick Religion, the well-fare of the
Empire, and the Grandezza of his own house, which depended all upon his joyning
with the King; setting all things else aside, and not caring for what was said
to the contrary, he fix'd his thoughts, and pitch'd his resolution onely on
this union. Taking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all necessary orders for it, he went with his
Army towards <hi>Monaco,</hi> where <hi>Serbellone</hi> and
<hi>Gambacorta,</hi> together with the remainders of <hi>Feria</hi>'s Army,
joyning with him, he drew towards the <hi>Danube;</hi> and passing over it
about <hi>Donevert,</hi> he came to the Cesarian Camp before
<hi>Nordlingen,</hi> whither <hi>Weymer</hi> was come a little before with his
Army; and expecting other recruits was firmly set upon the relief thereof.</p>
            <p>He was quartered upon a Hill called <hi>Arespurg,</hi> just over
against that part where the Cesarean Camp was pitch'd; so as the City was
seated just between as in a Diametre between the two Armies, and the Hill was
within four hours march of the City, <hi>Weymer,</hi> out of a desire to end
the business, endeavoured to draw the King out to battle; but the King
expecting the <hi>Infanta,</hi> kept within his quarters, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
keep on the siege, would not hazard the publick and his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fortune upon
the uncertainty of battle; Being afterwards much reinforced by the
<hi>Infanta</hi>'s Arrival he neither quitted the siege, nor refused battle, if
it should be presented by the enemy, but was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for both; his Forces
consisted of three Armies, his own of the Empire, that of the Catholick League,
and that of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s: They in all made up the full number of
13000 Horse, and 20000 Foot; in that of the Emperour, which was governed by
<hi>Gallasso,</hi> under the title of the Kings Lieutenant Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Pico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomini,</hi> and 5000 Foot, besides 2000 Hungarians and Croats, which
served more to trouble the Enemies quarters with inrodes, then to fight in open
fields. In that of the League, wherein <hi>Iohn de Vert,</hi> the Duke of
<hi>Lorreynes</hi> Lieutenant, commanded at first, and afterward the Duke
himself when he was come unto the Camp, were 3000 Horse, and as many Foot; in
that of the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s, whereof the Marquess <hi>Leganes</hi> was
Camp-master General, were 3000 Horse, under the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Commanders, all choice and veterane <pb n="508" facs="tcp:53250:263"/> Souldiers, composed
of severall Nations; besides many Gentlemen and Captains of quality, who served
as Voluntiers.</p>
            <p>In this al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> continued the same fervency rather to fight, then
to suffer such a City to be lost whilst he looked on, and had past his word to
those of <hi>Nordlingen,</hi> to relieve them and free them from siege within
six dayes. His loss of Reputation egg'd him much on thereunto, which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e foresaw he must undergo, if the
loss of this Town should be added to those of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> and
<hi>Donevert;</hi> whereby all the Hans Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> from whence
he had so great supplies of Monies, Men, Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and of Victuals, for
maintainance of the Army, would certainly quite forego the Leagues party, and
turn over to the Emperour. So as those supplies failing, the General con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ederacy would soon dissolve; he was
also encouraged to try his fortune, by his having been so often victorious over
the Imperiall Forces, and by his being certainly adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised that the
<hi>Infanta</hi>'s men exceeded not 2000 Horse, and 5000 Foot; Wherefore
despising the numbers of the one, and the courage of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he perswaded
himself of assured victory. On the contrary, <hi>Horn,</hi> the head of the
Sw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>dish Militia, measuring things
more warily, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst hazarding the Forces of the League upon the event of
battle; and almost all the subordinate Captains were of his opinion: They
considered the uncertainty of battle, that their numbers were fewer then those
of the enemy, that those whereof the Imperial Army was then full were valiant
men, that there were three Armies in one, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by three great Princes;
that the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> had won much reputation by the Victories of
<hi>Donevert</hi> and <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> that the <hi>Infanta</hi> and Duke of
<hi>Lorrain,</hi> especially the <hi>Infanta,</hi> had store of valiant and
experienced men; that the presence of these Princes was much to be considered,
by reason of the courage that upon such occasions it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuses into the
Souldiery; that therefore the hazarding of a Battle might prove dangerous; that
the Victory would be more certain by delay then by fighting, for that the
Cesarean Army was streightned in Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, Straw and Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

quarters long: on the contrary, that he was abundantly provided of all these
things from the Country of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> which lay on his back; so as

a Dice? to this was added the difficulty of the way by which they were to
march, it being an uneasie Country for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying of their Cannon, and being
possess'd and fortified by the enemy: that to boot with all this, they expected
Count <hi>Otto</hi> of the <hi>Rhein,</hi> with 2000 Horse and 5000 Foot, and
Count <hi>Cratz</hi> with 800 Horse and 3000 Foot, which were very considerable

up the number of 9000 Horse, and 16000 Foot. This resolution being put on, they
marched from their quarters, intending to attempt a certain Wood, by which they
were to pass before they could come to the Field where they were to fight; and
because it was thought it would be hard to get into the Wood, by reason that
the way was so nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, it was resolved that when they should have gotten it,
they should proceed to assault the Camp which lay beyond the Wood; and if they
could not gain the Wood, that then they should forbear, and take up their
Quarter in a convenient place, neer a little River, where they would wait for
the coming of Count <hi>del Reno,</hi> who was thought to be within a days
march. This Army appeared with this resolution before the Wood, three hours
before Sun-set; against which 3000 Horse were immediately sent under
<hi>Octavio Picolominy,</hi> to discover it, and to entertain the enemy by
skirmish: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> whose appearing as
many of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Camp advanced, and fought till night drew on; the
Imperialists were wholly unprovided of Muskets and Field<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Artillery,
whereof the enemy was well provided; the Imperialists therefore were worsted in
this encounter, and forced to retreat with the loss of many valiant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
and of some Captains; amongst which the Prior <hi>Aldobrandino,</hi> Nephew to
Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, was one, who having served with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment
many years in those wars, had given good trial of his Military va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. The
Imperialists loss in this first encounter was notwithstanding fortunate for
them; for it was the rise of a signal Victory gotten by them the next day; for
the Victors having after this made themselves maste<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s of the Wood, did not take up their quarters where
they had designed, nor waited not the coming of the Count <hi>del Reno;</hi>
but having won the Wood, doubted not to pursue their Victory the next morning:
on the left side of the Wood there stood a little Hill which commanded the
Imperial quarters, and all the Plain wherein the Catholick Army were to receive
the encounter, and wherein the main Battle was to be fought. The first of
either of the Armies which should possess themselves of this Hill commanded
absolutely the enemies quarters, and the place which was destined for the
future Battle: <hi>Weymer</hi> had no sooner cast his eye upon it, but
considering the advantagiousness of the situation, he designed to be master of
it; and there being another little Wood at the Foot of that Hill, he thought it
necessary to possess himself of that Wood, before he should master the Hill:
not content therefore with having got the first Wood, he would take the other
that very night, to make way for taking the Hill, which he reserved for the
next morning: the <hi>Infanta</hi> was quartered upon some other little Hill
neer this which were to be taken, but somewhat more inward, and not so high;
and he and his Captains having considered the si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uation of the higher Hill, they had sent
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ome men thither; and in order
thereunto, they had sent <hi>Francisco l' Escovar,</hi> Serjeant-Major of a
Brigade, with 200 Spanish <pb n="510" facs="tcp:53250:264"/> Musketiers, and not long after
200 Burgondians, with some Troops of Horse, to guard the little Wood which was
at the foot of the same Hill; and thinking they had sufficiently provided for
the defence of both these places, they did no more therein. But
<hi>Weymer,</hi> who was firmly resolved to make himself master of the Hill,
sent much greater Forces to assault that little Wood, against which though
<hi>l' Escovar</hi> fought valiantly, yet the assailants remained masters of
that second Wood that very night, as they had been of the other before, took
<hi>l' Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covar</hi> prisoner, and slew many of his men, not without much loss
of their own blood: this being the second bait which fortune laid to entice the
enemy on to battle, made the Cesareans more wary and more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in
defending the upper Hill; for they saw the enemy did their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to take it,
placing their chief hopes therein of that Victory which they thought themselves
sure of: wherefore the <hi>Infanta</hi> ceased not to send redoubled forces all
night to defend it, and to secure it from as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, which he was sure would be
given the next morning: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sent several Regiments both of Foot and
Horse thither, some whereof were placed on the Front, some on the sides, where
the assai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants were expected; and after these other Regiments were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly
distributed, who were to re-inforce the former upon occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: they l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>kewise sent Artillery thither, and
made Trenches for the better defence thereof; which were perfected before the
assault was given, though the situation was stony and wanted earth; nor
prepared they less for Battle on the Plain then on the Hill, expecting that the
enemy would undoubtedly sally out there from the Wood which which they had
taken. The Army was thus ordered in that Plain: on the right wing was the Duke
of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> General of the Catholick Leagues Army, and his Lieutenant
<hi>Iohn de Vert,</hi> with all the Cavalry of that League: on the left was the
Imperial Horse; in the Battle which was placed in the midst was Marquess
<hi>Spinola,</hi> General of the Spanish Horse, and with him was his Lieutenant
<hi>Paolo Deutici;</hi> behind these were the Emperours light Horse, a good
part whereof were Croats. The <hi>Infanta</hi>'s quarters were over all these
upon a little Hill, wherein was Artillery placed, and a good strength of men,
to succour and defend the Troops t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>at were upon the Plain: at last, the morn appeared on the sixth of
<hi>September,</hi> wherein the enemy were seen to come in very good order
towards the well munited, and well garrison'd Hill, against which the whole
force and conflict of the Battle plaid, little being done upon the Plain: for
<hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ymer,</hi> who was to
assault the Cesarean Camp, kept within the Wood, being more intent to send
forth new recruits to the Hill, then to advance and confront the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Army;
thinking, and not without reason, that that station being overcome, the Army on
the Plain would undoubtedly be vanquished. The whole concern touching the
Catholick Religion, and the safe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>y
of the Empire, was disputed upon that Hill: the ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ting up unto it was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry steep: <hi>Horne</hi> with

on the assault; and Count <hi>Gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>z</hi> was the other with almost an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Combatants: it
was defended by Don <hi>Martine d' Idiaques,</hi> with his Brigade of
Spaniards, Don <hi>Gasparo Toralto,</hi> with his Neapolitans, 
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:53250:264"/> 
               <hi>Gerardo Gambacorta</hi> with the Neapolitan Horse,
by <hi>Salma, Vormes</hi> and <hi>Leister</hi> with the Dutch Horse; by the
Counts of <hi>Torre</hi> and <hi>Alberg,</hi> with the Burgondian Horse; and
all these were to receive the first as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults: behind these were many Brigades
of reserve, amongst the rest two Brigades of the Lombardy, the one led on by
<hi>Carlo Guasco,</hi> the other by Count <hi>Panigarvola. Picolominy</hi> and
<hi>Serbellone</hi> were appointed to order this defence; to whose valour and
experience the whole defence of the Hill was intrusted: the Generals,
<hi>Gallasso</hi> and <hi>Leganes,</hi> had no certain place appointed them,
but went every where, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for, and disposing of all things requisite for
that days work. The assailants mounted the Hill in very good order, and with a
setled and constant pace; the first that were assaulted were the Neapolitan
Horse and Foot, and the Dutch; and so fierce was this first assault, as though
the Neapolitans resisted stoutly, the Dutch faced about and began to run; but
they were presently turn'd back by the Officers and Souldiers of the other
Brigades who were behind them, who with their Pikes and Swords withstood them,
and did not only force them to forbear flying, but to re-assume their abandoned
stations; wherein <hi>Gambacorta</hi> did much service with his Horse, who by
<hi>Serbellones</hi> order fell upon the Flank of the Enemies Horse, who had
already possess'd themselves of the station abandoned by the Dutch, and forc'd
them to forego it, and to quit it to Dutch, who were driven back by his men:
but <hi>Toralto</hi>'s Foot spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily discharging their Muskets, disordered the
Enemies Horse, who came on so furiously, as many who escaped the Musket-shot
were thrown to the ground by the Pike-men, and the Foot who followed them,
assaulted with no less sury, behaving themselves gallantly; but were but ill
handled by some Piles of Musketiers, who assaulted them on the Flank; and yet
answering them stoutly, a great conslict began, which grew at last to a fierce
Battle, and continued a long time equal; wherein the Dutch Horse, after some
resistance, being again repuls'd they forsook their station, one of their
Leaders was mortally wounded, and the other, which was <hi>Vormes,</hi> slain
right out; and they sled, some of them falling foul upon <hi>Toralto</hi>'s
Brigade, other upon that of <hi>Idiaques,</hi> by whom being again made to
stand by their Pikes and Swords, they did not at all disorder their ranks; and
the assailants possessing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves of the Dutch mens station, were masters
of their Cannon, and began to turn them upon the enemy, and had certainly
occasioned great disorder and prejudice, had not <hi>Serbellone</hi> prevented
it, who made <hi>Idiaques</hi> advance with his Brigade, which was composed not
only of brave and gallant Souldiers, whosevalour had been upon several
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions tried formerly, and who had been exercised in Military Offices and
Commands; but was also adorned with many of the Nobility, who were all placed
in the first Files: these passing through a thousand deaths, sacrificing their
lives for their Religion, for their Prince, and for their own glory, did not
only recover the lost station, but made it good against many assaults which
were given one after another; and afforded the fugitive Dutch occasion of
rallying once again, and of re-entring the Battle. <hi>Toralto</hi>'s
Neapolitans were already wearied, and lessen'd by long fighting, who no less
valiantly then the Foot had fought valiantly for a while, and maintain'd their
Ranks, and had <pb n="512" facs="tcp:53250:265"/> slain many of the enemies, whose Forces
plying upon this part, the Imperialists were likely not to have been able to
defend it much longer, which <hi>Gallasso</hi> and <hi>Leganes</hi> being aware
of, they sent thither a re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of a thousand Horse, and a great many
choice Musketiers, out of the Brigade; which were for a reserve; and the
hostile violence still encreasing, they sent thither afterwards
<hi>Guasco</hi>'s and <hi>Panigarvolo</hi>'s Lombard Brigades, which entring
with great courage sustain'd the Battle, which by the Neapolitans weakness
began to give ground: these entred so couragiously, as the Fight seemed to be
renewed; and the defence revived which was almost given over; and though
<hi>Panigarvelo</hi> after having long maintain'd fight, was slain by a
Musket-shot in the throat, and that <hi>Guasco</hi> wounded with two
Musket-shot in the thigh, and with one in the right hand, endeavour'd still to
fight; yet not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able longer to keep on foot, nor to manage his sword, he
was forc'd to retreat: but notwithstanding that one of their Commanders were
slain, and the other withdrawn, the subordinate Officers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of
these two Brigades failed not in doing their duties; but fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing still
couragiously and in good order, they made good their station, and maintained
themselves still stoutly against the Enemy, as if no harm had befallen their
Captains. It would require much time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late punctually all the actions, all
the assaults, and resistances which were made; for the defence and for the
taking of that Hill; how now these pursued, how those gave now back, how the
one party did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times abandon their station, then repulsing the oppugners,
regained them: it would be long to relate what dangers were run, to name what
Captains and Officers signalized themselves that day by fighting, some by
dying, some by overcoming. The final end was, that at the end of seven hours
fierce bickering, the like to which was hardly ever heard or read of; the
defendants after several likelihoods of being conquered, remained conquerers:
the occasion of this Victory was the happy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess that the Cesarean Army had
on the Plain; for <hi>Weymer</hi> finding it impossible to overcome the defence
which was made upon the Hill, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having lost the best men of his Camp by
sending continuaally strong re-inforcement thither, went, desperately out of
the Wood; and in his weak condition went to fall upon the Cesarean Camp, which
being well marshal'd in Squadrons, expected him; and having fought
unfortunately (for he was bravely, withstood, and repuls'd by the Duke of
<hi>Lorrein,</hi> by <hi>Iohn de Vert,</hi> and by Marquess <hi>Spinola)</hi>
he was forced to give back, and being pursued by the Duke of <hi>Lorrein</hi>
with the Cavalry of the League, and by Marquess <hi>Spinola,</hi> with those
the <hi>Infanta,</hi> and after these by the Croates, who afterwards advancing,
possess'd themselves of the passes by which the conquered were to seek their
safety; those who fought still obstinately upon the hill, seeing that
<hi>Weymer</hi> did direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fly with their chiefest strength, and that the
way whereby they were to escape was prepossess'd by the enemy, they began to
doubt that if they should persist any longer in the enterprise, they should be
assaulted on the backs, and that not being able to escape, they should be
undoubtedly cut in pieces; and that though they should have the better upon the
Hill, it would be to no purpose, since the body of their Army was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfited,
abandoned the fight, and gave over the enterprise, and left 
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:53250:265"/> the Victory to the Cesareans; which certainly would have
proved their own, if when they had taken the second Wood, they had imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
fallen upon the Hill, whilst it was ungarded; for being masters thereof, they
would have unlodged the enemy who were incamped below; who being forced to
retreat could not have escaped utter ruine; and there being no other Forces
then in the Field to sustain the Empire and the Austrian Grandezza, they would
have been the Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trators of <hi>Germany:</hi> On so sleight accidents do the
victories or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws of Armies, and the preservation or ruine of Empires
and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, often depend.</p>
            <p>Almost all the Imperial Cavalrie which were on the plain,
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed those that fled, and made great slaughter of them; more
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in a certain boggy place, which those that fled light upon,
where both Horse and Foot being plung'd up to the knees, they could not acquit
themselves; but being unable either to fly away, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, were
miserably slain. The Duke of <hi>Lorrein</hi> advanced, and took <hi>Horn</hi>
and <hi>Crats</hi> prisoners, and many others of the chief of the Army:
<hi>Weymer,</hi> by means of a fleete Horse, fled towards <hi>Ulms,</hi>
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with not above eight men; which City hearing how he had been
routed, shut the gates upon him; so as being deprived of that Refuge,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he fled still through the Country
of <hi>Vertemberg,</hi> and had the good fortune to recover <hi>Francfort;</hi>
the number of the slain in the battle is variously calculated. Some will have
it, that 8000 were slain, and as many taken prisoners as they fled; so as what
with those that were slain, and those that were taken prisoners, and dispers'd,
there hardly remained 2000 under Colours: This Victory was the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the little loss of the Conquerours blood; all that were slain or wounded on
their side not being full 2000, the Artillery to the number of 84 peeces of
Cannon, all the Munition, all the baggage, and 300 Horse and Foot Colours fell
into the Enemies hand; not above the third part of the Conquerours Army fought
in this battle: For the Imperial Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and that of the League, stood in
squadrons with the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the plain, being little more
then spectators of what was done upon the Hill: And the encounter which hapned
after on the plain, from whence the victory first began was very sleight, being
rather a victory, then a combat, for the Cesateans, and for the conquered
rather a fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ght then a fight. The
<hi>Infanta</hi>'s Army fought most, and but a part thereof neither, and by the
confession of the Dutch, generally, and of <hi>Horn</hi> himself, the victory
was to be wholly acknowledged from the <hi>Infanta</hi>'s Army, and
particularly from the Spaniards, Neopolitans, and Lombards, upon whom the whole
battle w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s charged. And such was
their confidence and ambition, as they would not communicate the glory of the
victory with any other Nation, by calling them in to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Hill; in so
much as the Duke of <hi>Lorrein</hi> being advanc'd with some of his Regiments
from the plain, where he could not tarry any longer idle looking on, as he end
avoured to climb the Hill and assist the defendants, he was with-held by his
own men; and kept from going any further on, before he could come to where the
battle was fought. By this victory the Swedish party which was before so
formidable, remained little less then quite overthrown; <hi>Oxenstern</hi> 
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:53250:266"/> who was their chief directer, one who had been always
undaunted, when he heard the news, was so astonished as that he knew not
whither to turn, or what to do, to repair so great a blow. He was at
<hi>Francfort,</hi> whither <hi>Weymer</hi> was retreated after the battle; and
having quickly gotten 3000 Foot, which came from the <hi>Rhingrave</hi> of
<hi>Hessen,</hi> and from the Duke of <hi>Luneberg,</hi> he with those, and
with some others, partly fugitives, partly those that he had sent for from
other Garrisons, went together with <hi>Weymer</hi> towards <hi>Mentz;</hi>
hoping to find some refuge there, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to stop the precipice of so great a
ruine: But those of the Town, affrighted at such a turn of Affairs, were more
desirous to obtain pardon for the faults they had already committed, then to
incense the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour by committing yet more, so as they would not receive
them. They therefore retired towards the neighbouring Mountains of
<hi>Rheine,</hi> and threw a bridge over the River, that they might receive
great succours which they expected from <hi>France.</hi> On the other side, the
victorious Army, to which those of <hi>Norlingen</hi> did immediately
surrender, passing into the Countries of <hi>Wittenberg, Franconia,</hi> &amp;
<hi>Suevia,</hi> thinking that they would all come in and submit themselves;
and that they might get great compositions from thence, which all the people
and parts thereabouts did readily offer, to shun the sacking and desolation of
their Country. The like did all the Cities upon the <hi>Rheine</hi> and
<hi>Danube;</hi> and those also upon the <hi>Iser, Occino,</hi> and
<hi>Neccar,</hi> (Rivers of that part of <hi>Germany)</hi> which had sided with
the Swedes. Thus the Conquerours minding more the reaping of advantage by their
victory, then to subdue the remainders of the conquer'd party, afforded them
conveniency of recruiting, and of recovering their former condition and honour;
which though it was attributed to weakness in the Imperialists Counsels, yet
other more important reasons kept them from doing it, lest they might put those
remainders into utter despair. They were yet posses'd of many prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Towns
near the <hi>Rheine:</hi> And the King of <hi>France</hi> being very much prest
by them for succour, made use of that present necessity which he saw they were
in; desiring that if they would have the demanded suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, they would deliver
up into his hands the important Town of <hi>Filisburg</hi> upon the
<hi>Rheine;</hi> so as the Cesareans thinking they might more easily recover
those Towns from them then from the French, were reserved in totally
extirpating them, to keep them from despair: Thus in their low ebb of the
reliques of the victories which they had formerly gotten made them secure and
considerable even to their victorious Enemies, as they had formerly when they
got them, made them formidable to <hi>Germany:</hi> Not long after the battle,
it was consulted in the Camp, whether the <hi>Infanta</hi> returning backwards
should go for <hi>Flanders</hi> thorough <hi>Alsatia,</hi> as he had formerly
intended to do; or whether being already so far advanced in <hi>Germany,</hi>
he should pursue his journey through the <hi>Palatinate.</hi> For his going
thorough <hi>Alsatia,</hi> the conveniency which he might have to relieve
<hi>Brisack,</hi> which was again besieged by the Enemy, was pleaded; and the
easiness and safety of his marching thorough that Country, which was now free
from Garrisons of the Enemy, they being gon, after the battle of
<hi>Norlingen,</hi> to joyn with their General. The shortness of the march
pleaded for the other way and the safety thereof; it being void of the
conquer'd Enemy as well <pb n="515" facs="tcp:53250:266"/> as <hi>Alsatia,</hi> as also the
much pressing of the Flemmings, that he would hasten his journey as much as he
possibly could: Moreover, the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-season, which upon any the least delay
before <hi>Brisack</hi> would come on, and would not only have block'd up that
way but all other ways, made more against his turning back, and for his
continuing the way he was in.</p>
            <p>After several debates it was carried, that he should go through
the <hi>Palatinate;</hi> wherefore the Infanta, in company with the King of
<hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> entring the Dukedom of <hi>Wittenberg,</hi> and having
reduced it to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience (for the Duke thereof was fled with some few into the
Country of <hi>Saltsburg)</hi> came into the lower <hi>Palatinate,</hi> where
the Infanta taking leave of the King, and having obtain'd 2000 Horse from him
for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, pass'd victoriously every where, and as triumphing over the
Enemies of the Catholick Faith and of the Empire, not meeting with any
opposition; nay, all places through which he pass'd yielded to him, and he was
furnish'd every where abundantly with victuals, and all sorts of refreshments.
From the <hi>Palatinate</hi> he entred into the County of <hi>Nansaw,</hi> and
being come from thence to <hi>Cullen,</hi> where he was honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably received by
that Elector, he pass'd into <hi>Flanders</hi> with as much quiet and safety as
he passed through <hi>Castile</hi> and <hi>Arragon</hi> when he parted from
<hi>Madrid.</hi> He came into <hi>Brussels</hi> about the beginning of
<hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> in the year 1634. where he was received not only with great
pomp but with incredible applause; his coming was very seasonable; for the
ground-work was already laid for a strong League in those parts against the
Spaniards, between the King of <hi>France</hi> and the United Provinces, which
was concluded on the beginning of <hi>March</hi> following; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
powerful Armies were prepared by them both to assault joyntly the Provinces
which were obedient to the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi>
wanted only a pretence whereby to honest the breach. But this new and great
rupture not being to be cloaked, the mask which had formerly been made use of
between the two Crowns must be taken off, and open War must be made, which did
necessarily require some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for its justification; therefore the King of
<hi>France</hi> made use of an occasion which hapned at this time. The
Archbishop of <hi>Triers,</hi> one of the Electors, held (as hath been formerly
said) much closer Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence with the King of <hi>France</hi> then with the
Emperour and Austrians, with whom for many occasions he had been several times
distasted; and to boot that this City was a member of the German Empire, it had
been anciently under the protection of the Dukes of <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> and by
succession under the protection of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ancient Dukes in that Dukedom; and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> under colour
of that pretension, was wont to keep some Souldiers in Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there, and to
use some actions of Jurisdiction: The Elector seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to apprehend the Swedish
Forces had (as hath been formerly said) put himself under the King of
<hi>France</hi> his protection, and received a French Garrison into the City,
expelling the Spanish: Nor herewithal content, he, to the great prejudice of
the German Affairs, delivered up to the same King of <hi>France</hi> the Town
of <hi>Hermensteyne;</hi> it was also said that he was to accept of the
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> as Co adjutor in the Archbishoprick, to which the
Electorship is annex'd, with intention of <pb n="516" facs="tcp:53250:267"/> leaving that
Dignity to him afterwards, and so introduce a Vote abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely depending upon
the King of <hi>France</hi> into the Electoral colledge; A thing which though
it was sufficiently contrary to reason, and to the preeminence of the German
Empire, and repugnant to the Votes of the German Nation; yet would it not have
been ill looked upon by the Protestant Princes in those times, and to such as
were ill affected to the Austrian Name. And the Emperour fearing these plots
which he saw were a framing by this Electory, he ordered the <hi>Infanta</hi>
that he should secure his person: In order whereunto, the <hi>Infanta</hi> put
2000 Souldiers in some barks cover'd with cloth, like to Merchants vessels
which pass upon those Rivers, and sent them down the <hi>Mosell,</hi> towards
<hi>Tryers,</hi> which is seated upon the bank thereof, whither being come by
night, and telling the Sentinels that they were boats come from
<hi>Lucem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> they fastned two Petards to two Gates, by one of which
they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and by the other 200 Horse, which were sent by land to that
purpose by the Infanta, who coming to the Gate at the same time that it was
beaten down by the Petard, the Horse and Foot entred the Town at unawares, cut
the French Garrison in pieces, who were overcome with fear, and the darkness of
the night, and easily made themselves Masters of the City, and of the Elector,
who being speedily carried to <hi>Lucemburg,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Namures,</hi> and so to <hi>Brussels,</hi> was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably treated there,
as an Archbishop, and Elector, but was dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently guarded, as a Prisoner.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>France</hi> held himself highly offended by this
action, as if it had been done in a resentment of the new Protection whereinto
that Prince had put himself; he therefore made the Electors liberty be demanded
of the <hi>Infanta,</hi> by his Resident who was then in that Court; to which
the <hi>Infanta</hi> answered, That what was done at <hi>Tryers</hi> was done
by the Emperours express command, and that therefore he was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress himself
to <hi>Cesar.</hi> The King not being satisfied with this answer, sent an
Herauld to the <hi>Infanta,</hi> who did intimate War against him, and against
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> expresly declaring, and protesting, That that
intimation should serve as effectually for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> as if it
had been given to his own Person in <hi>Madrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many Discourses pass'd about under the Names of the Kings
themselves, and of others, as they stood severally interessed or devoted to
either of the Courts, wherein each side sharpely defended their cause. The most
solid, and most ascertained Reasons of this breach, publish'd in print by the
King of <hi>France,</hi> in his own Name, were, That the Elector of
<hi>Tryers,</hi> being abandoned by the Emperour, when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, beaten by
the Swedish Forces, was not well able to sustain it self, not knowing whom to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ly unto for refuge, had put
himself into his protection, to free himself from being suppress'd by them;
wherefore he deserved not to be made prisoner for doing so, without citation,
or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned; he therefore accused it, as not only unjust, but
unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, being committed against a Sacred Person, an Archbishop, and one of
the seven Electors of the Empire; and that since it redounded not only to the
great offence of his Crown, in respect of the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereunto the Elector
had put himself, but to the like of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolick See, and of the Electoral
Colledg, the Pope and Electors were <pb n="517" facs="tcp:53250:267"/> to resent it as well
as he. To this was answered, That that Elector had never put himself into the
protection of the King of <hi>France,</hi> but had only desired some assistance
from him, as from a Prince that was his friend, against the Swedes; so as even
by the Electors own confession the title of protection was faulty, which was
the chief foundation of the complaint, and of the injury pretended to be done
to the King; and if the Elector had desired or received help under the name of
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, he ought not to have withdrawn him from the natural Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y of the Emperour, nor from the
protection of the Dukes of <hi>Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enberg,</hi> he being a Prince of the
Empire, and under the protection of the ancient Dukes of <hi>Luxenberg;</hi> it
being a clear thing, That a natural Subject cannot withdraw himself from the
Jurisdiction of his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Prince, nor prejudicate it by any action of his;
and that howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his protection against the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> did not
extend against the Emperour, or King of <hi>Spain,</hi> the one being his
Sovereign, the other his ancient Protector, no otherwise then fealty by a
natural Subject of a Prince sworn to another Prince from whom he holds any Town
or Castle in Fee, shall never be of force to engage him against his natural
Prince, nor to withdraw him from his obedience; That therefore the King of
<hi>France</hi> ought not by title of new protection, to intermeddle with what
the Electors Sovereign Prince was pleased to order. The ground-work of the
breach seeming to be shaken by these Reasons, the King of <hi>France</hi>
pleaded other former injuries, which he had at several times, and upon several
occasions, received from the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> and beginning from the
reciprocal Marriages made between the two Kings, it was said that the Spaniards
had never ceased to make plots against the quiet and safety of <hi>France;</hi>
and in the first place, That the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had waged war with the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> under the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable pretence of protecting the House
of <hi>Mantua;</hi> against which the same King did afterwards conspire
himself, for no other reason but because the Duke would not joyn with him in
making war with the King of <hi>France.</hi> To this was added, the revolutions
of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> to the prejudice of the Grisons, ancient Clients and
Confederates of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> which were endeavoured for no
other end, and somented by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> but only that he might
carry the war more commodiously through the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> from
<hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>Italy,</hi> and from <hi>Italy</hi> to
<hi>Germany,</hi> and to make himself Master of the parts confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning upon the
<hi>Valtoline:</hi> That the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> not being able to endure
the good correspondency which was held between <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>England,</hi> had, by means of Marquess <hi>Mirabello,</hi> his Embassadour
at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> sowed dissentions and discords between them, and fomented
the Rebellion of the Hereticks of <hi>France,</hi> to the end that the King
being busied in suppressing them might not have leisure to defend
<hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which were then powerfully assaulted
by the Spaniards; and that when the King of <hi>France</hi> had by the success
of his Forces, and by the Peace of <hi>Susa,</hi> freed <hi>Cassalle</hi> the
first time, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> had not only let slip that occasion of
preserving Peace in <hi>Italy,</hi> and of secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the liberty of the Client
of <hi>France,</hi> but had called in the Dutch against the City of
<hi>Mantua,</hi> whilest his Commanders endeavoured once more to take
<hi>Cassalle</hi> by force; whereby the King of <hi>France</hi> was 
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:53250:268"/> forced to send his Arms back again into <hi>Italy,</hi>
to secure his Confederates, and to keep the Spaniards within some bounds:
wherein faring as suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessfully as he had done the first time, which the
Spanish Agents were not able to indure, they had betaken themselves to sow
discord in his Royal family, making the Duke of <hi>Lorrein</hi> their
Instrument therein; and that thus they had endeavoured to Arm <hi>France</hi>
against <hi>France:</hi> that the same King of <hi>Spain</hi> had sent a
powerful Fleet to Sea to assault <hi>Provence;</hi> and that he was neer
assaulting it several times, had he not been sometimes detained by the season
of the year, sometimes by storms: that, moreover, he had furnished the Duke of
<hi>Orleans</hi> with Forces, to pass armed through <hi>France,</hi> to the
end, that being back'd by the Army of <hi>Catalogna,</hi> and by the Fleet at
Sea, he might trouble <hi>France:</hi> then falling upon the Affairs of
<hi>Germany</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained mightily, that the Austrians ends tended only
to make the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Imperial Diadem hereditary; and that therefore under the
speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pretence of the Catholick Religion, they aimed only at the abasing
and annihilating of the Catholick and the Protestant Forces, to the end, that
having extinguished the latter, they might the more easily subdue the others;
and so arrive at that Monarchy, whereunto though they had no reason to pretend,
yet did they thirst after nothing more; and that the King of <hi>France</hi>
not being able neither in justice, nor for the safety of his Kingdom, nor in
respect of his ancient and hereditary adherence to the German Princes, to
tolerate that the house of <hi>Austria</hi> should make way to so great
advantages, by the ruine of his Colleagues; lest when he should have compassed
his defire, he might pretend superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over all Christian Princes; had
desired to see the affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> reduced into such a condition by
civil means, as that the German Princes might live in safety, and not fear
being ruinated; and that so he might not be necessitated to defend them by
Arms: and that therefore upon several occasions, &amp; discourses of peace, he
had always propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a general peace, wherein all might be comprehended, and
all things might be amicably composed; for, said they, no peace is otherwise
truly made, but, like fire buried under ashes, breaks forth into a greater
flame; that it made not for the King of <hi>France,</hi> nor for his honour, to
compose differences with the Emperour, without including his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, who
might be overcome afterwards by the Austrian Forces; and that the same
consideration was to be had touching the affairs of the <hi>Valtoline:</hi> the
King having made it be trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed of
in the peace of <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasco,</hi> and of <hi>Madrid,</hi> that some course
might be taken to remedy what was done to the contrary at the peace of
<hi>Monsone:</hi> but that these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours not being listned unto, though
they were propounded with much zeal to the publick peace; the King was forced
to take up Arms, so to get such satisfaction, which he could not do by friendly
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ans.</p>
            <p>But the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> complain'd no less, nor did they
cease to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the accusations and complaints made by the French: these
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan from before, from the peace of <hi>Vervin,</hi> which was made the year
1601, wherein all reciprocal offences being laid aside, it was agreed, that
neither of the Kings should protect any one to the prejudice of the other; but
should renounce all Leagues and Intelligences contracted <pb n="519" facs="tcp:53250:268"/>
to the prejudice of either of them; and that notwithstanding this, the year was
hardly ended, when the French appeared in <hi>Holland,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King of
<hi>France</hi> his own Colours, against the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces;
nor did King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, with whom that peace was made, ever
re-cal so open Hostility, save only in appearance, and by vain Edicts, which
were never put in execution: insomuch as the French continuing in that Militia,
the King cared not for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints made by the Spanish Agents, but was wont
to jest and mock at them; whereby they infer'd that that King was the first
breaker of peace, and the original occasion of any hostility which had been
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward either tacitely, or openly, committed against him (if any such had
been committed); and that therefore the French had no just cause to complain:
they added, that King <hi>Henry</hi> did contrive a League with great
Potentates afterwards, against <hi>Philip</hi> the Third, which was
unperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the said Kings sudden death; and that though <hi>Philip</hi>
the Third might easily have resented these so open Hostilities, and gainsayings
of peace, after <hi>Henry</hi>'s death, making use of the pupillar age of the
then present King, and of the ill humours and factions of <hi>France;</hi> yet
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace prevailing over all resentment, he pass'd by so great an
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and became the defender of the young King, and of the Queen Dowager,
and consented to the reciprocal Marriage, to the end, that peace and union
might thereby be the better established between the two Crowns: passing from
hence to the League of <hi>Avignion,</hi> the year 1623, whereof the present
King of <hi>France</hi> was pretended to be the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; they said that from
thence proceeded the following wars of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi> and of <hi>Italy,</hi>
against the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain;</hi> which being happily ended for
the Austrians, the peace of <hi>Monsone</hi> insued, which the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> did not only not countervene, but when it was concluded, had
assisted the King of <hi>France</hi> with a powerful Fleet, in the so important
business of <hi>Rochel,</hi> and had assisted him therein, at the same time
when the King of <hi>France</hi> did openly assist the Rebels in
<hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> against him; then coming to the last wars of <hi>Mantua</hi>
and <hi>Montfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat,</hi> they complained that the King of <hi>France</hi> had
taken upon him the protection of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> a Vassal of the
Empire, against his Sovereign the Emperour, and against the Spanish Forces
imploy'd in defending <hi>Cesars</hi> Authority: that the King of
<hi>France</hi> had no occasion to interest himself in that business, which did
not at all concern him, but was proper to the Emperour; and much less reason
had he to meddle in dividing <hi>Montferrat</hi> between the Dukes of
<hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Nevers,</hi> though he had done it with much prejudice
to the Emperours Authority in the peace of <hi>Susa:</hi> Wherefore the
Emperour nor King of <hi>Spain</hi> had no reason to ratifie that peace; that
then they came to the peace of <hi>Ratis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone,</hi> wherein the Affairs both of
<hi>Germany</hi> and of <hi>Italy</hi> being setled, it was soon broken; for
what concern'd the Affairs of <hi>Germany,</hi> by the King of <hi>France,</hi>
by the League which he soon made with the King of <hi>Sweden;</hi> and as for
the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was not sincerely observed, since he extorted
<hi>Pinarvolo</hi> from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> contrary to the Articles of
that peace; and here heaping up all the accusations against the King of
<hi>France,</hi> touching his protecting the German Princes, the Elector of
<hi>Triers,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Nevers;</hi> they said that these
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections <pb n="520" facs="tcp:53250:269"/> did foment the Subjects of the Empire,
against the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; just as if the Emperour of King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
should take upon them to protect the French who had taken up Arms against the
King of <hi>France,</hi> and should foment and assist them: so as the King of
<hi>France</hi> numbers amongst the offences which he pretends to have
received, that the Queen and the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> the one Sister, the
other Brother in Law to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> both of them being gone
from <hi>France,</hi> were received, with safety to their persons, in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> and that 2000 Horse were given to the Duke of
<hi>Orleans</hi> for a conduct; so the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and King of <hi>Spain</hi>
might with much more reason complain of the King of <hi>France</hi> for giving
the like protections and fomentations to the Hollanders, the German Princes,
and the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who were in Arms against the Emperour: that
therefore it was no less an injury to the Emperour, that the King of
<hi>France</hi> should desire that the German Princes, who had taken up Arms
against him, should be admitted into the peace which was in treaty between the
Emperour their Sovereign and the King of <hi>France;</hi> it being no better
then to abet a Subject against his Prince, to prescribe Laws between a
Sovereign and his Vassal, and to make the world know that the King of
<hi>France</hi> was Arbitrator of Peace and War in <hi>Germany,</hi> and
Moderator of the Empire: which were undoubtedly too high pretentions, and which
were never put for, not practised by any; that the case of the King of
<hi>France</hi> his Mother and Brothers, who were fled into the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> Dominions, and honourably received there, was otherwise; that
these were personal Offices between a Father in Law and Son in Law, and between
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law in the like case; nor did they extend further then to the
person to whom they were done; and if they would talk of the 2000 Horse given
to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> these and other assistances, as the Fleet at
Sea destined against <hi>Provence,</hi> ought to be opposed to the King of
<hi>France</hi> his fomenting, so many both open and secret Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
against the Emperour and King of <hi>Spain;</hi> since it was not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
that it should be lawful for the King of <hi>France</hi> to undermine the
Austrian Grandezza, and that the Austrians should act nothing against him: that
the dissentions between the Crowns of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> and
the wars made by the King of <hi>France</hi> against the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he would not abet the Spanish designs, were not to be
considered, being things notoriously false, and whereof there was no proof;
that the world knew the reasons of the differences between <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and whence the distastes arose in the Royal Family of
<hi>France,</hi> and what were the occasions of the war made against the Duke
of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy;</hi> and how much the then Queen Regent of <hi>France,</hi> and
the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es of <hi>Italy,</hi>
did press the King to force the Duke to lay down the Arms which he had taken up
to suppress the Duke of <hi>Mantua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These were the chief charges and defences made by each party; and
it being hard to say what was the just cause of this breach, those who
understood the Affairs of the world best, were of <hi>Polybius</hi> his
opinion, an ancient Authour, who discoursing upon the true occasions from
whence the bitter Wars between the Romans and Carthaginians arose, makes no
account of this or that hostile act which happened between these
Common-wealths, or of any breach of peace between them, <pb n="521" facs="tcp:53250:269"/>
but layes the true reason of the Wars which succeeded between them, upon the
meer Ambition that the one Common-wealth had to exceed the other. The like (say
they) was the occasion of the Wars between these two Crowns and Nations, which
contending for superiority, great Emulation arose between them, from whence
those reciprocal hatreds which are grounded between them, cannot be cancell'd
by any Peace. The roots of the like Ambition being hatch'd (say they then) in
the Souls of both these Nations; it was necessary that the fruits of hatred,
continual jealousies, and reciprocal suspitions, by which their minds are
continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally agitated, should bud forth. From hence grow cruel hatreds, which
branch out into secret treaties, into plots, and then into open Wars. Building
therefore upon these foundations, they say,' tis true that the King of
<hi>France</hi> had promis'd to forget all faults past, in the Peace of
<hi>Vervin,</hi> and that he had promis'd to forego all Intelligence with the
Enemies of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> But that finding afterwards, that his
Kingdom was bounded on the South by <hi>Spain,</hi> on the North by
<hi>Flanders,</hi> which is under the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> on the East by
<hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> in part obedient, in part subject to the House of
<hi>Austria,</hi> and a little lower by <hi>Italy;</hi> which is likewise
partly subject, partly adherent to the same Crown: And thinking that being, as
it were, imprisoned by the Austrian Forces he did enjoy the freedom which
became so great a King, but that every the least addition of this so great
power indanger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the suppression and suffocation of his Kingdom; he held his
honour and authority to be but small, and that the eyes of all the world were
fix'd only on the Austrian Sun. These were sharp goads to unsettle a well fix'd
Resolution; he considered also what commotions and troubles the meere Dukes of
<hi>Burgondy,</hi> who commanded all <hi>Belgia,</hi> had caused in
<hi>France;</hi> that those Territories would now be incorporated into the
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and back'd by the Forces of <hi>Germany.</hi> That
therefore it became him to think not only upon his honour, but upon his
King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes safety; which being weakened by the late Wars, and vex'd with
intestine dissentions, could not well secure it self from so great a
neighbouring power; that it was usual for Princes to keep others low, for their
own better preservation, and to endeavour the pulling down of those that were
more potent; that principalities were maintained by these Arts. He therefore
apply'd himself to get out of their streights, and to favour the Hollanders,
lest if they should be beaten, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should grow too
strong upon those Confines, or at least that that wound being kept open, he
might be lesse able to advance further; that therefore this Resolution was more
necessary then voluntary, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the interest of self-preservation,
which is by natural reason more warranted to bruit beasts; (and surely then to
men and great Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates) then it is prohibited by the gain-sayings of Peace:
That such Peace wherein one of the parties is subject to the other, does not
deserve the name of Peace, but is rather to be termed Slavery, and not likely
to last long, as was clearly shewn by the Embassadours of <hi>Privernum;</hi>
who being asked, in the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> how long that Peace was like
to last which they desired? answered, that if it were a good one for them, it
should be perpetuall; if a bad one, very short. An answer which made those
Senators know, that no people nor person can keep <pb n="522" facs="tcp:53250:270"/> long
under the sharpness of an unjust condition; and this made them miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the
conditions of Peace, which were granted to those of <hi>Priver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> That
notwithstanding the King of <hi>France</hi> had pieced up that rent by the
Truce, which was by his means made between the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and the
Hollanders; not without much satisfaction to <hi>Spain,</hi> which was then
desirous to see an end of so expensive a War: So as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards had no
reason to complain of any assistance given to the united Provinces, wherein the
chief foundation of their Justice lay. That therefore when <hi>France</hi> was
free of Civil Wars, and had regained her former vigour, the King not being able
to be wanting to the just cause of the German Princes, who had recourse to him
touching the succession of the States of <hi>Iuliers</hi> and <hi>Cleves;</hi>
though it was conceived that he had contracted several Leagues against the
Austrians: Yet if that Kings life had not been cut off in the nick of time, all
those Leagues and Unions spoken of would have soon been seen vanish into smoak;
and it would have been known that they served for nothing but appearing
threats, since it made not for that the King who was then well in years, whose
issue was young, and his Kingdom not yet seled, to enter into new Wars for the
interests of other men; and leave his Kingdom to his young children involved in
forreign Wars: For he might be sure that Regal Authority which curb'd civil
dissentions, ceasing together with his life, the Kingdom which seemed now to be
united would fall into its former disorders, which would draw forreign Forces
into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: That the present King growng in years had given the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> no occasion of complaint, but had alwayes corresponded with him,
as became Princes that were friends and joyn'd in affinity. That the first
encounters arose from what had hapned in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the
King had interested himself out of his being bound to protect the Grisons, and
out of the great prejudice which was thereby occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to his own affairs,
and to the German and Italian Princes. That the first intermission was in a
civil manner, not by Arms, which the King took not up till the first
conventions of <hi>Madrid</hi> were undervalued; and that notwithstanding the
King of <hi>France</hi> did temporise, to ripen some difficulties. But that
seeing no satisfaction given, he was forced to betake himself to Arms; the
business not being yet well adjusted, he was once again necessitated to take up
Arms, for the just and necessary defence of the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who
was by violence kept from suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in the State of <hi>Mantua</hi> and
<hi>Montferrat;</hi> and for no other reason, but for that that Duke was born
in <hi>France,</hi> was of kin to the King, and held great possessions of the
Crown of <hi>France:</hi> That if the Auxiliary Forces of <hi>France,</hi> in
the behalf of that Duke, if the Peace of <hi>Susa</hi> ought to be accounted
violence or injustice, meerly for that they wanted the Cesarean Authority; that
the appearing of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards against that very Duke, not the division of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spanish Agents and the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> were not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced nor corroborated by the Emperour; that
if the merits of the cause, if the intention of Arms, and dissention between
these two Kings, were to be balanced without byass, those of <hi>France</hi>
would appear to be more just, and less concerned then those of <hi>Spain:</hi>
Since the later tended to the offence, the other to the defence of an assaulted
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:53250:270"/> Prince; so as the Spaniards had nothing to object
against the Arms of <hi>France;</hi> nor could the Emperour account his
authority more injured by the French then by the Spaniards: And that the award
of the cause, made on the behalf of the French by the Peace of
<hi>Ratisbone,</hi> did more justifie the Proceedings of the French then of the
Spaniards. For what concern'd the affairs of <hi>Germany</hi> many other
reasons were alledged; amongst the rest, that there was a difference to be put
between the Princes of <hi>France</hi> and the German Princes; that the Regal
Authority of <hi>France</hi> was Monarchical, to which all the Princes of
<hi>France</hi> are Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals; that <hi>Germany,</hi> on the contrary, was
Aristocratical, consisting of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sovereign Princes and free Cities, who
chusing the Emperour for their Head, obey, not as Subjects to a Sovereign, but
as Members and Colleagues of the Empire, enjoying many priviledges and
exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions which suit not with Sovereign Authority; from which exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the
Emperour not being able to derogate, if by any excess of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate power,
exceeding the known Authority of the Laws, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>at any time endeavour to derogate from them, or not observe them,
they hold themselves as much injur'd by him, as the Citizens of a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
would do, if their Head, abusing Authority, and contemning the publick Laws,
should aspire at Tyranny: That all <hi>Germany</hi> did at the present groan
under the burthen of the excessive Austrian authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that she had lost not
only the substance, but the very shadow of her original Liberty, and was
therefore forced to send for the King of <hi>Swedeland</hi> from the utmost
Northern parts to recover their almost lost Liberty: That this defence did
anciently belong to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> to whom upon like occasions
the German Princes had wont to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course: That the present King, out of
his too great respect born to the House of <hi>Austria,</hi> had neglected this
his duty to the German Princes; that he could not without much loss of
reputation degenerate from the Kings his Predecessors, nor by abandoning those
Princes suffer the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> to prevent him in that office which
did of due belong to him; nor would the Concernments of his own Kingdom
tolerate that the Austrian Authority should extend it self further by the
oppression of those Princes: And as concerning the conclusion of peace with the
Emperour, it was neither strange nor new, that the King should not make peace
without his Colleagues the German Princes, since there have been so many both
ancient and modern examples seen of peace solemnly concluded between Princes
and Vassals that have risen up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their Sovereign Prince: The peace of
<hi>Constance</hi> made between the Emperour <hi>Frederick</hi> sirnamed
<hi>Barbarossa</hi> and the Cities of <hi>Italy</hi> which had rebelled against
him; the Truce between the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and the Hollanders; so many
peaces made between the very Kings of <hi>France</hi> and their contumacious
people in the last Civil Wars; and the peace made not many years ago between
the Emperour and the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> are sufficient proofs of peace
made between a Subject and a Sovereign. It was therefore concluded, that the
King of <hi>France</hi> his interesting himself in the civil dissentions of
<hi>Germany,</hi> and in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral peaces that were to be concluded, was not
only just, and usual, but more necessary then that which King <hi>Philip</hi>
the second undertook in the troubles of <hi>France,</hi> which could neither in
justice nor for convenience <pb n="524" facs="tcp:53250:271"/> be parallel'd to this; and
though the King appeared to have undertaken them only for Religion, it was at
last discovered that it was more go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd therein by State interest, then by
Religion; and that therefore if there were any parallel to be made between the
countenancing of <hi>Germany</hi> and that of <hi>France, France</hi> might be
said to have learn'd the the Doctrine of fomenting the differences between
people and their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Princes, and of interessing her self therein, for her
own safety and grandezza, from the School of <hi>Spain:</hi> but that the
greatest part of these pretensions were rather seeming then substantial; for
<hi>Polybius,</hi> relating the true cause of the wars between the Romans and
Carthagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, doth not approve them as just; and though some Princes use to
keep inferiour Princes low, and to weaken the superiour; such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings are
to be esteemed rather tyrannical, then rational, and if King <hi>Philip</hi>
the Second had attained to such Counsels, he would never have consented to the
peace of <hi>Vervin,</hi> wherein Territories and Towns of importance were
restored to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was then the inferiour: wherefore
that peace cannot be pretended to be slavery, though the Austrians were
superiour to the French both in Dominions and Power; for the Romans after the
peace given to the <hi>Privernati,</hi> as they will have it, were superiour to
them; and if peace between Princes of unequal power may be violated by reason
of the inferiours weakness, no firm peace would ever be made between them,
unless the more powerful should divide States and Forces with the less
powerful. They therefore concluded that none of the reasons alledged did excuse
the King of <hi>France</hi> his countervenings; nor could the League con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by his means, some years after between <hi>Spain</hi> and the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, free
him from the preceding countervening, but did rather ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate it; as well
because the Hollanders, being strengthned by those fomentings, were made the
more able to withstand their King, and to force him to so disadvantagious a
Truce; as also by continuing the said assistance to them when the Truce was
expired: Passing then to the Affairs of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> it was said,
That the short relation of that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness would suffice to let the world see
whether of those two Princes were to be blamed. The King of <hi>Spain</hi>
protected the liberty and the Religion of the Valtolinians, by securing them in
both by some little Forts erected in the Valley against the imminent slavery of
the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who were prepared to subjugate them by force; and the
Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linians wanting men to munite them, the French, and with them the
Venetians, stormed very much, when Spanish Garrisons were put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into; as if
the Spaniards had no other end but to make themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Valley;
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to clear both them and the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, deposited
the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> together with the Fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> therein into the Popes hands, who was chose<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> by them both to be Arbitrator of the whole business,

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>reof as
he should se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> reason to do; that
while this was depending, the King of <hi>France</hi> pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest himself both of
the Valley, and of the Forts by Force of Arms: that when the Pope sent men to
recover them, the King, who would not make War with the Pope, upon this account
agreed with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in the peace of <hi>Monsone,</hi> to
restore the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> but upon very favourable conditions, touching
the Liberty and Religion of the <pb n="525" facs="tcp:53250:271"/> Valtolinians, and that
the Pope should demolish the Forts; whereunto the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
condescended only because the King of <hi>France</hi> obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himself to
observe the Covenants which were made in favour to the Valtolinians; so as the
Forts were superfluous, seeing that the two Kings were ingaged by the Peace to
maintain the Liberty and Religion of the Inhabitants: Therefore by this so
favourable Peace to the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinians, the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was justified
in his first taking up Arms. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> his
business deserve much defence, if men will justly consider the result thereof;
for that Prince was not at all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the King of <hi>France</hi> his
protection, since he was deprived of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and of the greater part
of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which were conferr'd upon the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
in recompence for his pretensions, and for <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> which was
assigned over to the King of <hi>France,</hi> contrary to the Articles of
<hi>Ratisbone</hi> and <hi>Cherasco;</hi> so as the Agreement with the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> which was so much exclaimed against, would have been better for
the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> then the protection of <hi>France,</hi> so much
boasted of by the French. And for what concerns the medling in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
between a Sovereign and his Subjects, many considerations were propounded in
favour of the Austrians; for in Peaces made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Emperour and the King
of <hi>France,</hi> the King had more then once renounced such Leagues and
Protections, and promised not to protect those Princes against the Emperour; so
that as the present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course began with <hi>Polybius</hi> his Authority, the
controversie may be end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Lucan</hi>'s Authority, who decides the
difference between <hi>Cesar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> in these words.

            <p>Immediately after the intimation of this war, made in the King of
<hi>France</hi> his name, to the Infanta, did the publication of the League
made between him, and the Hollanders, which hath formerly been menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
follow; and the execution thereof followed the publication forthwith; for the
King of <hi>France</hi> going to <hi>Campania,</hi> assembled an Army of above
20000 fighting men, and sent it into the Country of <hi>Lucemburg,</hi> under
the conduct of the two Marshals, <hi>Chatillione</hi> and <hi>Bresse;</hi>
whereinto being entred, it presently took <hi>Orcimon</hi> and <hi>Rocca,</hi>
strong places upon the Confines, but of small consideration, which yielded
without fighting; and afterwards it took <hi>Marca,</hi> a more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Town; and so advanc'd into the Country which is under the <pb n="526" facs="tcp:53250:272"/> King of <hi>Spain:</hi> Against this Army the Infanta sent out a
strength of 10000 Foot, and of 3000 Horse, the most whereof were tumultuous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

<hi>Thomaso,</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> their Commander in chief; who being
distasted with the Duke his Brother, was privately stoln from <hi>Savoy,</hi>
whereof <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Governour; and having first spent some moneths in the Court of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> he joyn'd with the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces in those
parts. The Prince being come neer the enemy, though he knew himself inferior to
them in numbers, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the advantage in situation he refused not battle,
which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented him: Battle being given neer to the Town of
<hi>Avein,</hi> after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fought valiantly four hours, he was worsted, left
three or four thousand of his men dead upon the place, to boot with his
Artillery, and besides many other Souldiers, and Captains of good condition,
who were taken Prisoners. The Hollanders were by the Covenants of the League to
assault the Provinces which were obedient to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the same time, with another Army on
their side; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying to do it, they afforded the Infanta a breathing time
after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat; but coming at last into the Field, commanded by the Prince
of <hi>Orange,</hi> who joyn'd with the French Army before <hi>Mastrick,</hi>
they made up a Body of 50000 fighting men, abundantly furnish'd with Artillery,
and all warlike preparations: the whole Country bein afraid of them, and
yielding to so great and formidable Forces, they advanc'd without any
opposition to <hi>Terlimone;</hi> which Town presuming too much upon its self,
would be the first that should oppose so vast and glorious an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; for which
boldness it paid soundly: for being taken by assault, it was sack'd with more
cruelty then hath been heard of, of many years. Wherefore the Infanta, having
this mean while made up an Army of those that remained u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>slain at <hi>Avien,</hi> and of other Regiments, which
was much inferiour to that of the enemy, insomuch as he was not able to keep
the Field, put himself into <hi>Loveine</hi> with 5000 Foot and 2000 Horse:
having quarter'd the rest of his Army upon the River <hi>Dee,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

               </gap>rrun, sack'd,
burnt and miserably destroyed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of present help; for the
Infanta's Army half routed, half run away, kept within strong Holds, abandoning
all to Military fury; and doubtlesly the assailants might have done great
things, had they known how to make use of occasion and of the advantage of
time: but lying long idle between <hi>Loveine</hi> and <hi>Termilone,</hi> they
afforded time to the Infanta to fortifie himself, and to expect a great succour
which was sent him from <hi>Germany.</hi> The Colleagues finding the enterprise
of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein</hi> to be too hard and almost impossible, to effect, by reason
of the new Fortifications and number of defendants, they went to before

that they <pb n="527" facs="tcp:53250:272"/> might easily have taken it: but being abused
in their hopes (for they found it extraordinarily well garrison'd, and
fortified round about) they gave the business over; and suffering much in their
Camp for want of Victuals, they were forced to quit <hi>Brabant,</hi> and to

               <p>THis Book tells you the redoubled going out of the Fleet from
  <hi>Naples</hi> against <hi>Provence,</hi> and the accidental disaster of the
  latter. The occasion, rise, encounters and progress of the French Forces, led
  by the Duke of <hi>Rhoan</hi> into the <hi>Valtoline.</hi> The endeavours of
  the French to alienate the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> from the Spanish party,
  and to draw them over to their King. The Pope and Venetians move not. The Duke
  of <hi>Savoy</hi> goes over to the French, more out of necessity then of good
  will. The great Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi> is constant to the Austrians. The
  Dukes of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Lord of
  <hi>Mirandola,</hi> negotiate with the French: the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>
  closes with the French, the others adhere to the Spaniards. The Commonwealth of
  <hi>Genoa,</hi> notwithstanding the great damages suffer'd by her Citizens from
  the Spaniards, and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the distastes she had received in her
  reputation, refuseth to declare manifest neutrality, or partiality, yet in fact
  keeps confident to both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The State of <hi>Millain</hi> is assaulted by
  the French, and by the Dukes of <hi>Sevoy</hi> and <hi>Parma;</hi> who going
  against <hi>Valenza del Poe,</hi> besiege it, but it is relieved, and quite
  freed by the Spaniards. The Duke of <hi>Rhoan,</hi> having routed the Dutch and
  <hi>Millain</hi> Forces, remains absolute lord and master of the
  <hi>Valtoline.</hi>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>BEfore the Austrian and French Forces broke forth reciprocally
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to open war, <hi>Italy</hi> being subordinate to the same disposition of 
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:53250:273"/> affairs, was necessitated to do the like accidents. The
King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> and the Duke of
<hi>Momorancy</hi>'s Forces suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded not against <hi>France,</hi> resolved to
assault <hi>Provence,</hi> which being then unprovided, and not expecting to be
assaulted, afforded hopes of happy successe. Having therefore recruited and
augmented his Army in <hi>Catalognia,</hi> he gave speedy Order for the rigging
up of a Fleet at Sea in <hi>Naples,</hi> which being furnish'd abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with
men, and with all warlike affairs, was to go forth to the prejudice of those
parts, under the Marquess of <hi>Sancta Croce.</hi> And though that Kindom was
exhausted both of men and monies, by its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving re-inforced two Armies in
<hi>Germany</hi> under <hi>Feria</hi> and the <hi>Infanta;</hi> yet as if it
had a Mine abounding therein, it was not long before by the extraordinary
diligence of <hi>Count Montercy,</hi> Vice-roy of that Kingdom; the Fleet,
beyond all mens expectation, was ready to put forth from the Haven of
<hi>Naples;</hi> but failing in their supposal (for neither Gallies nor men
were ready for that expedition) after having tarried long in
<hi>Favi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giana,</hi> a little Island near <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the winter
drawing on, the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so speedily begun, and with such hopes of good,
success was put off till the next year; No man knew whether, or against whom,
this so great preparation was intended: but though this expedition was much
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to be kept conceal'd by setting up contrary Colours, and under
contrary names and pretentions, yet at last after so long delay it was known,
or atlest suspected, that it was intended against <hi>Provence.</hi> But the
effecting of what was intended the year 1635, proved difficult, and almost
imposible: For the enterprize was disturb'd in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning by cross winds
and storms, so as the intention of that voyage was discovered; the Fleet went
forth from <hi>Naples</hi> more numerous, and stronger then before, about the
middle of <hi>May</hi> 1635, and being 80 miles out at Sea, when meeting with
contrary winds and great storms, it was forced, not without danger of
Shipwrack, to make directly towards <hi>Corsica</hi> whither the winds drove
it. Nor did the misfortune end here, but as if that enterprise had been
undertaken in an unfortunate hour, the Fleet was hardly got behind <hi>Capo
Corso,</hi> where it was shelter'd from contrary winds; when another storm
arose from the other side, more furious then the former, which sank 7 of the
Gallies, with all the men and munition that were in them. The rest being
scattered, some here, some there, were forced to throw their Horses, Munition,
Artillery, nay the very monies which was to maintain the enterprise,
over-board; and with much adoe, got one after another into <hi>Porta
Longone:</hi> So as this second attempt proved more disastrous then the former,
and proved more unfortunate to the Spaniards then to their Enemies. But whilst
the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and his Agents in <hi>Italy,</hi> were busied in
preparing against <hi>France</hi> by Sea; those of <hi>France</hi> were not
idle in making prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Territories:
Which preparations being by land, and not subject to the instability of winds
nor waves, struck more home. The first blow light upon the <hi>Valtoline,</hi>
the first occasion and original of which action, together with the pretence
thereof, must be made known before we come to relate the proceedings.</p>
            <p>The Grisons being displeased with the peace of <hi>Monsone,</hi>
(as hath been said) had never approved of those Capitulations; nor would they
allow <pb n="530" facs="tcp:53250:274"/> of the annual tribute of 25000 Crowns, nor allow
that their Magistrates should be yearly chosen by the Valtolinians, answerable
to those Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations; being therefore absolutely deprived of the
preheminence, command, and advantage of so noble a part of their State, they
desired and endeavoured nothing more then the lost possession of the Vally; to
which purpose they complained much, and made great pressures in the French
Court. The Court of <hi>France</hi> was no less discontented, then the Grisons,
with those Capitulations, (as hath been elsewhere said) not only for the
prejudice which would thereby redound to their confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, but for the like
which would result to the Kings Affairs, if things continuing in the present
condition, the Spaniards should be absolute arbitrators of that Vally, and
might pass their men, and whatsoever they listed, through it, as freely as
through their own Dominions. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was no less endeavoured in
<hi>France,</hi> then by the Grisons, how to find out some remedy against this
mischief, without absolute coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervening the agreed on Peace. Some looking
narrowly into the points of that Capitulation, took occasion to question
whether the Valtolini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans did understand themselves to be thereby put into a
state of absolute liberty and exemption, from the high and supream command
which the Grisons had over it before the beginning of these commotions; or
whether the exercise of usual jurisdiction being only taken from them by the
said Capitulations, they were, as touching sovereignty, in the same condition
of subjection and vassalage that they were in before the insurrection. This was
only to deprive the Spaniards of the passage which they had by that Vally, and
so to rob them of the advantage which they pretended by the revolution of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> fomented by them: For if the Grisons should remain
sovereign Lords of the <hi>Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line,</hi> by vertue of those Capitulations,
as they were before the insurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were to have all jurisdicton and
command there, except the ordinary jurisdiction both Civil and Criminal; which
was by those Capitulations granted to the Valtolinians: So as the allowing of
passage was to be granted by them, not by the Valtolinians Strong Arguments
made for this; for if the <hi>Valtoline</hi> were to return by these Articles,
to the same condition it was in the year 1617, who doubts but that then when
there was not any insurrection the leave of permitting passage to forreign
Princes appertained not to the Valtolinians, but to the Grisons? Moreover, no
concession of Jurisdiction, how largely soever exprest, was ever interpreted to
the derogation of the Concessors sovereign Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. So as the exception made
by the Peace of <hi>Monsone,</hi> in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to the Valtolinians, being only
touching the election of annual Magistrates for the administration of Civil and
Criminal Jurisdiction, could not be extended to the supream Mastery which the
Grisons had there, and consequently not to the granting passage: Nay, the
yearly Confirmation of Magistrates being to be made by the Grisons to the
Valtolinians, and the yearly tribute to be paid by the Valtolinians to the
Grisons, witnessed that sovereignty was retained in the Grisons: And the
quantity of the annual tribute being a more adequate price for the concession
of usual jurisdiction, then of Supream power, which is held inestimable, was as
much as to say, that the former was only allowed to the Valtolinians, and not
the latter; and yet it was as <pb n="531" facs="tcp:53250:274"/> strongly urged on the
contrary; that the Grisons authority was violent, and tyrannically usurped,
over their ancient Companions and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates, the Valtolinians, from which
the Valtolinians having freed themselves by force of Arms, and their having
renounced the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations of <hi>Millain,</hi> made between the Duke of
<hi>Feria</hi> and the Grisons, and this Sovereignty not depending upon the
Arbitrement or disposal of the two Crowns, could not be any wise prejudiced by
the Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Monsone:</hi> That the annual Tribute and confirmation
of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates was a meer remission, no concession of the Valtolinians,
meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to free themselves from being disquieted, troubled, or persecuted by
the Grisons, but no price or acknowledgement of Sovereignty; which being
anciently their own, and now recovered by Arms, there was no need that it
should be redeemed by moneys; and on the other side, the Grisons Commonwealth
being in a great part subjugated by the Austrian Forces, and restored by the
said Capitulations, to her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer liberty, was in all acceptions equivalent to
the restoring of the Valtolinians to their ancient Liberty and former
Sovereignty: nor was it probable that one of the two Kings, who had so openly
engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self both by Arms and by particular Decrees for the protection and
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Valtolinians, should mean to suppress them by the Articles of
<hi>Monsone;</hi> and that the other King, who boasts so much of the title of
Just, should intend to favour the unjust Tyrants and violent Usurpers of their
Confederates the Valtolinians liberty: nor did it belong to the titles of most
Christian and most Catholick, wherein the one and the other of these Kings do
so much glory, to reduce to the violent sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Hereticks those
Catholicks who had so justly withdrawn themselves from it: nor that the King of
<hi>France</hi> should by so gross dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling blemish the glory which he had
won in the first wars against the Hereticks of his Kingdom, by favouring
Heresie upon this occasion out of his Kingdom, which he had persecuted with
Arms within his Kingdom even to destruction; but that ifit had been the
intentions of the said Kings to revive the unjust, usurped, and now extinct
Sovereignty of the Grisons, they should have manifested their opinions more
clearly, since the weightiness of the affair did require it; and not have woond
it up mystically and obscurely in some few and general words: they therefore
concluded that the reasons which were alledged on the behalf of the Grisons
were new inventions, meer subtilties and sophisticated interpretations: But
howsoever the French stuck stifly to the advantage of the words; and being
desired by the Spaniards that they would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the agreement to the Grisons;
they answered, that the controverted point of Sovereignty first be declared, it
not being, in their opinion, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently cleared by these Capitulations: but
the Spaniards replied, that the ratification should be first made as clear and
without controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, so that if any doubt should afterwards arise touching
the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, it might be friendly agreed by their Majesties, answerable to
the Capitulation of <hi>Monsone:</hi> wherewith the French not resting
satisfied, the King of <hi>France,</hi> to content the Grisons, made a
Declaration by him self alone in the favour of their Sovereignty; and pretended
that to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer people to pass through the <hi>Valtoline</hi> without their
leave, was a meer gainsaying of the agreement; and the Spaniards esteeming the
French <pb n="532" facs="tcp:53250:275"/> Decrees vain without the joynt consent of their
King, pass'd as many men as they would through the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and
alledging that that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration should by the same agreement of
<hi>Monsone</hi> be made by both the Kings joyntly, they pretended, that being
made by one only, it was null; and that to deny them passage was to contradict
the said Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. These Affairs continued thus controverted a while; the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> endeavouring to keep the Valtolinians on his side,
promised to be aiding to them continually in their Sovereignty and Liberty; and
the King of <hi>France</hi> being unable to see the Valtolinians to depend
total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Austrians beck, favoured the Grisons pretensions, and would
not consent that they should ratifie the Capitulations, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to put
them into free possession of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which they so thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after; and the more to nourish this expectation in them, he was a means why in
the peace of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> where it was covenanted that the places taken
by the Dutch from the Grisons should be restored, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> should also be inserted: which though it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be
express'd, that some Dutch Regiments might be taken from thence, which were
sent thither a little before from <hi>Millain,</hi> lest the Swedes, which
drawing neer <hi>Italy,</hi> were feared would enter by the <hi>Valtoline;</hi>
yet since the general words might bear another interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they added to
the hopes and expectations of the Grisons, and gave the King occasion to betake
himself to these words, so to maintain the pretensitions of his ancient Friends
and Confederates, and to make amends for the prejudice they suffer'd in the
Capitulation of <hi>Monsone.</hi> The King of <hi>France</hi> reaped no little
advantage by these hopes; for though being deeply engaged in several affairs in
<hi>Germany,</hi> he could not apply himself much to this of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> yet feeding them with continual promise, he kept them
constantly at his devotion, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon his pleasure; so as thereby he
did not only recover the authority with the Grisons, which he had in that
Nation before the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt, but had munh encreased it these two last years; for
the parts of <hi>Rhetia</hi> being by the Emperor restored to the Grisons by
the Articles of <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> which were taken from them at the very
beginning of the Mantuan war, but upon condition that they should be no further
forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and the King doubting that the Treaty of <hi>Cherasco</hi> might be
made null, and peradventure that of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> also, by the
re-assignment of <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> he perswaded those people to keep them
well munited, and particularly the passage called <hi>Stainck,</hi> that they
might keep out the Dutch, if they should attempt to enter their Country again:
he made also a Fort Royal be built neer <hi>il ponte del Reno;</hi> and making
them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that those Fortifications made much for the recovery of the
<hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toline,</hi> he put French Garrisons into the new Fort, and into that
of <hi>Stainck</hi> which was newly fortified, all which the Grisons gave way
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, lest the King might be incensed at their refusal, and might waver in his
promise of restoring the <hi>Valtoline:</hi> but the King finding afterwards
what prejudice the passing of the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> and of the Infanta
through the <hi>Valtoline</hi> occasioned to his own concernments, and to those
of the Germans his Confederates, he bethought himself of removing that obstacle
which could only confound the progress of his affairs in <hi>Germany:</hi> he
resolved therefore to send Forces to recover the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> 
               <pb n="533" facs="tcp:53250:275"/> which expedition was not called the maintaining of the
Grisons Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, but the protection of the Valtolinians Liberty, totally
repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Grisons Sovereignty, which liberty the King affirm'd was neer
being suppress'd by the Spaniards frequent passing through that Valley: so as
professing himself to be a Protector of all oppress'd peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he now intended
to secure the tottering condition of the Valtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, as he had restored the
Grisons to their former liberty, and had secured them from the Dutch by the
building of Forts in <hi>Rhetia:</hi> he therefore made the Duke of
<hi>Rohan</hi> his General for that enterprise, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering him to protect them
against the Spanish tyranny with his men, and with those which the Grisons
should furnish him withall. <hi>Rohan</hi> was of the Lineage of the ancient
Kings of <hi>Normandy,</hi> a Captain of a refined and experienced judgment,
nurs'd up from his infancy in Arms, not only an Hugonot in Religion, but a
chief Protector of the Hugonots in <hi>France,</hi> in whose behalf he had
always fought against the Catholick Religion, and against the very King,
insomuch as he was the last of the Princes and Chieftains of that party, who
when they were beaten by the King, humbled himself; and who being pardon'd his
hostile Acts, was banish'd the Kingdom, and confined to the State of
<hi>Venice;</hi> where having staid some years, he by the Kings Commission went
into <hi>Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ia,</hi> and was
assistant to the Kings Embassadour, Monsieur <hi>Dulande,</hi> in the building
of the Forts: he was afterwards imploy'd by the King in the German wars; who
thinking him to be a fit person to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in the intended enterprise of
the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> as one who had been much acquainted with the humours of
that people, and of those parts, wherein he had lived, made him his General in
that enterprise: nor did he erre in his judgement or choice; for he did many
singular acts, whereby he won much honour in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and
obtained many famous Victories there, which had they been done in a larger and
more noble field, they might have made him vie for honour with the most eminent
Commanders of this age. When this business was first begun, war was not as yet
intimated to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor was the peace broken between the
two Crowns: the business of <hi>Triers,</hi> from whence the breach of peace
proceeded, hapned at this time. <hi>Rohan</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his Commission
from the King, went from <hi>Alsatia</hi> with but a few men to the Grisons,
whom he told, that the time which they had so long desired, and which the King
had promised of recovering the <hi>Valtoline</hi> was at last come; and
acquainting them with the Kings Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, he exhorted them to concur with
him in this business, which was undertaken only for their good, and would
redound so much to their advantage. The Grisons believing him, took up Arms
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and refused not to promote the cause with all their Forces:
<hi>Rohan</hi> had not many French with him, so as he began the war of the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> with almost none but the Grisons Forces: it is true, that
the Venetians being very desirous that the <hi>Valtoline</hi> should return to
its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer condition, dismiss'd 2000 French which were under their pay, and
who past easily into the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and joyn'd with <hi>Rohan;</hi>
who about the end of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 35, sent first to take the
Counties of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avenna</hi> and <hi>Bormio,</hi> to the end, that the way
being block'd up to the Dutch Forces by the latter, and to the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> by the former, <pb n="534" facs="tcp:53250:276"/> the <hi>Valtoline</hi>
might the sooner be recovered, which was seated between those two Counties, not
being to be relieved on any side. Nor was his counsel here in vain; for about
1500 Foot, the most whereof were Grisons, and four Troops of French Horse
falling down into <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venna,</hi> under the Embassadour <hi>Dulande,</hi>
they took it, together with the black-house of <hi>La Riva,</hi> and presently
began to munite and fortifie it. There also was a Fort erected in the plain of
<hi>Chiavenna</hi> beyond <hi>La Mera,</hi> upon the way which leads from
<hi>Millain,</hi> called <hi>La Strada Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesca,</hi> to keep any oppositions
from coming that way: And taking also some Barques for Merchandize which they
found at <hi>La Riva,</hi> they furnish'd them with Souldiers, and kept them to
defend the upper Lake. With the like sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed he sent about 600 Foot to <hi>Bormio,</hi> by the
Mountains which were yet covered with snow; who taking the unguarded <hi>Serra
de Bagni,</hi> which stands upon the Mountain which overlookes <hi>Bormio,</hi>
and confines upon <hi>Tyrvolo,</hi> they fell down and took the Town of
<hi>Bormio</hi> without any resistance, together with the whole Country till
you come to <hi>La Serra Della Valtolina,</hi> so as that Country fell into
their possession: the <hi>Serra</hi> are nothing but certain great Gates or
Portals of stone, made in form of an Arch, which are munited on the sides by
ancient Towers with strong Gates of Wood, scituated upon the passes, whereby
men enter and go out of that Country: Who soever will come into these parts
must pass through these Gates, the passage in this Country being so streight,
as the entrance thereinto is let in or shut out, just as in Cities or private
Houses; by the first <hi>Serra de Bagni</hi> the Dutch are kept out, by the
other towards the <hi>Valtoline</hi> the Spaniards. These two Counties being
taken and fortified, <hi>Rohan</hi> went from <hi>Rhetia,</hi> and entred the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> about the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> by the way of
<hi>Poschi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avo,</hi> which lieth between these two precincts, having with him
4000 Foot, and 500 Horse, and reduc'd it into his power without unsheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a
Sword, or discharging a Gun; and with much severity and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, forced the
Inhabitants to abandon the Spanish protection, and to adhere unto the French.
Then building a Fort at <hi>Font Martello,</hi> he fell down with his men
towards <hi>Morbegno;</hi> and quartering them in the Towns near the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> he began to unarm the people, and to put several Taxes upon
them: Nor herewithall content, he forced them to swear Loyalty to the King of
<hi>France;</hi> and doing other things in the Kings Name, he profess'd nothing
less then the maintaining of the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolinians Liberty, as by his Letters
Patents he was bound to do, and as he had promised the Valtolinians both by
word and writing; wherein he did not so much offend the Valtolinians as the
Grisons, to whom the King, and <hi>Rohan</hi> himself, that he might get them
to joyn in this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, had promised, that according to his directions
from the King, he would reunited them to their State, and reduce them to their
ancient subjection; By which actions the Grisons were heinously scandalized,
and made their complaints to <hi>Rohan</hi> himself, and required the
obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of his plighted faith, and the restitution of what had been taken;
who answered, that when the War should be ended, the King would restore all
unto them, provided that that they would reimburse him the monies which he had
laid out: At which answer, being more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry and incensed then before, they
almost all of them left him, and <pb n="535" facs="tcp:53250:276"/> repassing over the
Mountaines, went back again displeased to their own homes. By these so great,
and so many alterations and novelties, the Austrians in <hi>Germany,</hi> and
Spaniards in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> were much moved, and all of them
endeavoured to bring what speedy and necessary help they could thereunto, as to
a blow which by the consequence thereof wounded the total of the common
Affairs. But the more the State of <hi>Millain</hi> was necessitated so to do,
the more was it retarded by weakness; that State being then no less exhausted
of military men then the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> the flower of them both
being gon into the low Countries: So as they wanted Souldiers for their
necessary Garrisons, much more to send into the field; weak was the
preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or provision therefore which from thence could be applied against
this commencing mischief; the Cardinal <hi>Albernozzi</hi> was now Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> a Church-man by profession, and not at all experienced in the
management of War; he immediately deputed <hi>Count Iohn Serbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> with
some few Foot Companies, for the defence of those parts: Who thinking that the
first thing that was to be done was the recovery of <hi>Riva,</hi> gave orde
that a Gally should be drawn out of the Arsenal of <hi>Como,</hi> which was
built before these present Commotions; and not thinking this sufficient for the
businesse, an other Gally was built by the monies of the <hi>Genoese,</hi>
great Masters at this mystery, which was greater. And seeing that the French
were busie in fortifying places, to block up the entrance into the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> he betook himself also to fortifie other places, to oppose
their proceedings; but not succeeding herein, the French failed not to continue
the works which they had begun, and brought them on to <hi>Morbengo</hi> and
<hi>Trano,</hi> the best Towns of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> the latter being
seated on the right hand, the other on the left of <hi>Adda:</hi> And joyning
with the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gotten to those Towns on the
upper side, they sent 400 Horse, and 27 French Foot Colours, into the Towns
which lay lower towards the Lake, striving to block up the Avenues to the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> on that side, and to keep out the Spaniards, from whom, they
being then quartered in the Towns about Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> they in vain
endeavoured to secure themselves. The French proceeded the better in their
works, for that <hi>Serbellone</hi> being then sick could not for many dayes
oppose them; so as necessarily Affairs proceeded but slowly on this side: But
greater and more speedy oppositions came from <hi>Germany,</hi> which had they
been so fortunate, as they were valiantly brought on; or had they not been
defeated by <hi>Rohans</hi> better fortune, they would assuredly have put an
end to the woes that that Country suffered long under. Seven thousand Foot,
sent by the Emperour under the Baron <hi>Fernamont,</hi> who had woon much
honour in the recovery of the great Fort <hi>Filsburg</hi> upon the
<hi>Rheine,</hi> met at <hi>Tyrvolo,</hi> near the Confines of the
<hi>Valtoline;</hi> who falling down with them into the Vally of
<hi>Munister,</hi> he to succour himself on his back, built a Fort above the
Town <hi>Sancta Maria:</hi> Then marching towards the Mountain
<hi>Ombraglio,</hi> that he might enter the Country of <hi>Bormio,</hi> he was
kept out by <hi>Rohan</hi> who had diligently prepossess'd the passes; or
<hi>Rohan</hi> hearing of great moving on that side, and foreseeing the danger
which might thence arise, he feared, and not withou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> reason, that all his precedent actions would prove to
no purpose, unless he <pb n="536" facs="tcp:53250:277"/> should secure himself well on this
side: Parting then from <hi>Morbegno,</hi> he marched speedily to
<hi>Bormio,</hi> carrying many of his men with him; and finding <hi>la Serra de
Bagni,</hi> which is the usual way to pass from <hi>Germany</hi> to the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> sufficiently fortified and garrisoned, he feared lest the
Dutch not being able to enter by that way, would come in by the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er way of
<hi>Agnedina;</hi> leaving therefore his men in <hi>Bormio,</hi> he went with
some few to <hi>Agnedina,</hi> which is a part of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> and by the
assistance of those Inhabitants, who are bitter Enemies to the Dutch, he soon
block'd up and munited those Passes, and put the Agnedini in a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
posture, assuring them that he would still defend them with his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which
lay not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ar off, in
<hi>Bormio,</hi> in case they should be assaulted on that side. This being
done, he returned to <hi>Bormio,</hi> where taking fit order for all things, he
returned to <hi>Morbegno,</hi> fearing that the Fortifications were not there
well finished, and that they might be assaulted by <hi>Serbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;</hi> but he
cast his accounts amiss; for <hi>Fernamont,</hi> who having well munited the
new Fort of S. <hi>Maria,</hi> was passed over the Mountain <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bragl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>o,</hi> seeming as if he would send
men to assault the <hi>Bagni,</hi> went to assault the Sconce <hi>Fraelle,</hi>
and having taken it, he went from thence by unaccustomed ways, and having the
good luck to meet with excellent guides, he came to a certain place, where
playing upon those that defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>la Serra de Bagni,</hi> on the Flank, the
defendants were forced to quit the <hi>Serra</hi> to the Dutch, who much beyond
either their own or their adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries expectation, became immediately masters
thereof; by which loss the French did not only abandon the <hi>Bagni,</hi> but
the <hi>Serra,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Bormio,</hi> and left the whole County
at the disposal of the Dutch, who in a short space march'd on victoriously even
to <hi>Tirano,</hi> in the midst of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> and <hi>Rohan,</hi>
judging it impossible to resist so great a fury, abandon'd the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> and fled with all his men from <hi>Morbegno</hi> to
<hi>Chiavenna,</hi> burning the Bridges of <hi>Adda,</hi> to keep from being
pursued by the Enemy: But this his diligence was more then needed; for
<hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namont</hi> being come without any opposition to <hi>Tirano,</hi> and
understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Count <hi>Montosi</hi> was with a thousand Foot in the
Valley of <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigno,</hi> which was on his left hand, he feared that he
might pass from thence to <hi>Bormio,</hi> and block up the Gate of
<hi>Germany</hi> which he had opened; wherefore he forbore pursuing
<hi>Rohan,</hi> and turning upon <hi>Montosi</hi> came to <hi>Lovigno,</hi>
where he found all that Valley also abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for all the French which were
with <hi>Montosi</hi> were retreated to the Mount in tops, and passing from
thence to <hi>Agnedina,</hi> were come to joyn with <hi>Rohan,</hi> who was
come to the same <hi>Agnedina</hi> by the County of <hi>Chiavenna.</hi> Thus
far the affairs of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> went as well for the Austrians, and
as ill for the French, as was possible; and if <hi>Fernamont,</hi> leaving
<hi>Montosi,</hi> had pursued his victory through the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> or
had gone to <hi>Riva</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <hi>Chiavenna;</hi> or if <hi>Serbellone</hi> had advanced with his men to
<hi>Tirano,</hi> when the Dutch fell down to <hi>Bormio;</hi> or had he
advanced to <hi>Riva,</hi> when the French began to flye, doubtlesly they might
have carried the whole business: But though the necessity of securing the Pass
of <hi>Bormio</hi> may excuse <hi>Fernamont, Serbellone</hi>'s slow proceeding
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no excuse. <hi>Fernamont</hi>'s second errour was greater; he might
have returned to the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> when he found himself safe behind by
<hi>Montosi</hi>'s flight, and joyning with <hi>Serbellone</hi> might have gone
to <hi>Riva</hi> 
               <pb n="537" facs="tcp:53250:277"/> or <hi>Chiavenna,</hi> which being
almost abandoned, he might easily have made himself Master of them; entring
into the Countrey of the Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by the Valley of <hi>Lovigno</hi> he might
have encounter'd <hi>Rohan,</hi> who in his flight past that way; he might have
fallen down upon <hi>Chiavenna</hi> by the Grisons Countrey, and might have
made himself Master there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it being inclosed between his and
<hi>Serbellone</hi>'s Forces: But not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of these things, any of which
if he had done he might have been sure of Victory, he left his men in
<hi>Lovigno,</hi> and went privately to <hi>Tirvolo,</hi> only to provide
victuals for his Army, that he might main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them without incommodating the
Countrey; a resolution, which, though it was commendable for the piety thereof,
was to be blamed by reason of War; for <hi>Rohan,</hi> going to <hi>Coira,</hi>
and assembling the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants together, he encouraged them the best he could
to re-assume the business of the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> which if it should fall
into the hands of the Dutch, they might despair of ever regaining it; whereas
he faithfully promised to restore it to them, as soon as it should be
recovered; and said, that he had Orders from the King so to do. The Grisons
ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horr'd that the <hi>Valtoline</hi> should fall into the hands of the Dutch;
where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they chose, as the lesser evil, to go immediately to the recovery
thereof with those very French who but a little before had appeared so desirous
to retain it for themselves: they therefore joyned all their Forces with those
of <hi>Rohan,</hi> and fell down into the Valley of <hi>Lovigno,</hi> and
coming at unawares upon the Dutch before Sun-rising, who looked for nothing
less, but were drowsie, or fast asleep; The French placed a good number of
their men behind a certain wall near the Church, which they made use of as of a
Trench, to beat down a Bridge which was over a little River; the rest fell upon
the Dutch, and slew many of them, who being in disorder, and not able to
resist, were forced, not without much loss, to retreat towards <hi>Molina,</hi>
a Town near <hi>Bormio,</hi> at the foot of the Mountains, where the Pass and
<hi>Serra</hi> of the <hi>Bagni</hi> is: They tarried there till
<hi>Fernamont</hi> was returned from <hi>Tirvolo,</hi> and had sent 1500 Foot
and some Troops of Horse to take <hi>Mazzo,</hi> a Bridge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the
<hi>Adda,</hi> some few miles above <hi>Tyrano:</hi> But <hi>Rohan</hi> hearing
thereof went, without losing any time, toward the same Bridge, by the Valley of
<hi>Poschiano,</hi> where meeting both of them almost at the same time, they
fiercely disputed the possession of it; and the question was undecided till
night, and the decision was put off till the next morning, both sides keeping
quiet all that night, and each side guarded the head of the bridge, by which
both parties strove to enter, and to advance. <hi>Ferna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> came the same
night to the Dutch with the Van, and knowing the bridge, and the Enemies Forces
which were on the opposite shore, he returned to <hi>Bormio;</hi> and bringing
the rest of his men thither the next day, he encouraged his men with words, and
more Forces: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Rohan</hi> fearing to be fallen upon on the back by
<hi>Serbellone,</hi> quitted the head of the controverted bridge, and retreated
to <hi>Tyrano;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ascertained afterwards that <hi>Serbellone</hi>
was not ready to move, he resolved to assault the Dutch, who were quartered in
a Town near <hi>Mazzo,</hi> though he was inferiour in number, but superiour in
well arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Cavalry. The assault was given so couragiously, as after a long
dispute the French had the better, and put the Dutch to a direct rout,</p>

               </gap> of
the Spanish Empire therein: by these and the like perswasions he tried them
all; and endeavoured to kindle such a fire in <hi>Italy</hi> against the
Spanish Government, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being entertained in the
quenching thereof should forbear bringing the like into other mens houses, or
at least should not be able to extinguish that, which being brought by him the
King of <hi>France</hi> into <hi>Germany,</hi> was endeavoured likewise to be
continued and increased by him; but these his designs though they were much
laboured and negotiated by his Agents and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents in <hi>Italy,</hi> found
not that correspondency in the Italian Princes, which he had fansied to
himself; for the propounded plot, the more plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it was for the novelty
thereof, and for the desire that all men had and have of Liberty, the harder of
digestion it seemed to those who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indowed with more wisdom did foresee
the mortal infirmities which the bad concoction thereof might cause to the
imperfect health of this body in general, and to the particular members
thereof; for though the Spanish Forces, and commotions in these last wars of
<hi>Mantua</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> had been as hateful to the Italians as
they were dangerous; and the Arms and commotions of the French the more
acceptable, as being more advantagious for <hi>Italy</hi> at the present; yet
was not their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred so much against the Spaniards, nor their confidence so
great in the French, as to free themselves wholly from the fear of the
Spaniards, they would submit themselves to the arbitrement of the French, as
they foresaw they must do if their common Forces should prosper; and though
they were not displeased to see the French masters of <hi>Pinarvolo</hi> and
<hi>Casalle,</hi> since by the possession of these two places they curb'd the
Spanish power, and rendred it less formidable to <hi>Italy;</hi> yet they could
not be pleased, nor think that it stood with the common interest, that when the
Spanish Forces should be totally subdued, the French should succeed in their
place; and if they were to be accompanied by the Empire of one of them, they
rather chose the Spaniards company, whose mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration being proved for the
space of a hundred years (if you will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spence with the arrogancy which is
natural to that Nation) made their Authority and Empire appear more tolerable:
they were therefore content, seeing they thought it impossible to obtain
absolute liberty, to see the Spanish power lessened, as it was at the present,
but not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>en down; so
as inclining to neutrality between the two Crowns, their intention was so to
counterpoize the Forces of both the Crowns, by the Italian Forces, as by the
help of the French they might keep the Spaniards short, and by joyning with the
Spaniards they might not suffer the French to encrease in power too
immoderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and so secure their own liberty by this equality, as they might
nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be suppress'd by the one, nor lorded over by the other; therefore the
Venetians, though to boot with their having opposed the Austrian Forces in the
Mantuan wars, they had also assisted the French in the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> yet
for what concern'd the remaining affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and the
State of <hi>Millain</hi> in particular, they abhorred all novelty, 
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:53250:278"/> and seemed more inclined to preserve, then to beat down
the Spanish Empire; nor did the Pope (though he had always studied the
Grandez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za of <hi>France)</hi> seem to persevere in his accustomed course of
favouring and promoting the French interest; but being content to see the
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of <hi>France</hi> radicated in <hi>Italy,</hi> he was not pleased
that the roots should spread further. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> though he was
necessitated to second the will and pleasure of the King of <hi>France,</hi>
yet the manifest slavery which he foresaw he should be subject unto, if the
French should be victorious in <hi>Italy,</hi> made him unwilling; for when the
Spaniards should be driven out of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> he should be
deprived of the prop which their Arms and Power in <hi>Italy</hi> was to the
Liberty and Sovereignty of his Dukedom, against the French Forces, wherewith he
was in danger to be overcome, if the French should succeed in the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> instead of the Spaniards, whereby his Dominions would be
imprisoned by the French Forces, and he himself made ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely subject to the
arbitrement and will of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and of his Agents. The
King of <hi>France</hi> was aware of this difficulty, and that therefore he
could not safely build upon the Duke, though he should enter into the League;
and on the contrary, having found by experience some years before, that though
<hi>Pinarvolo</hi> and <hi>Susa,</hi> with other Towns of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
and almost whole <hi>Savoy</hi> was possess'd by his Forces, yet it was
impossible for him to relieve <hi>Cassalle</hi> so much as with one succour,
without the Dukes permission; and that consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he should find it much
harder, the Duke not concurring with him, nor joyning in the League, to assault
or possess himself of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> he resolved by present
offers and future promises to win his good will, and to promise that he would
make him absolute Lord of the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> these promises were
the rather credited by the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance the King had to him, and by his affection
to his Sister, who being Daughter to a King, and Sister to two Queens, the King
was desirous to confer regal dignity upon her, to the end, that not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
inferiour in degree to her Sisters, she might enjoy the title of Queen, which
he profess'd she should be deservedly honoured with, when to the State of
<hi>Millain, Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> should be added; and as an
earnest peny of his promises, he made the Duke General of his Forces and of
those of the League, bargaining to allow him 12000 Crowns a moneth; not being
aware, that as no force tames, no time consumes, nor any present reward
counterpoizes the Liberty and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty of Principality; so no tie of
alliance or blood can secure it. The Duke consenting to what he could not
refuse entred into the League, and accepted of the Generals place, which he was
to exercise more according to his own concerns, then according to the interests
of others; it was said, and the French did confirm it by their publick
complaints and exclamations, and the sequel (though somewhat am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguously) did
afterwards prove it; that in the interview that pass'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> and the Infanta, when the Infanta came with his Gallies to
<hi>Villa Franca,</hi> there pass'd secret negotiations, by which the Infanta
endeavoured to draw the Duke over to the Spanish party, and to win him from the
French; and that the Duke acquainted the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanta with what necessity he had to
keep fair with the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> 
               <pb n="542" facs="tcp:53250:279"/> lest his
State might be over-run by the French Forces, who might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by
<hi>Pinarvolo;</hi> and that though he might be sure to be succoured in such a
case by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> as his Father had been, yet he was sure
that <hi>Piedmont</hi> could not be the precincts, as it always had been,
wherein the conflict between the Forces of the two Crowns should hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen; and
that though the Spaniards should be victorious, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate could not but be
very prejudicial to his State, and ruinous if the success should prove
otherwise; so as, he said, he was not to declare for the Spaniard, but upon
urgent occasion: but that when occasion should serve, he would always make it
known, how much he valued the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Spanish Empire in the State
of <hi>Millain:</hi> others added more particular promises, that he would never
consent to the taking of any Towns in that State; but that fighting only in the
Campagnia, he would carry things with respect to the affairs of that Empire;
and finally, it was commonly believed, that a counter-league was tacitely
agreed upon between them, for the common concernment.</p>
            <p>The Dukes of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Lord of
<hi>Mirandola,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared contrary to the Popes and Duke of
<hi>Savoy's</hi> inward maximes; who driven either by their dislike of the
Spanish Empire, or allured by the great hopes they had in the King of
<hi>France,</hi> or eg'd on by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of inlarging their Confines, wherein
they thought themselves all of them too much streightned, or being moved by all
these respects, they gave ear to the new confederacy: Those of <hi>Modena</hi>
and <hi>Mirandola,</hi> though they entred into the Negotiation, it is not well
known, whether they concluded and subscribed it, or no; for, as shall be said
hereafter, they were diverted from it, before the publication: but the Duke of
<hi>Parma,</hi> who was more incens'd against the Spaniards, and incited by
more resentments and greater hopes, did not only willingly and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter
into the League, but amidst the so many troubles and damages which did result
to him thereupon, shew'd such solid resolution and constancy therein, as it
seemed not only strange but monstruous to all men: every one wondring that a
young Prince should so totally aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the footsteps so happily trod in by his
fore-fathers, and should so eagerly embrace contrary Counsels. The occasions of
this so great and constant alteration, if we will believe what he published by
his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesto, were of themselves so slight and so inconsiderable, as they
were generally held rather pretences, then real causes thereof: so as several
discourses arose thereupon; the most universal was, that the Duke being young
when his Father died, and his Uncle the Cardinal, who was his Guardian, dying
not long after, grew to have haughty thoughts, and that being of opinion, that
the obsequie and adherence to the Spaniards, which was held by his
Grand-father, Father and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, to be the chief foundation of Principality,
was nothing else but meer slavery; and that the Sovereignty of Italian Princes,
who adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> was meer subjection; that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e therefore aspired to more
absolute liberty, for the arriving whereat he thought that the peace of
<hi>Italy,</hi> and the present condition of affairs, was a great obstacle
which made him prone to embrace novelties, and that he was fed with hopes by
the French, that the Spanish Empire being laid low, he might arrive at more
greatness, and acquire new Dominions; and <pb n="543" facs="tcp:53250:279"/> it being
conceived that so young a man could not be capable of such high conceptions; it
was commonly held that Count <hi>Fabio Scotto,</hi> who was his Chamberline and
favorite, one who was wholly inclined to the French, in whose service he had
one of his Sons, and from whom it was thought he received a Pension, did kindle
these thoughts and hopes in the young Prince: it was thought that this man
fomented his Princes inclination with several suggestions, and that he strove
by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral means to incense him against the Spaniards, and adhere unto the
French; propounding unto him the continual servitude which he derived from the
obsequies of his Grand-father and Father to the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> the
meanness of his State and his low condition, whilst he should continue to do
so; and on the contrary, the liberty, esteem and encrease of fortune, which he
assuredly would purchase by adhering to the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> also the
condition of the present times, which concur'd thereunto, did much foment such
thoughts; for when this Prince began to interest himself in these affairs,
fortune began to smile upon the King of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>dens</hi> proceedings, and to

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rown upon the house of
<hi>Austria;</hi> and therefore he, either perswaded by others, or by himself,
that the fortune and power of the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was the chief
upholder of the Swedish Forces, being to be much advanced by the ruine of the
house of <hi>Austria,</hi> it must needs be excellent Counsel, to abandon the
falling fortune of that Crown, and to be one of the first that should adhere to
the others encreasing fortune. The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had from the
beginning discern'd the sprightly genius of this Prince; and thinking by some
shew of resentment to make him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the way of his predecessors obsequie
and devotion, they made him stray the farther out of it; for when mention was
sometimes made of this Prince in that Court, they would talk of his elder
Brother, who being a natural fool, was declared incapable of succession;
sometimes they took Don <hi>Octavio</hi> into consideration, another elder
Brother of the Dukes, made legitimate, though a fool, and inabled to succeed in
the Principality, when his Father, Duke <hi>Ranutio,</hi> had not, nor hoped
not for, any lawful heirs: which things were brought upon the board rather to
threaten the Duke with the doubt of succession, if he should persist in these
novelties, then that there was any thought to put them in practice; and Duke
<hi>Alexander,</hi> Grand-father to the present Duke, having done homage to
King <hi>Philip</hi> the Second, when the Citadel of <hi>Piacenza</hi> was
restored to him by the said <hi>Philip,</hi> and having been invested
therewith, upon condition that he should keep a Governour there, in whom the
Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> might confide, he thought that the King might have some
pretence or colour to be judge in the controverted succession, and that he
might see his sentence perform'd by force of Arms, when he should by the Dukes
comportments be constrained to renew those things touching the succession,
which should he persevere in his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers devotion, would be laid aside.
This medling with a part so sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, and which could by no means endure to be
handled, occasioned quite contrary effects to what was imagined; for the
<hi>Conde Duca,</hi> who having framed such conceits forbare not upon occasion
to speak of them openly; whereas he thought thereby to suppress the eager
desires of this Prince, found afterwards that they served for bellows to make 
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:53250:280"/> flame higher; for the Duke thinking that the Court of
<hi>Spain</hi> meant, under these pretences, to make use of these

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>etters, grew so inraged; as any
the least commotion he heard of in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> much more the
taking up of Arms by the Duke of <hi>Feria</hi> and by the Infanta moved him
beyond measure, as if they had been undoubtedly prepared for his ruine; so as
the fear of losing those possessions he had, being added to the hopes he had
fancied unto himself of augmenting them by joyning in League with the King of
<hi>France,</hi> he began to raise men for his own defence, to munite his
Forts, and to hold closer intelligence with the King of <hi>France,</hi> that
he might the better secure himself against such threats; and raising his
thoughts yet higher, being big with conceit of the liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi>
he, like another <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> did so zealously covet the beating
down of the Spanish Empire, as not only one, but many <hi>Charles Emanuels</hi>
seemed in all mens opinions to be risen up in this young Prince; and his
actions shewed in the progress of time, that Count <hi>Fabio</hi> was not the
Author of these sprightly counsels, but that they were the proper and natural
conceptions form'd in the Dukes own Idea. The Alienation of this Prince and of
the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> though they were none of the greatest in Dominions
nor in Forces, did notwithstanding discompose the affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> in
<hi>Italy,</hi> and were of no small moment to the safety of the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> Commerce by Land being totally separated by their States,
from between the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Naples</hi> and the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
which was so necessary for the conveyance of Horse, which could not be carried
by Sea without much inconvenience; in which case, the State and Havens of
<hi>Genoa</hi> (which by reason of the good correspondency between the Crown of
<hi>Spain</hi> and that Commonwealth, had formerly been a safe landing for the
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards) being now become doubtful (as shall hereafter be said) by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the bad satisfaction which many of the Genoese Citizens recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the
Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> or not safe by reason of the French Fleets which were
upon the Mediterranean; and the <hi>Valtoline</hi> being in the hands of the
French; <hi>Italy</hi> and the State of <hi>Millain</hi> were subject to be
invaded by their Armies: so as the affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> were subject to
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest danger, and strange events. The Spaniards therefore appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
what might happen, strove to re-gain, at least, the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi>
who drew along with him the Lord of <hi>Mirandola,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended much upon
him; for if <hi>Modena</hi> should be wrought upon, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples</hi> was sufficiently secured, since his State confined on the
one side with the State of <hi>Bollognia,</hi> on the other with that of
<hi>Crema;</hi> so as Horse (which are not usually denied passage by the Popes

<hi>Cremona,</hi> and from thence into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> without
touching upon <hi>Parma.</hi> Don <hi>Francisco di Melo,</hi> one of the chief
of the Nobility of <hi>Portugal,</hi> descended from the noble house of
<hi>Braganza,</hi> and consequently famous for birth, but more for worth and
dexterity, and great abilities which he had in the concernments of
<hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> where he had lived long with the title of Embassador in

the Princes <pb n="545" facs="tcp:53250:280"/> of <hi>Italy;</hi> wherefore being thought a
fit Instrument for such a business by Cardinal <hi>Albornoiz,</hi> he was sent
to <hi>Modena</hi> and to <hi>Mirandola,</hi> where having trea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

he deviated the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence which both of them had contracted with the
French: the Lord <hi>Mirandola</hi> was by agreement made with the King of
<hi>France,</hi> to have received shortly a French Garrison into
<hi>Mirandola;</hi> but <hi>Melo</hi> withdrew him from those treaties, and
reduced him under the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al protection of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> and
he prevail'd so much with the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> as foregoing also the
treaty of League with <hi>France,</hi> which was already either concluded or
neer concluding, he made him joyn in League with the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi>
upon condition that he should forthwith send his Brother, Prince
<hi>Reynaldo,</hi> who was afterwards Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, to defend the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> with a Brigade of Modeneses; and on the other side, deliver'd
him possession of <hi>Correggio,</hi> which had been the reason why that Duke
had been displeased with the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> he, moreover, promised
him in the Kings name many honours and dignities; upon which promise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the Duke ere long went to
<hi>Madrid,</hi> where he was honourably received, and made General of the
Ocean, with a stipend of 24000 Crowns a year. The great Duke of
<hi>Tuscany,</hi> either was not desired by the French to enter into the
League, or being desired, refused; it was not to be feared that he would enter
into new Counsels, were it either that, with the wisest, he did think them good
for the common good; or were it for that being Son to a Sister of the present
Emperour, he thought himself in honour interessed in what concern'd the
Austrian Family; which was the cause why in the late wars of <hi>Mantua</hi>
and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> he had openly declared for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strians; and holding
the State of <hi>Sienna,</hi> in Fee, from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> upon
obligation to succour the State of <hi>Millain</hi> with a certain number of
men, he could not well joyn in Confederacy with other Princes against the said
State; and therefore soon after the war was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, upon the same <hi>Francisco
di Melo</hi>'s going to him, he entred into League with the Crown of
<hi>Spain,</hi> which was after establish'd by his Secretary <hi>Dominico
Pandolfini,</hi> and sworn unto in defence of that State, and was bound to send
the Brigade of Foot, which he was to have sent to the State of <hi>Sienna,</hi>
and which was accordingly sent under the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Camillo dal Monte;</hi>
and, moreover, he of his meer will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, obliged himself to pay 4000
Swissers, and to send 500 Horse, which he soon did, under the Marquess
<hi>Ricciardi;</hi> for which noble and generous action, the King made
<hi>Iovan Carlo,</hi> Brother to the said Duke, and who was afterwards
Cardinal, Supream General of all his Majesties Fleets in the Mediteranean: the
French therefore had no hopes of prevailing with that State.</p>
            <p>They thought they might build more safely upon the State of
<hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> by reason of the displeasure which many of those Citizens at
this time conceived from the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> by means whereof they
thought they might divert that Common-wealth from that good cor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency which so many years had
been held between her and the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> so happily. And that it
may be known how this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satisfaction hapned, it will be necessary that
repeating somewhat that hath already been touch'd, we make a particular
discourse thereupon; <pb n="546" facs="tcp:53250:281"/> the which may serve not so much to
acquaint the present Age with what hath hapned in these our times, as the
future.</p>
            <p>The Common-wealth had held for an undoubted Maxime of State, that
the King being concern'd in that State, by reason of her negotia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with
that Crown, should stand for ever well affected to the liberty thereof; And the
King likewise, out of the same considerations, was of the same opinion, that
the Common-wealth should alwayes stand well affected to his Crown. From this
conformity of opinion did that perfect and affectionate correspondency result,
which made them never weary of assisting one another reciprocally; and a whole
Age of experienced happiness being past, there was nothing done either by the
Spaniards or Genoese, where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n the
dignity of that Crown, and the preservation of the Common-wealths liberty was
not joyntly intended. The Genoese allowed the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> to
maintain a great number of Gallies in the Haven of <hi>Genoa,</hi> whereby
those Kings kept their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions in <hi>Italy</hi> joyn'd to their Kingdomes
of <hi>Spain,</hi> which were so far divided both by Sea and Land. Passage was
granted easily, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of that Crown, by the Genoese, through their
Common-wealth; Those Kings made use of the Genoeses in their Affairs and
Imployments of greatest importance, trusting them with the supream command of
their Fleets at Sea, and of their Armies by Land; being enlivened by this
nearness and affiance the Genoese, brought home all that by their industry and
negotiation they had formerly gotten in several of the parts of the world, into
the States and Dominions belonging to that Crown. And the richest and
wealthiest of them, having imployed their riches and fortunes in the service
thereof, were both a great help to the Spaniards, and received much honour and
advantage thereby. By these mens industry those Kings turn'd all the Indian
merchandize into Gold, and they conveyed not only the Spaniards Gold but their
own, and the like of all <hi>Europe,</hi> whither soever the occasions of that
Crown required, as oft as the treasures of <hi>America</hi> came not time
enough, or were not sufficient to supply them. And all things went succesfully
by reason of the credit and great correspondency which they had gotten in all
the world by their real and punctual proceedings; a most happy Age, wherein
nothing was contended for between so great a King and the Common-wealth, but
reciprocal zeal and passion how to serve each other. The War made these late
years by the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> wherein he was assisted by <hi>France</hi>
against the Common-wealth, added new and stricter tyes to this so great an
union; wherein the King having been very ready and zealous to defend and
preserve the Common-wealth, she found she had not placed her hopes of
preservation formerly in vain in the union of that Crown; for the Common-wealth
finding her self abandoned in those necessities by all the Princes of
<hi>Italy,</hi> nay by the Pope himself, not without apparent scandal, she
found no Arms ready to fence her self against so great a Tempest but those of
<hi>Spain;</hi> which coming, in both by Sea and Land to her assistance, the
Common-wealth being assisted only by the Forces of <hi>Spain,</hi> was able so
to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Assaulters, as she had the better of the business; by all
which successes, the King and all his friends might easily perceive that the
joyning of the French Forces to those of <hi>Savoy</hi> against the
Common-wealth, <pb n="547" facs="tcp:53250:281"/> was not only to resent the buying of
<hi>Zuccharello,</hi> but to bound the Austrian greatness; and to begin the
abasing thereof in the ruine of <hi>Genoa;</hi> and that likewise the fall of
that Common-wealth was not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Rebublicks and chief Princes of
<hi>Italy,</hi> for any other end, save only that holding her to be too
cordially united to the interests of that Crown, they thought they could not
safely build upon her for those ends which they were intent upon; which were,
to pull down the Spanish Grandezza, the preheminency whereof they could not
see, and patiently suffer: So as the ones security, and the others greatness,
which were apparently practised against, being joyned to the reciprocal
advantagious bonds of such an union, it seemed that no future chance could
interrupt it. But the felicity of this world is not so secure, but that when it
is come to the height, it declines; for the storm which troubled <hi>Genoa</hi>
was not well over, when on the sudden, the so well grounded union was disturb'd
and indangered; it is hard to penetrate into the true and intrinsecal cause of
this change of this Scene. But the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards thinking that they had merited
exceeding much of the Genoese, by the assistance which they had given them,
pretended mighty matters from them; which not being granted neither by the
publick, nor by the private persons, begot ill blood in them, and particularly
in the <hi>Conde Duca;</hi> who was of a high spirit, one who naturally abhor'd
ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes, inclined to novelties, no wayes desirous to give
satisfaction to such Princes as were friends to the Crown, and (chiefly) not to
the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noese. Neglecting therefore that good correspondency which
<hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, and <hi>Philip</hi> the second, and the third, had
still endeavoured to preserve, he began on the sudden, and under colour of the
empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Kings Exchequer, to seiase upon their riches, which by reason
of their greatness being become odious in that Court were also esteemed hurtful
and prejudicial, as if they had been accumulated by wasting the Kings
Patrimony. Which conceits being promoted by the <hi>Conde Duca</hi> his
authority, some books or libels concerning them were disperst abroad in
<hi>Madrid;</hi> which though they were confuted sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet they were
readily embraced by the other Spanish Agents. Whence very great inconvenience,
loss, and dissatisfaction redounded to the Genoeses: And the first blowes being
made at private Citizens of <hi>Genoa,</hi> who would not consent to the
injurious negotiations which were propounded to them by the <hi>Conde
Duca;</hi> therefore what began with private men past on to the publick
distast; by reason of the former Wars of <hi>Genoa,</hi> some alterations had
sometimes hapned in that Court, to the prejudice of the Contract: But such as
by reason of their slenderness and seldomness might well have been endured. And
if the Kings, forced by some necessity, made any alterations, yet knowing how
useful and necessary the maintaining of the Contract was, they avoided breaking
it, and endeavoured to piece it up by making amends, some way or other, to the
negotiators. So as the Contract was kept still on Foot, and the sharpness or
bitterness of the losses suffer'd by the past alterations were abundantly
salved by the assistance which was given in the subsequent Warrs. But the War
being ceased, this mischief in those Spanish Agents, against the Genoeses,
began to be revived again, and renewed with such vehemency, as being continued 
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:53250:282"/> beyond all measure or end, it necessarily brought the
Genoeses even to the precincts of desperation: no gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t enterprise or action was resolved
upon in that Court, or in the Spanish Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> where some
design was not had upon the moneys of the Genoeses; the arming made in
<hi>Naples</hi> against <hi>Provence</hi> by the Viceroy <hi>Montersi,</hi> was
not only put together at first, and in a great part formed by moneys taken from
the Genoeses, but was recruited and re-assumed twice or thrice by the same
moneys: this mischief began first by the Kings Decree published in the
beginning of the year 1627, a year after the war of <hi>Genoa;</hi> by which
the satisfaction and payments, which were formerly assigned to the Genoeses, in
somuch Gold and Silver, which should be brought by the first Plate-ships from
<hi>America</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> were altered; in lieu whereof so many
yearly rents were assigned to them out of the Kings Revenue, and out of
impositions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conde Duca,</hi> and the other Spanish Agent esteemed it a
great advantage to make use of those ready moneys which they had of the
Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noeses upon new occasions: but as all novelties which are not introduced out
of true but appearing reasons, bring forth often sad accidents; so was this
resolution occasion of strange inconveniences, in prejudice to the contract
which was so necessary for that Court; for the King by this Decree suffer'd
much in his Credit and Reputation of contracting, which was formerly so highly
valued: the negotiating Genoeses did likewise suffer not only in their own
particular concernments, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in their Credit, which being formerly
incredible with all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, began by this Court-novelty, and by this
alteration of pay, to lessen. Forreign Nations suffer'd, which had trusted
their moneys in the Banks of the Genoeses; to the end, that they might exchange
them from place to place throughout all <hi>Europe,</hi> for the maintenance of
the Spanish Armies and Fleets: a great contrivement which had been long happily
experienced, and such as the Gold and Silver yearly brought in by the
Plate-fleet, and the Annual Revenues of the Crown not being sufficient for it,
did like a devouring whirlepool, always open, require indefinite ready moneys,
at all times, and in all Regions; which could be had no where else, but from
the Mine of the Genoeses Credit; all Merchants in all places suffer'd in their
Commerce and exchange of Moneys; which is the only means to make use of ready
moneys with least danger and expence in far-off Countries: the detaining these
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys in this Court occasioned all this inconvenience; just as when the chief
Fountain is dried up, all the Rivulets which derive from thence do grow dry
likewise, and the Grass is burnt up. By these unusual accidents the good
correspondency between the Genoeses and this Crown began somewhat to slacken,
advantage being the best nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to inclination, and prejudice the worst
venome; but these novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties began soon to cease.</p>
            <p>For the Spaniards finding, at last, how necessary it was for so
vast a machination to have Architects that were excellent at Traffick, who were
born out by credit, and very cunning in the winding and turning of Moneys and
merchandize; and finding that the Florentines, who in emulation or spite to the
Genoeses, were brought in by them to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, were not able to undergo
such a burthen; and that therefore <pb n="549" facs="tcp:53250:282"/> their Negotiations
did not only not proceed so well as they had hoped, but that Trade was
interrupted, to the great prejudice of the Crown, it behoved them to reduce it
into the ancient channel, and, in a great part, to put it again into the hands
of the Genoeses; and this resolution was the rather taken, for that the Spanish
Officers found, that Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by the Genoeses was not so very prejudicial
to the Kings purse, nor to the bettering of their own fortunes, as some of them
had belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; for to boot that they found that the consideration money was not
so excessive, as had been thought; and that all the mischief proceeded from the
great expence which the passing of business through so many hands, and in so
many places, brought with it, they afterwards, that they might make the
Genoeses plunge themselves further into business and negotiation, and take upon
them greater bargains, made the King invite them by Commendams, Titles and
Rewards, more then the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the businese did naturally bring with
it; and though the interrupted negotiation began to grow better, yet many
Staple Towns of Trade were wanting, and therein many of their Creditors for
ready money, who instead of ready moneys which were due unto them at their
Marts or Fairs, were forced to receive payment in credit given in far-off
Countries: so as the affection of the Genoeses being moved by so much
prejudice, made the Citizens grow somewhat testy; and on the other side, that
<hi>Hob goblin</hi> which misguiding the Spaniard in point of profit in
negotiation had troubled the current of business, did also conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vex
their minds, by the noise of the Genoeses wealth, and did suggest thoughts into
them of taking from them what they had gotten. They did not re-attempt their
goods nor the payments of the contract, finding the great inconveniences which
were occasioned by the last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions; and which were more apprehended now,
by how much it was more necessary to maintain the credit of the negotiating
Genoese, which was not a little diminish'd by the late Decree; and for that
they saw the urgent necessities of the Crown, reduced by that Decree into great
streights: Leaving therefore the Negotiation untouched, they seized upon the
yearly Rents of the Genoeses, which were in <hi>Naples, Spain,</hi> and in the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and which were of great worth; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution which
was ill resented and worse digested; for none being, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, prejudiced under
the name of Forreigners, but the Genoeses, against whom the King had no just
pretence at all, the injustice did the more appear, for that the natural
Subjects goods were not retained: this afforded occasion of several discourses;
as, whether the Kings Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer got more discredit, or advantage by it;
whether the Kings designs were more advanced, or more retarded thereby; whether
it did fasten or slacken the devotion of the Genoeses towards the Crown:
Contrary effects arising from the same cause which brings profit, and shews
Penury, which is a help to the Royal Revenue, and darkens Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, captivates
the goods, and alienates the affection; leaving it in doubt, whether there be
any thing of Royalty or Monarchy in that Project, which is neither order'd by
Justice, nor accompanied with Generosity; and because for justification of such
a Decree, provision might be had for repairing the loss, they talk'd of
assigning reparation to such as were grieved; but the restoring was not so
ready nor equal <pb n="550" facs="tcp:53250:283"/> to the dammage undergone, as was the
benefit of the second retention efficacious in behalf of the Kings Exchequer,
to make the Officers desirous to reiterate it to the prejudice of the same
Genceses; the second decr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e was
therefore determined, which was the more felt, as the disease was more
confirm'd, and touched many in their livelihoods and families; which was
stomack'd by many, and began to corrupt that confidence and trust which was
formerly had of the punctuality of that Crown, touching the payment of the
Revenues thereof, which were sold for ready monies. Wherefore they bethought
themselves of being more backwards in interessing themselves again with that
Crown, and to listen more to novelties; and finding what great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falcations
were made in their principles, by the retention of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, they began to
fear, what hapned, that the malady would be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, and grow dayly worse.
They therefore studied as much as they could to rid their hands of the
Revenues, by selling the Principal; that they might imploy the price thereof in
other States, in whose justice they mought more safely confide; since such vast
sums could not be imploy'd in the Territories of <hi>Genoa.</hi> So as some
thought of send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their monies to <hi>Rome,</hi> some to <hi>Venice;</hi> but
this was presently hindred by the same Spanish Officers. For being desirous to
keep the Genoeses subject to the Kings interests out of their own concernments,
they by indirect means hindred the sale of their principal; which proved very
prejudicial to the Genoeses; who not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Revenues, nor
to make use of their principal, were forc'd contrary to all right, to keep it
subject to a continual diminution; and the retention continuing, many Citizens
lost their greatest wealth, whereby they maintained their families. Wherefore
the Common-wealth which heard continual complaints hereof, and evidently found
how much the prejudice of private, persons which was insufferable, did redound
to the publick loss; was forced to complain thereof to the King, by <hi>Cesaro
Durazzo,</hi> whom they sent Embassadour in extraordinary to him to that
purpose: And he bringing back no satisfaction but in words, and faithful
promises of making reparation for what loss had been suffer'd, and of desisting
from being so in the future, which was not made good; for the retention
continued, and the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens began again to resent yet more, and to grow cooler
in their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to that Crown. This ill disposition was yet more fomented,
by but bad satisfaction which the Common-wealth it self received at the same
time from the Officers of the Crown: Which beginning (as hath been said
elsewhere) from the impunity of the Conspirators, which the same Officers with
such eagerness press'd for, was resented with no little admiration and grief by
the private Citizens, and as constantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by the Common-wealth. And as it
was seen that this earnest pressing of the Spanish Officers arose from the
immense desire they had to satisfie the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s ardent
desires, who was then a bitter Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the Common-wealth, and the chief
favourer of the Conspiracy; so did the Common-wealth think her self the more
injured by that Crown; for that preferring the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s
reconciliation before the sincere and never interrupted friendship of the
Common-wealth, it had concluded peace with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whilst
the differences <pb n="551" facs="tcp:53250:283"/> between that Duke and the Common-wealth,
were not yet well composed. To this was added the ardent desire of that Crown,
that Monsieur <hi>Di Sabran,</hi> Resident for the King of <hi>France,</hi>
should not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to tarry in <hi>Genoa,</hi> which was interpreted by
the Spaniards as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the alienation between the Common-wealth and
the Crown; by which occurrences the Kings Officers believing that the Genoese
fell much off from the union, and good correspondency towards the Kings
Affairs; and fearing lest the wound should fester, which might oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion more
mischief, they bethought themselves of a means, by which the generality of the
Citizens should be inforced to be better inclined to the Crowns concernments
then they held them to be; and more desirous to joyn with the Court Agents in
their desires; which was an excepting some of the Citizens, who were held to be
most affected to the Crown, from the retention of Revenues: thinking thereby to
insinuate unto the rest that they might be the better able to get their rents,
if they would appear partial to the Kings interest. This caused great commotion
amongst the Citizens, all of them detested it, as seeds of civil dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
sow'd by the Spanish Agents amongst the Citizens. And the Common-wealth knowing
how deeply this struck at the foundation of publich Concord, did at the first
hearing very much resent it; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the solid and well regulated
Government of the Common-wealth might be thereby much disordered; since those
that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted might mind more their private then the publick good. And
those that were excepted were as much displeased thereat as were the rest; who
thinking themselves to be more noted then favoured by that exception, seemed
particularly offended. The Common-wealth therefore, that she might countermine
and render this decree vain, which was so pernicious for her, ordered that
whatsoever rents should be paid to those that were excepted should be shared
equally by all that were concern'd in the like rents. So the Common-wealth
making use of her Native Liberty, would make <hi>Italy</hi> see, and all
Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendom, how far she undervalued any Interest in respect of the liberty,
The proceedings of the Marquess <hi>Sancta Croce,</hi> Generall of her Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Fleets at Sea, did likewise much irritate all the Genoeses; who though in
respect of what he had done for the Common-wealth, when he was made by the King
Captain General of the Forces that were sent to relieve her, he had received
all the satisfaction both of honour and gratitude that she could give him; yet
the seeds of bad satisfaction being already sowed (as hath been said) by the
<hi>Conde Duca,</hi> to the prejudice of the Genoeses interests; <hi>Sancta
Groce</hi> who was one that did chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the authority of the
<hi>Conde Duca,</hi> was of all others most sollicitous and most accurate in
seconding his Genius, greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the occasion which presented it self,
of sharing in his resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For being in <hi>Messiina,</hi> with the
Galleyes and Standard royal, when the Common-wealths Gallies came thither with
her Standard, he intended some innovation, in prejudice to the precedency which
was usually given there to her Standard; which <hi>Luca Iustiniano,</hi> the
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths General, hearing, though he had much adoe to believe it, yet he
took notice thereof, complained much, and endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move him from the
thought thereof, both by affectionate entreaties, <pb n="552" facs="tcp:53250:284"/> and by
evident reasons alleadged on the Common-wealths behalf. But in vain, for
<hi>Sancta Croce</hi> was resolute in his intention; so as <hi>Iustiniano</hi>
seeing he could do no good upon him, that he might avoid further
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, resolved to be gon; and bringing news to <hi>Genoa</hi> of
<hi>Sancta Croce</hi>'s comportments, he inceased resentment generally in the
minds of all the Citizens, who were very much offended with the Spanish
Officers for the continual injuries which they received from them: Wherefore
the Common-wealth took from him all the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges which she had granted him
for his former services. The Common-wealth was also very sensible of another
sad accident, which hapned not long after, almost within sight of the City. Ten
<hi>Holland</hi> ships came to <hi>Genoa</hi> fraught with merchandize, and
victuals, which belong'd partly to the publick Granary of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
partly to the private Genoeses, and partly to forreign Merchants who resided in
<hi>Genoa. Don Melchiore di Borgia,</hi> General of the Neopolitan Gallies, was
in the Haven of <hi>Vai</hi> neer <hi>Savona;</hi> and hearing of these ships,
put to Sea, and assaulted them, and took them, and carryed them away to
<hi>Naples,</hi> with their lading as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full prize; alledging for his
defence, that being <hi>Holland</hi> ships, who were Enemies to the King, he
might lawfully take them. The Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth held her self offended by this
action, several wayes; chiefly, for the violation of the jurisdiction of her
See; pretending, as undoubtedly she might, that the jurisdiction of the whole
Ligustick Sea did ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to her, she having won it with her own
Fleets, having an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently defended it from the <hi>Saracens;</hi> which
pretension is approved by ancient Cesarean priviledges, and by the authority of
the most famous ancient Writers and Civilians. Moreover, she held her self
injured by the interruption of commerce, and concourse of Forreign Ships in her
Havens, for wrong done to the publick Store houses of the City and of the
Common-wealth; for the loss that redounded to private Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and to
Forreigners, who resided in the City upon account of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and to the
Custom-house; and finally, for the violation of the Laws of Hospitality: whilst
the Kings Captains abusing the reception which is court<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ously given in the Havens of the Common-wealth to the
Kings Ships, they rewarded the courtesie with injurie and go out of their
Havens where they are friendly received, secured, and furnish'd with all
necessaries to injure, the vessels of the Common-wealths confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates; who
frequenting the Haven of <hi>Genoa,</hi> come under assurance of publick faith,
and of the Common-wealths protection, to supply the City with victuals, and to
maintaine Commerce, which is one of the chief foundation of the City and State
of <hi>Genoa.</hi> And really the Ships that were in <hi>Vai</hi> were rig'd
out by the monies of the Genoeses, which was detain'd in the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples;</hi> and was not only received and provided of all refreshments in
the Ligustick Sea. So as the Common-wealth seeing that the Captains of those
Ships abused such civility, and had turned her high favours not onely to the
abuse of her friends, but of her self, had occasion to complain of this action,
which might justly be esteemed hostile; for indeed, what was it but debarring
of free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between Forreigners and the City? What, but to pretend to
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siege the City by Sea? To the end that those vessels might not enter the
City, which were by her favour permitted to enter; So as after fitting 
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:53250:284"/> complaints made both in publick and private, there were
three Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadours chosen. The first was sent to <hi>Spain,</hi> to complain
of the injury received from Don <hi>Melchior di Borgia</hi> in the Ligustick
Sea, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand satisfaction: This was <hi>Lucca Iustinian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> who being descended from a
Father who had been long since Doge, not long after his return from this
Embassie, was with much applause chosen also Doge, as his Father had been
before him. Another was sent to <hi>France,</hi> to complain of the taking of
many Vessels of <hi>Genoa,</hi> which were taken by the French, who coming out
of the French Seas with Letters of Mart grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King, committed Piracy
upon the Mediterranean: This was <hi>Iovannai Baptista Saluzz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> one who had been long employed
in Embassies for the Common-wealth. The third, with title only of a Gentleman
of <hi>Genoa,</hi> was <hi>Iacomo Negrone di Melchiore,</hi> a young man, but
of great hopes, who was sent to the United Provinces of <hi>Holland,</hi> to
complain of what had been done in the Ligustick Sea, of the common prejudice
done to their Vessels, and to the Merchandize intended for <hi>Genoa,</hi> to
acquaint them how it was resented by the Genoese, and with the remedy which was
endeavoured and expected from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the end that
those Provinces might not have the Navigations of their Vessels disturbed nor
interrupted afterwards. The two last of these Embassies were ill interpreted by
the Spaniards, as esteemed to be sent for the holding of closer intelligence
with the King of <hi>France,</hi> and with the United Provinces. This jealousie
of the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was augmented by another provision which it
behoved the Commonwealth to make, touching the unloading and passage which was
to be granted to the Subjects of Forreign Princes: For formerly, when for
almost a whole Age the Spaniards had met with no competition in <hi>Italy</hi>
from the French, neither by Sea nor Land, the concession or inhibiting of
landing or passage could cause no inconvenience; and therefore it being thought
of little or no concernment to the main Affairs, the arbitrement of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
or denial was in the two Colledges; but now, when almost the whole state of
Affairs was altered in <hi>Italy;</hi> by the French Forces, which kept
frequently in <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and by the shipping of
the same Crown, which entered the Mediterranean not long after, (as shall be
said hereafter) it became the Commonwealth to reflect more upon the importancy
thereof then she had done formerly; wherefore, as things of greater
concernment, it was thought fit that they should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved by the same
Colledges, but by the intervening of the lesser Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, according to the
publick Laws, which referr'd the dangerous af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of such accidents to the
said Colledge. The result of this new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation was, That concession being
to be carried by the most Votes, the Spaniards thought it would be a harder
business to be decided, by reason of the times, wherein they thought the
Genoeses had slackened their studying the Kings good, many of the Genoeses
complaining, and, as being greatly concerned by the retention of their Rents,
exclaiming, that it was an unworthy and unjust thing, that the Spaniards should
purchase the conveniency of passage from the Swissers for great sums of money,
and other honourable terms, and that the Geno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eses, receiving no recompence,
should moreover be deprived of their rents, which was the fortune wherewith
they maintained their <pb n="554" facs="tcp:53250:285"/> Houses and Families; and which not
being given gratis, but bought with ready monies, was due unto them by all Laws
both Humane and Divine: And that, moreover, the publick dignity was contemned,
and their Hospitalities were thereby violated. The King not approving of what
<hi>Borgia</hi> had done, and being desirous in some sort to satisfie the
Genoeses complaints, which were prest home by their Embassadour
<hi>Iustiniano;</hi> did at last order by decree, that their merchandise and
vessels which were taken should be restored; and as the ready execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would
have generally much quieted mens minds, so the difficulties put therein by the
Spanish Agents in <hi>Italy</hi> did exasperate them, and made the proviso
unsatisfactory. But on the other side, the Spaniards did much resent the
Common-wealths resolution; and not being able to endure that the free
concession of landing, unloading, and passage formerly granted unto those of
their Nation, should be now any ways controverted; they thought that the favour
their King had shewn in the last War to the Common-wealth, should be prefer'd
before any motive which should have made the Common-wealth put on such a
resolution. The Court of <hi>Spain</hi> had much adoe to believe that so great
a conspiracy against the Common-wealth, and the great losses suffer'd by that
War, should proceed onely from the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s anger concerning
<hi>Zuccharello,</hi> but rather for that the Common-wealth, contrary to the
ends and interrests of all the Italian Princes, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly maintain
union with the Crown of <hi>Spain:</hi> so as the assistance given by
<hi>Spain</hi> upon that occasion to the Common-wealth, (to boot that it was
not gratis, nor at the Kings expence, as those which were subministred for the
protection of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> but paid for by the monies of the Genoeses)
was onely due to the Common-wealth from the King by the Laws of gratitude and
good correspondency, but requisite for the safety of the Kings Affairs in
<hi>Italy;</hi> which would have run much hazard by the loss of the
Common-wealth. But howsoever, who knows not how far the merit of benefits
received may be cancelled, and the memoy of them quite forgot, by loading those
that received them with wrongs and injuries? And yet the Common-wealth mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more the substance of Affairs, then Accidents which may happen, shew'd plainly
to the whole world, and to the King and Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> in the
ruptures which hapned afterwards, how considerately she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in her
actions.</p>
            <p>For the Genoeses being amidst these Commotions, the French thought
they might prevail much with the Common-wealth; and thinking that if they could
draw her over to their side, they should have as good as effected their
business; they endeavoured to make her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for them, as they had done the
like with many other Princes of <hi>Italy.</hi> But the Common-wealth which
would never be brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare for <hi>Spain,</hi> was far from doing so;
but carried her self so discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her actions, as neither of the Crowns
had reason to complain of her: So as she was equally pleasing to them both; and
her carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the disputes which succeeded afterwards between the Forces of
both the Crowns, was well received. Wherein she wan so much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit with the
French, and of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Admiral, being then in the Haven of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> with the Standard royal, and with other Gallies, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral 
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:53250:285"/> of <hi>France,</hi> came at the same time into the same
Haven, with a greater number of Gallies and better provided for fight; and the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict might have proved dangerous to the Spaniards, had not the Common
wealth interposed her self: So that as if both of them had put their
differences to be decided by her, they stay'd there quietly with incredible
respect, and forbearing all the while of their abode there. And both their
Admirals coming on land walked up and down the City without any quarrelling;
and that seemed to happen at this time in the Haven City of <hi>Genoa,</hi>
which hapned in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Ark, where beasts which were at enmity with one
another, laying aside all their rancour, lived peaceably together. The like
hapned not long after in <hi>Savona,</hi> whereinto eleven Neopolitan Gallies
being entred, which had landed some Souldiers at <hi>Finale,</hi> they were
overtaken by thirteen French Gallies, and after them came a great many French
Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats, not far from <hi>Savona;</hi> which assuredly would have made
themselves masters of the Neopolitan Gallies, had not <hi>Iohn Baptista
Baliano,</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Savona,</hi> willed the French
General to forbear all Hostility, which the French were ready to have used to
the Enemy: So as the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Agents might perceive, how
differently the Common-wealth (though so many several wayes injured by his
Agents) had carried her self, from what some Italian Princes had done, who were
near ally'd to the Austrian blood, and who had received great honours and
favours from the King: One whereof (as shall be said in its due place) being
hardly desired to do so by the French, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared absolutely for Neutrality; and
the other joyn'd with the French, and went with them to assault
<hi>Millain.</hi> These were the practices of the King of <hi>France,</hi>
wrought in <hi>Italy</hi> by his Agents; and these were the fruits thereof; but
yet that King forbore not to attempt that by Arms which he could but weakly
compass by negotiation; not having drawn any others over to side with him, but
the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> the latter more then willingly,
the other much inforced; when War was openly declared, he raised an Army of
2000 Horse, and 12000 Foot in <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> and sent it into
<hi>Piedmont</hi> under Marshal <hi>Cricky;</hi> to the end that joyning with
the Forces of the Dukes of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> they might begin
to fall upon the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> Which being then unprovided of men,
many whereof were employ'd in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> against <hi>Rohan,</hi>
was but in bad condition to defend it self. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was to
concur in this enterprize with 2000 Horse, and with about 10000 Foot, and the
Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> with 7000 Foot and 1000 Horse; which made in all 5000
Horse, and above 25000 Foot, a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Army for the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> though it had been sufficiently provided of Souldiers, much
more now when it wanted them so much.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cricky</hi> appeared about the end of <hi>August,</hi> in the
year 1635. with Title of Lieutenant to the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who was
chosen (as hath been said) Captain General of the League, and of the King of
<hi>France</hi> his Forces in <hi>Italy;</hi> and having thrown a bridge over
the <hi>Sesia,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently took <hi>la Villata,</hi> together with the
Fort which the Spaniards had built there; and thought he lay idle there some
days, expecting the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues, yet he kept the Enemy in suspence, they not
knowing where this so great a preparation would first fall: Doubtlesly they
minded <pb n="556" facs="tcp:53250:286"/> most to assault that part which the Millanois
call beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> in which, to boot with the Cities of
<hi>Alessandria</hi> and <hi>Tortona,</hi> the Town of <hi>Valenza</hi> is
scituated, upon the right hand of the <hi>Poe,</hi> just over against <hi>la
Lomellina;</hi> which though it were but badly defensible, either by scituation
or art, was notwithstanding of great consequence in respect of the
<hi>Poe,</hi> which dividing this part from the rest of the State, and there
being no other Town upon the whole extent of her banks, fit for the casting
over of a bridge; therefore <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>as
when it was held by the Spaniards, it kept both parts of the State) joyned
together by that bridge; so being lost, and the two parts disjoyn'd, the one
part could not well assist the other; it was therefore to be feared, that if
<hi>Valenza</hi> should be lost, all that part of the State would soon be
taken; and that the other part being thereby weakned, and cut off from the Sea,
they should be totally debar'd all Maritime succour; so as this being added to
the loss of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> it was cleerly seen how great a loss to the
State of <hi>Millain</hi> the taking of <hi>Valenza</hi> would prove: the
inconvenience grew the greater, for that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> being
alienated, the accommodation which (that part being lost) his territories could
give for bringing relief by Sea, was also lost; so as it was probable that
<hi>Valenza</hi> would be the first place that the enemy would fall upon; and
therefore the Cardinal who was the Governour, and the other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s, were troubled how to withstand this
so imminent danger, their forces being weakned, and their Souldiers exhausted;
especially since those few that were left to defend the State were sent for a
little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to keep Flanders from being assaulted by the French, and
Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers; to the slenderness of the forces was added the weakness of
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; the Cardinal, who was Governour, was by profession a Church-man,
and little, or not at all, vers'd in what belonged to war; though Don <hi>Carlo
Colonna,</hi> a Commander long trayn'd up in the wars of Flanders, by orders
from the King, commanded in chief the forces of the State; but Marquess
<hi>Spinola,</hi> who was General of the Horse, and of a susperior quality,
quitting his own command upon this occasion, as not induring to be commanded by
him, chose to serve as a private Volunteer; the other Captains, though they did
not openly refuse to serve, yet did it but unwillingly; so as the
disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and disaffection of the Commanders, being added to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the forces, made the defence dangerous; the danger was yet great, for fear
lest the Duke of <hi>Rohan,</hi> a Commander of known fame, might fall with his
men from the <hi>Valtoline</hi> into some other part of the State, and might so
divert those few forces, which being all joyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether were not sufficient
to defend one part: or that joyning with others he might make the assault the
sorer; amidst these dangers, the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> who had never been
provoked by any hostile act, stuck not to be the first that entred armed into
the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> in hostile manner, with seven thousand Foot, and
one thousand Horse, all very well appointed, about the beginning of
<hi>September;</hi> he was not above twenty four years old; but being
sprightly, and building rather upon certainties then hopes, he at first entred
the territories of <hi>Tortona,</hi> and crossing over, those of
<hi>Allessandriae</hi> thought to joyn with the Marshal, who was in the
<hi>Villata,</hi> and with the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who 
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:53250:286"/> expected his speedy joyning with his <hi>Piemontese</hi>
in this enterprise; and not being well entred into the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> he encountred twenty five thousand Foot, divided into two
bodies, at <hi>Ponte Carone;</hi> the one Spaniards, led on by Don
<hi>Gasparod' Azevedo;</hi> the other Neapolitans, conducted by <hi>Philippo
Spinola,</hi> sent from <hi>Naples</hi> by the Vice-roy <hi>Monterei,</hi> and
landed but a little before in the Seas of <hi>Genoa. Aze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedo</hi> marcht
foremost, who not tarrying for <hi>Spinola,</hi> who followed half a days
match'd behind, he fought the Duke; and being at the first shot in the head
with a Musket he fell down dead; wherefore the Spaniards, though for a while
they resisted valiantly, yet being exceeded in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they were routed, and
put to flight, the Duke hoping hereby for greater things; and being glad that
he had begun so fortunately, went more couragiously forwards; but he had lost
many of his men, part whereof were slain in the fight, part disbanded in the
march; he found the Marshal at <hi>Piovera,</hi> who was come thither with his
men, to guide him, and secure him in his march; and turning with him back, he
encamped before <hi>Valenza;</hi> where assigning the lower bank to the Duke
for his quarters, and the upper bank to the Marquess <hi>Villeroy,</hi> who had
some French Regiments with him, he himself kept with his men upon a hill
behinde the Town; which being block'd up on all sides, could receive no succour
from any part, but onely by a bridge of Boats which was thrown over the
<hi>Poe;</hi> the Town was not thought able to hold out longer then six days,
either by those that were within, or those that were without, and those of the
Spanish Army were so full of this opinion, as they cared not to defend it,
thinking it better to quit it, and spare those few Captains, and Souldiers
lives, in this so great scarcity of men, which if they should tarry to defend
it, must necessarily be lost; so as they were much astonished and confused, not
knowing whether they should adventure the lives of the Defendants, not to lose
the Town, or (not to lose the Defendants) abandon a place of such importance;
to this was added, that there being none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in Chief there, but onely
he who was trusted with it in time of peace, and whom they that were to enter
would not obey, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoved to send one of better quality and experience
thither; Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Spinola,</hi> one upon whom the eyes of all men were
bent, though come thither as a Volunteer before the Marshal went from
<hi>Villata,</hi> had begun to make some fortifications; but would not take the
place upon him, it being far inferior to the place of General of the Horse
which he must then lay aside; and it was refused by all others, fearing lest
they might lose either their lives or honours there, or peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both; so
as they inclined rather to spare their men, then to defend the Town, which they
held as good as lost already; it hapned that when the Marshal went from
<hi>Villata</hi> to meet the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> the Spaniard observed that
he left <hi>Valenza</hi> behind him, and took the way towards
<hi>Allessandria,</hi> and afterwards, towards <hi>Tortona;</hi> so as they
ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined he would first go to the taking of some one of those Cities;
wherefore Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> went with some few Souldiers into
<hi>Alles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sandria</hi> (where General <hi>Colonna</hi> was, with the gross of
his men) and offered himself ready to defend either that Town or
<hi>Tortona,</hi> if either of them should be assaulted by the enemy; but when
he saw the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal <pb n="558" facs="tcp:53250:287"/> return from <hi>Piovera,</hi> and
go, together with the Duke, to before <hi>Valenza,</hi> he hasted thither, with
<hi>Colonna,</hi> and the men which were with him; and being come into the Town
he found it provided of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Commander, the Marquess of
<hi>Celada,</hi> a Spaniard nobly born; whom being come a little before from
Spain, and seeing that they were likely to abandon <hi>Valenza,</hi> could not
suffer such an amazment, and therewith such a prejudice to the affairs of the
Crown, and so great a lessening of the honor of <hi>Spain;</hi> he therefore
offered to take upon him the defence of that Town, and to sacrifice himself and
his fortune in so dangerous a business, for the publick honour, and safety; who
being a Gentleman experienced in Arms, and sent from the Court, with title of
General of the Horse of an Army, which by the Kings order and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence was to
be raised in <hi>Alsatia,</hi> his offer was accepted, and much commended by
the Governour of <hi>Millain;</hi> the singular example of so generous
magnanimity encouraged many and fill'd them with ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous emulations; so as
not able to stand spectators of the loss of that Town to the loss of their
reputation, they resolved to follow him; he entred <hi>Valenza</hi> two days
before <hi>Colonna</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi> came thither, from
<hi>Allessandria,</hi> with men, artillery, munition and victuals;
<hi>Spinola</hi> took upon him the already begun defence the more willingly,
now that he saw the place commanded by so gallant a person, whom he had very
well known in the Wars of Germany; and not refusing to serve under him, the
generous Spaniards would not exercise command over him, but left the titular,
or seeming government, to <hi>Martine Galeno,</hi> who was the Governour
before, in whose name all things were done; and they two, <hi>Celada</hi> and
<hi>Spinola,</hi> joyntly and unanimously, did with much care and vigilancy
minde the defence of the besieged Town; and seeing it provided of all things
necessary (for new provisions were daily brought in by the bridge) they fell to
fortifie it; but the Town being environed onely with an old ruinous wall, they
first began to perfect the work which <hi>Spinola</hi> had begun, which was a
great strong Trench; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Flank'd with eight bulwarks, begirt the Town
at a competent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, on the outside; by which work, which was handsomly
begun, and perfected, they hoped to keep the enemy from the wall, as long as
possibly they could; and having time and convenience, through <hi>Cricky's</hi>
negligence, to finish the work, they munited it with many men; and for the
better defence, they, besides the Bulwarks, made certain low Redoubts in the
ditch, which they call <hi>Capponiere,</hi> by a word taken from Capons pens,
which they are like; to these <hi>Capponiere</hi> some slin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers were sent by a
cover'd way from the bulwarks, who kept the enemy at such a distance, as he
could not come neer the wall, before he was master of the <hi>Capponiere;</hi>
the taking whereof, as it was very hard, they being under the shelter of the
Cannon, and musket of the Bulwarks which were on their backs; so were they
easie to be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in case they were lost; for those that take them being
play'd upon by the same Cannon, and Muskets which did first defend them, they
are forc'd either to abandon their purchase immediately with much loss of
blood, first shed in the taking of them, and afterwards in aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning them;
which being abandoned are easily re-taken by the said Slingers, through the
same cover'd ways, who when they can make no <pb n="559" facs="tcp:53250:287"/> longer
defence, got with safety into the bulwarks; the loss therefore succeeding the
defence, and the defence the loss, provision was had for the long preservation
and safety of the chief Bulwark, by which the place was secured; a moderen
invention, the which the sleighter it seem'd to be, proved the more
efficacious; for it is apt to weary the fiercest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults that can be given to
Bulwarks; nor did they employ their time onely in fortifying and muniting,
after <hi>Celada</hi> and <hi>Spinola</hi> were come, but in sallying out also,
and in assaults; for finding that the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s quarters were
not yet perfectly fortified, and hearing that his numbers were much diminished
by the running away of many of his men, they thought they might easily make
themselves Masters thereof by assaulting them early in the morning, whil'st the
Souldiers were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep; but the event answered not expectation; for as they
sallyed out, upon break of day, towards the Dukes quarters, they were driven
back to within their own walls, and fortifications, with loss of men, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation; <hi>Richardo Auvoyadro,</hi> General of the Dukes Horse, a stout
and well experienced Flanders Souldier, whil'st he was diligently looking to
affairs espied the enemy, and giving an Alarm immediatly, went out himself
unarm'd, as he was, on horsback, with onely fourteen other horse which he found
ready, and in order, and encountred the enemy: and falling upon a squadron of
Carabines, which were advanc'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rest, he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ter a sleight Skirmish beat them back,
and afforded time this mean while for the rest to arm, and put themselves in
order to defend their quarters; which the enemy being aware off, and fearing
they should fail of their hopes, they retreated to within their works, in great
confusion, leaving some of their men dead behinde them, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which Don
<hi>Iovan di Chiavari,</hi> nephew to Cardinal <hi>Albornizi;</hi> whose death
was recompenced with the like of <hi>Avogadro;</hi> who after having repuls'd
the Carabines, being transported with the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, advanc'd forward, and going
to assault some Curassiers, was slain by a Musker shot, to the Dukes great
grief; who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided much in his Councel, valour and experience;
<hi>Valenza</hi> being fortified, and 5000 good foot being left there,
<hi>Colonna</hi> went out with only 800 Horse, and retreated to <hi>Pieve del
Cairo,</hi> a Town beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> in the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>omellina,</hi> six miles from <hi>Valenza,</hi>
expecting more men, which were to come from several parts; and in the interim
was a Convoy to the Provisions which were continually sent; and this he did,
lest it might be taken by stoln assaults, which would have been prejudicial to
the relieving of <hi>Valenza;</hi> wherein many valiant and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Commanders tarried, the very flower of the Spaniards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides Marquess
<hi>Spinola;</hi> so as by the confidence that was had of them, by the Works
and Fortifications which were continually made, and by the continued assistance
that Don <hi>Carlo Colonna,</hi> who kept in the <hi>Lomel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,</hi> gave
them, the condition of the Town seemed to be somewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered: This
confidence grew greater, for that the besiegers were found not to proceed with
such vigour and diligence as they ought to have done. The Duke of
<hi>Parma,</hi> who being of a fiery spirit, and desirous to bring the business
to a good and speedy end, thought every least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay a loss of time; nor could
he endure that the business, which of its self was like to be short and sure,
should be prolonged, or any ways doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <pb n="560" facs="tcp:53250:288"/> by giving the
enemy opportunity to fortifie; wherefore he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually sollicited the
Marshal, that he would begin the Trenches, prepare the Batteries, and do all
things which might make for the speedy taking of the Town: but the Marshal
continuing his carelessness, lay still idle, and as if seized on by a fatal
dull drousiness, seemed as if he had left thinking of the business; and minding
hunting more then warlike acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he did nothing for more then twelve days,
but go daily to the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to hunt wild Beasts; and past his time in other
delights and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, to the wonder and amazement of all men, nay, even
of the enemy, who often from their quarters saw him go a hunting; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
he would not meddle with the business before the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who
was General, should come into the Camp with such Forces as, by the Articles of
the League, he was bound to do; and so much did all men wonder at this his
manner of proceeding, and at these his failings, as not knowing whereunto else
to refer it, it was almost generally sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that he was bribed thereunto by
the Spaniards; as if not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what else to do in this perplexity of
affairs, they had blunted the enemies steel with their gold: which the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi> suspecting, he for very anger bit his lips and his fingers ends;
but at last, when the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s men appeared under Marshal
<hi>Villa,</hi> who were not, both Horse and Foot, above 5000 fighting men; and
when not many day<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> after the Duke
himself appeared, they consulted upon the manner how they should go to work;
which having resolved upon in three days, and all requisite provisions and
orders being taken, the Duke left the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Villa</hi> to command his
men, and return'd himself to <hi>Vercelli.</hi> The Dukes men were quartered in
the <hi>Lomellina,</hi> a little above <hi>Valenza,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the banks of
<hi>Poe,</hi> where there is an Island, by which two Bridges being thrown over,
one on either side of the Island, conveniency of Commerce was afforded between
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s quarter and that of the Marshals, which was on the
other side the <hi>Poe,</hi> beneath <hi>Vicenza,</hi> and <hi>Parma</hi>'s
quarter which, was neer at hand; who having lost many men, some whereof were
run away, and some ready to run; and he fearing another assault, he desired to
be recruited by <hi>Cricky;</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal being weary of his so many
pressings to expedite the business, was very slow in granting him any recruits;
the chief reason why Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> took up his quarter in the
<hi>Lomellina,</hi> was to keep the Town from being relieved by that way; so as
being streightned and inviron'd on that side of the <hi>Poe</hi> by
<hi>Parma</hi> and the French, and block'd upon this side from receiving any
relief from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> the Town might be brought to
surrender the sooner; and that he might the better do this, he sent some
Souldiers by night to assault the Fort which guarded the head of the Bridge;
and sent some others afterwards, to the end, that whilst those within the Fort
were busie in defending themselves against the assaulters, they might fire the
boats which upheld the Bridge, as they did; and after a fierce skirmish the
Half-moon being taken, which gua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ded the Bridge of the Fort, the assailants entred, hoping to take
the Fort it self quickly, when the use of the Bridge being cut off by firing of
the Boats, new men could not come from <hi>Valenza</hi> to defend it; but many
came out from <hi>Valenza,</hi> who quench'd the fire, and defended the Bridge,
and who also recovered the Half-moon that was lost, forcing 
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:53250:288"/> the assailants to retreat; but that which the
Piedmontese could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, was done the next night by the River, which
swelled so high as it brake the Bridge, and disordered the Boats; which
<hi>Villa</hi> being aware of he sent a greater number to re-assume the
assault, who for a while were kept off by the Cannon and Muskets which plaid
upon them from the Town; but at last they took the Fort, though they were held
play, till the Garrison, by means of the Boats which were yet fastned to the
bank, got off with the loss of about 200 men, whereof some were drown'd whilst
they sought to save themselves from the enemy; the rest being carried down the
River in two Boats; the one whereof got safe to land, the other being driven
upon the shore in the <hi>Parma</hi> quarters, were at first shot at, but
afterward, upon yielding themselves, were taken Prisoners. This accident did
much trouble the Spanish Camp, which being weak for want of men thought it self
not safe in <hi>Pieve,</hi> whither, as hath been said, it had retreated, when
it came out of <hi>Valenza;</hi> wherefore <hi>Colonna,</hi> calling a Councel
of War, ask'd their opinion touching the urgency of the present condition; the
great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and better part were for retiring from those quarters; thinking it
the better course to preserve their men, then to tarry in <hi>Valenza,</hi>
which not being to be relieved when the Bridge was b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>oken, would assuredly be assaulted by <hi>Villa,</hi>
who, being a wise Commander, had found the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of their men and quarters.
<hi>Colonna</hi> inclined to this opinion, who to this purpose had sent some to
finde where they might quarter with most safety thereabouts: but <hi>Frederick
Imperiale,</hi> Son to the Marquess of <hi>Oira,</hi> Nephew by the Sisters
side to the late Marquess <hi>Spinola,</hi> an approved Souldier, and train'd
up under his Uncle in the wars of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> was of another mind; and
with him did <hi>Pietro d' Aro</hi> joyn, who was Lieutenant of the Horse;
their reasons were, that they were to keep that station, were it only not to
shew their fear and weakness to the enemy, and not to make the defendants
despair of succour by their removal; that it was not probable that
<hi>Villa,</hi> who was a no less wise then valiant Commander, being bound to
keep the Town from being relieved, would quit his station to hazard an unsafe
enterprise; that the place was capable of Fortification, and that it could not
be long ere new Forces would come from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> who were
ready to march, and who when they should be come, the besieged would cease to
fear any longer. This opinion was approved by all, and was successful in the
sequel; for that very night there came thither a Brigade of Lombards, speedily
raised at his own charge, by Cardinal <hi>Trivultio,</hi> in the name of his
Son the Prince, and brought unto the Camp by Count <hi>Carlo Marliani,</hi>
consisting for the most part of Souldiers that had fled from the Duke of
<hi>Parma,</hi> whilst going out of the Territories of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> he
went to joyn with the French Camp, and which were incited by the Cardinals
authority, and by his large pay; they were a great help to the condition of
affairs, in this so great scarcity of men, and when things were tottering,
having not only weakned the Dukes Forces, but strengthned the Spanish Camp; so
as <hi>Colonna,</hi> who toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the remainder of his men,
<hi>Valenza</hi> being well garrison'd, could not keep the field, nor look the
enemy in the face, but was likely to have abandoned his station; was able by
the coming of this Brigade <pb n="562" facs="tcp:53250:289"/> to make his station good, to
face his enemy, to maintain the affairs of the Town in reputation, to keep the
enemy from forraging, to scoure the Country to the prejudice of the enemy, and
to attempt somewhat upon the Towns thereabouts, particularly against
<hi>Sartiranno.</hi> Don <hi>Martino</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi> came thither also
not long after, with some Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of his Brigade which were quarter'd in
<hi>Novara;</hi> and some few days after there came two other Brigades thither
from <hi>Naples,</hi> raised by the Viceroy <hi>Monterei,</hi> as soon as he
heard that the State of <hi>Millain</hi> was assaulted; the one consisted of
1200 Foot, conducted by Don <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> the other by <hi>Lucio
Boccapianola,</hi> wherein were 1600 men; so as the Camp was much re-inforced
by the coming of these men; but though these Forces were sufficient for the
safety of the Camp, and for the keeping of the Field; yet did they not at all
serve for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence or relief of the Town, which was severed from the River,
and inclosed by the enemy on both sides, who were very well fortified; and
which Town was already begun to be batter'd, and assaulted: the chief Battery
was placed by the Covent of the Capuchins, situated at the foot of a Hill,
behind <hi>Valenza,</hi> which by reason of the neerness and height of
situation did absolutely command it; the others were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of lower in fit
places; but though they all plaid continually, yet did they but little harm,
not playing all upon one place, but sometimes on one place, sometimes on
another, according as they were levelled, to the no little wonder of the
defendants, who laugh'd at such Batteries; and the assailants seeing how little
good they did thereby, began to turn their Batteries upon the houses; but were
it either the fault of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniers, or the ignorance or treachery of those
that ordered the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, they got no more advantage thereby; for the
bullets flew so high, as, for the most part, they either fell into the River,
without touching the houses, or upon the opposite bank of the
<hi>Lomellina;</hi> so as they only beat down one Gate, and the tops of two
neighbouring Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which were soon mended by the defendants diligence. The
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was impa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ient to see this, finding thereby the miscarriage of the
enterprise, foreseeing the ruine of his so high hopes, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing of the
like to his own Territories; to this was added, that <hi>Cricky</hi> who did
not much mind the Siege, was very negligent in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in the
Discipline of the Camp; so as his men were likewise much lessened by running
away: he was therefore forced to send for 2000 of the Militia of
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> till he might receive new recruits from <hi>France;</hi>
and the Duke being in greater want of men then the Marshal, (for his men ran so
fast away, that of 1000 Horse which he brought with him from <hi>Parma,</hi>
there remained but 200, and of the 7000 Foot, less then 3000;) nor knowing from
whence to get any more, he lay idle in his quarters; and there being no good
correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency held between him and the Marshal, he could not expect any
as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from him; and though the Dukes displeasure appeared to be somewhat
mitigated by the coming of a Gentlemen, who was sent to the Camp by Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> to keep the Duke steadfast to the League, and to chide the
Marshal for his proceedings, as well in carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Siege, as in his
behaviour to the Duke; and to wish him in the Kings name that he should
hereafter treat the Duke with all honour <pb n="563" facs="tcp:53250:289"/> and
satisfaction; yet these reprehensions being thought to proceed from some
complaints made to the Court by the Duke, they caused no good effects inwardly;
and were so far from sweetening their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stastes, as they did rather exasperate
the malignancy which they had conceived one against another; and yet the Duke,
continuing constant to the League, did not only not repent what he had done,
but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing so many distastes and misfortunes, profess'd more
constancy still in his resolutions to Monsignior <hi>Gorio Pannolini,</hi>
Vice-legate of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lognia,</hi> who was sent unto him by the Pope, who being
much press'd by the continual complaints of the Spanish Agents, had sent him to
admonish the Duke seriously, and to wish him that he would retire to his own
Dominions, and not persevere in the League any longer, to the so great
perturbance of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of the publick peace. The Pope, all the
while that the Duke appeared so highly distasted with the Court of
<hi>Spain,</hi> that he prepared for Arms, that he took Commanders and
Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers into pay, with manifest appearance of making war with
<hi>Spain;</hi> never cared to suppress so great a commotion, nor to sprinkle a
little water upon so great a flame; nor did the event of this Negotiation
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the judgement which was made thereof; for when the Vice legate was
come unto the Camp, and had delivered his Embassie to the Duke; the Duke did
not only not at all value it, but acquainted the Marshal with it; wherewith the
Marshal thinking himself injured, he complained bitterly to the Vice-legate,
that the Pope should use his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to divert the Kings Colleagues, and to
withdraw them from siding with his King: at the making of which complaints the
Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing present, he seemed also to be displeased with the Vice-legate; so
as the Vice-legate return'd with little satisfaction, and less fruit of his
Negotiation, to <hi>Bologina;</hi> and the Pope not any ways resenting this
success, nor having at any time after press'd the Duke to desist from this
enterprise, he did not only not appease the anger of the Spaniards, but did the
more confirm the general jealousies which were conceived at these proceedings:
it being unlikely, that he who, when he might, cared not to keep his Vassal
from beginning such a business, should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to withdraw him from it, when
he was deeply engaged therein.</p>
            <p>Now to reassume the Siege of <hi>Valenza.</hi> New recruits came
daily to the Marshal from <hi>France;</hi> so as the Camp being much encreased,
when they saw they did no good by their batteries, they fell to assault the
Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, about which, as also about the <hi>Capponiere,</hi> much labour was
taken, with variety of fortune, and mortality of the parties; the end whereof
proved, that several reiterated assaults proved still unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the
Assailants, who were never able to take any thing save one <hi>Capponiere,</hi>
which they got not without much loss, and did not keep long; and yet the
Defendants having lost many men, and not being able to be recruited, they began
to forbear making out any more salli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s, whereby they had not a little prejudiced the Enemy; so as
minding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the defence of their Trenches, they endeavoured to preserve
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as much as they could, and to draw out the Siege at least so long
as that the earth might become untractable by the rains of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
winter, and might force the Enemy to be gone. But though the defendants had the
better of the businesses in repulsing assaults, yet was <pb n="564" facs="tcp:53250:290"/>
it not had without the loss of many men, whereof <hi>Cesare Caraffa</hi> was
slain for one, and a Spanish Serjeant Major; but many more of the meaner
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ort of Souldiers, and many of the
Captains, Officers, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Quality, of the Enemy, were slain; but all
this was not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, by reason of the continual recruits which they
received from <hi>France;</hi> and it was reported, that ten Regiments were
upon their march; so as the Town was not likely to hold out long: Moreover, by
reason of the length of the Siege, many things necessary for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of the Town grew scarce, Moneys, Salt, Match, Oyl, and Grist, the Enemy having
beaten down the Mills which had furnish'd the Town with Grist; and none being
left but two hand-mills, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral necessity could be but badly supplied:
Therefore all hope of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the place grew daily less and less, not only
in the defendants, who through such wants decreased, but in those who laboured
to relieve them; for it being to be done either on this side, or on that side
the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it was (if not impossible) very hard to be done on either side.
There was no thought of relieving it by the <hi>Lomellina,</hi> the Bridg being
down; and to relieve it on the other side was too desperate a business, the
Mountain at the Foot whereof the Town stood, the Hill which stood on the side
of it, the fields and banks which environed it being all of them possess'd, and
well munited by the enemy; and <hi>Parma</hi>'s quarter was at last recruited
by the Marshal: The difficulties growing thus great, the chiefest of the
Spanish Army began to detest the generous resolution of <hi>Celada</hi> and
<hi>Spinola,</hi> by which they and so many of their best men had engaged
themselves in that defence, and whereby they had been obliged to hazard the
Garrison and State of <hi>Millain:</hi> not knowing therefore very well what to
do, they inclined rather to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don then to relieve the Town; and beginning
now totally to despair of keeping it, they began to think what they were to do
when it should be lost; and foreseeing that when the enemy should have taken
<hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> they would go either into <hi>Allessandria,</hi> or into the
Territories of <hi>Tortona,</hi> as they openly threatned they would do, they
began to build a Fort beneath <hi>Valenza,</hi> there where the <hi>Tanaro</hi>
falls into the <hi>Poe,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to throw a Bridge over there, whereby
passing over into the Territories of <hi>Alessandria,</hi> they might the more
easily get into that part of the State, to relieve either of those Cities if
they should be besieged, or to defend the Campagna if it should be annoyed by
inroads, or at least that they might bring some help to the languishing Town,
if any way might be opened whereby to do it on that side; which though they
were but slender undertakings, and but of little hope, yet the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
wherein they were did either perswade them to it, or made them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to
be the least of evils: whilst the Spanish Army was amidst these miseries,
troubles and dangers, three Brigades came very sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably; the one Spaniards,
under Don <hi>Iohn di Garray,</hi> the other two Neapolitans, under
<hi>Achilles Minutulo,</hi> and under <hi>Andrea,</hi> Count <hi>di
Marianella,</hi> which made in all about 4000 good men, and well appointed, who
were sent by Sea by Marquess <hi>Sancta Croce;</hi> who being gone the third
time from <hi>Naples</hi> with the Fleet to Sea, to assault <hi>Provence,</hi>
and hearing the great danger that <hi>Valenza</hi> was in, (and then the State
of <hi>Millain,)</hi> held it his better course to endeavour the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation 
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:53250:290"/> of that State, then to put for possessing what belong'd
to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; deferring therefore his chief enterprize, he very seasonably
landed these Brigades at <hi>Finale,</hi> and sent them to before
<hi>Valenza,</hi> by whose coming the Spanish affairs got a little breath, and
every one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to hold the abandoning of <hi>Valenza,</hi> and the Captains
therein, to be not onely ignominious, and detestable, but dangerous, and
ruinous; so as they resolved by all mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> to relieve it; to this purpose they held a consultation in
<hi>Dorno,</hi> a Town between <hi>Pavia</hi> and <hi>la Pieve del Cairo,</hi>
whither all the Commanders, and Chief Officers being come; as the Cardinal
<hi>Albornozzi,</hi> and with him Don <hi>Francisco di Melo,</hi> Don
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonio Ronchillio,</hi> who was Lord Chancellour, and divers others of
the Councel both of State, and War; they all were of opinion that the Town must
be relieved; but with such caution, and circumpection, as that by so doing they
might not be enforced to a battel, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the re-inforcement
which was come, they did, all of them, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor: the resolution was in it self
repugnant, by reason of the neerness of enemies army, for the caution did
absolutely resist the execution of it; and yet the business being long
discuss'd, there was a remedy found: Don <hi>Martin d' Aragona,</hi> and Don
<hi>Iohn di Garrai,</hi> took upon them the charge of this business, and
propounded a means which was generally approved, and found a way how to relieve
the Town safely, without hazzarding battle; and it was this, that some place
should be found out in the <hi>Lomellina,</hi> neer the <hi>Poe,</hi> and neer
<hi>Valenza,</hi> capable to receive the whole Army, and all provisions
necessary for the maintenance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, which might be so fortified, as they
might not be compelled to quit it, nor be brought to fight, neither by assault,
nor want of provisions; from whence they proved thus, that it might be possible
to relieve the Town, without being forc'd to fight; the men which lay before
<hi>Valenza</hi> would either come &amp; joyn with the <hi>Pidemontese,</hi>
who were quarter'd on this side the <hi>Poe,</hi> and which were fewest in
number; or they would not come; if they should not come, who could doubt but
that the Army being safely quartered in the <hi>Lomellina,</hi> wherein were
6000 Foot, and 1200 Horse, all of them good men, and well appointed, and being
to be masters of the field, might by boats brought by land bring into the Town
what relief they listed, and not so only, but by the advantage of their numbers
force the Savoyards to quit their quarters; and if they should come to joyn
with them, and that the greater part of those that lay before <hi>Valenza</hi>
should pass from that place to this, it was certain that they could draw the
enemies army out of their quarters, without much slackning the siege of
<hi>Valenza;</hi> in which case, the Town wanting opposers, they would not need
many defendants, whereof having alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more then needed, the same effect
would be wrought by the passing over of the enemy, as if they should be
succor'd by the defendants; more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over the enemies trenches being weakned, &amp;
almost abandoned by that coming over, men enough, and sufficient provision
might be convey'd into <hi>Valenza,</hi> from the City of <hi>Alessandria;</hi>
these things being granted, they proved that doubtlesly the Town might be
relieved, without their armies being forc'd to fight; this dilemma was
generally approved of, so as some might be sent to discover the countrey, &amp;
the enemies fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, before the resolution should be put in practice;
but because there was <pb n="566" facs="tcp:53250:291"/> some difference in opinion between
<hi>Aragon,</hi> and <hi>Garrai,</hi> about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how the succour should
march towards the river, and about choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the place where the whole Army
might be safely quartered; as also where they were to put the Boats into the
water, which were to conveigh in the succour; they were both of them ordered,
that taking along with them Colonel <hi>Frederick Imperiale, Vincenzo
Monsury,</hi> and the Count <hi>Trotti,</hi> they should go to discover the
Country, and choose out both the safest places; having with them a Convoy of
four troops of Horse, they viewed all the parts thereabouts narrowly, not
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some opposition made by the enemy, who met them with the like number
of Horse, so a Skirmish hapned between them, with some advantage to the
discoverers, who effected what they went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; they found a place neer a
Chappel, between <hi>Frascarvolo</hi> and the <hi>Poe,</hi> as fit as might be
for their purpose; being far from the enemy, munited before by a deep way, and
behind by a rivulet of cleer water, which served not onely for a ditch, and
safety, but for drink for the Camp; and which was of more concernment, the
place was almost fortified of it self; they found it a harder business to
choose the other place, for conveying the boats over, by reason of the Fort,
which being first built to defend the head of the bridge belonging to
<hi>Valenza</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Lomellina,</hi> and which (as hath been said) was
afterwards ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> was still held by the enemy, and
commanding both the upper and the lower side, kept them from all hopes of
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing their intents; and the less, for that though the retaking of that
Fort was a thing not difficult of it self, yet was it dangerous to put for, for
fear lest the attempting of it would draw all the Enemies For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to defend it;
in which case, they must either go thither with their whole Camp, and come to a
battle, or not coming, quit the business; the one of which was contrary to the
resolution they had taken, the other of little honour, and less advantage. For
their design being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by the attempt, they would fortifie the bank
better; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of these respects left thinking of taking the Fort,
and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the discovery of the upper bank, which lying between the Fort
and the Piedmonteses quarters, they could not well do; and went to discover the
lower side, where they observed a place which being far enough off was out of
the Forts reach, and fit to bring relief. So as they all approved it, except
<hi>Imperiale,</hi> who said that the same distance which rendred that place
free from being offended by the Fort, made it also too far off for bringing
relief, since it answer'd not just upon the banks of <hi>Valenza;</hi> but
between <hi>Valenza</hi> and the <hi>Parma</hi> quarters, so as the boats which
should be put in there, would be necessarily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried lower by the current of
the River; and falling towards the <hi>Parma</hi> quarters would not relieve
the place besieged, but the besiegers. He therefore was for bringing succour by
the bank above the Fort, where the current would carry the boats to the very
side of <hi>Valenza;</hi> and that to keep them from being endangered by the
Piedmonteses quarters, the body of their Army should advance, and by its
interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition keep the succour from being offended. But this was not then
neither approved, as being contrary to the resolution of avoiding being
compelled to fight; they therefore continued their choice in both these 
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:53250:291"/> places, and the Camp master General had notice given him
thereof, that he might advance with the Army. The Army marched, and being come
to the place near the Chappel, they made a flying squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron of 800 commanded
foot of several Nations; which being led by Marquess <hi>Torrecuso</hi> a
Neapolitan, was sent to <hi>Frasearvolo,</hi> which was the nearest place to
the Enemies quarters, that lie might keep there, and secure those who wrought
upon the Trenches, and that he might be ready to receive and withstand the
first incounters. The rest of the Camp staying at the Chappel, there made up
the body of an Army; and immediately giving out Mattocks, Pales and Spades,
fell to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie, and perfected their works in one night and day; and having
brought thither the provisions which had been diligently provided by Senator
<hi>Arias,</hi> they stood expecting what the Enemy would do in this so great
alteration of Affairs. They were not long in comprehending, that counsels and
resolutions which are taken in common are better acted then discours'd of; for
the Marshal and Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> fearing <hi>Villa</hi>'s quarter, and
that relief would undoubtedly be brought if they did not pass over the
<hi>Poe,</hi> went with the greatest and best part of their men to the Piedmont
quarter, where the Duke who was come but a little before from <hi>Verselli</hi>
was; and thinking it now time to fall to work, they marched out in ranks into
the field, to assault the succouring Army; they were about 4500 Foot, who all
obeyed the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Colleagues; they
advanced on the left hand towards <hi>Fras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carvolo,</hi> having sent some
Troops of Horse before, and some Foot towards the right hand near <hi>Poe,</hi>
to hold those Forces in play, and to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them which should come from the
left wing of the Spanish Camp. <hi>Torrecuso</hi> march'd out with his men from
<hi>Frascarvolo</hi> against the Enemies Army, when he saw it march toward him;
and putting his men into a squadron, advanced with certain Files of Musketeers,
and posses'd himself of a great hedge which was before him: Under the shelter
whereof he very seasonably let fly a shower of Musket-shot, against the Enemies
van which approached; whereat the Spaniards, who were at dinner, stood to their
Arms, and put themselves in a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive posture. The General was in his
quarters, which were between the Artllery and the body of the Army; he ordered
his Foot and Horse to draw out into ranks, the Foot within the Trenches, and
the Horse at the place appointed for the Magazine; and in this interim the
skirmish grew hot between <hi>Torrecuso</hi> and the Enemies Camp. The Generall
wholly intent how Affairs should be governed in this onset, and knowing
<hi>Torrecuso</hi> wanted Horse, commanded <hi>Don Alvaro Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones,</hi>
Leiutenant General of the Neapolitan Horse, to go speedily and receive or
withstand him with three Troops of Horse, which were then upon the guard; and
sent <hi>Don Iohn di Garrai</hi> first to him with a strength of Musketiers,
and some carts of Ammunition, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Don Martin</hi> of <hi>Aragon.
Quinones</hi> finding <hi>Torrecuso</hi> alre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dy much ingaged, kept in a place a little distant from the
skirmish; and <hi>Garrai,</hi> with <hi>Aragon,</hi> advancing, re-inforc'd
some stations which they held to be convenient to maintain the skirmish; which
when the General saw it grew greater then was thought it would have done, and
that <hi>Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nones</hi> stir'd not, he sent Colonel <hi>Imperiale,</hi> with
two Troops of Horse, <pb n="568" facs="tcp:53250:292"/> to assist the fight, with
directions to tell <hi>Torrecuso,</hi> that he should not ingage any further,
and to protest unto him, that if he should be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther charged by the Enemy, he
would send him no more help then what he had already done; because, according
to the common sence, he would not indanger a general battle. He notwithstanding
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the Horse, which <hi>Imperiale</hi> brought, to defend those
sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which were reinforced by Foot: So as the skirmish being main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
valiantly, and in good order on this side, it continued for full four hours;
neither side sending out any more men: For <hi>Colonna</hi> would not, as it
was agreed upon, ingage himself in a general combat; and the Colleagues Army,
which esteeming the Enemy to be far infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them in Forces, was gon out
with an intent to fall upon them, and defeat them utterly; seeing how Affairs
were ordered, and that the Enemy, without coming out of his Trenches, sent a
good strength of men out against him, conjectured that the Enemy was stronger
then he thought at first he was; so as he cared not much to inforce the first
encounters any more, but kept on the fight with sleight skirmishes till night
coming on, he retreated to his quarters, from whence he was with such fervour
come. Though some will have it that there was no good correspondency between
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> &amp; the Marshal, which was the cause why things
were not acted as it was agreed they should be. <hi>Torrecuso</hi> seeing that
the defendants had the better, and having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders not to advance any
further, retired also into <hi>Frascarvolo,</hi> more like a Conquerour then
conquered; and to observe his orders, he with-held his men from pursuing the
Enemy, as they were desirous to do. But the Spanish Commanders being aware,
that by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over of many of their men to that part, the Camp before
<hi>Valenza</hi> was much lessened, and the Trenches but badly guarded; order
was given that 500 Foot should come from <hi>Allesandra</hi> to
<hi>Valenza,</hi> with good store of match, which the Town wanted much. These
were led on by the Camp-master <hi>Lodovico Guasco,</hi> being guided by
<hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliano Stampa, Count di Monte Castello,</hi> nephew to
<hi>Guasco,</hi> who knew those ways very well; and passing on succesfully
between the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s quarters and those of the Montferrians,
they were not at all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb'd by the enemy, that side being open, without
Trenches, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most abandoned; but they ran danger in approaching the
fortification of their friends; for as they drew near Fort <hi>Rosario,</hi> a
Fort which stood towards the Mountain, and which had been bravely defended all
the time of the siege by <hi>Ottaviano Sauli,</hi> a Gentleman of
<hi>Genoa;</hi> and the fore-runners, or Scouts, not having given the true
watch-word whereby they were to have been admitted and received, but had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the last nights watch-word, <hi>Sauli</hi> doubted that some treachery might
lie hid under that false word, and therefore made them keep aloof off with his
Musket shot, wherewith some of them were slain; but when <hi>Guasco,</hi> and
other Captains who were very well known to <hi>Sauli,</hi> began to parly, they
were soon known, and let in; by this happy success another better fortune
followed; for <hi>Cricky,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>earing that this relief was
brought into <hi>Valenza,</hi> which was reported to be greater then it was,
they began to apprehend the safety of their own Trenches, quarters, Artillery
and Baggage, in <pb n="569" facs="tcp:53250:292"/> case they should be assaulted by those
that brought in the succour; for knowing in what woful condition they had left
them, they verily belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they would have been taken and sack'd, with the
loss not only of their honour, but of their Artillery, and with the destroying
of their Fortifications, and the loss of those few men that were left to defend
them, so as they thought good to return speedily to their first Quarters.</p>
            <p>This so sudden resolution of the Colleagues facilitated the
bringing in of the whole relief by the <hi>Lomellina;</hi> for the Spanish Army
being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the preceding days success, and seeing that the Enemy had
abandoned the field, knew they were absolute Masters on this side the
<hi>Poe,</hi> and saw not any thing that could keep them from relieving the
Town; leaving therefore all their Militia, with half their Foot, under the
command of Camp-master <hi>Boccapianola,</hi> to guard their Quarters, they
went out early in the morning with the rest of their men, and marched towards
the upper bank. The Horse, which was commanded by the Count <hi>di Sora,</hi>
marched on the right wing, within sight of the Piedmontese Quarters, to the end
that the Foot, which were divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three Squadrons, being sheltred by
them, might advance safely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the same side, and with them the munition;
and three Troops of Horse went before the Foot Van. The convoy of relief went
on the other side, towards the place that was chosen on the lower bank, led on
by the Marquess <hi>Lunato,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Frederick Imperiale,</hi> to
whose charge the whole business was committed: Two pieces of Cannon went before
them, with some Foot; and behind came a competent number of Carriages, loaded
with Boats, and with all things requisite for relieving the Town. In this
posture did the Army march, being favoured by a thick mist, which kept them
from being seen by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and whilst the Scouts went without any
opposition to the other side, Don <hi>Iohn di Garrai,</hi> who having better
considered the windings of the <hi>Poe,</hi> and finding by the manner of the
Enemies proceedings that no Forces would come from the Piedmontese Quarters
which might any ways make him apprehend a general Battle, (having first agreed
with <hi>Colonna,</hi> that the succour would come safe between the aforesaid
Quarters, and the Fort) he ordered <hi>Lunato</hi> and <hi>Imperiale</hi> that
they should go thitherward, and towards the place which was first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by
<hi>Imperiale,</hi> to execute their Commission: The new Order was obeyed
forthwith; so as the succour wheeling about behind the Fort, it drew neer the
bank which was above it, where it was playd upon by Musket shot, which came in
abundance from the said Fort, and by two pieces of Cannon, which play'd from
the top of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site shore; but the Cannon shot, though it were dreadful,
yet being made but seldom, they did more terrifie then endammage; and to the
hail of musket-shot which came from the Fort, no readier nor fitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
could be found out then to assault the Fort: Wherefore Colonel
<hi>Imperiale,</hi> who attending still upon the succour, saw how necessary it
was to provide against this inconveniency, sent to advertise <hi>Colonna</hi>
how affairs went, and how requisite it was to assault the Fort; whereupon
<hi>Colonna</hi> forthwith commanded some Companies of Spaniards and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians,
that they should assault that Fort, who going boldly on, took it; for they did
no sooner skirmish then scale it: The Marquess <hi>Torrecuso</hi> 
               <pb n="570" facs="tcp:53250:293"/> was the first man, who having moved <hi>l'Imporiale</hi>
a little before to favour the putting of the Boats into the River, was intent
upon the passing of them over, it being the action of most importance; when he
saw the Foot advance to give the assault, leaving the whole care of the relief
to Colonel <hi>Imperiale,</hi> he headed them with his sword in his hand; and
plucking the Stakes from out the Steccado, wherewith the whole ditch was
environed, he was one of the first that got upon the Parapet; all the rest,
moved by his example, followed him; so as most of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison were slain, and
the Ensigne and Captain were taken prisoners. The succour past on the mean
while without any disturbance, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with their Boats, which falling
down the stream, came happily to the Shore at <hi>Valenza,</hi> and by them as
much relief as was desired was conveyed in, the Enemy looking on, who
endeavoured in vain to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it with their Cannon and Musket shot from the
Capuchins Chappel.</p>
            <p>By this succour the Town was not only well provided of all things
needful, but wholly freed from Siege; for the Colleagues despairing to make
further progress, foreseeing that by the approaching winter the earth would
become so spungie as it would not be to be wrought, and that the Army being
bemired, and not able to receive any food, would be besieged even in the open
field, they resolved after fifty days siege to give over the Enterprise, and to
retreat, to the no little confusion of the Commanders in chief, who being at
variance within themselves, and unsatisfied, laid the fault of this ill-guided
Siege one upon another. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> parted not long after, much
discontented, for <hi>France,</hi> where he intended to give a clear and full
relation unto the King how Affairs had been carried in this Enterprize, and to
desire to be protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him, and to be defended in his Dominions, which,
when this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness miscarried, he apparently foresaw was exposed to the
invasion of the Spanish Forces, for his having sided with <hi>France:</hi> But
this happy success was a little overcast by the death of <hi>Colonna,</hi> who
through his extraordinary pains taken in this Siege, died the day before the
Town was relieved.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Valenza</hi> being freed, the Colleagues Army dissolved. The
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> retreated with his men to <hi>Vercelli;</hi> and the
Marshal to <hi>Cassalle;</hi> upon whom the Gates of the Town were shut, upon
pretence that there being scarcity of Victuals in that City, it could not
provide food for so great a number of men, without evident danger of wanting
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary nourishment for them that were in the Town already; wherefore he was
forced to divide his men amongst the Towns of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> which though
they suffer'd the like want of victuals, yet being weak and unable to refuse
giving quarter, they were forced to yield to the stronger power; the remainder
of the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s men were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise distributed into the same
Towns; the Duke himself being retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Cassalle,</hi> where he had the
Castle given him for his lodging: on the Spaniards side, their Armies were also
put into their Winter quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, except some of <hi>Serbellone</hi>'s Brigades,
which were sent to recover the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> for at the same time, which
was about the beginning of <hi>November, Fernamont</hi> who had raised more men
in <hi>Tirvolo,</hi> prepared to pass the Moun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ains once more, to reduce the <hi>Valtoline</hi> into its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
condition; &amp; to this purpose he had sent to <hi>Millain</hi> and to
<hi>Serbellone,</hi> 
               <pb n="571" facs="tcp:53250:293"/> to agree upon the time when they
should fall upon the French joyntly, <hi>Serbellone,</hi> on the State of
<hi>Millains</hi> side, and he by <hi>Tyrvolo,</hi> that so they might effect
their business the sooner and more safely; but <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi>'s speed
prevented these designs, who hearing how neer the Dutch were, sent immediately
1000 Foot to <hi>Bormio,</hi> whither not long after he himself came with the
remainder of his men: being come thither he found the Dutch fallen down by
unknown ways into the Plain; without any delay, he once more assaulted them;
and not without loss on their side, forced them to re-pass back over the
Mountains to <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volo:</hi> they being gone, <hi>Rohan</hi> leaving a
Garrison in <hi>Bormio,</hi> and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lest <hi>Serbellone</hi> might fall
upon him on his back, and hearing that many Grisons were come down to assist
him, he made the like haste as before, and brought 4000 Foot with him, amongst
which 200 <hi>Zuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cani;</hi> he appeared, unexpected, at <hi>Morbegno</hi>
about noon, where <hi>Serbel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone</hi> was with 3500 Foot and 200 Horse, and
not having heard of the rout given to <hi>Fernamont,</hi> expected news of his
coming, to the end, that according to appointment he might at the same time
fall upon the enemy on the back; but he fared no better then
<hi>Fernamonte,</hi> for whilst he was at dinner, he unexpectedly was assaulted
by <hi>Rohan;</hi> and not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving time to assemble his men, who were dispers'd
into the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts, he was soon overcome and routed, many of his
Captains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing slain or taken prisoners, amongst which the Count <hi>di
San,</hi> the second Captain of Horse, and Count <hi>Valenza,</hi> Nephew to
<hi>Serbellone;</hi> and <hi>Serbellone</hi>'s self being pursued by the enemy
fled to Fort <hi>Fuentes,</hi> wounded in the arm and on the back; such
Souldiers as could save themselves fled, some one way, some another way, to the
neerest Towns of the State of <hi>Millain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Rohan</hi> having beaten the enemy the fifth time,
remained all that Winter master and peaceful possesser of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Bormio</hi> and of
<hi>Chiavenna;</hi> and greatly rejoycing, forc'd the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants to new
agreements, pretending that the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> contrary to the Articles of
<hi>Monsone,</hi> was wholly and totally fallen into the arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
King of <hi>France;</hi> and not being able to obtain of those In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,
though beaten by his Forces, and several ways oppress'd, any thing of what he
demanded, he began by strange rigour and extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to tyrannize over them; but
they little confiding in the promises of liberty and maintenance of their
Religion, which were made them in the King of <hi>France</hi> his name,
patiently underwent their bad treating, and would never forego the authority
and protection of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> promising themselves, and
confidently believing to be preserved and maintain'd by the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> in their intire Liberty and Religion, according to his Promises
and Decrees: miserable and woful wretches, whom you shall soon see abandoned to
their former yoke of slavery, by those in whom they so much trusted, and for
whose sake they suffer'd so much at the present.</p>

  Governour seeing the State freed of the Enemies Army, betakes himself, partly,
  to recover the Towns taken by the Enemy, partly, to resent himself to

  Forces he could thither, he proceedes so far, as the Duke who was retired to
  <hi>Piacenza,</hi> maintains a siege till such time as, seeing no succour, he
  is forc'd to compound with the Governour. The War of <hi>Parma</hi> being
  appeased, the Governour turns upon the Towns in the <hi>Langhe,</hi> which were
  yet held by the Enemy; and having taken some of them, he hears that the Duke
  raiseth Forces in the <hi>Canavese;</hi> he marcheth towards him, and having in

  <hi>Villa,</hi> who was returned from the State of <hi>Parma,</hi> coming forth

  defend it: And succeeding fortunately therein, his happinesse was imbittered by
  a great defeat which the Duke gave to <hi>Don Martino</hi> of <hi>Aragon</hi>

            <p>NEws being come to the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> of the assault
given by the Colleagues Army to the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and of the
scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of provisions, and Garrison, which were there; though
<hi>Burgondy</hi> were assaulted at the same time by the Prince of
<hi>Coude</hi> with another Army, and <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi>
were full of several perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; (all which required extraordinary
provisions) yet the King would have the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> of all other
parts, chiefly and fully secured and furnish'd. For it being the Bulwark, and,
as a man may say, the Rendezvous of the Spanish Arms, the greater the prejudice
should be that would result by the loss thereof, the more necessary was it to
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the safety and preservation thereof. And Cardinal
<hi>Albornozzi</hi> who was a Church-man, not being very proper for that
Government, in so turbulent and dangerous times, and the care of that State
being <pb n="574" facs="tcp:53250:295"/> to begin by the choice of a Governour, who might
be fit for that charge, and for the condition of the present time<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>Don Diego Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
Gusmano,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Liganes,</hi> who had formerly served in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> was constituted to succeed him: Who though he went speedily
from Court, came not to <hi>Millain</hi> before the midst of <hi>October,</hi>
a little after <hi>Valenza</hi> was freed from the siege; and not long after
that by the rout given in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> the recovery of that valley
appeared desperate. With him came many Spanish Cavaliers, who being zealous of
that Crowns Reputation and Grandezza put themselves to serve as Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
under this new Governour; he brought also a million and a half of Ducates,
which was brought after him in Gallies. But the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the
Marshal, being with no great honour driven from before <hi>Valenza,</hi> and
hearing how ill they were spoken of in the Court of <hi>France,</hi> and
particularly the Duke, (who heard himself taxed of double dealing,) they
endeavoured to give better satisfaction to the Court then yet they had done, by
recovering their lost Reputation. Having therefore mustered their Forces at
<hi>Villata,</hi> which was yet in their possession, they went to the
<hi>Lomellina;</hi> and going to <hi>Candia,</hi> whither 400 Foot were sent by
the new Governour, they met with some opposition; but making themselves
presently masters of the place, the 400 Foot were sent prisoners to
<hi>Gasalle:</hi> And not thinking that place convenient for their design, as
being too far from the <hi>Poe,</hi> they went lower, and took
<hi>Sartiranna;</hi> where were 200 Foot, who being as the others, forced to
yield, were, as the others were, sent prisoners to <hi>Casalle;</hi> from hence
they march to <hi>Bremi,</hi> a Town upon the <hi>Poe,</hi> with whose
scituation being satisfied, they resolved to make use of it for a ground-work
of their premeditated designes. For considering that, by casting a Bridge over
here, they might over-run the Country of <hi>Allessandria</hi> and of
<hi>Tortona,</hi> and the <hi>Lomellina</hi> and Country of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi>
joyning thereupon, they thought that when they should have forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
themselves there, they might make a good part of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
on each side of the River, subject to their commands. Falling therefore with
all diligence to do what they intended, they within a short space erected there
a Fort Royal, big enough to receive an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Army; and puting thereinto
a good Garrison, they thought they might keep firm footing in the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> and lay a good foundation for the further designes they had
upon that State; and if they should do no more, they thought they should win
much glory and reputation in keeping a quarter in that State, and an almost
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable bulwark, by which they hoped to have subjugated part of that, the
whole whereof they so much thirsted after: The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> was
thought to be a chief plotter of this, being defirous to cancel the sinister
opinion out of the French, which they had conceived of him, by reason of what
had hapned before <hi>Valenza,</hi> by giving them this place in lieu thereof,
which was of greater consequence, and a more convenient seat: And therefore he
did not onely assist the already begun Fabrick by his care and diligence, but
stuck not sometimes to work thereupon with his own hands as a private Souldier.
The work was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun about the end of <hi>November,</hi> in a time when the
<hi>Lomellina</hi> having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been the seat of the War before
<hi>Valenza,</hi> was wholly destitute <pb n="575" facs="tcp:53250:295"/> of victuals,
forrage, and of all things else necessary for the maintenance of an Army, in a
time when the earth being cover'd over with Ice and Snow, and the ways deep, it
was impossible they could be disturbed in their work; an advantage which was
well repaid, by the prejudice that the same difficulties occasioned to the
labourers, and to the whole French Army; for the Souldiers not being able to
resist the bitterness of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and the scarcity of victuals, so many of
them died, as in a short time, and before the Fort was finished, they were
reduced to a very small number; yet the work was finished, and abundantly
provided of all warlike necessaries; but not being able to tarry in so desolate
a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try for the scarcity of victuals, a sufficient Garrison being left
there, all the rest of the Souldiery went out, and ran plundering up and down,
some in the lower <hi>Montferrat,</hi> some in the parts about
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> where taking Towns, they, with much rigour used towards
the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, got together as much victuals as they could, and brought it
all speedily into the new Fort. The Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> was not present at
this building, being gone to <hi>Paris</hi> to negotiate his own interests with
the King, hoping not only to be rewarded and honour'd, but to be by him
assisted in the maintaining of his Dominions, which in his absence were exposed
to the assaults of the enemy; in defence whereof, the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
were it either to regain the Kings favour, and to can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel all shadows of
suspition, or to ease <hi>Piedmont</hi> from quartering, he sent the Marquess
<hi>Villa</hi> with 1800 Horse, and 4000 Foot, to boot with the remainder of
the <hi>Parma</hi> Forces, to go joyntly to the defence of those Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es. The Marquess marching out of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> and having without any opposition cross'd through the
Country of <hi>Alessandria,</hi> came to <hi>Scrivia</hi> a River which runs
neer <hi>Tortona;</hi> but the new Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who hearing of this marching,
was before hand, got into that Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, hoping assuredly to hinder the enemies
passage over that River; to which purpose he placed two pieces of Cannon, and
some Sacres, upon a certain rise on the inward bank, on the opposite side
whereof the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my marched already; and he also placed all his Musketeers
there: he also sent a Troop of Dragoons beyond the River to discover the
ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which were driven back over the River by the Marquess his Guard, and
forced with much loss to get within shelter of the Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the other
side. The Marquess drew out his men in battle array to venture foording his men
over; and after having skirmished a while, finding himself inferiour to the
enemy both in Forces and situation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted from passing over there, and tried
whether he might not overcome the enemy by Military industry: this River is
foordable only in three places, the first in this place which was well guarded
by <hi>Tortona;</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther five miles lower at <hi>Castel nuovo;</hi> the
third between these two, which is called <hi>passo della Lupa.</hi> The
Marquess would not venture over here, it being so neer the other place, and
from him: the Prince being come to <hi>Traghetino,</hi> within three miles of
<hi>Castel nuovo,</hi> found that <hi>Villa</hi> stood expecting him in the
field with his men in order; and not thinking it fit to face a Captain and old
Souldiers proud of their late got Victory, with fresh and unexperienced men,
staid expecting new recruits from the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> where, by
order from the Governour, some 3000 Foot were in readiness to assist the
assaulted State, under Don <hi>Iovan <pb n="576" facs="tcp:53250:296"/> Vasques
Cornado,</hi> Governour of <hi>Cremona,</hi> and 800 Horse under Don
<hi>Vincenzo Gonsaga,</hi> Lieutenant General of the Horse of the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> who being come from the greater <hi>Cassalle,</hi> in Barques
along the <hi>Poe,</hi> to <hi>Boreto,</hi> a Town of <hi>Modena,</hi> landed
there, and joyn'd with Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi> intending to fall joyntly upon
the State of <hi>Parma.</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Villa,</hi> at the news of the
coming of this recruit, was gone from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stel nuovo</hi> to the banks of
<hi>Poe,</hi> between <hi>Barcello</hi> and <hi>Colorno,</hi> thinking that
this succour would land there, that so he might keep them from landing; but
seeing them fall lower, and fearing what did indeed hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that when they
should be landed they would march into the Country of <hi>Parma,</hi> he
thought to oppose them at the pass of <hi>Lenza,</hi> a little River which
divides the States of <hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Parma,</hi> upon which there were
two Bridges; upon one of the which, called <hi>Ponte del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la Sorbolla,</hi> he
himself stood with his men, and sent 500 men of <hi>Parma</hi> to defend the
other, thinking that the enemy would fall on by that of <hi>Sorbolla:</hi> but
seeing that they went to assault the other, and that having driven away those
of <hi>Parma,</hi> not without some loss, they were pass'd to this side the
River, he feared that they would overrun the Country even to the Walls of
<hi>Parma,</hi> as they might well do; wherefore leaving the <hi>Parma</hi>
Militia to guard the Bridge of <hi>Sorbolla,</hi> he went himself with his men
to the Hospital St. <hi>Lazzero,</hi> to keep them from advancing neerer the
City; between the River <hi>Lenza</hi> and the City of <hi>Parma</hi> there
goes a large way, with a great Ditch on either side; the Prince and the Spanish
Commanders, thinking to charge through to the City, by that great way, they put
their men in order; and so did <hi>Villa</hi> his: a Van of 500 Musketeers
march'd before the Prince his men, half on the one side, half on the other side
of the way; betwixt whom the Horse marched, and behind them the rest of the
Spanish Foot, and in the Ree<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> came
those of <hi>Modena,</hi> 5000 Foot and 1000 Horse, in number. The Marquess
disposed of his men <hi>en Croupe;</hi> and were it either that the Spanish
Horse which advanc'd wanted Musketiers, or that the way through which they came
galloping was so narrow, as no more then five Horse could come on front, it was
easie for the Marquess (who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready was pass'd over with the <hi>Piedmont</hi>
Horse) to make head against them, and to keep back and repulse the enemies
Horse by his Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot, who being dispers'd fled, some to <hi>Castel

               </gap>e wounded, some slain. Don <hi>Martine d'Aragona</hi>
received a sore wound himself, and the Governour not appearing with any
succour, the foord was forsaken; so as not only those who were already pass'd,
but those that tarried behind, pass'd over together with the Foot, without any
gainsaying; <hi>Villa</hi> being doubly glorious, first for having deluded the
enemies advantages by his cunning, and by his valour routed their Forces, he
pursued his march, and came with his men to Castle St. <hi>Iovanni,</hi> and
from thence into the States of <hi>Piacenza</hi> and <hi>Parma;</hi> and having
distributed his men in these States, instead of being a guard and defence unto
them, he drew a new war and a new enemy upon them; for he had no sooner
refresh'd his men, but that he entered the Dukedom of <hi>Modena</hi> with 1000
Horse, and 200 Foot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving any notice thereof to the Duke of
<hi>Modena;</hi> and having taken <hi>Castel nuovo del Regiano,</hi> he made a
Rendezvouz of Arms there, and <pb n="577" facs="tcp:53250:296"/> quartered his Horse in the
neighbouring Towns, putting compositions upon them.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> took this freedom ill, as he had
reason to do; chiefly finding, as it was true, that this was not done by
<hi>Villa</hi>'s own motion, but by order from the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
the Marshal; and perhaps also from the Court of <hi>France,</hi> in resentment
of his parting from the League with <hi>France,</hi> without saying any thing,
and for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving wholly joyn'd with the Spanish party, when so great a change
was least looked for; it not being likely that the Marquess would otherwise
have done so great an affront to a Prince, who was son to a sister of the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> whose Captain General he was: the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>
thinking therefore how to defend himself, and how to resent so great an
affront, muster'd 4000 foot, and 1000 horse of the trained Bands of the State,
with whom, and with two field pieces, he sent his uncle Prince <hi>Lewis,</hi>
to oppose those who had entred his State in hostile manner; and having sent
news to the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> of this unlooked for affront, he
expected good succour and assistance desended by the same forces; he therefore
placed his design on the passage at <hi>Castelnuovo,</hi> as being further off
and unguarded; so as while he kept his files in order upon the side opposite to
<hi>Tortona,</hi> he feigned as if he would try his fortune over that foord,
that he might so keep the Governour at bay, but ordered his horse to go down
the river towards <hi>Castelnuovo;</hi> where foording over the river without
any opposition, he made himself master of the further shore; and when he
thought his horse were well advanced, he withdrew his foot, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after
them; the Governor being too late aware of the Enemies pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, began to doubt
that he might pass over that foord which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded; wherefore he
dispatch'd away Don <hi>Martine d'Aragona</hi> speeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thither with the
greatest part of the horse, and some foot, to the end that he might be there
before him, to defend the passage; but with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press order, that if when he
should become thither, he should finde the enemy were not yet come neer the
foord, he should endeavour to keep them aloof off it; and if they were come so
neer, as that they were already begun to wade, he should withdraw a little into
a wood which was not far off; for that he himself, who prepared to follow him,
would come thither, when half the enemy being not well over, he might enclose
them between his men, and those of the <hi>Aragons</hi> who were in the wood;
and so having destroy'd that part, the rest who were beyond the water, might be
forc'd to wheel about, and might easily be overtaken, and being in an enemies
countrey, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd by numbers might be assaulted, and defeated: but the
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign failed, were it either that the <hi>Aragon</hi> did not perfectly
obse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ve his orders, or that the
Governour tarrying longer then he ought to have done, marched not soon enough;
for the <hi>Piedmont</hi> horse got to the foord before those of the
<hi>Aragon,</hi> who though he got to the other side with some of his fleetest
fore-runners at the same time when those of <hi>Piedmont</hi> entred the river,
and endeavor'd to munite the bank with the militia of <hi>Castelnuovo,</hi> and
to hinder their passage; yet instead of retreating to the wood, and affording
time for the Governour to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, he gave order that his horse, leaving the
foot behinde, should <pb n="578" facs="tcp:53250:297"/> advance as fast as they could;
which the horse observing, they came thither, when the first part of the
enemies horse, on the head whereof was Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> having overcome
the opposition made on the other side, had already foorded over with Musketeers
otherwise. He placed 200 Musketeers on the Front, which were entertained by a
great squadron of horse, 200 more Musketeers were on the right hand of the
horse, a good part stood behind some trees that were cut down, which served for
a Trench; he fortified a place behind him with <hi>Parma</hi>'s Souldiers, to
serve him for a retreat, in case he should not be able to resist so many men;
nor herewith content, he did not fill up the whole breadth of the way with
Artillery, to the end that if he were forc'd to retreat, he might do it without
confusion, contrary to what the enemy did, who promising themselves assured
victory, provided not any place of retreat: the Skirmish was fought with much
valour and courage, and the Spaniards came very hot on at first, thinking to
discompose the enemies ranks at the very first onset; but they were soon
deceived, meeting with as stout resistance, for above two hours space; but at
last being overpowered in numbers, <hi>Villa</hi> was forc'd to retreat, which
he did without disorder, by the part of that way, which he discreetly had left
open: Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonsaga</hi> pursued them fiercely, as also Baron
<hi>Battavilla,</hi> and Count <hi>Arese;</hi> who being opposed by Don
<hi>Mauritio</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> with his regiment, they met with some
resistance; but not long after the first falling on <hi>Scipione Fiesco,</hi>
brother to the Prince of <hi>Messerano,</hi> and Captain <hi>Guirini</hi> were
taken Prisoners, and many were wounded and slain; so as not able to make his
party good any longer, he was disordered, and retreated without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion
also, by that part of the way which was left open; and certainly they would all
have been certainly ruin'd, had not Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> who had all this
while assisted in the fight, rallied all the valliantest of his men, and
putting himself on their head, fought undauntedly, and withstood the violence
of the enemies, who thinking themselves sure of victory, came up in close
ranks, and cheerfully pursued the chase; and though the Piedmontese met with
hard usage by the Musket-shot, wherewith many of them were slain, yet did they
so resolutely resist, and the assailants were played upon so fast by the
Musketeers, who were placed behind those trees which being cut down, served
them for a rampier, or trench, as <hi>Gonsaga, Battavilla,</hi> and
<hi>Arese,</hi> who fought on the head of the horse, being wounded,
<hi>Villa</hi> easily disordered the enemies horse, being now without leaders;
and forc'd them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to fly back in disorder; <hi>Villa</hi> pursued
them till night, which came soon on, and then he left free passage for the
enemy to fly, and to retreat; and he bringing back with him above a hundred
prisoners, and of these some of the Chiefest, he retreated victoriously towards
<hi>Parma:</hi> the City refusing to receive in so many men, shut the gates
up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, but took in the Captains, who were nobly treated by the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>lity of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the rest
were sent to quarter in S. <hi>Secondo, Soragna,</hi> and in
<hi>Fontanello.</hi> At the same time that this succour was sent directly from
<hi>Millain</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> the Governour would also
assist his State, and his affairs by diversion; he therefore ordered Don
<hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> to enter the Dukedom of <hi>Piacenza</hi> with 4000
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:53250:297"/> foot, 600 horse, and six pieces of Artillery; who in
obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, sat down immediately before <hi>Castel S. Iovanni,</hi>
the first Town of that Dukedom confining upon the State of <hi>Millain;</hi>
and placing his Artillery against the walls of that Town which were weak, and
old, and not lined with earth, the Towns-men, who saw they could not resist,
surrendered the Town; and <hi>Gatta</hi> entring thereinto fell to take the
Castle, wherein were 120 French men, who after 15 days siege were forc'd to
give it up; during which time the Governour desired that the horse, who were
not imployed in that service, might over run, and lay waste the countrey of
<hi>Piacenza,</hi> to help the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> yet more by diversion,
which was molested by Marquess <hi>Villa:</hi> wherefore the Marquess of
<hi>Carracena,</hi> who commanded them, chose out 300 of the best horse, and
went first to assault 250 French horse, who were quartered in the Towns three
miles from <hi>Piacenza;</hi> he fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately routed them, and chased them till
they came to a certain rivolet which ran cross the way, which when the French
had past, they rallied, and faced about, and being routed again by
<hi>Carracena,</hi> they got under a Town called <hi>Rottofreno,</hi> from
whence some Foot came forth to aid them, they fell to skirmish the third time;
wherein <hi>Carracena</hi> being sore hurt in the leg by a Musket-shot, he
retreated and gave over the fight; so as the French Horse which pursued them,
routed them, and had the slaughter of them till they came to <hi>Castel San'
Iovanni,</hi> which when they were come neer unto, the rest of the Horse which
were there coming forth, together with a Foot Company to assist them, they fell
into further disorder; for this succour coming the same way as those that were
pursued did, they were broken and disordered by their own men, who fled back by
the same way: in this action about 100 of <hi>Carra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena</hi>'s Horse were
slain, and some taken prisoners, amongst which <hi>Becca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raia</hi> a Captain of
Horse, who was first sore wounded; and yet the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of <hi>Gatta</hi> and
<hi>Carracena</hi> into the Territories of <hi>Piacenza</hi> was not to no
purpose; for it freed the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi> from having his Country
molested by the Piedmontese; it being necessary to send for Marquess
<hi>Villa</hi> back to relieve the parts about <hi>Piacenza;</hi> so the Duke
of <hi>Modena</hi> being free from this disturbance, had leasure to resent
himself, and to take <hi>Rossenna,</hi> a Town belonging to the Duke of
<hi>Parma,</hi> which was wholly environed by the Territories of
<hi>Modena.</hi> The Spaniards took likewise <hi>Colorno,</hi> a Castle
belonging to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> considerable for its strength, and for
the opportunity which it afforded of passing to the City of <hi>Parma;</hi> and
some moneths before, <hi>Fiombo,</hi> and <hi>Guadamiglio,</hi> two Towns in
the Territories of <hi>Piacenza</hi> lying beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> were taken
by the Marquess of <hi>Carracena.</hi> But the Governour, that he might revenge
himself yet further upon the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> gave order to <hi>Gerardo
Gambacorta,</hi> General of the Neapolitan Horse, that he should enter his
Territories with two Dutch Regiments, the one of Horse, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Count
<hi>Slic,</hi> the other of Foot led on by Colonel <hi>Gild' Ais;</hi> and that
they should proceed further against him. The Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> and the
Marshal thought that it would redound to the discredit of the League, if they
should suffer those States to be invaded whilst they stood idly looking on with
their fingers underneath their girdles, and should behold the misfortunes of
that their Confederate Prince, whereby they <pb n="580" facs="tcp:53250:298"/> might fall
into the displeasure of the King and Court of <hi>France,</hi> the King having
given the care of preserving his Dominions in charge to them; since therefore
they could not directly assist by opposition, they resolved to do it by
diversion; so joyning their Forces, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king up a body of 9000 Foot, and 500
Horse, the Marshal went there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with from <hi>Vercelli,</hi> and passing over the
<hi>Sesia,</hi> took <hi>Palestre,</hi> an open Town, where there was no
Garrison, from whence he went to <hi>Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enza,</hi> and then to
<hi>Robbio,</hi> where there were some small Foot Garrisons; and taking them
upon conditions, he pass'd with all his men over <hi>la Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gua,</hi> a River in
<hi>Lomellina,</hi> and went to <hi>Vespolano,</hi> where for two hours space
he was stoutly resisted by the Towns-men, who when they were able to do no
more, quit the Town, and retreated to the Castle: The Marshal entred the Town,
and quarter'd his men thereabouts; but at so small a distance, as they might
easily come together and joyntly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves, in case they should be
assaulted: The Governour hearing of this new commotion, sent Orders immediately
every where, that all the Foot and Horse should meet about the
<hi>Tessino;</hi> he recalled <hi>Gambacorta</hi> with his Dutch Regiments from
the parts about <hi>Piacenza;</hi> and fearing that the enemy might fix their
eyes upon <hi>Vigevano,</hi> he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered them to march with all diligence
towards that City; whereinto having formerly sent 100 Spaniards, he went from
<hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Biagras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa,</hi> where <hi>Gambacorta</hi> was come
that very night with two Dutch Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and with the Horse from the Country
of <hi>Piacenza;</hi> and there being only a hundred Spaniards and some few
Dutch in <hi>Vigevano,</hi> he feared that the Marshal might keep that City
from succour, if the Marshal coming to the <hi>Tessino,</hi> should hinder the
passing over of that River, and consequently it would be taken; wherefore he
commanded <hi>Gambacorta</hi> that with all speed he should passe over the
<hi>Tessino,</hi> and should secure that City and all the adjacent Towns from
being sack'd, and from inroads; all which being pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually performed by
<hi>Gambacorta,</hi> the Governour pass'd with the rest of the men to
<hi>Vigevano,</hi> where he tarried some days to expect a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment of Dutch,
conducted by the Baron <hi>di Lezer,</hi> who was to come shortly, and also to
tarry for the Artillery which was come out of <hi>Pavia,</hi> and could not be
long a coming. In this interim some of the Marshals Forces advanced to a little
weak Town called <hi>Civagliana,</hi> which they took, leaving the Castle
unattempted, which they would not tarry to take, the enemy being so neer; but
the Governour, who was in <hi>Vige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vano</hi> with 6000 Foot and 2000 Horse,
thought it stood not with his honour, that the enemy should advance armed
further into the State of <hi>Mallain;</hi> and should continually grieve the
Inhabitants, sometimes with quarter, sometimes with composition: he therefore
resolved to march into the field, and keep them from such insulting; he went
straight to <hi>Novara,</hi> intending to come upon the back of the enemy, that
so by keeping him from returning he might easily vanquish him; being gone a few
miles he heard news, that the Marshal was gone with his Army out of
<hi>Vespolno,</hi> and that he was ready to give him Battle if he should
advance; and that to that purpose he had sent some Forces that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
<hi>Sastrego,</hi> a Town neer <hi>Strano,</hi> where the Governour was to
quarter that night: the truth is, that the Marshal was advanced with 
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:53250:298"/> 1500 Dragoons, and 1000 Foot, to <hi>Serano,</hi> and
leaving them all in a certain Wood, he himself advanced to discover
<hi>Serano,</hi> where he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to lie that night, and so to advance
towards the <hi>Tessino.</hi> The Governour hearing this, which was also
confirm'd unto him by <hi>Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacorta,</hi> who was so far advanc'd, and got so
neer the Enemy, as he could not retreat, he sent him forthwith order to fall
upon him; assuring him that he would come in unto his succour with the rest of
the Forces. <hi>Gambacorta</hi> was not slow in executing his orders, nor the
Marshal less slow then he in receiving the onset; thinking that the whole body
of the Enemies Army was not there, but onely some Troops of Horse which went
for forrage, or to quarter in the neighbouring Towns: So as falling together by
the ears, they fought a while with equal Valour and Fortune, till two Troops of
Dragoons of the Spanish party ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; who gave fire so fast, as beginning to
disorder the first ranks, which were already well advanced, all the rest were
routed by the Commissary General of the Cavalry, <hi>Don Ferdinandod'
Heredia,</hi> and turning their Horses heads began to run, and were pursued for
a mile and a half by <hi>Gambacorta;</hi> till being come to the wood where the
am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush lay, they staid. <hi>Gambacorta</hi> doubting the coming of the
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, whom he saw not yet appear, and seeing that the Enemies faced
about, and prepared to resist feared an ambush, and forbore pursuit; nor durst
he with unequal Forces run the hazard which he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, as if the
Governour had come he would have done, and so have gotten a fuller victory, for
which he deserved to be accounted not onely a valiant, but a cautious and
prudent Commander. For being content with the slaughter and imprisonment of
many, he very sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably with-drew himself and his men from the imminent
danger. There were slain in this conflict about 150 of the Marshals men, and
some 60 taken prisoners; and all the mischief befell the Duke of
<hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi>'s Horse, which fought more stoutly then the rest; and hereupon
some dispute arose between the Duke and the Marshal: The Duke complaining that
the Marshal, upon the first declension of the fight, got upon a fleete Horse
and to save his life abandoned the Dukes Horse. Those that were worsted
retreated from <hi>Vespolano</hi> to <hi>Palestre;</hi> and the Governour going
to <hi>Novara,</hi> pursued the Enemy, who though they made some shew of facing
him, yet when they heard he was come neer them, they past back over the
<hi>Sesia,</hi> and retreated into <hi>Piedmont:</hi> Hastily freeing that
State, which but a little before they had so reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely assaulted. And as this
assault proved unfortunate for the assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, so neither had the diversion
intended that effect which was hoped for: For the States of <hi>Parma</hi> and
<hi>Piacenza</hi> were molested in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim; the Duke of <hi>Modena</hi>
was assisted in the State of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Kings men, notwithstanding
this unexpected assault, were not sent for back from the parts about
<hi>Piacenza.</hi> But both the Dukedoms of <hi>Parma</hi> and
<hi>Piacenza,</hi> were sack'd, fired, and laid desolate; and yet was the Duke
of <hi>Modena</hi> sent to by the Pope to forbear all Hostillity against the
Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories belonging to the Church, and was desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Parma,</hi> to come to composition; and the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi>
Brother in law to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed himself also in the
business of compounding; wherefore the <pb n="582" facs="tcp:53250:299"/> Duke with-drew
his Souldiers to within his own State. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, the Spaniards, who
were come to succour <hi>Modena,</hi> forbore not to ransack the Country, and
to commit other hostile acts; <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> having taken
<hi>Castell St. Iovanni,</hi> went to <hi>Rottofreno,</hi> a Town 7 miles from
<hi>Piacenza,</hi> and not far from the <hi>Poe,</hi> took it, fortified it,
and put a Garrison of 600 Foot, and 200 Horse into it, which curb'd and
troubled the whole Country. It was likewise thought fit to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the States
in those parts which lay nearest <hi>Genoa;</hi> 400 Foot were sent to
<hi>Frederico Imperiale,</hi> under Sergeant Major <hi>Francesco
Tuttavilla,</hi> and two Troops of Horse, the one Curassiers, the other
Dragoons; who together with some of Prince <hi>Doria</hi> his Militia, being
raised in <hi>Bob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bio,</hi> went against <hi>Valdetara,</hi> a large Town
belonging to the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> where the Horse not being yet come, 70
of the Trained Bands of the Country were entred; but <hi>L'Imperiale</hi>
making himself master of the parts thereabouts, and causing two peice of Cannon
to advance, it yeilded: That Town being taken and well garrison'd, he went to
destroy <hi>Le Ferriere,</hi> a very advantagious place belonging to the Duke
of <hi>Parma,</hi> to which the way lies by a very narrow passage at the foot
of a high Mountain, called <hi>Della Penna,</hi> wherein was a Garrison of the
Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s subjects; <hi>L'Imperiale</hi> came against it with
500 Foot, and the Troops of Dragoons; the Pass after the first vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was
abandoned, all men running shamefully away; passing on, he came to <hi>Le
Ferriere,</hi> wherein there being a Garrison of the Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with some
peices of Artillery and Morter-peices, he met with some resistance; but it
lasted but a while, for it yielded the same night that <hi>Imperiale</hi> came
before it, and all the Forges and instruments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging, were
forthwith destroyed; which was done by order from the Governour. Moreover, the
Souldiers were permitted to plunder the whole Country, who got thereby great
booty in cattle and victuals. Some few dayes after he past to the plain of
<hi>Piacenza,</hi> where he found the whole Country forsaken by the Inhabitants
who fled, and <hi>Imperiale</hi> advanced no further; for hearing that greater
number of the Dukes Forces, both Horse and Foot, drew nigh, he kept his men on
the side of the Mountain, expecting greater recruits from <hi>Millain,</hi>
which did not onely not come; (for at <hi>Millain</hi> they endeavoured to send
greater Forces on that side against the Dukes dominions;) but these very men
were sent for back, to be used in more necessary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. The State of
<hi>Millain</hi> was molested by the French at the same time that the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi>'s Country was annoy'd by the Spaniards: For the Garrison of
<hi>Bremi,</hi> over-running the adjacent parts of the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> made themselves be soundly felt; and on the other side, the
French were much afflicted with sickness, occasioned by the ill ayr, and
marshes thereabout; whereof 40 and 50 dying on a day, they within a few moneths
lost above 4000 of their men; and it was thought, what between the building and
maintaining of that Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, that Fort cost the French more men, then the
taking of such ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have done; and diminishing not onely by the death
of so many, but also by the running away of multitudes, the French Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
already was reduced to so small a number, as it could not have sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted long,
had it not received new and great recruits. Nor did the <pb n="584" facs="tcp:53250:299"/>
Kings men suffer sore hardships here onely, but the Inhabitants of the County
of <hi>Como</hi> shared in the like. The Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> being (as hath
been said) after the rout given before <hi>Morbegno</hi> to
<hi>Serbellone,</hi> peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully possess'd of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and
having with him about four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Foot, and five hundred Horse, was
impatient to think he should lie idle; and envying the Marshal, who made
himself be so terribly felt from the Fort of <hi>Bremi,</hi> and who did so
enrich himself by booty, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to do the like himself, and to get more
footing in that State: He therefore made some small barques in the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> which being brought in the beginning of the Spring, 1636.
to the bank of the little Lake, full of Souldiers, he put them into the water;
and going to <hi>Pradel,</hi> he took it; and going by the way called
<hi>Francesca,</hi> and thence to the three <hi>Pievi,</hi> Towns belonging to
the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> he burnt and consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them, together with many
other neighbouring Towns. He came next (but without Artillery) to Fort
<hi>Medegin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> whither
<hi>Lodovico Guasco</hi> being sent a little before with a strong Garrison,
<hi>Rohan</hi> proceeded no further, but retreated to the
<hi>Valtoline.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But greater preparations for War then those of <hi>Rohan,</hi> or
the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal, were made the preceding Winter in all parts. Nine Troops of
Horse, and nine Regiments of Foot, were newly fallen down from the
<hi>Alps;</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> having set his heart upon being
Master of the Mediterranean, he assembled many Ships and Galleoons in
<hi>Britany</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> and increased the number of Gallies in
<hi>Provence,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he gave out he would do great things. On the
other side, the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard made no lesser preparations, as well to defend his
own Dominions, as to offend those of others: They had taken order for four
Regiments in <hi>Germany,</hi> two of Horse, and two of Foot, whereof one was
Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassiers, the other Dragoons, which they expected shortly; and being to pass
thorow the Swissers Country, they had already sent moneys to those Cantons, to
the end that being paid, they should not hinder their passage: Moreover 3000
Spaniards were entered the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> sent from several parts,
and 1000 Horse from the Vice-roy of <hi>Naples,</hi> who being sent thorow
<hi>Romagna,</hi> into the State of <hi>Modena,</hi> were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come into
that of <hi>Millain:</hi> But before these, the French Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appeared in
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> was also come thither, who
was returned from <hi>France</hi> loaded with promises, and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the
Courts good intentions and effects; for he brought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Orders to the Duke
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and to the Marshal, to re-place him in his States; in
obedience whereunto, the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> went anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipately into the
Field, together with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and the Marshal; their chief
intention was, as the effects did afterwards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate, to put
<hi>Parma</hi> into his State; which when they had done, they should, with his
men, and those of <hi>Villa</hi>'s which they should there finde, assault the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> either by the territories of <hi>Tortona,</hi> or by
those of <hi>Cremona,</hi> whilst the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Marshal
should do the like by that of <hi>Novara,</hi> and by the <hi>Lomellina;</hi>
or if they liked it better, they should turn upon the State of <hi>Modena,</hi>
and oblige the Spaniards to assist that Prince with good forces, who for having
aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the French party, and adhered to the Spanish, they desired to
suppress, and thus by either of these ways to divide the Spanish force<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, <pb n="584" facs="tcp:53250:300"/> and make them less able to
defend the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> Thus the Duke going from
<hi>Vercelli,</hi> and the Marshal from <hi>Cassalle,</hi> they joyned their
forces together, which amounted in all to about 18000 foot, and 4000 horse, and
past over the <hi>Poe</hi> at <hi>Bremi,</hi> and the <hi>Tanar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </hi> at <hi>Filizzano,</hi> and from
thence advanced to <hi>Nizza della Paglia,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess the Duke of his
Dominions: The Governour was then far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to them in men, the regiments
not being yet come which were expected from <hi>Germany;</hi> so as not
thinking it fit to oppose them in open field, he resolved to fortifie the right
bank of <hi>Scrivia</hi> with a great Trench, which beginning from the skirts
of the <hi>Appenine</hi> should run along the river to where it falls into the
<hi>Poe,</hi> which would be above fifteen miles in length, which the river it
self served for a ditch, the river being very dangerous to wade over, by reason
of the swift current, and which therefore made this fortification unaccessible;
so as though it seemed not to be defensible, as requiring many more Souldiers
to defend it then the Governour had to place there; yet since the river
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted access to the trench, but in very few places, those places being well
munited, it was sufficiently well provided for elsewhere, by the swiftness of
the river, and by some <hi>Corps de Guard</hi> placed in conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient places,
which might hinder any desperate attempts which might be made by the enemy
where they should think them weakly guarded; and yet the Governour being
desirous that the defence should not be defective, he brought thither all the
Souldiers that he could get either in the State of <hi>Millain</hi> or
elsewhere, even to the lessening of the usual garrisons, and most important
places; he did not onely summon the common Souldiers thither, but the Officers,
and best ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Commanders; nay, he himself would assist there in his own
person; nor did his counsel herein, nor his expence, and labour in that work
prove vain; for the enemies being as desirous to overcome that Trench, as the
Governour was to defend it, they sent the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced of their army to
discry it, who finding it untakeable, and unpassible they gave over the thought
of attempting it; they thought it not good to expose their Souldiers at one and
the same time to the swiftness of the river, and to the shot of the Spaniards;
they therefore resolved to try another way; they went from <hi>Nizza,</hi> and
past back o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Poe,</hi> and coasted along the left side of the river,
till being come to <hi>Giarvola,</hi> they had past by the head of the Trench
of <hi>Tortona,</hi> which terminated on the opposite bank: here they thought
to pass the Duke over into the Countrey of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> in their Boats
which followed them down the stream; and so they thought to couzen the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but they found new difficulties, which opposed them also in this
their enterprise; they first saw Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> with many
Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keteers on the other store, ready to hinder their passage; wherefore not
thinking it fit to attempt it there, they marched on; hoping they might advance
so far, as that they might find Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shore in
the confines of <hi>Piacenza,</hi> with his own men, and with those French who
were in that State under Count S. <hi>Paule;</hi> who might receive the Duke,
and secure the passage over the river; <hi>Villa,</hi> upon orders received
from the Duke, was really joyned with Count <hi>S. Paule,</hi> and was marched
thitherward; and having in his passage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <pb n="585" facs="tcp:53250:300"/> the
Town and Castle of S. <hi>Iovanni,</hi> was come to <hi>Arena,</hi> a Town in
the Territories of <hi>Pavia,</hi> to receive the Duke, whom they expected
suddenly to see on the other shore; and having driven away some horse which
were in <hi>Arena,</hi> they kept in those parts; but the Dukes met with new
and greater oppositions, which kept them from advancing so far; Count
<hi>Ferrante Bolognino,</hi> a Knight of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> one who had been
long vers'd in the wars of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and who was newly come to
<hi>Italy,</hi> to serve as Camp-master in these Wars; having received orders
from the Governour to hinder the passing over the <hi>Poe,</hi> had made some
fortifications upon the mouth of <hi>Tessino,</hi> and had drawn thither also
many mills, upon which, as also upon the banks, he had placed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cannons and
Musketeers; So as the two Dukes finding these new difficulties, and oppositions
as hard to overcome as those of <hi>Serivia,</hi> they past no further on; but
betook themselves to make inrodes into the Countrey, and to prejudice the Towns
thereabouts; which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing great fear in those of <hi>Pavia,</hi> they knew
not how they should be able to defend themselves from being sack'd, if the
enemy should draw neer their walls; and truly there not being so much as one
Souldier in the Town, (for the Governour, as you have heard, had sent for them
all to the Trench) the danger of that City was not inconsiderable; not onely in
respect of plunder, but also that it would be very hard to get the enemy who
was very strong, out, when he should be possest thereof; the Governour
apprehending this sent <hi>Spinola</hi> immediatly to defend it, with five
hundred Musketeers, which yet were not suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to free those Citizens from
fear, who for their greater safety, and to keep the enemy from their walls,
were resolved to break down an arch of that noble and magnificent bridge, which
close to the City stands over the <hi>Tessino;</hi> but these and other
provisions which were h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

more then was needful for the preservation of <hi>Pavia,</hi> for the
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federats, letting slip so fair an occasion, whereby they might have
conveyed the Duke safely into his Countrey, drew back, though they were not
pursued, and returned to <hi>Bremi;</hi> where not giving over the thought of
conveying the Duke into his Countrey, they resolved to make the enemy forgo the
Trench by a lusty diversion; which being abandoned, they might pass him over
with a few men into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Piacenza;</hi> they knew that the
continent of <hi>Novara,</hi> as being that part which of all the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> was farthest off from the Trench, was totally without
Garrison, or defence; wherefore they thought, that by going thither with the
main body of their army, they might cause the Trench to be abandoned; so being
come to <hi>Bremi,</hi> they sent the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> with 3000 foot,
and 300 horse towards <hi>Nizza,</hi> to the end that when the Trench should be
forsaken, he might pass with those men into his own dominions; they afterward
gave out that they intended three things, to the end that the Governour being
to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them all might speedily leave the passage over the Trench free to
the Duke: The first was to sit down before <hi>Valenza;</hi> The second, to go
take in <hi>Sandoval;</hi> And the third, to march strait towards
<hi>Novara:</hi> The Governour hearing these designs published, did at the same
time make two provisions; he sent Don <hi>Iohn di Gattai</hi> with 3000 foot,
and some horse, to succour <hi>Valenza,</hi> whether Don <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco 
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:53250:301"/> di Melo</hi> resolved to go soon after; and he sent
<hi>Gambacorta</hi> with the greatest part of the Cavalry, to relieve
<hi>Rottofreno,</hi> wherein there was but a small Garrison, for that part
thereof were sent for to the Trench: wherefore it was streightly besieged by
Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> who finding the Dukes expectation vanished by
withdrawing of the Leagues Army, and hearing how the forces were lessened about
that place, did not let sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>p the
occasion of going to take it; both these provisions were well warranted; for
<hi>Garrai</hi> getting into <hi>Valenza,</hi> whilst the enemies army looked
on, endeavour'd sollicitously to perfect the Fort <hi>S. Diego,</hi> which was
already begun upon the Banks of <hi>Poe,</hi> in the same place where the Fort
was much guarded the foot of the Bridge of <hi>Valenza,</hi> toward the
<hi>Lomellina,</hi> that upon the like occasions that place might be secured;
which Fort was soon perfected, or at least put into a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of convenient
defence; so as being assaulted by the <hi>French</hi> whilst they marched from
<hi>Bremi</hi> to <hi>Novara,</hi> it did not onely resist the assault, but two

Cavalier of the French, and of great expectation, and <hi>Gambacorta,</hi> who
went to <hi>Rottofreno,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the passes well block'd up, and fortified
by <hi>Villa,</hi> returned back, not doing any thing; yet the preservation of
that place being of great consequence, he was sent thither again with the same
Cavalry, accompanied with a good strength of Musketeers; and being come thither
he did not onely bring in the relief, but made the enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move just when the
Town was ready to surrender; which mean while notice being come to the Trench,
that the enemies Army was marched towards the territories of <hi>Novara;</hi>
the Governour being very careful of those parts which were wholly unprovided of
any Garrison, sent Don <hi>Martine d' Aragona</hi> and <hi>Lodovico Guasco</hi>
away with all speed, and with a good strength of men to mark what way the enemy
went, and to defend the Towns of those parts as well as they could from them;
and to the end that the enemy might not attempt passing over the
<hi>Tessino</hi> in the Barques which usually go thereupon, he gave order that
they should all be detained either in <hi>Pavia,</hi> or in the greater Lake,
from whence <hi>Tessino</hi> comes. The Governour continued (notwithstanding)
with the main Body of his Army at the Trench; except it were those who were
sent to <hi>Valenza</hi> when the enemy drew neer the Town, and who returning
were busied in keeping that pass block'd up from the Duke; the Duke was come
already to <hi>Nizza</hi> with the men that were allotted him; where he tarried
till he might see the Trench abandoned, that he might pass into his own
Dominions; whilst the Army of the League, being come into the Territories of
<hi>Novara,</hi> overran that Country, firing and laying all things waste where
they came, sacking some Towns, and bringing others under composition; and as it
went to <hi>Fontaneto,</hi> a Town not much fortified, but of much consequence
for entertaining Commerce with <hi>Vercelli</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the
Towns men who confided in the Castle which was there, made some resistance; but
being overcome on the fourth day, they were miserably sack'd, in revenge for
the death of Marshal <hi>Toras,</hi> who was unfortunately slain by one of the
first Musket-shot that was made out of that Town; a <pb n="587" facs="tcp:53250:301"/>
death unworthy so gallant a Commander, and which was very ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented, not
only by his friends, but by his enemies, for his singular va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and for the
gallantry of what he had done. <hi>Fontanero</hi> being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they talked of
going to <hi>Sandoval,</hi> or to before <hi>Novara;</hi> but a strange and
unexpected accident hapned, which made them think of greater things: six French
Souldiers, who according to the fashion of the Spanish Souldiers wore red
Scarffs, coming to the <hi>Tessino,</hi> feigned themselves to be Spanish
Souldiers; and seeing the Barque wherewith they cross the River, and which is
commonly called <hi>Porto,</hi> on the other shore, as he is called
<hi>Portenaro</hi> who guides it, they earnestly desired the <hi>Portenaro</hi>
that he would come and pass them over to the other side, offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him a good
reward for their waftage: the <hi>Portenaro</hi> thought them to be friends, by
the red Scarffs which they wore, and being too credulous and too greedy of
gain, went to the other side the River, and took them into his <hi>Porto,</hi>
who presently slew him; and passing over to the other side, they found the
Country abandoned by the Inhabitants, who by reason of the neerness of the
enemy were fled to the tops of Mountains; so they took some Cattel, and passing
with them over the River, they went and acquainted the Duke and the Marshal
with what they had done, and shew'd them how easie it was to pass over the
<hi>Tessino.</hi> The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise was very hopeful, and glorious beyond
expectation, and was not to be despised; and so much the rather, for that to
keep in the State of <hi>Novara,</hi> as they had done till now with little
advancement, made but little for their honour; wherefore that somewhat might be
done, they thought they were forc'd to embrace any whatsoever hard imployment,
and then much more this which was so easie, and which was so propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
presented to them by fortune; they were the more encouraged to this enterprise
by what little esteem was had of the enemies Forces; which keeping still within
the Trench, they thought they would not dare to encounter them, and that at the
present they would shun co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the open field, to keep from hazarding the
welfare of the State upon the uncertainty of a Battle; having therefore sent
some Horse over the <hi>Tessino,</hi> to discover the Country and the affairs
bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they tarried expecting their return; that they might the better ground
their resolutions; and finding by what they brought back, that they agreed, in
their relation, with what the others had said, they threw over the boats which
they had brought with them in Carts, and making a Bridge of them pass'd the
Army over to the other side; and staid some days waiting some happy occasion,
which this so fortunate accident might present unto them; the Bridge was thrown
over neer <hi>Casa della Camera;</hi> the first thing which they did after they
were passed was to break the <hi>Sprone</hi> (which is nothing else but the
keeping in of the <hi>Tessino</hi> with great stones, to the end, that the
water being thereby stop'd may rise into a channel, which they call <hi>ill
Naviglio,</hi> whereby they pass even to <hi>Millain,</hi> carrying and
re-carrying boats full of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion (from the Lake whence the <hi>Tessino</hi>
comes) to <hi>Millain,</hi> and which are necessary for the City, and for the
Inhabitants (who live upon the Lake) and to take away the water from the
<hi>Naviglio,</hi> that so they might streighten the City in point of
provision; and bereave it of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage it got thereby; they afterward
fortified themselves in <hi>Tornaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> 
               <pb n="588" facs="tcp:53250:302"/> a little
Town on the left bank of the <hi>Tessino,</hi> and extended their
Fortifications to the <hi>Brughera;</hi> which is nothing else but a Copse of
many miles about where nothing grows but brush-wood or low shrubs, which those
of <hi>Lombardy</hi> call <hi>Brughi;</hi> they tarried there some days

encounter (for <hi>Guasco</hi> was not yet come thither, and Don <hi>Martine d'
Aragona,</hi> being far short of them in numbers, who heard in <hi>Novara</hi>
that the enemies Army had passed over the <hi>Tessino,</hi> did also pass over
it himself a little lower, and was come to <hi>Bigarasso)</hi> they might march
safely to the Walls of <hi>Millain;</hi> when the enemies passage over the
<hi>Tessino</hi> was heard of, and that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of the Inhabitants
thereabouts were flock'd together, with their Wives, Children, and with what
else they had of most value, as to a place of refuge, the Citizens fell into
such terrour and confusion, as greater was never known in the memory of man, or
was ever read of in ancient Story. The City of <hi>Millain</hi> was bereft of
defendants, and as it were, exposed to be assaulted by the enemy, who was very
strong, neer at hand, and was hourly expected to appear before the City walls;
they saw the Governour and all the chief Officers stood idly, minding only the
keeping and defending of the Trench, and that they did not at all care for the
rest of the State, so as they might keep the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> from
passing over; that this was the chief thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all their thoughts were
bent, that they cared not though the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my burnt, plundered, and laid the
Country waste; they saw that the Army which had been raised at the peoples so
great expence, and which had suffer'd such hardship in their quarters all the
Winter, made no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all for their sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ety at this time of so neer danger; so as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple exclaimed in
the streets against the Spaniards, and against the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour himself; and
bewailing their miseries were neerer tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, then preparing to prevent
their imminent danger: many also thinking the City lost sent away what they
had, of most precious, into the State of <hi>Venice;</hi> so as the Gates of
the City were pester'd by those who believing in her safety ran thither with
what best things they had, and by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se who not confiding in her safety fled away with what they had of
most precious, and convey'd them into safer places; they were all the more
disturb'd by hearing that the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi> was fallen down by the
Valley of <hi>Sarsina</hi> into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and was come
neer <hi>Lecco,</hi> which if he should take, he might safely come to the City,
and joyning with the Confederates Army might put for mighty things; so as in
this great confusion, many of the chief Gentlemen had recourse to Don
<hi>Ranchillo,</hi> a Spaniard, and Chancellor of the State, who in the
Governors absence supplied his place, desiring that he would use his authority,
and that he would endeavour the peace and safety of the City: he had at the
same time received Letters from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour who was at the Trench, of the
same tenure; wherefore beating up Drums immediately, to raise as many Citizens
as he could, as well Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as others, he distributed them upon the Walls
and Gates in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places to defend them: he also took care for repairing
the walls and Gates, where it was most requisite, wherby, and by other
provisions, men began to be of better hopes; they were chiefly quieted by the
coming <pb n="589" facs="tcp:53250:302"/> of Prince <hi>Borsoda Este</hi> into the State
with 2500 Dutch, who sent them immediately towards <hi>Lecco</hi> to oppose the
violence which <hi>Rohan</hi> threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and to keep him as far from the City
as he could; but the confusion of the Confederates was not less then that of
the Millainois, when they found themselves in an enemies Country, which was
laid waste, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Inhabitants, and wherein the neighbouring Towns
not being able to furnish food, contribution nor quarters necessary for their
daily sustenance, they were forced, not without delay, difficulty and danger,
to have them from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and from the Continent of
<hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra;</hi> they therefore knew
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>at to keep there with so much
inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, was impossible; and that to go to <hi>Millain,</hi> as their so
happy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage did in honour bind them to do, was dangerous and difficult; for
if they should do so, they must necessarily, in the first place, abandon the
Bridge, which not being to be fortified, it was impossible to secure; and the
impossibility of securing it arose from the left side of the <hi>Tessino,</hi>
which being very high and commanded by many Hills, it was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as
impossible as necessary, to fortifie all those Hills, so as to secure the
Bridge from battery, and to fortifie them so, as that the one might be a help
to the other, and that they might all joyntly concur with that which guarded
the head of the Bridge; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise any one of those Hills being taken by
the enemy, and a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery being thereon placed, the Bridge must necessarily be
beaten down, the Army must be debar'd the River, being in an enemies Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
wanting the conveniency of retreating, and of those succours which they were
only to expect by the Bridge; being, moreover, exposed to be insulted over by
the enemy, who (it was to be supposed) would quickly come, and fall upon them,
to their ruine and undoing: to this was added, that they heard a flying rumour,
that the Governour hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they were pass'd over the <hi>Tessino</hi> was
already removed, and was already come with his Army very neer <hi>Millain;</hi>
so as if they should go thither, the Governour must either necessarily be got
before them with his Army into the City, or come upon them when they were
hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test in besieging it, or when they should have finished their Siege; in any
of which cases there appeared manifest ruine; for if he should come before they
were sat down before the City, it would be a rash and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long resolution, to
go to assault a great City well peopled, and that they should not be able to
continue the Siege, having an enemy Army upon their backs, and that in their
retreat, which would be necessary, they were likely to receive a great blow;
and that, say they should take the City, the Souldiers would assuredly fall to
plunder, and would not obey their Captains commands, but flying from their
colours, and running about the City without any Military Discipline, nothing
but ruine was to be expected; they therefore concluded, that their going to
<hi>Millain</hi> would afford the enemy an opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a signal
Victory: Yet the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> had much a do to keep the Marshal from
going thither. Who alleaged that the pressing over the <hi>Tessino</hi> had
alwayes been dreadful to that City, and was likely to prove so now more then
ever. That therefore it behoved them to make use of the occasion, and aspire
after the victory, which they could not fail of, if they would couragiously go
about it: That else <pb n="590" facs="tcp:53250:303"/> they had done better never to have
passed the <hi>Tessino,</hi> then after so happily past it, to do nothing. That
to make any doubt thereof, was nothing else then to abandon the occasion of
overcoming, and to shun victory: That the French Army had never past the
<hi>Tessino,</hi> but that the issue thereof had been the entire acquisition of
the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> Wherefore then should they now forbear, when the
Enemy, who were inferiour to them in Forces, and far more inferiour in Courage,
would never dare to shew their faces, nor hazard battle? When the people full
of confusion and fear, and moreover, very ill satisfied with the Spanish
Government, would joyn with the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>in
the ruine of so abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an Empire. But reasons to the contrary, and the
authority of supream command which resided in the Duke, prevailing over the
Marshals Allegations, and the having also heard for certain, that the Governour
was at last gone from the Trench, and was come neer the City; the Marshall was
forc'd to give way to the Dukes will, not without much murmuring: Not
proceeding therefore any further, and being forc'd to go from thence by Famine,
they resolved to go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Lake, and to take <hi>Sesto, Anghiera</hi> and
<hi>Arona,</hi> which were sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in the mouth thereof; which believing
they should take without any manner of difficulty, they thought to be thereby
masters of the whole Lake: Whereby they should command the onely passage which
the Spaniards had to bring men from <hi>Germany</hi> into the State of
<hi>Millain.</hi> And not being now able to bring in any by the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> that State would be a prey to the French Armies, when they
should assault it with greater Forces. The Duke therefore preferring the safety
and advantage of this proposal, before the airy and perillous enterprize of
<hi>Millain,</hi> made the Bridge be broken up, and ordered that the Army
should march towards the Lake; putting some of the Boats, whereof the Bridge
was made, into Carts; and drawing some against the current of the River, they
marched with their Army divided by the River; the Marshal with his French along
the left side, the Duke along the right side, with his Piedmontese. But the
Governour having, in this interim, heard of the Enemies being past over the
<hi>Tessino,</hi> by messengers sent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him from the City, &amp; of the
confusion of that City, the desolation of the State of <hi>Novarra,</hi> and of
the Towns on this side the River, he at last left the Trench; and sending
precise orders to all those that were either in the Country of
<hi>Tortona,</hi> or in the parts about <hi>Picenza,</hi> to follow him, he
past over the <hi>Poe</hi> and the <hi>Tessino,</hi> with Don <hi>Francisco di
Melo,</hi> and some others, and came to <hi>Pavio;</hi> and without entring
<hi>Millain,</hi> he went directly toward <hi>Biagrassa.</hi> He sent
<hi>Melo,</hi> notwithstanding, to <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> to be Governour of that
Castle, lest some disaster might happen in so great confusion. For fearing lest
the Enemy might approach the City, he thought fit to put a wise Governour
thereinto, and one of authority. <hi>Melo</hi> being come thither, was very
diligent in bringing Ammunition into the Castle by night, lest if it should
have been disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, it might have caused greater fear in the people: He also
armed 1200 Horse which were come a little before from <hi>Germany,</hi> and put
the much confused Affairs of the City into better Orders. The Horse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
armed, were presently sent to <hi>Biagrassa,</hi> and with them 13 Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
of Neapolitans; and those who were come from the French, <pb n="591" facs="tcp:53250:303"/>
and from the parts about <hi>Piacenza,</hi> past over the <hi>Poe</hi> and the
<hi>Gravalone,</hi> and went to joyn with the Governour, who in a short time
was able to muster 15000 Foot, and 5000 Horse. And whilst others were coming,
the Governour went with three Troops of Horse from <hi>Bigarassa</hi> to
<hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navento,</hi> the same day that the Enemy going from thence went
towards the Lake. The Marshall hearing this, who marched on that side the
River, and was not advanced full twelve miles, halted, and advised with the
Duke, and they both resolved to return back, and go to their former quarters of
<hi>Tornavento</hi> and <hi>Brughera;</hi> for it was very probable that those
who marched on this side with the Marshal might be defeated if they should be
pursued by the Enemy, being divided by the River from their associates: For the
River, which runs very swiftly from the Lakes mouth to <hi>Tornavento,</hi>
would not suffer them to throw over the Bridge there, that so they might joyn
their Forces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; nor did the same swiftness of the River permit that the
boats which were drawn against the Current could come time enough to peece with
the others, before the Enemy might come upon them. Whereas on the contrary, by
returning back, the Boats which were below, would anticipately come to the
former place; so as the Bridge being speedily put together, they might meet
with their joynt Forces, before they could be assaulted by the Enemy. This
Resolution was soon put on and executed; and about the going down of the day,
the Duke and the Marshal came both of them to <hi>Tornavento,</hi> the Duke on
that side, and the Marshal on this. The Marshals chief care was to fortifie
that place, and the Dukes, to cast over the Bridge speedily; a little below
<hi>Tornavento,</hi> where the Enemy might advance, there was a great ditch,
which had been formerly made by the French, when they were masters of the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> that they might bring the water of <hi>Tessino</hi>
thereby, and convey it elsewhere; which ditch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it proved to no
purpose, and had cost much money, was then, and is yet called
<hi>Panperduto,</hi> (which we may translate lost labour) the Marshal made use
of this ditch for a Trench and Parapet to his men. For intending onely to stand
upon defence, he had left Monsieur <hi>Di Boisac,</hi> Commissary of the Horse,
without, with 300 Horse, that he might flank <hi>Panperduto,</hi> and playing
upon the assailants on that side, might keep them from being assaulted. The
rest of his men he kept within the ditch, where on the Front, and on the left
side, they were sheltred by the same ditch; on the right side by the
<hi>Naviglio,</hi> and on the back by the <hi>Tessino</hi> and
<hi>Tornavento.</hi> Being thus securely seated, the Marshal stay'd expecting
the Governour, who being returned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Marshal from <hi>Tornavento</hi>
to <hi>Bigarassa,</hi> made his men advance to <hi>Constanzano,</hi> within
three miles of <hi>Tornavento,</hi> that he might gaul the Enemy on the back,
in case he should continue his march towards the Lake, and that he might fight
him if he should tarry by the way. The Governour came to <hi>Constanzano,</hi>
the same night that the Marshal was returned to <hi>Tornavento:</hi> And
notwithstanding that all those that were at the Trench, nor other that he
expected, were not yet come to him, and those that were already come were very
weary by their long and speedy march; yet placing his hopes of victory upon
coming before the Bridge should be perfected, which till it should be so kept,
the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies <pb n="592" facs="tcp:53250:304"/> Forces un-united, he was ready to go to
assault them; the rather for that two hours before day <hi>Gambacorta</hi> was
come to him with part of the horse wherunto he was driven, not so much out of
the danger which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay might occasion, by giving the enemy leasure to perfect
the Bridge, as for that his Army not being able to continue in the place where
they were, out of many reasons, but especially for want of water, he could not,
without much danger, and without loss of honour, retreat, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being so
neer; so as the choice was turn'd to necessity, and the peoples murmuring made
the necessity greater, who being subject to such charges, and to such trouble
in quartering, could not endure that the War should be spun out, without hopes
of ever seeing an end of their so many sorrows and calamities; he therefore
doubted that if he should delay fighting them now that they were so neer, the
people might go wild, and perhaps produce some bad effect; so as their
opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were not listned to who thought it rashness to go in the condition
they were in to assault an Army well munited within its Works, and which, when
the Bridge should be made, would become more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but the peoples crying
out for battle prevailed over these and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other considerations; and the
Governour inclining to give them satisfaction, gave order to fight; he had not
now above 10000 Foot in his Camp (for all the Foot were not yet arrived) and
between four and five thousand Horse, who by reason of the streight situation
were placed behind the Foot, in nine Squadrons; so as the Foot were to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo
the whole brunt of battle, without receiving any help from the Horse. Marquess
<hi>Spinola</hi> was by the Governours side, and Don <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisco di
Melo</hi> who was come that very night from the Castle of <hi>Millain,</hi> out
of the great desire he had to be present at this action: The conflict, or
rather the assault, began four hours after Sun-rising, on the second of
<hi>Iune,</hi> and endured till three of the night; so as they fought fifteen
hours without any intermission, and was continued by the assailants, with much
valour and constancie, though upon so many disadvantagious terms; the enemies
were very well shelter'd (as hath been said) on all sides, and yet the
assailants, who gave the assault with naked breasts, and in open field,
advanc'd so far, as they came to push of Pike, for all the hundred horse which
were left without by the Marshal; for though they turned at first to good
purpose, to keep the assailants aloof from the Trenches; yet the Governour
having sent <hi>Gambacorta</hi> against them with five hundred horse, and after
him another squadron of as many Curassiers, commanded by <hi>Augustine Fiesco,
Gambacorta</hi> fell furiously upon the Enemy, and drove them into a wood which
was behind them; whereinto when he with his men entered, they were furiously
played upon by musket shot from the Enemies Trench, whereby some of them were
slain, amongst which <hi>Gambacorta,</hi> who was shot through the body with
two Musket bullets; A death which was esteemed a great loss; he being a
gentleman of a stout heart, good at Counsel, and well vers'd in military
affairs, wherein he had given good proof of his valour: wherefore his death was
much resented by the whole camp; the horse which entred the wood with him,
their captain being slain, were forc'd to retreat, and were pursued by the
enemies horse, which (in this the others consternation,) had time to rally
themselves; <pb n="593" facs="tcp:53250:304"/> they chased them till they came to
<hi>Fiesco</hi>'s squadron, who did not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make head against them, but
forc'd the French back into the same wood; whence not daring to come forth any
more, the assailants, when that impediment was removed, had opportunity to
advance unto the Trenches; amidst all this toil and danger the heat was
excessive great, and there was no water thereabouts; so as the souldiers, hot
with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fighting, having no shade to shelter them from the Sun, which
shone then excessive hotly, nor water wherewith to quench their thirst, they
could no longer withstand the extream heat, which consumed them both within,
and without. Serjant Major <hi>Octaviano</hi> saw a Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mill somewhat far from
the place of fight, but well guarded by the enemy; he went thither with a good
many Musketeers, and driving the Defendants away, not without much contest, he
became master thereof, and opened unto the thirst-burnt Souldiers a large vein
of water, who as soon as they heard thereof forsook their ranks, and without
any respect ran confusedly in crouds to refresh themselves therewith; this
refreshment enabled the army to continue the fight more vigorously; and the
Governour hearing what refreshment the Army had received, ordered
<hi>Sauli</hi> to have a great care of that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not to abandon it
without particular order from him; but all this while the victory was far off,
the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made the Bridge, past over with his
fresh-men to this side the river, and brought very seasonable succour to the
French, who were ready to forsake the field; by whose coming though the defence
was much strengthned, yet did not the assailants fail to play their part, but
kept the field as before; and therefore though the Dukes arrival took from them
the glory of victory, yet was it not sufficient to make them losers; at last
that which the night could not do, the wearyness of the souldiers did, which
put an end to the assault three hours after Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set; the assailants departed in
good order, not losing one man in the retreat, being well back'd by the
Cavalry; but this was more then needed; for not any of the enemy (a thing
no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> often read of) came out of
their Trenches, to pursue them; their end being onely to keep their quarters,
they thought they had done enough to keep from being driven from thence; or
peradventure, the Gallantry shewed that day by the assailants made them keep
in; but because the place where the sight was was incapable of quarter, being
nothing but brush-wood, without water, save that of the Mill, without Trees,
without fortifications, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radge for the Horse, which had born armed men
all that day, without either food or rest, they were forced to go quarter at
<hi>Biagarassa,</hi> which was fifteen miles off; this business decided the
difference between the Duke and the Marshal touching going to <hi>Millain;</hi>
and the Army that was assaulted had the honour, though not the title of
victory, which was due to it by Military law, for having kept it's station; and
it would have carried away entirely the title of Victory, if the Duke of
<hi>Parma,</hi> who was the chief occasion and end of these conflicts, had made
use of the occasion of passing over the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rench at <hi>Tortona</hi> at the
same time when it was abandoned by the Governour, and had so past happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Dominions. This Prince, as you have heard, was sent from <hi>Bremi</hi> to
<hi>Nizza,</hi> with a convoy of three thousand Foot, and three 
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:53250:305"/> hundred Horse; to the end that the going of the
Consederates army towards the territories of <hi>Novara</hi> being likely to
draw the Governour, with his men, from defending the Trench, to defend these
parts, the Duke might make his way by that Trench, when it should be
abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pass securely into the Countrey of <hi>Piacenza.</hi> The
business suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded as it was designed, and better; for the Governour being
forced by the unexpected passage of the French over the <hi>Tessino,</hi>
hastily to forsake the French which he left guarded by <hi>Carlo della
Gatta,</hi> with onely five hundred foot, too small a number by much for the
large extent thereof, and the weather being then very dry, and the
<hi>Scrivia</hi> very shallow, it had been easie for the Duke to pass the
Trench, and come into his States; and if, as easily he might, he had done so,
what greater glory could the Confederates have won, then to have then put that
Prince happily and honourably into his Dominions; and that whereas to keep them
from doing so the Governour would force them to fight with so much
disadvantage, against the Trench of <hi>Tortona;</hi> they to effect it, by
better and more advised counsels had compelled him to abandon that Trench; nor
had their glory ended here; for they might moreover have boasted to have almost
totally freed the Dukes Dominions, and to have brought his Convoy safe into the
territories of <hi>Piacenza;</hi> which being joyned to the forces which were
there alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy might have defended that Prince from being injured by the
Spanish forces; which successes would assuredly have been glorious, and
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable, if the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> had co-operated to perfecting of the
common ends and Counsels; the reasons which hindred the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>
from doing so may be guest at by a letter which he writ to the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> in answer to one written to him by the said Duke, two days
before the conflict at <hi>Tornavento;</hi> wherein <hi>Parma</hi> was exhorted
to advance, and get into his Dominions by the Trench which the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had
abandoned; whereunto <hi>Parma</hi> answered the day after what had hapned at
<hi>Tornavento;</hi> that it was impossible for him to undertake that journey,
for want monyes; that moreover he wanted victuals, munition, and carriages to
convey his baggage, though it were but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle; and that it was impossible for
him, though he should make never so much diligence, to repair so many wants;
especially since he who was deputed to defray the expences had refused to pay a
small sum of money which he had desired; he also said that by the convoy which
was given him he had no power to command, nor to make the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers obey him;
so as he could not make use of them who were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very contumacious; for
though, at first, they seemed very willing to serve him, yet not long after
they had altered their minds at the instigation of others, who had suggested
unto them, that they should not be satisfied in their pay, when they should be
come into his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey; wherefore perceiving that ill blood began to be bred
amongst them, and that this malady began to spread abroad in the multitude, it
had so infected them, as many of them had run away that very night; and that
therefore he had given them leave to go unto the Camp, to the end that his
Majesties affairs might suffer no prejudice by their absence; and parting that
very night from <hi>Nizza</hi> with seven other horse, he went towards the Sea,
whither being come about break of day he hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <pb n="595" facs="tcp:53250:305"/> a little
Vessel at <hi>Voltri,</hi> and steering directly towards <hi>Lerici,</hi> and
passing incognito through the <hi>Luniggiana,</hi> he came unknown and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
unaccompanied into the same City from whence he departed ten moneths before, so
nobly attended by Lords and Souldiers, full of high and generous designs, like
one who had return'd from war in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; and yet when he was come home, he
seemed more distasted with his success, then sorry for what he had done.
Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> by reason of new advertisements which he had received,
was gone with the <hi>Piedmont</hi> Horse and Foot to <hi>Voghera,</hi> to
assist the Duke in passing over the Trench; but hearing that he was gone
towards the Sea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go by that way into his States, he resolved to
march to <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont</hi> whither he was sent for by the Duke of
<hi>Savoy:</hi> he therefore went from <hi>Voghera</hi> to <hi>Castel
nuovo</hi> upon the <hi>Scrivia,</hi> where refresh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Souldiers and his
Horses, he went strait towards the Trench which was not far from <hi>Castel
nuovo,</hi> and making a sufficient gap by Mattockes and Spades, he pass'd
through it, so neer <hi>Tortona</hi> as he was saluted by the Artillery, though
without prejudice; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Duke might know how glorious an action he had
let slip. Having once more pass'd through the Territories of
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> with like happy success as he had done before, the
Countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unfurnished of Souldiers, he came without any opposition to
<hi>Asti,</hi> and from thence to the Duke, who was still with the Marshal at
<hi>Tornavento,</hi> that they might not lose the glory which they had won by
making that place good against so fierce an assault; and as if they expected a
second assault, they seemed not at all to fear it, but stood fix'd, and
resolved to receive it; but not being re-assaulted, nor being able to tarry
there any longer with so many dis-accommodations, and being greatly molested
with abundance of Horse flies or Hornets, which the dead unburied carcases had
either drawn thither, or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, they resolved to remove from thence,
leaving these words wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a conspicuous place. 
<q> 
                  <l>
                     <hi>Quod non potuerunt Hispani, potuerunt Taffani.</hi>
                  </l> 
                  <l>What the Spaniards could not do,</l> 
                  <l>Hornets and Horse-flies did pursue.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And making their first march towards the Lake, when they were come
thither, they threw a Bridge over between <hi>Sesto</hi> and
<hi>Castel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letto,</hi> Towns which lie in the mouth thereof, intending to go
from thence to before <hi>Arona,</hi> and to take it; and thinking to make
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves first masters of <hi>Angiera,</hi> a Town which lies also upon the
Lake, over against <hi>Arona,</hi> they planted Batteries against it. The Count
<hi>Bolognino</hi> was entred <hi>Arona</hi> with a good Garrison, which would
have withstood the Siege a good while, if it had been attempted by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
but a new and unthought of necessity forced them to retreat and quit the
Country; for the Governour, after what had hapned at <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navento</hi> had
made up the Body of an Army neer <hi>Buffaloro,</hi> between
<hi>Bia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grassa</hi> and <hi>Tornavento;</hi> and having sent <hi>Melo</hi> back
to guard the Castle <pb n="596" facs="tcp:53250:306"/> of <hi>Millain,</hi> and
<hi>Bolognino</hi> with Forces into <hi>Arena,</hi> he threw two Bridges over
the <hi>Tessino,</hi> by which passing over that River, he gave out that he
would go to <hi>Romagnano,</hi> a Town on the left side of the <hi>Sesia,</hi>
where he might commodiously besiege the enemy, who were quarter'd in the mouth
of the Lake, and hinder their proceedings, and keep them from retreating; so as
they must ncessarily be consumed there, for want of meat; for that Country
being abandoned by the Country people, who were withdrawn to the Mountains, and
the Governour keeping in <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magnano,</hi> they could not be nourished by
the Country, nor receive vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals nor succour from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> nor from
the County of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> by reason of the craggy Hill which riseth from
<hi>Romagnano</hi> towards the Lake: on the side whereof there were only three
ways, which being guarded by reasonable Garrisons, excluded all passing from
<hi>Piedmont</hi> to the Lake: this evident danger being foreseen by the Duke,
and by the Marshal, they quickly gave over the enterprise and retreated; and
passing back over the <hi>Tessino,</hi> they got before hand into
<hi>Romagnano,</hi> where they fix'd their quarters, seeming as if they would
keep there; but the Governour being come to <hi>Carpignano,</hi> he
incommodated them there, and begirt them on sundry sides, and sent some men
into the Country of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> to hinder the bringing of provisions to
<hi>Romag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nano;</hi> wherefore they were forced to go from thence, and
abandoning the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> retreated into <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
being lessened both in Forces and Honour; insomuch as the rest of their Army
being dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded, most of the French retreated to <hi>Pinarvolo,</hi> and from
thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>France,</hi> and the Piedmonteses kept in
<hi>Piedmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Confederates Army being dissolved, the Governour betook
himself to drive out the French Garrisons, which kept yet fortified in some
parts of the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and sent several Commanders to recover
them. Don <hi>Martine d' Aragona</hi> recovered <hi>Fontaneto,</hi> in the
County of <hi>Novara,</hi> which was taken by the Confederates, and till now
kept with a stout Garrison. Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> recovered ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other
Towns in the same. <hi>Giuseppe Monpavone,</hi> Governour of
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> drove the French Garrison out of <hi>Annone;</hi> and it
being a place of consequence, he fortified it; and now there remained no Towns
in the hands of the French, except <hi>Bremi</hi> and <hi>Villata. Villata</hi>
was quickly slighted and abandoned by a small Garrison which was in it; so as
all the remainder of the French were in <hi>Bremi;</hi> which being a strong
Town, and well munited, the taking of it was put off to another time. The
Governour also shew'd some resentment against the Duke of <hi>Savoy; Lucio
Baccapianola,</hi> by his Orders, entred <hi>Gattinara,</hi> and without any
opposition took it, and sack'd it; and Don <hi>Philippo di Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va,</hi> who
succeeded Marquess <hi>Spinola</hi> in the place of General of the Horse,
entred the County of <hi>Asti</hi> with some Horse, and took <hi>Arazzo,
Montealto</hi> and <hi>Montegrosso;</hi> and some of the Garrisons of
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> made inroads into the enemies Country, burning and
sacking many of their Towns: which actions did gainsay those secret
intelligences which said, and more publickly the Marshal, that the Duke held
with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards; but greater resentments were plotted against the Duke of
<hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> who being come into his State was not idle; for though the
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Villa</hi> was gone from thence (as hath been said) and was
returned <pb n="597" facs="tcp:53250:306"/> to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and that consequently the
Duke wanted that assistance, yet overcoming all difficulties with his undaunted
spirit, and having yet some two or three thousand French with him, part whereof
were come with Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> part sent to him by the River of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> with permission from the Genoeses, and having added to these a
Body of his own Subjects, and some others that he had taken into pay, he once
more besieged <hi>Rottofreno</hi> at a distance; nor herewithall content he by
way of resenting Prince <hi>Doria</hi>'s attempts against <hi>Valdettaro,</hi>
sent to take St. <hi>Stephano,</hi> a Town belonging to the same Prince in Fee
from the Emperour, seated upon the Confines of the State of <hi>Genoa;</hi> and
passing over the <hi>Poe</hi> was entred into the State of <hi>Cremonia;</hi>
and doing much prejudice to the Towns of that Country, he pretended revenge for
the ruines occasioned in his Country by the Kings Souldiers; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the
Governour, being scandalized at these new attempts, and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> almost freed of the Confederates Forces, he sent some of his
men under Don <hi>Martine d' Aragona</hi> to prejudice that Duke, with order to
quarter in those States, and that without attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing against the
chief Cities he might over-run the Country, to the end, that the Duke being
mortified by such losses, and terrified by fear of greater, might learn to know
how unable he was to defend himself against the Kings incensed Forces. Don
<hi>Martine</hi> being entred into the State of <hi>Piacenza</hi> first, freed
<hi>Rottofreno</hi> from being besieged by the Dukes men, drove away the
assailants, and killing and taking many of them prisoners pursued them to
underneath the Walls of <hi>Pia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenza,</hi> he afterwards recovered the Castle
St. <hi>Stephano</hi> for Prince <hi>Doria,</hi> which was taken from him by
the Dukes men; and Cardinal <hi>Trivultio</hi> being entred at the same time,
by Orders from the Governour, with a Regiment of Dutch, into the States of
<hi>Cremona</hi> and <hi>Lodi,</hi> he drove out those that were placed there
in Garrison in some Towns that the Duke had taken but a little before in those
parts; then passing over the <hi>Poe,</hi> and joyning with <hi>l'
Aragona,</hi> he went to possess himself of the State cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Palavicino,</hi> by which acquisition all Commerce was almost inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
between <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza;</hi> many Towns of those Territories
were afterwards taken, and the Salt-pits were destroyed, which brought in a
great revenue; and the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> not able to keep the Field
against the Spaniards, retired to <hi>Piacenza</hi> where he was first besieged
at a distance, and closer afterwards: it is a thing verywell worth
obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to think how that Prince amidst so many adversities, and being so
neer utter ruine, did notwithstanding keep so close to his first resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and how he kept his first hopes, against all probability of not only obtaining
his pretensions, but even of being preserved from imminent ruine; for though he
had much reason not to doubt that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was his
onely hope, and who endeavoured now to get the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> to
adhere unto him, would suffer that the first and almost onely one of those
Princes, and who so freely and so couragiously had declared for him and his
Crown, would suffer that he should now upon that account be opprest and ruined;
making him thereby an example to others, how little they were, in the like
case, to relie upon the protection of that Crown; yet the Affairs of that King
were at that time reduced to so bad a condition, that they rather seemed 
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:53250:307"/> to need being assisted by others, then to assist others.
The Cardinal <hi>Infanta,</hi> going from the Confines of <hi>Flanders</hi>
with a gallant Army, was entred <hi>Picardy;</hi> and having taken <hi>La
Capella</hi> and <hi>Corbie,</hi> two principal places upon those Frontiers,
over-ran that Province victoriously; and burning, and sacking all before him,
he was advanced even to the Walls of <hi>Amiens,</hi> and S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
               <hi>Quintins.</hi> And the King not having Forces in readiness, to with-stand
so sudden, and so unexpected a storm, caused Men and Armes to be tumultuously
raised, for the defence of <hi>Paris</hi> it self; and by an Edict, which the
French in their Language call <hi>Arierban,</hi> which is as much as to say,
the last Call, (which the Kings of <hi>France</hi> never make use of, but in
extream necessity) he summoned all his Feudatories, and all his Nobility, to
assist in defence of the publick safety, which was then tottering. Nor was this
all the danger of that Kingdom; for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was forced to
rise from before <hi>Dole,</hi> a Town in <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gondy,</hi> whither he had
been sent a little before by the King with a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Army. For
<hi>Gallasso</hi> being assisted by people of the same County was entred
<hi>Burgondy</hi> with a strong Army; and over-running all the Towns thereof on
this side the <hi>Some,</hi> had taken <hi>Merabaule,</hi> and was come to
before St. <hi>Iean di Beaulme,</hi> a Town standing upon the <hi>Some,</hi>
between <hi>Verdune</hi> and <hi>Shalloune.</hi> Nor was this Kingdom in less
danger on the parts towards <hi>Spain;</hi> whither the King having sent a
powerful Army, commanded by the same Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> wherein were
many Signieurs of <hi>France</hi> that served to assault <hi>Spain</hi> on that
side; and the Prince being encamped before <hi>Fonterabie,</hi> a frontier Town
of <hi>Spain</hi> over against <hi>Gascony,</hi> he had reduced it to great
extremity, not without much danger to <hi>Spain,</hi> if it had faln into the
hands of the French, as necessarily it must have done, had not the Admiral of
<hi>Castille</hi> come from <hi>Spain</hi> with 10000 Foot, and 1500 Horse,
which passing over the Pirenean Mountains, came unexpectedly to before
<hi>Fonterabie,</hi> just as it was upon Articles of surrender, and freed it
luckily; for at the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals appearing, the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> raised
the siege, and the Admiral taking St. <hi>Iohn di Luz,</hi> and besieging
<hi>Bayonne,</hi> over-ran <hi>Guascony,</hi> plundering and bringing the parts
thereabouts into composition; how could the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> expect or
fancy unto himself any assistance from the King of <hi>France,</hi> whilst his
own Kingdom was so full of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and assaulted on so many sides? and which
was worse for him, the French were almost gone all out of <hi>Italy,</hi> and
the Spaniards were increased in numbers and reputation, and left untroubled by
that League which was intended for their ruine. He saw apparently that could
not be diverted from prejudicing him; nay, the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>
having heard that some few French, who were yet in <hi>Cassalle,</hi> were
ready to pass over to <hi>Piacenza</hi> in boats, when they should see the
<hi>Poe</hi> swolne with water, had ordered that a Steccado should be made over
that River neer <hi>Valenza,</hi> to withstand those Forces, and had a good
Garrison to be placed there to oppose those boats, and all others who should go
upon that River: And the Governour had given order to Cardinal
<hi>Trivultio,</hi> to have an eye to those parts; who fearing lest some
Mantuans, and some of the State of <hi>Venice,</hi> not being able to enter the
nearest way into the Dukes States, might by way of diversion assault the State
of <hi>Cremona,</hi> or of <hi>Lodi,</hi> he went first with the men that 
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:53250:307"/> were assigned him to the frontiers of those Counties, to
defend them from any incursion; so as that Prince was excluded from any succour
on every side. There was onely one loop-hole left open, from which he might
hope for safety amidst these so many streights; which was the King of
<hi>France</hi> his Fleet, at that time come into the Ligustick Sea, as shall
be said in its proper place. But to boot with the hindrance (as shall be said)
which the Spanish Gallies gave to the landing of the French Fleet, keeping it
from landing its men; the Governour who was himself with part of his Army in
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> stood ready to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose any who should land in relief of
the Duke, or to prejudice the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> This was the condition
of this Dukes Affairs; and to fill up all his misfortunes, the Emperour after
having taken the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> off from the Protestant League, and
brought him by the peace of <hi>Prague</hi> to side with him, he had also at
this very time compass'd his fervent desire of seeing his Son, the King of
<hi>Hungary,</hi> Elected King of the Romans; an Election which had suffered
great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, by those who desirous to abase the Austrian name, used all
the means they could to keep him from it; the which being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the
dexterity and several negotiations of the Spanish Agents in that Court, and
particularly by <hi>Count d' Ognate,</hi> it was happily atchieved about
Christmass, the year 1636. In which Election, the Marquess of
<hi>Castagneda,</hi> who was Embassadour from <hi>Spain</hi> with the same King
of <hi>Hungary,</hi> upon whom the Election fell, did very much co-operate.
True it is that the success of the Austrian Forces at this time did very much
facilitate this choice; which having shut up the Swedes in the furthest corner
of <hi>Pomerania,</hi> and were neer driving them out of <hi>Germany,</hi>
obliged some of the Electors, though contrary to their wills, to permit that
the Imperial Diadem should be continued in the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> the
peace and union of the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and this Coronation, and the
late victories, did doubtlesly redound much to the greatness and security of
the Austrian name: so as the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi> might see how prosperously
the Austrians whom he had abandoned, proceeded; and on the contrary, how the
d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>vo-King of <hi>France</hi> his
affairs, which he had so readily and with so much tion embraced, how much, I
say, they had miscarried, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently he might easily perceive to what
condition his affairs were brought; and that to stand pertinaciously to these
designs was nothing else but to fight against heaven, and to run head-long into
ruine; he might also know that the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> were not well
pleased with this new fire which he had kindled in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Pope, in consideration of the Sovereignty which the Apostolick
See hath over the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Dominions, feared that they might be
possess'd by the Spaniards; and was angry that the Duke who was his Feudatory
should so obstinately subject himself to so many evils; wherefore not only he,
but the great Duke, whose Sister was Wife to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi>
interceded for him to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Agents, to be more
reserved in their resentments, desiring them to pardon somewhat, in respect of
the merits of the former Dukes of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> much in respect of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

by <pb n="600" facs="tcp:53250:308"/> fair means, sometimes by foul, that he would foresee
and know his danger, and the like of the common affairs; they prevailed more
with the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his Agents, then with the Duke. The King
seemed willing to pass by so many offences, and to restore his Territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
free and entire to the Duke, as they were before he had used any hostility,
without lessening his former authority or liberty; but all this was nothing;
for the Dukes devotion to the King of <hi>France</hi> was such, and had so
bewitched him, as he was no more himself; so as not knowing how to forsake this
earthly deity, by whom he hoped to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an earthly Paradise, he seemed to
rejoyce in becoming a Martyr, and in sacrificing his State and Fortune in
maintenance of his Faith and Devotion towards that Deity whom he had once
adored, and to whom he had wholly dedicated himself; wherefore the losses he
had suffer'd, the dangers he had run, and those which did still threaten him,
nor the afflictions of his people, (who desirous to rid themselves of so many
sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows desired he would incline to peace;) nor any fair conditions that could
be offer'd him, could do no good upon him; nor did they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear adequate
remedies to mitigate his mind, but rather made him the more refractory. The
Governour not being able any longer to endure so much obdurancy justified the
Kings intentions to these Princes, which was not to oppress this Prince, but to
reduce him and all <hi>Italy</hi> to quiet; and resolved at last to alter his
way of proceeding; and to proceed with more severity since he saw fair means
could do no good; he therefore gave order to Cardinal <hi>Trivultio</hi> to
besiege <hi>Piacenza</hi> yet closer, and sent Colonel <hi>Gill di Hays</hi> to
him, a valiant and understanding Souldier, who by order from the Cardinal
assaulted <hi>Rivalta,</hi> and took it within five days; there were in it 400
Foot, whereof 50 French, who went all free out, and the French were sent with a
sufficient convoy into <hi>France.</hi> The Cardinal designing afterwards to
take the Island which is incompassed by the <hi>Poe,</hi> over against
<hi>Piacenza,</hi> sent Serjeant Major <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taviano Sauli</hi> to take it;
who going first to discover it, with the Engineer <hi>Prestino,</hi> drew
afterward neer it with his men; who being got into the Island they first
repuls'd five barques loaded with Souldiers which were sent from
<hi>Piacenza,</hi> as soon as the enemies design was known, to prepossess the
Island; he also fortified the bank which was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to <hi>Piacenza,</hi>
and built a Fort in the midst of the Island, whereby he became master of it,
and began to streighten the City; and at the same time the Cardinal and
Marquess <hi>Antonio Pietro Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nato,</hi> who was General of the Artillery, did
much molest the City with their Artillery; affairs continued thus for above a
moneth; in which time the Cardinal sent Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> to take
several Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in the territories of <hi>Parma,</hi> and <hi>Gill di
Hays,</hi> to take others in those of <hi>Piacenza;</hi> by the taking whereof
the Cities of <hi>Parma</hi> and <hi>Piacenza</hi> being more streightned were
quite excluded all communication; at last the Duke seeing the Mills neer the
City beaten down by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Artillery, the State almost wholly possess'd
by the enemy, all Commerce kept from the City of <hi>Parma,</hi> himself and
his Wise so streightly besieged in <hi>Piacenza,</hi> as the scarcity of
victuals was so great in that City, that wanting meat even himself to eat, he
held it for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary present to receive every week a Calf from
<hi>Ottaviano Sauli,</hi> 
               <pb n="601" facs="tcp:53250:308"/> which was duly sent him by
order from the Governour, and which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing safely kept was all the flesh he had
for his own Table for the whole week; finding himself therefore, I say, thus
streightned, and having no hope of succour, he foresaw he should be reduced to
utmost extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, if he should not yield to these so terrible tempests;
wherefore he began to listen to conditions of Agreement, which were still kept
on foot in <hi>Millain</hi> for all the fighting and batteries, by Count
<hi>Carpegna</hi> in the Popes name, and in the name of the great Duke, by his
Secretrary <hi>Dominico Pandolphino;</hi> nor was the agreement hard to be
made; for the Spanish Agents being desirous to have an end of all this trouble,
accept of any conditions: when therefore it was known that the Duke would
parley, all hostility was suspended, and an agreement was quickly made between
Don <hi>Francisco di Melo,</hi> Embassadour plenipotentiary from the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> to the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> and Secretary
<hi>Pandolphino.</hi> The Articles were approved by the Governour, and by the
Duke; but were never published but by what was comprehended by the sequele, and
by what was commonly said, they were; that the Duke returning to the King of
<hi>Spains</hi> devotion should enjoy the same, nay greater ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours under the
protection of the King <hi>Spain,</hi> then formerly; that he should renounce
any League made with any other Prince, against the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi>
that he should dismiss all the French, with a Pass<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that should be given
them by the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> whereby they might safely pass into
<hi>France,</hi> and that in lieu of them the Duke should have a Garrison of
Italians, Dutch or Swissers, such as the King should confide in: That the
Governour should withdraw all his men into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
quitting all Towns that were taken; and leaving them in the same condition they
were in before the War; all which Articles were fully performed on both
sides.</p>
            <p>This Peace, as also the precedent War, afforded diversity of
Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Many praised the Kings moderation and magnanimity, even to the
skies, who being so highly offended by so inferiour a Prince, had
notwithstanding suffer'd it, with a Princely Grandezza, and had considered
t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>merits of the offenders
ancestors, and the youthful spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the delinquent, against whom he had made
war more by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, then free will; but with such moderation as by the
manner both of taking up Arms, and of laying them down, it was evidently seen,
that the King never intended to suppress this Prince, but only that by making
him lay down his fierceness he might receive him into his protection, and make
him capable of all honours and favours that he could expect from his Majesty;
that therefore the Kings Forces had fought rather to subdue the Prince his
obstinacy, then his Towns; and rather to win his good will, then his Dominions;
many, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, detracting from the praise of so singular an action,
attributed all that had been done neither to the worth, nor to any good
intention in the King, but to meer necessity which had forced him to do so; for
to have resented himself against this Prince, to the oppressing his
Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, and possessing himself of his Dominions, though perhaps he might
easily have done it in this present conjuncture of times; yet to keep them
would be a very hard business, and apt to cause immortal wars; so as after
having been at much expence in getting them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <pb n="602" facs="tcp:53250:309"/>
having been troubled with war to keep them, all would end in a necessary
restitution; that herein the States appertaining to the See of <hi>Rome</hi>
were concerned, which would never sit down by so great a loss; that the great
Duke of <hi>Tuscany</hi> was herein concern'd, a Prince so well affected to the
Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> and who had merited so well thereof; and whose
friendship was now of great concernment thereunto; that the Duke of
<hi>Parma</hi>'s wife who was niece to the Emperour was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned herein, so
as what reason had he to distaste the great Duke in a thing which so neerly
concern'd him, in his sisters behalf, and by aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to give occasion
to him who could not sit down by the ruine of his sister, and brother in law,
to fall upon new resolves by way of resentment; was the condition of affairs
such as this time, as that it made for the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> to alienate
a Prince who was most sincerely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to the interest thereof? that what
was yet of greater importance, the satisfaction, and safety of all the Princes
of <hi>Italy,</hi> was herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; who thinking so great an increase of
the Spaniards power in <hi>Italy</hi> was a decrease of their own Empire and
Liberty, would have turn'd the whole world upside down, rather then suffer
those States to be joyn'd to that of <hi>Millian;</hi> to what purpose was it
then to destroy a Prince, whose destruction would occasion war to succeed war,
hatred to succeed hatred, enmity to succeed enmity, to the so much prejudice of
the destroyer? that there was fresh example, what wars, troubles and dangers,
the taking away of the <hi>Palatinate</hi> from it's natural Prince had
occasioned, and did still occasion to the Emperour, and to the House of
<hi>Austria;</hi> that the Examples of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and Duke of
<hi>Mantua</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> were yet more evident; thus they, by these
arguments, and examples, concluded that necessity was turned to vertue in the
King of <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Duke was the subject of no less various discourse; some
prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, others dispraised the generosity of his mind, which could not submit
to the injuries and oppressions of the Spaniards, but had dared to oppose their
insolencies; that he had given a singular example of a free spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a
Free Prince; and had taught the Spaniards, who had wont to insult over the
Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> how they ought to esteem them, how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfully
they ought to proceed with them, and what the greater and more powerful
Potentates can do, when the lesser can make such noise; that the reason why he
had not compassed the chief end of his high and generous pretences, was not out
of any fault of his, but of others; it being apparent, that if they had
proceeded effectually before <hi>Valenza, Italy</hi> would never have seen a
more illustrious day for her liberty, then that wherein he went out armed from
his Dominions, when fighting the Spaniard at <hi>Ponte Carone,</hi> he had the
better of them, and slew their Captain, who led them on so proudly against him;
that success cannot detract from the glory of enterprises, especially when
their miscarriage proceeds from casual accidents; that howsoever, amidst so
many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities he had made the Spaniards see that a great part of their
losses, and dangers, had proceeded from his alienation; that the
<hi>Pavian,</hi> and <hi>Novarese</hi> Towns, the Cities of <hi>Millain,</hi>
and <hi>Pavia,</hi> together with their territories, had doubtlesly suffered
more prejudice upon his account, then the parts about <hi>Parma,</hi> and
<hi>Piacenza;</hi> and that <hi>Millain,</hi> and <hi>Pavia</hi> 
               <pb n="603" facs="tcp:53250:309"/> had been as neer being lost as <hi>Piacenza</hi> and
<hi>Parma;</hi> that therefore the Potentates of <hi>Italy</hi> were always to
acknowledge the lessening of the Spanish pretensions, the moderation, and
respect, which shall hereafter be used towards them, the esteem which shall be
had of them, and their liberty, from this Prince; others, on the contrary,
ascribed the actions of this Prince neither to worth nor generosity, but to
madness of youth; for beginning at their beginning, and continuing to the end
of the Tragedy, they said, that without any just occasion given, he had
swer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the footsteps of his forefathers; who having placed the sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
foundation of their Principality upon Friendship with <hi>Spain,</hi> had never
reason to repent it; what reason then had this Prince to doubt the favour and
protection of that Crown, if he had continued to follow his Predecessors
foot-steps? but that from his Infancy he had aspiring thoughts, and greater
pretentions then became his condition; that he seemed to undervalue the
Friendship of <hi>Spain;</hi> and that by inclining more to that of
<hi>France</hi> he had begot no little distrust of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which
caused the Spaniards to conceive ill of him, and to spy into his ways; whereby
discovering his aversion, he had given them occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to complain thereof, and
sometimes to break forth into words of just resentment; which might have served
to admonish him; but he esteeming this medicine poyson had broken out upon
small occasion; nay indeed upon none at all, if he would consider things
justly; chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the question was touching a Prince so inferiour in force
and power to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and when greater things had been past
by, by greater Princes, and wink'd at, to keep them from disturbing the publike
peace; how many distastes had Duke <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> suffered before he
broke with <hi>Spain;</hi> nor did he ever come to any breach till his own
Dominions were assaulted by the Spaniards; so as he may ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be said to have
taken up arms in his own defence, then against the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> how
many injuries have the <hi>Venetians</hi> past by, nay how many the Popes
themselves, not to mention other Princes? how many dislikes have been wink'd at
between the two Crowns of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and between them
and other Princes; that great Princes do sometimes use acts of superiority and
Seigniorie towards lesser Princes, and the lesser have been known to think it
wisdom to suffer them; nor do greater Princes use always to look big upon
lesser, but to proceed moderately with them; generously pardoning the defects
and failing of lesser Princes committed against them, without so much as taking
any notice thereof otherwise the world would be turn'd upside down, if arms
were to be taken up upon every small offence; that this is kept for the last
refuge of an assaulted, or tottering State; not to offend or provoke one that
is more powerful; not to vent hatred upon the weaker, or to secure suspition;
that then there being no occasion of a breach, it must necessarily be
concluded, that either fear of being opprest by the Spanish forces, or hopes of
getting either the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> or part of it, by adhering to
<hi>France,</hi> or a desire to put <hi>Italy</hi> into her former liberty, by
driving out the Spaniards, had thrust him upon this novelty; as for fear, it
was said, that being strengthned by the so many merits of his predecessours, he
could not possibly dread those forces which had been such a prop and defence to
other Princes of <pb n="604" facs="tcp:53250:310"/> 
               <hi>Italy,</hi> that had not deserved
so well of the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> that <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> the Cardinal,
and after Duke of <hi>Mantua,</hi> might serve to witness this, who having
given more manifest signs of alienation from that Crown, both in <hi>Rome</hi>
and elsewhere, then <hi>Parma</hi> had before the breach; yet when he succeeded
his Brother in the Principality, contrary to the expectation of all men, nay of
himself, he was received into the Protection of the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi>
and effectually defended by the Forces thereof, against the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> who was joyn'd in alliance and interest to that King; and yet
this <hi>Ferdinando</hi> was not munited by the merits of his predecessors; nay
his Father was sorely suspected to have conspired against the Crown of
<hi>Spain;</hi> and as fear appeared not a sufficient occasion to justifie this
commotion, so had he less reason to be induced thereunto by hope; for not to
say, that the aggrandizing of ones self is no just reason to make war; he who
shall balance these hopes justly will find them not to be well placed, but that
they were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rail, and
unconsiderable. The French pretend that the State of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> doth by
ancient right belong unto their Crown; and therefore is unalienable either in
part or in whole; and they have spent more blood and moneys to get it then it
is worth; and will any one then believe that if the French should get it, they
would give it him, or divide it with him? especially since he concur'd to the
getting thereof with so small Forces; and if reason did not convince him in
this, former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples might have excluded him from all hopes thereof.
<hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> won that State, assisted by the Venetian
Forces, and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with them expresly for the City and County of
<hi>Cremona,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with whole <hi>Giaradada;</hi> but as soon as he
atchieved his intent, he re-demanded of the Commonwealth all that by the said
Covenants was due unto her; and this not under any other pretence, but for that
it being a State appertaining to the Crown, it could not be dismembred from it;
and as for the so specious pretences of the Liberty of <hi>Italy,</hi> which
never moved the greater Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> how could they ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
fall into the conceit of this Prince; who being none of the chiefest amongst
them, neither for Forces, Wisdom nor Experience in wordly Affairs, might learn
by their proceedings, that though they were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times perhaps incited by
greater provocations of more absolute liberty; yet they have always temporized,
lest being freed for the present they might be afterwards forc'd to yield to
worser conditions; and being content with having brought <hi>Italy</hi> now to
a greater equality, studied how to preserve her in it: these were the
considerations which were commonly had upon these occurrences, which as we
leave undecided, so will we leave them free to be approved or disapproved, as
every one shall think fit.</p>
            <p>And now to return to our discourse, a little before this very
time, when the Duke of <hi>Parma</hi>'s Dominions were by this peace freed from
war, <hi>Donna Anna Caraffa,</hi> the only Daughter and Heir to the Prince of
<hi>Stigliano,</hi> a chief Lady in the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> was married
to the Duke <hi>de Medina dellas Torres,</hi> a chief Lord of the Family of
<hi>Gus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and one of the Grandees of <hi>Spain,</hi> and who lately
succeeded Count <hi>Moanterey</hi> in the Vice-royalty of the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples;</hi> from which marriage a Son was soon born, to whom together with
the large <pb n="605" facs="tcp:53250:310"/> patrimony in that Kingdom belonging to the
Mother the Patronage of <hi>Sabioneta</hi> did belong, as being descended from
a Sister of <hi>Vespatian Gonzaga,</hi> married to the Grand-father of
<hi>Donna Anna;</hi> this place, by reason of its strong situation, is almost
impregnable, seated in the State of <hi>Cremona,</hi> towards the Dukedom of
<hi>Mantua;</hi> and therefore of great consequence, not only for the City of
<hi>Cremona,</hi> but even for the whole State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and
whereupon the Spaniards had fix'd their eyes long before, being very desirous
to be masters of it. The Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> who did not love that the
Spaniards should get this place, were very jealous of this their desire; and
the Spaniards never having been able to get footing there, though that Lady, as
also her Father, both by birth and marriage, were Subjects to the Crown of
<hi>Spain;</hi> yet they obtain'd their ends in these times without any
violence, or just occasion of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to the Princes of <hi>Italy;</hi> for
the aforesaid marriage, and the birth of this Son, Heir, and Successor to that
place, made way for them to get that which they valued so much, and so much
desired; but this place being for some respects assigned over to the Duke of
<hi>Ranusco,</hi> and that assignment was now descended to the now Duke of
<hi>Parma,</hi> who was his Heir and who succeeded him; therefore the Duke of
<hi>Medina</hi> and his Wife, in their own names, and in the name of their Son,
sent to Don <hi>Francisco di Melo</hi> to recover the deposited place.
<hi>Melo</hi> went to <hi>Parma,</hi> where that Duke not being able openly to
refuse restitution, he demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon the expences of the Garrison which had
been kept there during the time of depositure, which he said came to 300000
ducats; and <hi>Melo</hi> being unwilling that the business should be retarded
for point of moneys, the sum of 300000 ducats being reduced to 200000, the Duke
was contented to assign the place over to him, and the Italian Garrison
marching out, a Spanish Garrison was put into it, to the great satisfaction of
the Spanish Agents: but this was not done before the Castle of
<hi>Rossenna</hi> was restored to the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from him by the Duke of <hi>Modena,</hi> as hath been said, when he first moved
against the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi> with which restitution the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
between those two Princes were adjusted; it was generally thought that the Duke
of <hi>Parma</hi> did so easily part with this, to revenge himself of the
Venetians, with whom he was much unsatisfied, because they had never lent him
any the least assistance in the present war, but had suffer'd him to submit to
the Spanish Forces; knowing very well how much the Venetians would be troubled
at the Spaniards having of that place; but though the Duke was not assisted by
the Venetians, or by his Brother in Law, the great Duke, with Arms; yet could
he not deny but that he was favoured by them both, by their powerful
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that his Dominions might not be taken from him, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
prevailed more with the Spaniards; and it is certain, that these two Potentates
were ascertained by the Spaniards, that they made not this war to oppress him,
but to extinguish that fire in him which was not ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>sing to these two Potentates, nor to the other Princes
of <hi>Italy,</hi> in respect of the common concernment: wherefore having,
without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising with them, and contrary to their liking and minds, continued
his commotion, they had no reason by assisting him, to be drawn into a war
which they foresaw would be pernicious, to their particular, and 
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:53250:311"/> to the common interest; and which would make
<hi>Spain</hi> their enemy, and keep them from using their best endeavours in
that Court for his service.</p>
            <p>The Governour being rid of the business of <hi>Parma,</hi> which
as a stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block had been a great hinderance to the proceedings of the
Kings affairs, applied himself to re-gain the <hi>Langhe;</hi> which are little
Castles held in see of the Emperour by several Lords, situated in the Mountains
of <hi>Liguria,</hi> confining partly upon the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Commonwealth of <hi>Venice,</hi> partly upon
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferrat;</hi> and at the present garrisoned,
partly by the French, partly by the Piedmonteses. The Governours Forces were at
this time en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased by men come from <hi>Spain, Naples</hi> and
<hi>Germany;</hi> and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected others from the Swissers, which made him
betake himself the rather to this business: it was not long since the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> being desirous to defend himself in those parts, had taken the
County of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesino,</hi> seated on the back of <hi>Savona,</hi> wherein
was a Castle called <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio,</hi> very strongly seated, and very convenient
for passage by Sea; and which standing in the midst between the Marquisate of
<hi>Finale</hi> and the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> was very proper for the
preservation of that Marqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sate; the possession of this place caused much
jealousie in the Spaniards, who were desirous to open a passage by
<hi>Finale</hi> for the men which for the future they intended to land there;
and also because, when <hi>Finale</hi> should be assaulted, it was not to be
succoured by the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> but through that County. The
Governour was therefore forced to clear those parts from the enemies Garrisons:
to effect the which, he began with the Town and Castle of <hi>Ponsone;</hi>
whether under the conduct of <hi>Emilio Gliglino,</hi> he sent a body of men,
part Spaniards, part Italians, part Dutch; who coming within sight of the Town
took it without any opposition. For the Garrison which were French, at the
first appearing of the Enemy abandoned it, and retreated to the Castle; to the
taking whereof, Artillery, and greater store of forces being required, Don
<hi>Martind' Aragona</hi> was sent thither with more men, and with Artillery,
which being planted against the Castle, and the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants hearing no news of
any relief, it was within a few dayes surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. At the same time <hi>Gill de
Hays,</hi> boasting that he could surprize <hi>Nizza,</hi> he was sent thither
by the Governour from the City of <hi>Alessan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> with three Regiments
of Foot, and two of Horse; who parting two hours before Sun-set was to have
been that night at <hi>Nizza,</hi> which was not above twelve miles off: But
not coming thither till two hours after the Sun was up, and therefore not able
to take it by surprize he possess'd himself of the Convent of Capuchins, where
he fortified him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; the Governour thought himself ingaged in that
enterprize; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he quitted <hi>Cengio</hi> in the <hi>Langhe,</hi> that
he might not leave the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of <hi>Nizza</hi> unperfected; he therefore
went thither himself in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with all his Forces, and having opened Trenches
on severall sides, even almost to the ditch, a Parly was heard beaten on that
side, where Serj ant Major <hi>Ottavino Sauli</hi> was advanced further then
the rest with Marqness <hi>Cosmo Richardi</hi> his Brigade; who entring the
Town, and Hostages being given on all sides, the Town was soon surrendred. This
business being over, the Governour sent presently some Brigades 
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:53250:311"/> to take in <hi>Aiano,</hi> a strong Town in the County
of <hi>Asti,</hi> where it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines upon <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and therefore of
great consequence for getting into <hi>Piedmont.</hi> To which expedition, the
Camp-master General, <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippo di Silva,</hi> was deputed; who in his
passage took a Town called <hi>Costigliole,</hi> neer <hi>Aiano;</hi> and
finding there great store of Corn and Wine, he sent <hi>Ottaviano Sauli</hi> to
possess himself of <hi>Montegrosso,</hi> a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Town also, seated upon
a Hill well peopled, having a strong Mannor-house which serves for a Castle;
whose Defendants standing upon their defence, and having stoutly resisted
<hi>Sauli</hi>'s assaults, were at the third assault overcome, and many of them
slain; and the Castle after obstinate opposition was also taken. Then they went
with all their Forces to <hi>Aiano,</hi> which stands upon the rise of a Hill,
and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all the plain about it: <hi>Silva</hi> not thinking that he
needed any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, failed in his supposal, being forced to keep five dayes
before it till the Artillery was brought, where with he made two batteries; and
having plaid a while upon the Town, he took it upon good conditions; which when
he had done, he re-inforced it with new works, and put a strong Garrison into
it. The Governour went from <hi>Nizza</hi> to <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none;</hi> and passing
over the <hi>Tanaro,</hi> upon a Bridge which was thrown over at <hi>Croce
Bianca,</hi> he thought to attempt the taking of <hi>Asti</hi> by assault; but
Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> being come thither, with about 4000 Foot, he forbore
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>attempt. But considering of
what importance the Castle of <hi>Araz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo</hi> was for the safety of
<hi>Aiano</hi> and <hi>Annone,</hi> he sent some to take it, and to fortifie
it, and put a good Garrison into it. From thence he past over the <hi>Poe</hi>
to <hi>Valenza,</hi> resolving to quarter in the Canavese, that he might vex
the Duke on that side: And being come thither, he quartered his men in
<hi>Pertegno, Assigliano, Riva, Costanzo, Carenzana,</hi> and <hi>Desana;</hi>
and hearing that the Duke and the Marshal, who had past over the <hi>Poe</hi>
at <hi>Pontestura,</hi> were come with all their Forces to <hi>Morano,</hi> a
commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Town for neighbourhood of the <hi>Poe,</hi> and strong by reason of
the moorish ground about it, he used all the art he could to draw them out of
those plashes; and to this end sent to take <hi>Balzola,</hi> a Town equally
distant from either of the Armies: which being taken, the Duke endeavoured to
recover it by might; but failing thereof, he began to fortifie the parts about
it, that he might besiege it; but the Town being soon relieved, he was forc'd
to return to <hi>Morano,</hi> from whence the Governour could never draw him
out to battle; and the Governour not being able to keep long there for scarcity
of Forradge, and finding that the Duke was resolved not to stir out of those
miry places, he returned to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanza,</hi> where he stayed some dayes
without doing or receiving mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station; except that having sent Don
<hi>Martino</hi> to discover <hi>Bremi</hi> and <hi>Vercelli,</hi> he was met
by Marquess <hi>Villa;</hi> who was come with some Forces from
<hi>Vercelli,</hi> with whom he skirmished, and <hi>Villa</hi> worsted him.
Many were slain on the <hi>Aragon</hi>'s side, amongst which Camp-master
<hi>Boccapianola,</hi> and <hi>Spadino</hi> a Captain of Horse, and <hi>Antonio

                  </gap>,</hi> with seven other Horse
Captains, were taken Prisoners and sorely wounded. The Governour heating
afterwards that <hi>Count Verrua</hi> was gon with a body of men to <hi>Rocca
d' Arazzo,</hi> he resolved to go to the relief thereof with his whole Army: He
therefore sent for recruits from <hi>Alessandria;</hi> wherefore <hi>Count
Galleazzo Trotti</hi> came from thence, <pb n="608" facs="tcp:53250:312"/> and wading
thorough the <hi>Tanaro</hi> entred the Town with 300 Foot, for <hi>Count
Verrua</hi> was not yet got thither; in which time, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our passing over
the <hi>Sesia</hi> and the <hi>Poe,</hi> came to <hi>Annone,</hi> not far from
<hi>Arazzo,</hi> where he found Don <hi>Martino,</hi> who being by him sent
with 5000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, was come thither the day before, just as the
Enemy (who were already intrench'd before the place) began their batteries. The
Governour commanded Don <hi>Martino,</hi> Don <hi>Iohn de Garrai,</hi> and
<hi>Monpavone,</hi> to discover where they might bring succour; who brought
word back that truely the business would be hard, but not impossible; wherefore
the Governour gave order to advance. The <hi>Tanaro</hi> runs between
<hi>Annone</hi> and the place besieged; and the bank be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher on that side
then on this, and well fortified by the Enemy, the others, who must needs come
to the hither bank if they would relieve it, when they were come thither were
subject to be play'd upon by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Musketters. Moreover, the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and the Marshal, were come to the besiegers Camp, with as many
men as they could bring, with firm resolution to keep back all succour, and to
take that place in the face of the Enemy. But it being impossible to ford over
the River any where without endangering the loss of their men; and it being
necessary for them to pass over it, if they would bring succour, the business
seemed more desperate; but the industry and valour of the succourers overcame
the difficulty, who having prepared many Gabbions for defence, advance to the
River side behind those Gab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bions, conducted by <hi>Garrai;</hi> and by the
shot which being shelter'd by those Gabbions, they made at those of the
contrary shore, they forc'd the Enemy to abandon it. In this interim,
<hi>Aragon</hi> having thrown the Bridge of boats over which he brought in
Carts, Don <hi>Iovanni Romero,</hi> past over with 1000 Foot, to whom many of
the Garrisons were added; and going joyntly to assault the Enemies Trenches,
they fell upon them in good order, and without much Resolution. But meeting
with no less resolute resistance, and being over-powred by the Defendants
number, and by the advantage of scituation, they were likely to have been
repuls'd; had not the Artillery, which at last was brought unto the Camp, and
which were speedily placed in a convenient place, by the Marquess of
<hi>Caracena,</hi> made them abandon the defence, and given the assailants full
victory, with much prejudice to the Enemies Camp. The combat lasted from noon,
the first of <hi>August,</hi> till night, which parted the fray: The next day
the Duke and Marshal, though they had seemed to fortifie all night, and to
maintain possession, yet they went away by break of day, without any
molestation; for the <hi>Tanaro</hi> which was between them, and the deepness
of the way, kept them from being pursued, onely some Horse followed them, more
to shew their Courage, then out of any thought of damnifying them; especially
since the Duke and Marshall being come, the Enemies Camp was so increased, as
there were in it above 8000 Foot, and 1000 Horse. They left great quantity of
Arms and Munition in the Trenches; 500 of the besiegers were slain, and many
more wounded; few of the Relievers were slain, but m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ny wounded, which rendred this dayes action more
famous.</p>
            <p>But this success was soon allay'd with as much misfortune, which
not <pb n="609" facs="tcp:53250:312"/> long after the Spaniards suffered in the
<hi>Langhe,</hi> under Don <hi>Martino,</hi> whither the Governour had sent the
said Don, with 4000 Foot, 800 Horse, and 6 pieces of Artillery, to secure
<hi>Finale,</hi> which he foresaw would be endangered by Sea, by the French
Fleet, and by Land by the Duke of <hi>Savoy.</hi> The whole body destin'd for
this service consisted of Spaniards, under Don <hi>Antonio Sotelo,</hi> of
Dutch, under Prince <hi>Boro d' Este,</hi> and led on by <hi>Gil de Hays,</hi>
and Colonel <hi>Leiner:</hi> The Horse was commanded by the Baron of
<hi>Lisao.</hi> Don <hi>Martin</hi> being come to <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care,</hi> a place
appertaining to the jurisdiction of <hi>Finale,</hi> he heard that the Duke
being gone from <hi>Asti</hi> with a strong power, was come to
<hi>Saliceto,</hi> and hasted to inclose him in those streights; and that
possessing himself of those passages whereby he had entered the
<hi>Langhe,</hi> he intended to keep him out of the State of <hi>Millain;</hi>
he therefore sent 600 Foot to inforce <hi>Finale;</hi> and by common consent of
the Commanders it was resolved to retreat, and to prevent the Duke in his
design, and therefore to return to <hi>Bistagno,</hi> where being to meet with
more Forces, and being neerer the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> they thought they
should be safe if they could get thither. The difficulty of this consisted in
that he who will go from <hi>Spigno,</hi> a place by which they were to go, and
get into <hi>Bistagno,</hi> must pass by <hi>Monbaldone,</hi> which is almost
in the midway, and so must pass underneath the Dukes Musketiers, which being
led on by Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> were to their knowledg already got thither,
which made this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution dangerous; yet their necessity of getting into a
place of safety, and their hopes that by their industry, orderly marching, and
by their valour, they might overcome all difficulties, they resolved to
advance, the rather, for that being better informed, they knew that the Duke
was not yet come thither with all his men, but that the Van was only there
under Marquess <hi>Villa;</hi> they therefore made their Horse advance under
<hi>Lisao</hi> their Conductor; and after them <hi>Gil de Hays</hi> with his
Dutch, which made the Van; and then <hi>Sotelo</hi>'s Spaniards, with the
Artillery and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, who was followed by Prince <hi>Borso</hi> with his
Regiment of Dutch; the Rere was brought up by Colonel <hi>Leymer,</hi> with his
Regiment of Dutch Horse, back'd by two Companies of Dragoons: Marching in this
order, when they were come neer <hi>Monbaldone</hi> they saw some armed men in
certain Inns, against which Don <hi>Martin</hi> made two Files of Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers
advance, to possess himself of those Inns, and drive away the Souldiers which
were there: These Orders were succesfully followed; for the Musketeers drove
the others out, and made themselves Masters of their habitations: This mean
while the Horse were commanded to halt, and to face the Enemy, who kept still
at <hi>Monbaldone;</hi> and the Foot coming up at the same time, they made a
Squadron, and caused the Artillery to advance with a sufficient Guard:

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he Squadron, from which Files of
Musketeers continually issued forth and skirmished, marched but slowly, giving
the Artillery time to advance, and get to a place of more safety, where they
were afterwards to halt, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Enemy till the Artillery were come
to <hi>Bistagno.</hi> Those who had formerly taken the Inns seeing that the
Artillery and the Foot were well pass'd on, and got into a place of safety,
they likewise would retreat, and went to joyn with the Horse who stood upon the
plain and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Foot, who when
they should have marched were also to r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>eat; <pb n="610" facs="tcp:53250:313"/> but on a sudden they might
see Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> fall down with the Horse from <hi>Monbaldone,</hi>
and charge the Foot, which being in plain open field were abandon'd by the
Horse, which not making any resistance began to fly so shamefully, as the enemy
leaving the Foot began to pursue them and cut them with their swords; and
afterwards falling upon the Foot, did so disorder the Squadron, as some flew
one way, some ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in great confusion; and the Artillery and Munition
being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned fell into the enemies hands. The Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi>
coming with the rest of the Forces to <hi>Monbaldone</hi> made much for the
happy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ssue of this action; for
coming when the fight was begun, he assisted in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Victory; many
Spaniards were slain in this conflict, and many taken prisoners, amongst which
some Commanders: it was thought that if <hi>Lisao,</hi> who commanded the
Horse, and was the first that began to run, had made head and charged the
enemy, the Foot would have had time to have charged their Muskets again, and to
have rallied; so as all might have succeeded happily; and that this march might
have equal'd the succour which but a little before was given to the <hi>Rocca
d' A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razzo. Lisao</hi> who was justly blamed for this default, alledged for
himself, that he had told Don <hi>Martino</hi> it was impossible for him where
had placed him, if the enemy should assault him; and Don <hi>Martino</hi>
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the Governour, who when he sent him into those parts, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
he would fall upon the Territories of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> so to divert the Duke
from the <hi>Langhe,</hi> which promise he had not made good; with this
Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Duke <hi>Victorio</hi> ended his life just a moneth after he had
gotten it; he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Vercelli,</hi> where the Marshal also was; and it
was commonly enough said, that he was poysoned, though the Physitians, who cut
him up, said that there appeared no signs thereof in his bowels. This suspition
was occasioned by an invitation which was made by the Marshal, some few days
before the Duke died, to the Duke, Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> and Count
<hi>Verrua,</hi> where after having been sumptuously feasted, they fell all
three immediately sick; the Marquess mended within four days, but the Duke and
Count died within 8 or 10 days: it was notoriously known that great hatreds,
diffidencies, detractions and imputations, pass'd reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally between the
Duke and Marshal, which made that to be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected which befell the Duke, and
the Count, who was most inwardly acquainted with the Dukes ends and intentions.
The Duke was of an accurate understanding, he foresaw the manifest ruine of his
Principality by this war; if the French should beat him they would be his
Masters; if they should be beaten, they would be his enemies: it behoved him
therefore to carry the business so as that he mig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> not be oppress'd by Victory, nor ruined by the loss of

               </gap>y, so as the Spanish

               </gap>e, which was his only support
in <hi>Italy</hi> against the French, might not be weakned; so as though he did
many things to the Spanish preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, yet he never endeavoured their ruine and
destruction; by which artifices he made the world suspect, that not being able
to do less, he shun'd the danger which he saw did threaten him; so as his not
being able to manage the common a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ms freely, as it rendred his actions doubtful of double dealing, so
did it make them excusable: but these were divulged opinions, without any proof
or certainty, only that the Marshal published them; he embraced many
enterprises, and had <pb n="611" facs="tcp:53250:313"/> many designs: a little before his
death, he treated with Don <hi>Andrea Fossa,</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Theodoro di
Genoa,</hi> who was after chosen General of the Cannons of <hi>Laterane,</hi>
to joyn in League with the Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> seeming to value her
very much, and professing himself to be as well affected to her, as his Father
was the contrary; he therefore gave him Order to lay some foundation for this;
but his death, which ensued soon after, put an end to this and to all his other
negotiations; he died on the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October,</hi> the year 1637, in the
50<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his age; besides Daughters, he left two Sons behind him,
<hi>Francisco Giacinto,</hi> the eldest, who died a year after his Father, in
the sixth year of his age, and <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> who succeeded him, and
was not above four years old. This Prince his death was believed to be very
prejudicial to the Crown of <hi>Spain;</hi> for as, whilst he lived, the King
of <hi>Spain</hi> might assure himself he would never be absolutely against
him; so being dead, and the Government of the State falling upon the Dowager
Dutchess, who was Sister to the King of <hi>France,</hi> all men thought she
would be absolutely guided by him; and people were generally much troubled to
think, that if the young Duke should die, who seemed not then to be over
healthful, the States of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> would fall unto
the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and it was forthwith seen that the French did
gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily aspire after them; for the Duke being dead, the Marshal, who was in
<hi>Vercelli,</hi> endeavoured to bring a French Garrison in thither; and had
done it, had not Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> who was not perfectly recovered of
his sickness, been aware thereof, and brought many of the Dukes Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia into
the Town, by which he seasonably prevented the Marshals de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs. This Dukes
death was the occasion of great wars to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which we will leave
to speak of till the next Book; for we must now give over the affairs of
<hi>Lombardy</hi> in the condition we have spoken of, and looking a little
backwards, re-assume the proceedings at Sea; which, not to interrupt the Land
affairs, are of purpose treated of here.</p>
            <p>About the time that the things which have been spoken of, hapned
on Land; the Fleet at Sea, which having put twice forth from the Haven at
<hi>Naples</hi> could never light upon <hi>Provence,</hi> fell at last upon the
two Islands of St. <hi>Honorato,</hi> anciently called <hi>Lerino,</hi> and St.
<hi>Margherita:</hi> the latter being divided from the former by a narrow
channel; small Islands, and almost uninhabited; Count <hi>Monterei</hi> was the
occasioner of this enterprise; who having laboured the sending out of this
Fleet twice, and spent vast sums of money therein, was loth that this
enterprise which he esteemed as his own, and from whence he hoped to reap great
things, should vanish away in smoak; and seeing that the defence which was
prepared in <hi>Provence,</hi> and the lessening of the Fleet which was
shat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by tempest, made the enterprise unpossible to be effected as it was
first designed, he turned his force upon these two Islands. The Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of
<hi>Ferrendina</hi> did also co-operate herein, who appearing in the Seas of
<hi>Genoa,</hi> with a Squadron of Spanish Gallies whereof he was Captain;
being well furnish'd with Souldiers, he found the Marquess of <hi>San'
Croce</hi> with the Neapolitan Fleet in the Haven at <hi>Vai,</hi> who had but
few men aboard, he having sent them, as you have heard, to before <hi>Valenza.
Ferrendina</hi> incited <hi>San' Croce</hi> to joyn with him in taking of 
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:53250:314"/> these Islands; which when they should have taken, they
thought they might at least be able to hinder those of <hi>Provence</hi> from
Trafficking by Sea, and be ready for some greater enterprise as occasion should
be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd. About the midst of <hi>September, San' Croce, Ferrandina</hi> and
Don <hi>Carlo Doria,</hi> Duke of <hi>Tursis,</hi> went with 22 Gallies, 5
Ships and some Shallops, towards those Islands; whither when they were come
they landed their men the same day in the Island <hi>San' Margherita,</hi> as
being the greatest and neerest the Continent, and therefore apter to be
relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; they without any withstanding became masters of it, taking a small
Fort which was all they found in it, wherein were 50 Souldiers in Garrison, who
after having made some shot, surrendred the Fort: they went afterwards with
their Gallies to batter a certain Tower called <hi>le Crocette,</hi> which was
newly built upon a point of the Continent, so neer the Island as they plaid
upon them with their Artillery from the shore over against them, whereof they
thought they might easily make themselves masters; but the Tower resisting, and
many men coming to defend it, they gave it over; they then went to the Island
St. <hi>Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato;</hi> where though they met with more resistance, because
there was there a greater Garrison and better Fortifications, yet it was
surrendred though it held out somewhat longer then St. <hi>Margherita;</hi>
there march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of both these Islands about 400 Foot; and the Viceroy of
<hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> receiving advertisement of all that was done, abundance of
victuals, Munition, Arms and Artillery, and all things necessary to munite
them, and maintain them were sent from that Kingdom; there was great fame at
this time of Maritime preparations made by the King of <hi>France,</hi> both in
the Seas of <hi>Britanny</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> to furnish out a powerful
Fleet, and to keep it in the Mediteranean, not only to secure <hi>Provence</hi>
from the Spanish Fleet, but to resent himself upon the Kingdom of
<hi>Naples</hi> for his offences intended against <hi>Provence:</hi> it was
therefore given out that the King of <hi>France,</hi> holding intelligence with
many Lords and others of that Kingdom, (who were held to be dis-satisfied with
the Spanish Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire) would send that Fleet to prejudice that Kingdom; which
when the Vice-roy <hi>Monterei</hi> heard, it made him not only provide for
offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Provence,</hi> and for securing the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
but for defending that Kingdome, in case effects should be answerable to what
was said: No appearance was ever found of the intelligence or dissatisfaction
which was spoken of, though strict inquiry was made thereinto; and yet without
omitting to provide for the war of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> which the Viceroy minded
as much as that of <hi>Naples,</hi> he made all places where the Fleet could
Land be munited with strong Garrisons; he gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for levying a Dutch
Brigade, he armed at least 40 men of war, he re-inforced the Gallies, made
great provision of Arms, Ammunition and Artillery; he made many Brigades be
raised throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he gave order that the Mediterranean Militia
should be in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to come, if occasion should serve, to the sea side; he
chose 15000 of the best experienced Neapolitans, to defend the Walls; and he
did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply himself with such diligence and indefatigableness to have a care of
all places, as he might be truly said to be the soul which did at that time
maintain and inanimate the vast body of the Spanish Monarchy, which was
assaulted on so many sides; all these provisions were so ascertained 
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:53250:314"/> and so fitted, as the French Fleet, which was numerous
for Vessels and Souldiers, hearing thereof, forbare not only assaulting, but
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching the Coasts of that Kingdom; and keeping long in the Ligu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Sea
did not any thing worth so great a preparation; nor could it ever hinder the
passage and landing of Souldiers which were sent from <hi>Spain,</hi> and from
<hi>Naples,</hi> to the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> for the requisite
re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of the Army in <hi>Lombardy;</hi> for at the same time that the
French Fleet lay in the Ligustick Sea, the Spanish Gallies came to shore at
<hi>Finale</hi> whilst they looked on, and landed as many men as they pleased,
without any hindrance. The French Fleet consisted of 60 ships, which were come
from <hi>Britanny,</hi> into the Mediterranean, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by <hi>Henry</hi> of
<hi>Lorreyne, Count Harcourt,</hi> and by Monsieur <hi>De Sordi,</hi>
Arch-bishop of <hi>Burdeaux;</hi> to which were added 13 Gallies of
<hi>Provence,</hi> amongst which was the great Galleoun <hi>Guise,</hi>
commanded by <hi>Count Poncurletto,</hi> all very well rigg'd, and provided of
Artillery, and all other Navall necessaries; they sailed all of them by the
Islands, which were taken by the Spaniards but a little before, not making any
one shot at them, though they were provoked by many made from those Islands;
and tarrying a while at <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> they appeared in the Ligustick
Sea, about the end of <hi>September,</hi> 1636. The Spaniards For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at Sea
were far inferiour to this Fleet; wherefore it became the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Gallies to
give way to the French Fleet, and to keep out of the reach of Cannon, wherein
the French exceeded them. And yet the Duke of <hi>Ferrendina,</hi> who was in
the Seas of <hi>Genoa</hi> with his own squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron and other Spanish Gallies,
understanding that the Enemies Fleet was come to anchor at <hi>Mentone,</hi> a
place not far off, belonging to the jurisdiction of <hi>Monaco,</hi> made
towards them; and appearing before them about break of day, began to shoot at
them; and after having hit them with many Cannon shot, returned to the Haven of
<hi>Vai</hi> from whence he was come. These Spanish Gallies kept still in some
of the Havens in the Sea of <hi>Genoa,</hi> to the number, for the most part,
of 40: and though both the Fleets profess'd to bear all respect to the
Common-wealth, and not to do any act of Hostility against either other, whilst
they kept within the Havens of the Common-wealth, and did effectually make good
their professions; yet not satisfied with the exact cautious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the
Militia, they attentively observed the wayes of one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>another, lest they might be
taken unawares, where they could not evade danger in so neer neighbourhood; and
more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary the Spanish, as being weaker both for number and quality of
vessels, and consequently more subject to misfortunes. They there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were
extraordinarily diligent in learning the first motions of the Enemy; and to
this purpose, to boot with much diligence on land, they kept Feluccaes, and
other vessels at high sea, by which by fires at night, and by smoak in day
time, they were continually advertised which way the Enemy went: And yet the
Spanish Fleet was one day in very great danger of being sunk or taken. This
Fleet stay'd one whole night in the Haven at <hi>Vai,</hi> knowing that the
other lay in the Haven at <hi>Alassio,</hi> not above thirty miles off; from
whence the French Fleet put to sea, and favour'd by the darkness of the night,
undiscovered by the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, they upon break of day appeared so neer
<hi>Vai,</hi> as had not the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish <pb n="614" facs="tcp:53250:315"/> Gallies cut their
Cables, and speedily put to Sea, the French Fleet could never have got a more
famous victory: They got away in so good time, as they past all safe away, and
escaped the Enemies hands. These two Fleets kept long neer one another, in the
bosom of the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> without coming to a dispute; but the
French finding at last that they got but little good, and less honour, by
staying here, that they might not return to <hi>France</hi> without having done
any thing worthy so great a preparation, and such threats, they resolved to
assault <hi>Sardig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> whither they hoped to come unexpected and unlooked
for by the Inhabitants, so as they might do some good there. And coming to land
in the desolate Haven of <hi>Orestano,</hi> a City no less desolate in
<hi>Sardig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> then was her Haven; and little inhabited by reason of the
malignity of the air, they entred thereinto on the Saturday, in the time of
Carni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vale, when the Inhabitants dreaming of nothing less then of being
as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by so many ships, were more busie in feasting and revelling after
the manner of the Carnivale, then in defending themselves: Wherefore being
terrified, they fled most of them to within land; those who stay'd behind sent
some to the ships to know what they did intend; Answer was made, that they
intended to take the City, and to keep it till such time as the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> should restore the Islands which he had taken in
<hi>Provence;</hi> so they landed their men, and entred the City the next day,
which was almost abandoned by those few Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants which there remained,
where they refreshed themselves with those good things which they found ready
there to make a good Carnivale. But two dayes after, armed men began to appear
upon the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hills, who skirmish'd with them; and the French being
therein worsted, they fearing that the numbers of the Enemy might increase,
they retreated the second day of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Provence.</hi> When the Commanders of the Spanish Fleet heard this, they
finding that Winter was already begun, did also disband their Fleet, sending
some squadrons to winter in <hi>Spain,</hi> some in <hi>Genoa,</hi> some in
<hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> till they might put to sea with more
safety the next spring. But the French Fleet, about the beginning of
<hi>March,</hi> 1637. went, together with many of the Nobility and Souldiery,
to recover the Islands; and having possess'd themselves of the convenientest
passes, to keep off any succour that might be brought, they might see a great
ship which passing thorough with a fore-wind by the Fleet, entred into the
little neck of water which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the two Islands; and thinking to be safe
there amongst Friends, was the next night wholly burnt. <hi>Count Monterei</hi>
had sent it from <hi>Naples,</hi> loaded with Victuals, Munition, and all
things necessary for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Islands; it brought also 40 peeces
of Artillery; for the Vice-roy being glad that the Kings Forces had at last got
good footing there, and hoping that the crown would be much advantaged, and
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi> much prejudiced thereby, had a special care to keep them.
But <hi>Count Harcourt,</hi> Generall of the Fleet, fearing what was true,
&amp; despairing to recove; the Islands if that ship should land her
provisions, sent one of the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e-ships full of powder, and artificial fire-works which was in the
Fleet; which entring by night where the ship was, fasten'd her self with
grapling-irons to the ship; and giving fire to the train; the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners 
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:53250:315"/> got out of the fire-boat into a schiff which was behind
her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated without any harm to the Fleet. The fire took soon hold, and
quickly devoured the ship and all that was in it; some few escaping, who threw
them selves into the Sea: So as the Garrisons in the Island, missing of those
supplies, could continue defence the lesser while; the which they
notwithstanding drew out a long while, by reason of the many Forts, Trenches,
and other works, which were well munited, so as the French were to win them by
inch-meal. They assauted S<hi rend="sup">ta</hi> 
               <hi>Marg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herita</hi> first, which resisted
stoutly a long while: The ships accosted it, and with their Cannon beat down
the first rampiers, which were erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to keep them from landing; they then
landed their men, but not without much effusion of blood; and having taken some
small works, they came before Fort <hi>Monterei,</hi> which was munited with
four bastions, together with their ditches and two half moons; the French
thought they should meet with stout resistance there, and therefore wondred
very much when they saw it abandoned ere assaulted; for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants were
retired to a neighbouring Fort which was greater then all the rest and was
called a Fort Royal; and flanked with five Bulwarks; in the mid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> whereof was a Tower, which in that
Island served for a Fortification; The French being Masters of Fort Monterei
began to draw a trench cross the Island, wherein they might the more safely
lodge; then coming before the Fort Royal, and other smaller Forts, they
endeavoured to take them; many were the assaults, and many the Sallies which
were made; the oppugners behaved themselves like good Warriours, and the
Defendants like good Souldiers, and that Island served for a Steccado of

relieve it, seeing a powerful Fleet ready to resist him, had no mind to have to

live at Sea. <hi>Perez</hi> got leave from <hi>Harcourt</hi> to send to
<hi>Millain</hi> for succour; but none appearing within the perfixed time, he
surrendered the Fort Royal, and the other forts, upon very Honourable
conditions; even with leave to carry away two pieces of Artillery with all his
train and tacklings, and with permission that he might have vessels allowed
him, to carry himself, and Souldiers, and all their goods to <hi>Finale</hi>
986 per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons came out of the Island, honoured and praised by the Enemy for that
valiant behaviour, and the Captain was highly esteemed and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by
<hi>Harcourt;</hi> the Island <hi>Honorato</hi> was not defended like this;
wherein was another Fort which surrounded our Ladies Church, and was a
<hi>Pentagon,</hi> consisting of five Bulwarks, begirt with ditches, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
ways, half Moons, and other works; there were six other Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels of devotion
in the Island, dedicated to several Saints; which being reduced into little
Fortifications defended the Island, having two Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons <pb n="616" facs="tcp:53250:316"/>
apiece in each of them, with sufficient Garrisons; the Fleet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having made
300 Cannon shot, landed their Souldiers in the cloud of smoak; which ere they
were come within Musket shot of the Fort, beat a Call, and quickly agreed to
surrender up that place, and all the other Fortifications, upon such conditions
as the General should be pleased to give them; about some 500 March'd out on
the 14 of <hi>May</hi> with their Arms and baggage, but without Colours: they
had Boats allowed them to carry them to Port <hi>Hercules;</hi> this was the
end of this enterprize, which without any good done, occasioned vast expence to
each of the Crowns, and much loss of blood to that of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Spanish Empire at Sea suffered not a little by the coming of
this Fleet, for it never had any competitor before in the Mediterranean, but

               </gap>re absolute sway there; but the
coming of this Fleet did not onely trouble the Crown in the possession, and
command thereof, but made the name of <hi>France</hi> of more authority to
other Princes who had any possession on her shore; Moreover, many armed vessels
come from <hi>Provence</hi> under her protection, which by Letters of Mart from
the King of <hi>France</hi> committed piracy upon the vessels of the King of
<hi>France</hi> his Enemies; in which letters of Mart, the Spanish, Neapolitan,
Sicilian, and Sardinian vessels were directly named, and indirectly all those
of any other nations, though friends to <hi>France,</hi> were included, in case
any the least goods appertaining to any subject of <hi>Spain</hi> should be
found therein; for then all the other Merchandise, as well of Friends, as
enemies, became lawful prey, by the ancient Laws and constitutions of the Crown
of <hi>France;</hi> and neither did the smaller ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels onely, but even the
Fleet it self seized on Merchants Ships in the Mediterranean, of which no
discourse of restoral was to be had, if there were any the least thing in them
belonging to any of the Kings ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and this rigour was so abused, as the
French Mariners would by force, and by threats, make the owners or masters of
such ships as were taken, confess before the Judges that the goods therein
contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed belonged to the Crown of <hi>Spain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </gap>e liberty under the Emperour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted so many Potentates, and
Commonwealths; so as by reason of the abundance of Inhabitants, it had always
been a fruitful mine of Souldiers, and Armies, was now so desolated and wasted
by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine dissentions, which were openly fomented by the King of Swede, and
underhand by the King of <hi>France,</hi> as some of the Provinces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of had
almost no inhabitants left in them; nor did <hi>Flanders</hi> nor
<hi>France</hi> fail in feeling their share of the mischiefs which the
influences of the Stars, or rather, the hand of God irritated by our sins, drew
down upon all Christendom; and therefore all Christendom being plunged in War
and Ruine, which instead of being extinguished did daily increase, the Pope,
the Common Father of Christians, thought good to interpose his authority, in
composing so many Wars, and in reducing so many discords to peace and union;
this holy endeavour <pb n="617" facs="tcp:53250:316"/> was not onely praised by all men,
but in appearance willingly listned unto; those seeming most desirous thereof
who in their hearts were furthest from it; the City of <hi>Cullen</hi> was
chosen for the place of Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, where the Princes were to meet by their
Embassadours, with full Authority as Plenepotentiaries; the Pope chose Cardinal

                  </gap>inetti,</hi> who was sent
thither with the title of Apostolick Legate; the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who
shewed a great readiness to peace, sent thither the Duke of <hi>Alcala,</hi>
Don <hi>Francisco di Melo,</hi> and Don <hi>Ronchiglio,</hi> Chancellour of
<hi>Millain;</hi> the Emperour nominated the Bishop of <hi>Wurtzberg,</hi>
Count <hi>Fuccaro,</hi> and the Count Counsellour <hi>Ferdinando Maximiliano
Kurtz,</hi> and the King of <hi>France</hi> Marshal <hi>Berse,</hi> and
Mounsier <hi>Davo:</hi> but the Emperour, and King of <hi>France,</hi> were
slow in sending them thither: the occasion of this delay was, for that the
Emperour <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond being dead a little before this
negotiation, who was succeeded in the Empire by his son <hi>Ferdinando</hi> the
third; who before his Fathers death, was chosen, as hath been said, King of the
Romanes; those who were not pleased that the Empire should continue in the
house of <hi>Austria</hi> took occasion to pretend that the Election of the
King of the Romans, and consequently the present succession to the Empire, was
not Legitimate; as being done without the intervening of the Electour of
<hi>Triers,</hi> who was still Prisoner in <hi>Flanders;</hi> of these, the
King of <hi>France,</hi> professing himself head of all the rest, would never
not onely acknowledge, but not so much as call the present <hi>Ferdinando</hi>
the third, Emperour, nor King of the Romans, before he was chosen Emperour; and
the Emperour being desirous to get the King to acknowledge this his title,
desired him that he would grant a Pasport to the Embassadours which he was to
send to <hi>Cullen;</hi> thinking that the King being to make some decree for
safe conduct could not chuse but name him Emperor; which to evade, he did not
onely refuse to grant such a pasport, as being superfluous in the Emperours own
Dominions; but desired that the Emperour would give Pasports, and safe
conducts, to all the Princes and Hans Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> his
Confederates, as he professed, that they might pass safely to the Convention at
<hi>Cullen,</hi> and there safely Negotiate their several interests; he
required also that safe conduct might be given to the United Provinces of the
Low-Countrys, and to the Queen, and Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who were so
deeply concerned in that peace; he alleadged for this his pretention, the bond
of League which he had with all these Princes, States, and Cities, which would
not suffer him to conclude any peace without their agreement; he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that
if he should enter into this Negotiation without them, he should give them just
cause of jealousie, and complaint, as if he had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned them, contrary to
the Articles of Confederacy; the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our not permitting that the Princes, and
Hans Towns of <hi>Germany,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the Emperours, and who
had rebelled, should be admitted to treat of peace in company with him who was
their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Lord, denied absolutely to grant them safe conduct; the rather
for that onely the Plenipotentiaries of Sovereign Princes were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into
the convention at <hi>Cullen;</hi> but the King who had taken up arms in this
cause, not upon any account of his own, but in defence of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>
liberty, said, that he having no interest in that cause save only the 
<pb n="618" facs="tcp:53250:317"/> patronage of those Princes, he was but accessory, and
the Princes Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals; so as there was no reason that the Principals should
be excluded, and the accessory admitted; and that it was no new thing, but an
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custom, and now in practice, that in disorders which sometimes happen
between Sovereigns and subjects, agreement be made by cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted Articles; and
as for the Queen and Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour did not refuse to
grant safe conduct, if it should be demanded by her, and by the Deputies of
that Kingdom, and not by the King of <hi>France;</hi> but the <hi>Swedes</hi>
were so far from desiring it, as they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into private treaty with the
Emperour; absolutely denying to come with the other Princes to the Convention
at <hi>Cullen;</hi> because they knew that the Cardinal Legate, who had the
first place in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, would treat them as Hereticks, and
consequently would not suffer them to intervene in any treaty of peace; nor
would use such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to their Agents, as he did to those of other Princes;
the Emperour, on the contrary, complained of the difficulties interposed by the
king of <hi>France;</hi> as if they were apparent Arguments, that he did not
onely not wish well to peace, but that he was more intent then ever upon War:
and upon fomenting the Insurrections of <hi>Germany;</hi> and that therefore
out of these pretensions proceeding slowly in the Treaty of Peace, he intended
to give occasion to other Princes, (who though they desired peace, would not
for their own honours sake seem to desire it more then others) to proceed with
the like slackness in this affair, which was so necessary for the peace of
Christendom; and therefore the Emper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Plenipotentiaries, nor those of the
king of <hi>France,</hi> not appearing in <hi>Cullen;</hi> those of the king of
<hi>Spain</hi> who were come to <hi>Cullen</hi> after the Legate, lest by being
come before the rest to the Diet, they might seem more greedy of peace then
others, they never appeared in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity before the Legate, nor did they
seem to be come to treat of Peace; and the king of <hi>France,</hi> finding not
long after that his pretences, being contrary to the Negotiation so much
desired by all, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ill resented, and that they were imputed rather
to his no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to peace then to any thing that he alleadged, he
recalled his Plenipotentiary power confer'd on <hi>Berze,</hi> and
<hi>Davo,</hi> and gave it to the Cardinal of <hi>Lyons,</hi> brother to
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> which occasioned other difficulties, which
troubled the Treaty no less then did the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; for the <hi>Caesarean</hi>
Agents, thinking that this was done on purpose that the French Embassadour
might by his Cardinal dignity precede all others; (whereunto the Emperour nor
King of <hi>Spain</hi> would by no means consent) they refused to send theirs
thither. These, and other pretentions, occasioned such difficulties, as not
onely no conclusion was come unto, but no commencement was given to the Treaty
which was propounded by the Pope, and in appearance so much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by all; so
as the Negotiation proved abortive, and ended before it began.</p>
            <p>Let us now return to the Affairs of <hi>Italy.</hi> A Treaty began
by chance, and almost unthought of, in the beginning of the year 1637, which
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards continued and concluded, put a period to the business of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> between the two Crowns, and the Grisons League, in the
subjection of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> which by the Articles of this Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ederacy <pb n="619" facs="tcp:53250:317"/> was
remitted upon some conditions to the three Leagues: And that the foundation of
this business may be the better known, it will be necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that we re-assume
the whole business from the beginning, and repeat some things which have been
loosely related.</p>
            <p>The ancient Confederacy between the Crown of <hi>France</hi> and
the Grisons, appearing to those people to be turned almost into subjection, was
not willingly suffer'd by them, who thought themselves daily more streightned
and more invaded in their Liberties by the Agents of that Crown; it began to be
very bitter, when by reason of the Grisons joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in League with the
Venetians, the French pretended that their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient League was thereby
prejudiced; and their resenting it made the Grisons suspect that they had gone
along with the Spaniards in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection which hapned afterwards in the
<hi>Valtoline:</hi> these bitternesses encreased by the peace of
<hi>Monsone,</hi> by which the liberty of the Valto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linians was approved of, so
much to their prejudice, by the same King who was the Grisons Protector,
contrary to what the King had always promised, and which was profess'd
publickly to all the world by Arms; but they grew greater and more
insufferable, when thinking by this last endeavour of the Duke of
<hi>Rohan</hi> to be restored unto the ancient and free possession of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> they saw they were kept from it by the French Forces; and
when any endeavour of restitution was had in the Court at <hi>Paris,</hi> the
King, as Protector of the Valtolinians, did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, upon condition
(notwithstanding) that the Catholick Religion should be secured there without
any mixture of Heresie, and that the Civil and Criminal Justice should remain
to the Valtolinians, answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Capitulations of <hi>Monsone.</hi> This
was caused, for that the King of <hi>France</hi> finding that he could not
maintain his authority in that Valley, which he greatly desired to do, without
much disturbance to his own affairs, without much war and expence; and that
assigning it to the Grisons, it would be immediately taken away by the Austrian
Forces; and that he should be obliged to recover it again; so as the loss
succeeding the recovery, and the recovery the loss, a perpetual cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolution
would ensue, which would make him subject to perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al wars and much expence;
being desirous to get quit of this trouble, he had a design to win the hearts
of the Valtolinians; and by granting them all that they had from the Crown of
<hi>Spain,</hi> to alienate them from that Crown, and make them wholly depend
upon his Crown; and by this means to spare the continual expence he was at in
maintaining that Valley at his devotion; embracing therefore the cause of their
Liberty, he offer'd the Valtolinians more advantagious conditions then they
could get from the Austrians, whilst they should depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his protection:
this course did totally alienate the Grisons from the Crown of <hi>France;</hi>
nor did it gain the Valtolinians, who could never be brought to confide in the
Kings promises; which if they should have done, they were sure they should be
more prosecuted by the Arms of <hi>Austria,</hi> which confined upon them, then
by the French which were so far from them; and the Grisons did believe that the
unexpected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, so contrary to that absolute Dominion which they pre
ended to under the Valtolinians, and which they expected to obtain from the
King of <hi>France,</hi> were but cunningly propounded to cause delay, which 
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:53250:318"/> would at last end in a manifest exclusion of the
promised restitution; so as they were highly offended; and, moreover, the Fort
which <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>han</hi> did still keep well munited with French Garrisons in
<hi>Rhetia,</hi> seemed to them to be but formal fetters of the publick
liberty, which they saw was reduced to greater subjection, whilst the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> was pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd by the French: they likewise observed
<hi>Rohans</hi> residence in <hi>Coira,</hi> the Metropolitan City of
<hi>Rhetia,</hi> where he carried himself imperiously with them, rather like a
Princely Governour then like a Guest or Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadour, seeming as if he labour'd
to overthrow the publick Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To these publick distastes other private
grievances were added, by reason of detaining the Pensions which the King was
used to pay to the principal men of that Nation, to the end, that by their
authority they might keep the people well affected to him; so as failing of
those advantages, they did by contrary endeavours strive to divert those that
did depend upon their authority, from the French: these people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore
much incensed, and weary of this usage, they hatched ill will; and persevering
but untowardly in the ancient League with that Crown, they consulted with
themselves how they might throw off their present condition, which they thought
was reduced to slavery, and shun the worser which they feared they should
shortly be brought unto; but having well debated these things, and finding that
they could not compass their ends, without being upheld by some great
Potentate, they quietly dissembled the iniquity of their present condition, the
best they could, expecting some opportunity whereby they might free themselves
from this imminent subjection. On the other side, the Court of <hi>Spain</hi>
and her Agents in <hi>Italy,</hi> knew as well the necessity, as the difficulty
of recovering the <hi>Valtoline;</hi> especially in times of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufferable
troubles; and considering the jealousies and suspicions, and afterwards the
hatred and enmities that the recovery thereof, if they should get it, would
bring upon them from the Venetians, and from all the Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi>
who for their own safety sake did not well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Spaniards superiority in
that Valley; they considered also the continual wars which they must have upon
this account, the expence of moneys, the shedding of blood, the great
disturbance which that Valley occasioned to the Kings Affairs, which like a
Bone out of Joynt did discompose the whole Body of the Austrian Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>
            <p>Things being in this posture, Don <hi>Frederick de Henriques,</hi>
the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Embassadour, happened to be in the Court at <hi>Ispruch,</hi> and
a Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Grisons, who was named <hi>Granazza,</hi> one of great credit
and Authority in that Common-wealth, between whom occasion being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
offered of discoursing of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> something arose between them
touching the composure of those affairs, which like seed sown in well prepared
ground, took root, and produced the fruits of those Agreements which did
afterwards insue; for the business being well discuss'd and digested between
them, they agreed that the French should be driven out of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> by the joynt Forces of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and of
the Grisons; and that the Catholique Religion, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession thereof,
being allowed to the Valtolinians, without any mixture of Heresie, the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> should adjust businesses between them <pb n="621" facs="tcp:53250:318"/> and
the Grisons; which if the Valtolinians should not agree unto, they should be no
longer assisted by the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Forces. They like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise agreed
upon a perpetual Confederacy between the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> and that
Republick, with free leave for the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s people to pass
thorow the Rhetian State, and upon obligation of serving the Crown of
<hi>Spain</hi> in the Wars of <hi>Millain</hi> with a certain number of men, to
be paid by the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> together with many pensions promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to
the prime men of that Nation.</p>
            <p>Things being thus rather rough-cast then perfected, the Grisons,
who were impatient of the Company of the French, took heart, and causing some
Forces to come from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> they made themselves masters
of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> and drave the French from thence; and being assisted
from <hi>Germany,</hi> they recovered the Forts of <hi>Reno</hi> and
<hi>Steinc,</hi> which were yet held by the French; and afterwards coming to a
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral insurrection, <hi>Rohan</hi> himself was taken prisoner, from whom,
when they had got him into their power, they got by Agreement stipulated the
restitution of as many Forts as were yet in his hands, and the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing of
all the French out of <hi>Rhetia,</hi> upon tie that he should remain Prisoner
till all that he had promised were performed. This news be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard in
<hi>Millain,</hi> the Spaniards were not so much delighted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as they
were afraid that the Agreement made at <hi>Ispruch</hi> would va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish to
nothing, if during six weeks time the King of <hi>France</hi> should get power
or authority in that Diet; nor did they fear in vain; for that King leaving the
way of War, as too tedious and costly, fell to Treaty, to keep those people in
their loyalty; and to this purpose, besides mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys given about, he offered to
give them the <hi>Valtoline</hi> freely, without any condition belonging to
Religion or Justice; but nothing would do any good; for the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> having sent Agents into those parts, with monies, and power to
offer much more then the French did, he prevailed, so as the <hi>Grisons</hi>
stood firm to what was agreed on at <hi>Ispruch;</hi> for being weary of their
ancient friendship with <hi>France,</hi> they desired to try new Fortune; which
they assured themselves they should find more prosperous in the Confederacy
with <hi>Spain.</hi> The Grisons knew that the possession of the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> which was the principal point of this Negotiation, was to
be held more safely by the friendship from <hi>Spain,</hi> then from
<hi>France;</hi> for their Confederacy with <hi>Spain</hi> secured them from
any disturbance they should have in the <hi>Valtoline</hi> from
<hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> or from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> with the confining
Principalities; whereas they could not keep from being offended, nor secure
themselves of protection and assistance from <hi>France,</hi> by reason of the
far distance thereof, in case they should be molested in that Valley by the
neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Austrian Forces, by reason of the difficulties and excessive
charge which the recovery of that Valley did continually cost that Crown; and
howsoever it was much better for them to be sure not to be molested by the
neighbouring Forces of <hi>Austria,</hi> then after being molested to be
protected by the far-off the French. The prefix'd time being past,
<hi>Rohan,</hi> who had several times indeavoured to escape, but still in vain,
was forced to surrender the places held by him, and to free them from the
French, with which he was set at liberty, and was forced to resign up to the
Grisons all that he had got in those parts, and so
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o <pb n="622" facs="tcp:53250:319"/> be gone,
elsewhere with little honour. The Grisons being thus fully restored to Liberty,
sent their Deputies to <hi>Millain</hi> to conclude this so important Treaty:
The Valtolinians sent their Deputies thither also; but the business growing
excessive difficult, and the Governour not knowing how to decide it, they were
all turn'd over to the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> whither the Deputies being
come, and being very well received by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and having
their expences discharged all the time they were there, the business was almost
two years in hand. The Valtolinians pleaded the ancient Rights of their
Liberty, the Grisons tyrannical oppression, their zeal to Religion, their
constant loyalty to the Crown, and towards the Austrian name, their protection
of Liberty, given by his Majesties particular decree, and promised them by his
royal word, the Pontifical Decrees, and the Sacred Canons, which forbid that
Catholicks should be under the subjection of Hereticks, the Popes own
Authority, who would not permit that the Empire of the Grisons should extend to
that Valley, the Articles of <hi>Monsone,</hi> the offers made unto them by the
King of <hi>France,</hi> if they would accept of his protection, their constant
refusal thereof; and finally, the sufferings which they had undergone for doing
so. They also desired that the condition of the Grisons, with whom his Majesty
treated of joyning in League, to the prejudice of their Liberty, might be
considered: they being Hereticks, Enemies to the Catholick Religion, falsifyers
of their words, who term not standing to their Covenants, liberty, and the
being obliged thereunto, Slavery; and that they would bear with any thing, so
they might get the <hi>Valtoline</hi> again, which when they should have
gotten, they would renew their confederacy with <hi>France,</hi> with the
Venetians, and with any other Potentate that they should please to renue it, or
to continue it with, and would carry themselves without any respect to any
conventions; so as the present agreements would neither gain their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to the Crown, nor would it secure the covenanted passages, but would be the
loss of the constant Faith and Loyalty of the Valtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and of the sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e passage thorough that Valley, which
his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty had till now constantly enjoyed. All which reasons being alleadged
and reiterated over and over, and amplified, were not sufficient to hinder the
things agreed upon at <hi>Ispruch.</hi> For the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> were
confident that the Grisons would continue constant in the obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancy thereof,
for the same reason which had brought them to make this new confederacy; which
was, what was said, before their being sure, during the confederacy, not to be
disturbed in their possession of the <hi>Valtoline</hi> by the Austrian Forces,
from whence they could onely expect molestation. So as the King might be sure,
that whilst no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty should happen, on his account, in the
<hi>Valtoline,</hi> the Grisons would not violate the new confederacy; and so
that, to shun any occasion of trouble in the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> they would
forbear any of the least alteration of what was agreed upon. And the King
thought that he had fully satisfied the Valtolinians, both in their spiritual
and temporal interests, by the two conditions which were annexed to the
Confederacy. The first whereof was, that the Catholick Religion should be
sincerely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served there, without any mixture of Heresie. The other, that a
Tribunal should be erected in that Valley of two grave men, and men 
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:53250:319"/> of authority; the one to be chosen by the Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> the other by the Grisons; to which Tribunal the Valtolinians
were to have recourse, in point of any civil or criminal grievances which they
should receive from the Grisons Agents or Officers.</p>
            <p>Thus the Valtolinians obtained entirely the chief point concerning
Religion, for the preservation whereof, according to their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
they had first taken up Arms; and they did in a great part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
satisfaction in the other point, touching their politick Liberty; they not
being to be oppress'd for the future by the Grisons in these two points. And
yet this settlement, for what concern'd the cause of the Valtolinians, was
variously discoursed upon: Some blamed it, as being unworthy the Religion and
Majesty of the King, for the reasons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged by the Valtolinians; and for
that it seemed, drawn thereunto by the great advantages which he got by this
new convention, he had abandoned, nay suffer'd his Clients the Valtolinians,
who had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved so well of him, and of the Catholick Religion, for which they
had undergone so great and so many troubles, to be trampled upon in their
Liberty and Religion by the tyranny of the Grisons. Others, though they wondred
at the Kings determination, did notwithstanding execute it, out of the
necessity whereunto the Kings Affairs were at the present reduced. But those
that discoursed hereof more freely did not only approve of the Kings
Resolution, but without any regard almost had to the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>in name of the Liberty and protection of the
Valtolinians, did commend it as being done justly and wisely: Considering that
the Liberty of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> as it leaned upon the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> was of its own nature odious to all the world; and impossible
to be maintained by humane force. They therefore concluded, that the King
neither could, nor ought to permit, that his Royal Authority, and therewithall
the Catholick Religion, for want of his assistance should be endangered in
other more important places, by his up holding the Catholick Religion, and the
politick liberty of that little Canton. The Affairs of the <hi>Valtoline</hi>
being then adjusted, the Deputies were sent to <hi>Millain,</hi> that the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the confederacy might be there stipulated, as they were
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: But whilst this so hard, and so important business, was discussed
there, the Governour by his Forces, but much more by his Industry, ended the
important enterprize of <hi>Bremi.</hi> This place (as hath been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
said) was of a large circuit, and very commodiously seated, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed with
ditches, flank'd with Bulwarks, abundantly provided with Victuals and
Ammunition, munited with a numerous Garrison, and briefly, reduced into a Fort
Royall; and therefore held by the French to be a strong defence, and Rendezvous
for Arms, capable to receive an indifferent Army; and holding it, for these
respects, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, they called it a new Rochel. The Governour before he
would betake himself to this place of so great concernment openly, would have
all his preparations ready, and that so secretly as the Enemy should not be
aware of it: To this end, he distributed many Souldiers in the parts
thereabouts, under the pretence of quartering, and under the colour that those
places might be better garrison'd by reason of the neighbourhood of
<hi>Bremi;</hi> he therefore sent some to <hi>Valenza,</hi> some to
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> others to <hi>Montaro,</hi> and into <hi>Lomello,</hi>
into which place he <pb n="624" facs="tcp:53250:320"/> also sent Victuals, Munition, Straw,
and other provisions, fit for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended enterprize. And to make the Enemy
the less apprehend this siege, he sent men to <hi>Filizano,</hi> giving out
that from thence he would make himself master of <hi>Mount calvo:</hi> He also
considered the custom of the <hi>Poe;</hi> which swelling in <hi>May,</hi> when
the snow falls down from the <hi>Alps,</hi> would be a great hinderance for the
Armies abode in those places, which at that time are subject to great
inundations; being therefore to anticipate the enterprise, he provided much Hay
and Straw; which though it were very hard to get in any quantity then, Winter
being well nigh ended, yet diligence overcame all difficulties. These things
being thus ordered, he commanded that they should fall to executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which
was carried so silently, and so unexpectedly, as the Souldiers were before the
Walls, even almost before they were dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; their secrecy made them so
confident of good success, as they prepared Scaling-ladders to attempt taking
the Town by surprize, and so to make themselves masters of that Fort by
stealth, before which it was thought that whole armies would be consumed before
it could be taken. The Governour therefore ordered that four Bodies of
Souldiers, commanded by the best experienced Camp-masters, should, by night,
about the midst of <hi>March,</hi> 1638, at one and the same time fall upon the
Town in four several sides; the first that were to give the two first
as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saults, were Don <hi>Antonio Sottelo</hi> and Count <hi>Ferrante
Bolognio;</hi> the first coming from <hi>Mortara</hi> about the coming on of
night, with 3000 Foot, and the other with as many from <hi>Valenza,</hi> and
bringing with them all necessary instruments, they were each of them to possess
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, in the several places appointed them, of the banks of <hi>Poe</hi>
joyning upon the Town, and there to fortifie themselves; and so by bereaving
the enemy of any benefit of communicating by the River, exclude all succour by
that way, which was thought would assuredly be sent from <hi>Cassalle:</hi> the
business proved lucky, and better then was supposed; for <hi>Sottelo</hi>
advancing to a certain place called <hi>Bonobo,</hi> lying between the River
and the Town, which was seated very high, and fit for the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, made
himself master of it without any opposition. <hi>Bolognino</hi> did yet more
fortunately discharge his part; he went at the same time out of
<hi>Valenza,</hi> and having assaulted the lower station called <hi>Corno,</hi>
and which was fortified and garrison'd by the enemy, he at the very first drove
out the enemy, took the place, and began straightway to fortifie against the
enemy; and then raising Trenches along the bank, went to joyn with
<hi>Sottelo,</hi> who advanced with his Trenches likewise from <hi>Bonobo;</hi>
and joyning together, they at very first block'd up the Town from the River;
and having each of them brought many sacks with them, which they filled with
earth, and made sudden Trenches with them, and many Barques being come to them
from <hi>Valenza</hi> with Faggots, and other Instruments for perfecting their
Fortifications, they raised that work higher: on the same night Don <hi>Iovan
Vasques Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> and Don <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> were ordered to
accost the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>own from two other
parts, further from the River; the former coming with <hi>Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telo</hi> from
<hi>Mortara</hi> was to assault the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>own on that part which is called
<hi>Forbice vecchia;</hi> and the other coming from <hi>Lomello,</hi> was
ordered to approach it by the Covent of the Capuchins; and when both of them 
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:53250:320"/> were got thither they were to fall a scaling; wherein if
they succeeded well, they were to give notice to <hi>Sottello</hi> and
<hi>Bolognino,</hi> that they might do the like with the Ladders which they
brought with them; and if the first Scaladoes should not succeed well, they
were either by real or seeming assaults, to endeavour to divert the defendants
from that part of the River where <hi>Sottello</hi> and <hi>Bolognino</hi>
were; that so they might leave them the Fortification on the bank unmolested by
the enemies Garrison, on which Fortification the ground-work of the business
lay: nor were they to forbear fortifying their stations, and to sence
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Musket-shot of the enemy, before day-light, if they should
miscarry in their Scalado; but both of them finding the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants readier and
more intent upon the defensive part, they failed in the chief intent of the
Scalado; for as soon as they approached, a hail of Musket-shot was let fly at
them, together with thunder of Artillery, and lightning of artificial fires,
which though they kept the oppugners from making Scaladoes, or giving assault,
yet could they not keep them from fortifying the stations wherein they were.
Don <hi>Martin d' Aragona</hi> was the Head and Superintendent of all this
Enterprize, to whom only the Governour had communicated the whole design from
the beginning; so as he ordered all things as his Lieutenant; and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
applying himself to all parts, ordered all things requisite for carrying on the
work: <hi>Tiberio Brancacchio</hi> Camp-master was also or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to go with his
Brigade from <hi>Alessandria,</hi> with many Carriages, many Sumpture-Horses,
and store of Artillery, to <hi>Valenza,</hi> and from thence to
<hi>Sartiranna,</hi> to drive the Enemy from thence; who moving early, and
being come to the intended place, after having made forty shot of Battery, took
the Town, which the Captain of the Garrison yielded upon Articles: And
<hi>Brancacchio</hi> going from thence, went by Orders from the Governour to
joyn with <hi>Gatta;</hi> nor were the horse idle, but were distributed into
such parts by which succour might be brought. Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> was
to guard the Passage over the <hi>Poe</hi> with 1500 Horse, at
<hi>Villata,</hi> where it falls into the <hi>Sesia:</hi> the custody of
<hi>Frassineiro</hi> fell to <hi>Ferdinando de li Monti</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the
Dutch Cavalry, with as many Horse: the guard of <hi>Lomello</hi> to Don
<hi>Alvaro di Quignones,</hi> that he might be ready there, as occasion should
serve; but Marquess <hi>Cricky</hi> as soon as he heard of this so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and
so unexpected assault, sent nine Barques from <hi>Cassalle,</hi> where he then
was, and in them 1200 Foot tumultuously and on the sudden put together,
together with much provision and munition; not so much to supply the Town, as
to defend the bank of the River, to the end, that the enemy, who he thought was
possess'd thereof, might not keep it, nor block up the way from succour; but
the design being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen and prevented, they did not onely not possesse
themselves of the banks, but neither did they bring in succour; for the Barques
coming to shore at <hi>Sotelo</hi>'s quarters, were encounter'd, and after a
long fight departed, being hardly dealt with; and passing afterwards to where
<hi>Bolognino</hi> was, three of them landed their Souldiers; and the others
fiercely fighting would have done the like; but meeting with stout resistance,
after a long fight, fell together with the munition wherewith they were
fraughted into the enemies hands; two of the <pb n="626" facs="tcp:53250:321"/> three
Barques which landed Souldiers were sunk, and 70 prisoners were tak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n, whereof two French Captains; and
hardly 200 of those that were landed, being favoured by the night, got wounded
into <hi>Bremi,</hi> the rest being slain or drown'd; the defendants afterwards
sallied out to recover the Sconce <hi>Corno,</hi> which was taken at the first
by <hi>Bolognino;</hi> who finding the defendants negligent, drove them out;
but <hi>Bolognino,</hi> with some 200 of his men, got it again within two
hours: then the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour came to the Camp; who viewing the stations, Works
and Fortifications made by his men, commended them, to the great satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of the Commanders and Souldiers; and having given several other Orders touching
the fortifying of quarters, and the environing the Camp with a Trench, he
retired to <hi>Sartiranna,</hi> from whence, as from the neerest place, he
might give out Orders, visit the Camp, as he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten did, and provide things
necessary; but Fortunewould have her share in this enterprise; for an accident
which hapned help'd much not only to the taking of this Town, but to the total
of all affairs. The Marshal seeing the unfortunate success of those that were
sent from <hi>Cassalle,</hi> thought to place a battery upon the shore opposite
to the enemies Trenches, to the end, that the shore being cleansed, the way
might be open to bring in succour by water; and whilst, accompanied by three or
four Horse-men only, he stood behind a Tree on the opposite shore, looking with
a Prospective-glass, where the battery might best be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, he was hit by a
Sakers-bullet, which was shot from the enemies Trench; and falling dead from
off his horse, his body was carried into <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and after solemn
obsequies, was carried into <hi>France;</hi> whither it was accompanied by
almost all the flower of those few French who were yet in <hi>Italy;</hi> so
the French being without a head in <hi>Italy,</hi> became like a body without a
soul: on the contrary, this chance added force and courage to the enemy, who
began to make their approaches, whereby to come to battery, and then to
assault; the batteries were raised in five places; the one of six Cannon in
<hi>Sottello</hi>'s quarter, another of four in that of <hi>Vasques;</hi> the
third, of four Cannon more in <hi>Bolognino</hi>'s quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the other of three
Guns apiece, the one in that of <hi>Carlo dela Gatta,</hi> and the other in
that of Prince <hi>Borso:</hi> all which playing continually up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Town,
and falling with their approaches into the ditch, the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants at last beat
a Parley, and not long after concluded that they would surrender the? Town,
upon Articles, that all the French should march out safe and free, and might
have a safe conduct to convoy them to <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle;</hi> that they should go
out with Drums beating, match lighted, Colours flying, Bullet in mouth, their
Flasks full of Powder, and that they might carry with them what Baggage they
would: There marched out about 1800, whereof 1400 bore Arms, the rest were sick

               </gap> wounded; and they were attended
by 3000 Horse to <hi>Cassalle,</hi> under Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon these terms was <hi>Bremi</hi> surrendred, after thirteen
days Siege; a place of so great concernment for the preservation of the State
of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain;</hi> well provided of instruments and munition for its
defence, and of victuals for the defenders; and since it seemed strange, that
such a place, so well provided, should be surrendred in so short a time; the
French, who were not able to endure it, impleaded the Commander thereof, a man
of low birth, and perfer'd by <hi>Cricky</hi> (whose Groom of 
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:53250:321"/> the Stable he had been) to that charge; he was accused
of cowardize and of treachery; and not long after by Order from the King he was
beheaded publickly in <hi>Cassalle;</hi> but more for cowardliness then
treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Many will have it, that having gotten much money by dead pay, as
not having kept so many Souldiers as the King allowed for, he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred the
Town for fear of losing the moneys he had got, in case the Town should be taken
by assault; and that this was the treachery which he was accused of: This Town
continued in the hands of the French from the end of <hi>November</hi> 35, till
the end of <hi>March</hi> 38, wherein it was re-gained; when it was taken, it
was better fortified; and the French having kept it so little a while, it was
said that they had built, furnish'd, fortified and munited, it for the Crown of
<hi>Spain:</hi> being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it seemed also to be a curb to <hi>Cass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and that it kept all that part of the State of <hi>Millain</hi> from the
inroads of the enemy; and that from thence the Spaniards might now make

importance, the French could not boast that they had any receptacle for their
Armies in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> to the conquest whereof they had
aspired; great rejoycing and Bon-fires were made for this in <hi>Millain;</hi>

civil War was mixt with Forreign War; which being not long after the Dukes
death brought by Spanish Forces into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> was there exercised
with much fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour between the two Crowns; the which <hi>Piedmont</hi> being to
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford field room, and the State of <hi>Millain</hi> Arms and fomentation, the
Millinaeses suffered no small prejudice upon the same account wherein the
Piedmonteses suffered much more; for the better knowledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it will be
necessary to take our rise a little higher.</p>
            <p>There hath always been a competition for the guardianship of the
Pupil Princes who are to succeed in the States, between the Mother, and the
neerest kindred of the Fathers-side; which competition, though by the Roman
Laws it be generally decided on the Mothers behalf, yet being in substance
variously practised by the Princes of the blood, is not as yet decided, but
depending; for it hath sometime been given absolutely to the Mother, sometime
to the kindred on the Fathers-side, and sometimes joyntly to both; nor hath
<hi>Piedmont</hi> been exempt from the like Competition; where though sometimes
the kindred on the Fathers-side have been allowed the Guardianship of the Pupil
Princes, yet this hath hapned either by force of Arms, or by the Mothers death,
or because the Fathers kindred have been chosen to be Guardians; but this case
not having hapned in this our age, it was not evident in what condition the
kindred was under the Supream Regency of the Mother; and every one interpreted
this obscurity to the Mothers advantage; yet the condition of times, and
accidental Circumstance, have always had a great stroke herein; in these
present ruptures, the Princes could not be more crossed, not onely in their
pretending to Guardianship and administration of State, but even in their
returning to their own Country, from whence they were excluded; for to boot
that they were far off when the Duke their brother died, whereby the Duchess
met not with those oppositions which she might have had, had they been
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent; their being in much disgrace with the King of <hi>France</hi> made
much against their pretentions at the present; for whereas they had formerly
profest to adhere constantly to the King of <hi>France</hi> and his party, they
had with little respect quitted him a little before their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death; and
with much scandal to his Majesty, were gone over to the King of Spains side;
Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> was the first, who being dista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted by the Duke h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s brother was gone from
<hi>Savoy,</hi> where he was Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, and past privately with his wife and
Children into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to the Infanta his Cousin-german; where taking
up Arms, he stuck not to come into the open field as Captain and Conductor of
the Spanish <pb n="630" facs="tcp:53250:323"/> Forces, and to march with open Colours, as
hath been elsewhere said, against the Ensigns of <hi>France;</hi> and the
Prince Cardinal, going not long after his brothers departure, upon the same
occasion, from the Court at <hi>Turin,</hi> went to <hi>Rome,</hi> where he
openly disclaimed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of <hi>France,</hi> and turned over to the
Emperour, and to the House of Austria; For which actions, the first being
hostile, and the other so high an affront to the King of <hi>France,</hi> his
Majesty was much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, holding the one for an open enemy, and the other as
totally alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from him and therefore desiring that the affairs of
<hi>Piedmont</hi> might totally depend upon him, he would not suffer that
either of those Princes who were become followers of the Austrian and Spanish
party should have any thing to do in the Guardianship of their Nephew, or in
the Government of the State; which he would, as in justice it did belong,
should totally and integrally depend upon his Sister. He therefore informed
her, and his Agents did publickly protest, that if she should receive the
Princes into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> much less admit them to share in the Regency,
or administration of State, she would counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene the league which was made
between him and the late Duke, and which was yet in force; and he desired that
the Chief Towns should be assigned over to him, for the safety of the young
Duke, lest the Uncles assisted by the Spanish forces might make themselves
masters of the State, to the perpetual exclusion of their Nephew; Thus by
reason of the Princes being absent from Court, and through the King of
<hi>France</hi> his anger conceived against them, it was easier for the Lady
<hi>Christiana,</hi> sister to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and Dutchess of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> to take absolute possession of the guardianship of her
Children, and of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the State; to the which she was called by the
Laws, and by the ancient customs of the House of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and not
without some testimony of her Husbands Will. She therefore obtained that title
by succession, and reduced the Forts, Arms, Revenues, and treasure of the
State, into her power; which she did the more easily, for that to boot with her
right to the regency, she was then fortified with both domestick and Forreign
Forces which were then great and powerful in <hi>Piedmont</hi> for the Duke, a
little before his death, and also the Marshal, knowing how great an advantage
the Fort of <hi>Bremi</hi> was to them, had an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take
<hi>Vigevano,</hi> a City in the County of <hi>Pavia,</hi> and to fortifie it;
and aspired to greater things: There were therefore about 18000 fighting men in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> part French, and part Piedmontese, who were in a readiness
for such an Enterprize.</p>
            <p>The supream command of the French did, by the death of their
Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the Duke, undoubtedly fall upon his Lieutenant-General the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shal;
and none would think but that he would adhere unto his Kings Sister. The
Piedmontese were commanded by Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Dukes
Horse; one in whom the Dutchess might safely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide, he being a well
experienced Commander, and of approved va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and one whom she upon all
occasions had favoured very much. The place of General of the Foot, being
vacant by Count <hi>Verrua</hi>'s death, was soon conferred by the Dutchess
upon <hi>Iohn Iacinto di Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana</hi> Marquess of <hi>Pianezza,</hi> who was
then Lieutenant-General of the Horse, a man both very wise and valiant. Her
brothers favour being <pb n="631" facs="tcp:53250:323"/> added to all this, she was
immediately after her Husbands death sworn Guardianess of her Children, and
Sovereign Regent in <hi>Vercelli,</hi> by all the Gentlemen and Officers of the
Court, and by the military men that were the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e present, and afterwards was sworn the same in <hi>Turin</hi> by
the supream Senate of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and by the particular decree of the
same Senate, and by all Magistrates, Feudatories, Subjects, and Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sals of the
Ducal house; and in all this, no mention was made of the Princes, nor durst any
seem thereat distasted; and yet the sequel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that though the former
carriage, and present conditions of Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager Dutchess, naturally born to
Govern, were satisfactory to all, and Universally acceptable, yet many of the
<hi>Piedmonteses,</hi> out of an inward affection, and devotion to their
natural Princes, were not well pleased that they should be excluded; but the
evident knowledge that their exclusion proceeded not from the Dowager, and that
she had no hand therein, did not only acquit her from so much rigour in the
opinion of the world, but was a powerful lenitive to mollifie the minds of
those <hi>Piedmonteses</hi> who were well inclined to the Princes; and many of
them considering, more wisely, how many inconveniences the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of
Gaurdians had occasioned in other States, setting all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects aside,
were better pleased that the Regency should be restrayn'd to one alone, then
diffused into many; and it being agreed upon by all that the Mothers right was
to be preferred before any other Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titour, they were not onely not
displeased that it should be in the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager, but did willingly give way unto
it, as justest and safest for the State, and for the publick quiet; One of the
first things the new Regent did, was to send messengers to both these Princes,
to acquaint them with the Duke their Brothers d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ath, and how she had taken upon her the Guardianship of
her Children, and the Regency of the State; and withal how displeased the King
of <hi>France</hi> was with them both; and acquainting them how strong the
French Forces were in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> she admonished them, and did
earnestly, exhort them, that they would keep where they were at the present,
lest if they should come into <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont,</hi> they might fall into some
great inconveniency, by some orders that the King of <hi>France</hi> might give
to his Commanders, which it would not be in her power afterwards to divert; and
telling them how that all this was done, against her will, she exhorted them
that they would endeavour to appease the Kings anger, and by joyning with him
again get into his former good opinion, to the end that they might all of them
joyntly co-operate to the young Dukes quiet, and safety; and as a token of her
good will towards them, she promised to make speedy pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Arrears,
and for the future of their annual allowances, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in French
<hi>Appenage,</hi> which were sequestred from Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> by the
late Duke, after the battel of <hi>Avein,</hi> because he had carried Arms
there against his confederate the King; and as for the Prince Cardinal, though
they were not absolutely sequestred, they were detained, or but slowly pay'd,
for his having past over from one protection to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, nothing could disturb
the calm commencement of the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers Regency, as it was thought, but fear of
the Spanish forces, if they should take upon them to maintain the Princes
pretences; and should strive to bring the Princes into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and
into the Regency of the <pb n="632" facs="tcp:53250:324"/> State by meer force; which was
not very unlikely, by reason of the requisite jealousie, which
<hi>Piedmont</hi> being to be governed by the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager, who was so straitly
united to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> might with good reason bring to the
State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and she was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled that she could no further
be friend them, by reason of the League which continued yet for some Moneths
with the Crown of <hi>France;</hi> Fortune, which would also have her share in
these Ruptures, did mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculously assist her herein; for the Spanish Agents who
governed the affairs of that Crown in <hi>Italy,</hi> reflecting upon the
condition of <hi>Piedmont</hi> as it was now altered by the Dukes death, and
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing the tempests which were likely to fall upon that State, considered
also what might redound to the State of <hi>Millains,</hi> and to the Kings
affairs in <hi>Italy,</hi> by those alterations; Wherefore weighing the
business well, and conferring together by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Messengers, when they
had discuss'd all thing considerately, they were all of one mind, that to avoid
all inconveniencies, they must not distaste the Dowager in her regency, nor
cause any jealousies in her. And the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> being acquainted
with this their resolution, did approve of it, out of the great desire they had
to see the Affairs of <hi>Italy</hi> quieted; the said Agents, doubting that
the Dowager would be compelled by the King of <hi>France</hi> to renew the
league, which he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the late Duke, and desiring to be assured
of her, and to assure her, they propounded unto her, that the King would be
obliged not to molest her in her Regency, but would assist her strongly, if she
would joyn in League with him, and help to drive the French out
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and not allow passage, for the future, to the Forces of that
Crown thorough her Dominions. And lastly, that he would endeavour to make the
Princes her Brothers in law observant to her, so as she would give each of them
what did of right belong unto them. It appeared clearly, that the Spaniards by
their offers labour'd more to accommodate their own Affairs, then to favour
those of the Dowager; which, if she should accept of these offers, would run
apparent ruine; since she could not but draw her Brothers enmity upon her, by
adhering to his Enemies, without manifest danger. Wherefore being desired by
Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Vasques,</hi> an Agent for the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> that
she would send some trusty person to <hi>Genoa,</hi> with whom he might, by
Order from the King, negotiate some Affairs, to the common good and
satisfaction; when she heard by Cavalier <hi>Olgiato,</hi> whom she sent to
<hi>Genoa,</hi> what <hi>Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques</hi> proposals were, she answer'd freely.
That she had alwayes nourish'd thoughts of Peace, and that she would be alwayes
ready to quench any fire which might be kindled; wherein she would engage her
self to the utmost of her power therein. But that she could by no means, nor
did it any wayes suit with her to enter into Warr against <hi>France</hi> upon
the account of <hi>Spain,</hi> nor to separate her self from her Brother in the
present conjuncture of times. And that since she had restored their Appenages
to the Princes her Brothers in law, which was sequestred from them by the late
Duke; and treated with them as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy, and with as much affection as the
present condition of Affairs would permit her to do, she knew not what they
could pretend unto more, nor wherein else the King, upon this account, would
interpose <pb n="633" facs="tcp:53250:324"/> himself. And she was so stead fast to this, as
she would not consent to stand neuter between the two Crowns, though she was
much press'd thereunto by the Abbot; alledging that, during the League, it was
not lawful for her to make such a promise: So as the Spanish Agents seeing they
could get no more from her, who they saw could not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually promise more,
they were for the present satisfied with her good will and intention, which
they knew must, for her own interest sake, keep her from desiring any
alteration; nor did they think to alter their good inclinations towards her.
This was the substance of the negotiation in <hi>Genoa,</hi> between Abbot
<hi>Vasques,</hi> and the Cavalier <hi>Olgiato;</hi> before which meeting
things being past contrary to all mens expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, between the Dowage, and
the Spanish Agents, with reciprocal satisfaction; it was publickly argued
throughout <hi>Italy,</hi> that secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence was held between them, and
that a secret neutrality was agreed upon by the Dowager, between the Arms of
both the Crowns. For the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> according to common
resolution, did openly profess to be far from thinking of molesting her, no not
upon the least occasion. It was also observed, that the Dowager did not in any
manner disturb the Government in the business of <hi>Bremi,</hi> and that which
past in the Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> about these times, did corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate this
indulg'd opinion. As soon as the Cardinal heard of the Dukes death, and that
the Dowager had taken upon her the Regency, to his exclusion, he thought
himself much affronted, to be made subject to her Authority; and resolving not
to submit to such exclusion, he went privately, accompanied with a few, out of
<hi>Rome</hi> towards <hi>Piedmont.</hi> This so sudden departure caused great
commotion in that Court; and every one thinking that it was not done without
knowledge of the Spanish Agents, it was much talked of both in publick and in
private; and it was held to be the beginning of the troubles of
<hi>Piedmont.</hi> Wherefore the Marquess of <hi>Castell Roderigo,</hi> who was
then Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour from <hi>Spain</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> seeing all mens eyes
turn'd upon him, upon this occasion, did publickly declaim against it; and with
many asseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations protested to the Pope, that it was done, not onely without
his counsel or participation, but without his imagination; and that he and all
the Spanish Forces were far from dreaming of any novelty in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi>
and that the Dowager should not be disturbed in her Regency by them, nor by the
King of <hi>Spain.</hi> These things being known in the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> and consequently well weighed by the Cardinal
<hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelieu,</hi> an attentive looker into the ends and counsels of other
men, and especially into those of the Dowager, he thought it impossible that
the Spaniards setting their own interests aside, and those of the Princes, so
neer alli'd in blood to their King, and who had lately declared themselves to
adhere to that Crown, should be, without any compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, so free of their
favours to the Dowager in her Regency. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could not believe but that
she not being content with the King her Brothers protection, had also anchor'd
the ship of her Regency upon the protection of that Crown. And therefore,
though that Crown was very well satisfied upon the account of <hi>Bremi,</hi>
(knowing that it was long ere she had been desired to assist in that defence;
and that as soon as she was requested she made preparations, which should have
appea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed <pb n="634" facs="tcp:53250:325"/>
before <hi>Bremi,</hi> had not the too hasty surrender thereof prevented their
march,) yet were they not altogether free from being jealous of her sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity,
and of so many favourable Demonstrations made to her by the Spaniards. When the
Cardinal was therefore come to <hi>Savo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> he sent the Abbot
<hi>Soldati</hi> to the Dowager, to acquaint her with his coming thither;
whereat she being very much moved, she presently dispatch'd away to him by
three several ways the Count <hi>di Camiana,</hi> the President
<hi>Morozzi,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>di Druen,</hi> with Orders to represent unto
him, in her Name, the impossibility of her receiving him, or his Brother,
whilst they adhered to the House of <hi>Austria;</hi> and that the Officers and
Commanders of the King of <hi>France</hi> his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which were very strong
in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> did freely profess they would proceed with them in
hostile manner, if they should come neer <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> and that if she
should receive them she should go against the League, which would make them
pretend that she should assign over the Towns unto them; and to pacifie him the
more, she gave order to those that she sent, to promise him in her name, that
she would pay him his allowance or Appenages, whereof she sent him by these her
Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers some ready moneys in hand: The Prince was pacified, or at least
seemed to be so, with these Proposals; and intending to winter in
<hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa,</hi> staid some days in <hi>Savona,</hi> and afterwards altering
his minde, he returned to <hi>Rome;</hi> whither when he was come, he was
disquieted with what had happened in <hi>Piedmont</hi> after his Brothers
death; he began to sollicite his interest with the Pope by word of mouth, and
by Letters and Messengers with those Princes from whom he thought he might
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any advice or assistance; he made his complaints to them all of the
injuries which he had received, and strove to justifie his pretences; he
alledged the ancient Institutions and Customs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by which he
pretended the Guardianship of the Infant Princes of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the
Regency of the State, during their minority, did belong to the next akin by the
Fathers side; That <hi>Thomaso,</hi> Uncle to <hi>Bonifacio,</hi> had thus
exercised the Guardianship, joyned therein with <hi>Cecily,</hi> Mother to
<hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifacio;</hi> That thus <hi>Amadeo, Guietta</hi> of <hi>Burgondy</hi>
being excluded, was Guardian to <hi>Philip,</hi> and the younger Sons of
<hi>Thomaso di Conte Moriana;</hi> That <hi>Lodowick</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi>
and <hi>Amadeo Conte di Genoa,</hi> had thus been Guardians to <hi>Amadeo</hi>
who was afterwards called <hi>il Verde;</hi> wherefore he ought not to be now
debarred the same priviledg, being so neer al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied in blood and interest to the
Duke his Nephew; That he and his Brother could not justly be banished their
Country, not having done any thing that might deserve such a punishment; That
contrary to all reason, they were declared to be Enemies to those States, the
safety and preservation whereof, especially in such dangerous times, did only
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto them; That the Mother was governed by the advice, and (to the
horrour of all men) begirt by the Forces of those who having great designs upon
those Dominions, were known to be more desirous to get them for themselves,
then to defend them for the Orphans; which the possession of <hi>Pinarvolo</hi>
and <hi>Cassalle</hi> did sufficiently witness; That the Marshal had given
proof of this in <hi>Vercelli,</hi> by the jealousies which he caused there at
the instant of the Dukes death; after which Books de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the presention of
that Crown to the States of <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> 
               <pb n="635" facs="tcp:53250:325"/> were publickly sold in <hi>Paris:</hi> How could those
Forces be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore confided in, which pretend to the owning of those States
to the which at the present they professe protection? that the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of
the Uncles did expresly tend to this, that the Mother might be govern'd as they
pleased who had procured the Uncles to be excluded; with these and the like
examples which were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to many exceptions, and might be replied unto by
many other examples, did the Prince Cardinal goe about to justifie his and his
Brothers cause; and both of them thinking that they might ground their
pretentions best in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> they laboured there, and with
the Spanish Agents in <hi>Italy,</hi> to get their cause to be embraced by
them, and powerfully assisted by their Forces; wishing them also to consider,
how much danger would redound not only to their Kings Reputation, but to his
Affairs and Dominions, that the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream arbitrement of <hi>Piedmont</hi>
should depend upon the pleasure of the King of <hi>France,</hi> by his Sisters
means; which King making himself ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster afterwards of the chief Towns
confining upon the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> might
get a new and a powerful neighbour; that it became not his Majesty to suffer
that he and his Brother should be so persecuted, for the name sake only of
having adhered to him; then he strove to perswade the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> that the business would be easie, by
reason of the peoples inclination, who desired, beyond comparison, rather to be
govern'd by their natural Princes, then by a forreign Lady, who was suspected,
by reason of her greatly enforced and necessary dependancy upon the King her
Brother, upon whom being of necessity to relie; a blind man might easily see
the ruine of the house of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of having the people
recommended to their protection, subjected to a forreign yoke; and that
therefore it was most certain, that when the people of <hi>Piedmont</hi> should
see their Princes accompanied by any considerable strength, they would
unanimously abandon the Dowager, and adhere to them; but these reasons could
not prevail with other Princes who were concern'd at a further distance with
the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and much less with the Spanish Court
and Agents, whom it concerned more neerly; were it either that they were weary
of seeing the war renewed in <hi>Lombardy,</hi> or that fearing, according to
the ancient Spanish maximes, that to wrastle in <hi>Piedmont</hi> would
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly draw on war from <hi>France</hi> in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi>
they desired rather to enjoy the present advantage, then hastily to provoke
trouble; they therefore held it better not to disquiet the present peace,
though it were doubtful, then to enter into new wars, which might be long, and
costly, and of uncertain event: thus thinking it suited better with the common
interest, not to innovate, then to maintain the Princes presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by Forces,
they proceeded cooly and reservedly with them; and seemed more inclined to
disswade them from pursuing so dangerous a business, then to adhere unto them
therein, whereby to make the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wager jealous; they found yet the Princes of
<hi>Italy</hi> lesser inclined to them, who being desired by the Cardinal that
together with their so just cause, they would embrace the common concernment of
<hi>Italy,</hi> which did so much depend upon the good or bad success of
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> none of them would so much as appear to favour their
pretences. The <pb n="636" facs="tcp:53250:326"/> Dowagers affairs seemed therefore to
proceed successfully on this side; if fortune had not pleased to put a spoke
into her wheel here, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wager could
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ave desired no greater safety to
her self, nor to her Sons Principality; and the Princes, though exiled, might
have shared in the happiness, as was thought by those who saw best into
business; but the heavens had destined it otherwise; for the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who was more obliged then the Mother her self, by reason of
the protection he profess'd to take of the young Duke, to preserve the peace of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> which was so necessary for the present affairs of his Sister
and Nephew, became the chief instrument of disturbing it; to the great
admiration of all those who considering the inconstancy and vieiffitude of
humane affairs, wonder'd that the Spaniards who had great reason to oppose the
Dowager, should willingly offer her peace; and that the King of <hi>France</hi>
should purposely disturb it. This King was with miraculous fortune and valour
got rid of the wars and troubles whereinto the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian Forces had brought his
Kingdom, as hath been said before; wherefore he prepared to revenge himself by
falling upon the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and King of <hi>Spains</hi> Territories with as much
fervour as they had done upon his; to this end, he had disburst moneys to the
Hollanders, and to Duke <hi>Weymer,</hi> to the end, that these passing back
over the <hi>Rhein,</hi> might enter <hi>Germany</hi> with the men which he had
furnish'd them withall; and re-enforcing the Swedish weakned party, might renew
war with the Emperour; and these having at last recovered <hi>Schincks</hi>
Sconce, and making ready a powerful Army which they joyned with another Army
that he had raised in his Kingdom, and entring <hi>Flanders</hi> might assault
those Provinces, which were under the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and embroil them
as formerly they had done, but the Swedes and Hollanders cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with the
King, that he should assault the State of <hi>Millain</hi> with a powerful
Army, at the same time that they should fall upon <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Flanders;</hi> to the end, that the Austrian power being assaulted on
several parts might be the more easily subdued, and that the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> being molested in <hi>Italy</hi> might not assist the Austrians
in those parts: he therefore substituted the Cardinal of <hi>la Vallette,</hi>
in lieu of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased <hi>Cricky,</hi> in the command of his Forces in
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and assigned him men and moneys, wherewith to renew the war
in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> which could not be done without the consent
of the Dowager of <hi>Savoy,</hi> the French Armies being to pass through her
State, before they could enter the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> she was therefore
desired by the King not only to renew the League which was made with her
husband, and which was then expiring; but that she would joyn her Forces in
<hi>Piedmont</hi> with his, and resolve to make war upon the State of
<hi>Millain.</hi> The Dowager being no less affrighted, then surprized with
this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, by which all her designs were overthrown, said, and did all she
could to evade it. First, she represented unto his Majesty, how much better
peace would be for her and her Son, in those his tender years, then war; how
much the present times did differ from those when her Husband lived, wherefore
she was to govern her self by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Counsels; that for the present the safety
of her Sons States consisted chiefly in peace, and the ruine thereof in war;
she there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore desired him not to put her upon so dangerous a point; that 
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:53250:326"/> it better became the protection which
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s Majesty profess'd, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
peace in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and to keep
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap>om the revolutions and
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustions of war, then to put it to the hazard of dangerous events by
fomenting war made by his Majesty elsewhere; that the intreaties of his Widow
Sister, and the innocence of his little Nephew, ought to prevail more with his
Majesty, then the fierce cruelty of the Swedes and Hollanders, or the ambitious
and unquiet advice of his Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, who pretend to vent their rage against
the house of <hi>Austr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>a,</hi> at
the cost of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> that his Majesty ought not to subscribe to the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful spirits of other men, in prejudice to an Orphan Prince, who had put
himself under his protection; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
therefore desired that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would be contented to consent to a Truce
with the Austrians for what concern'd the affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> or at
least to a suspension of Arms touching those of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> to the end,
that his Nephew and Client might enjoy quiet, and might avoid those dangers
which the wars that his Majesty would interest him in would draw upon him; that
he would therefore suffer him to encrease in peace, and be well setled in his
Principality, that so he might be better' able to serve his Majesty in
weightier affairs.</p>
            <p>These so just intreaties, accompanied by so strong reasons, might
have prevailed with the King, but they could not move the solid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions of
Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who like the <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> would turn
about the lesser Planets, and make their interests absolutely sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to those
of the King. Being therefore resolved to revenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon the Spaniards
for their attempts made upon <hi>France;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing also moved by the
ancient competitions and emulation which he had long hatched against the house
of <hi>Savoy,</hi> he cared for nothing less then the peace and safety thereof,
so as it might make way for his resentments; wherefore confiding upon the
continual good success of his Counsels, and upon the prosperous conduct of the
Arms of <hi>France,</hi> he was ashamed that the Dowager should so much
distrust them; and professing that both she and her Son would be freer from
mischief, whilst they were within the King of <hi>France</hi> his quarters,
then in the peaceful quietness which the Spaniards offer'd her, he would compel
her, not only to depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Kings party, but to joyn with the King in
carrying on the war against the Kings enemies, as the King would with her,
against her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but the Dowager persisting in being very averse from
entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any offensive war, the Cardinal told her freely, that she ought
not to complain, if the first thunder of war, which was intended for
else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, should fall upon her Sons Dominions; so being much oppress'd by the
Kings demands, and by the Cardinals authority, she tried whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she could
avoid offending either of the Crowns, by going a middle way; she therefore
offer'd the King free passage for his men through <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> and
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and very earnestly desired him that that might content him,
and that he would suffer her Son to enjoy his Territories in peace; but the
Cardinal not being herewith satisfied, she condescended (since she could not
chuse) to the desired League; but only as far as concern'd defending of their
common Dominions, not the offending of others in theirs. The Cardinal would go
no less, but grew more severe in his demands; for thinking (as he said) that
she had agreed upon some <pb n="638" facs="tcp:53250:327"/> secret intelligence with the
Spaniards, he would force her to declare her self openly to be their enemy; he
therefore required that she would declare her self absolutely for an offensive
League against any whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever; whereupon the Dowager called all her
Counsellors and chief Officers of her Court together, and acquainted them with
this so important business; and though they all saw the great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which the
renewing of the League would bring upon the Dukes State, and upon the Dowagers
Regency; yet following the late Dukes example, they thought they had better
break with <hi>Spain,</hi> then provoke the Forces of <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Dowager being forced to take poyson for a medicine,
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the renewing of the League, in the same manner as it had been
agreed upon by the Duke her Husband. This resolution, though it were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
violently extorted from her, was notwithstanding the best the Dowager could put
on in these times of ruptures, not so much for her own interests, as for those
of <hi>Piedmont.</hi> For finding that the King of <hi>France</hi> was resoved
to make the State of <hi>Millain</hi> the seat of War, to joyn with him
therein, was nothing else but to suffer the calamities of War to fall upon the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and to free <hi>Piedmont</hi> from them: Whereas by
doing otherwise, she must have made <hi>Piedmont</hi> the seat of War; the two
last Dukes afforded clear examples in both these cases. <hi>Charles
Emanuel,</hi> joyning with the Spaniards, would op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the succour which the
French intended to bring to <hi>Cassalle;</hi> whereby he did not only lose
<hi>Pinarvolo,</hi> and other. Towns in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but did keep the War
a long time in his own Dominion, to the great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of his people: and
<hi>Victorio Amadeo,</hi> by joyning with the French, carried the War into the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and brought all the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs that accompany War
thither, freeing his own people from them. And yet because, in the conclusion
of the League, <hi>Piedmont</hi> was assaulted by the Spaniards (as shall
hereafter be said) the people, who began to make trial of the trouble and
mischiefs of War, blamed the Dowager, attributing the cause thereof to the
renuing of the League. Wherefore those Piedmontese who wish'd well to the
Princes inwardly, strove to make her and her Government odious, which had till
now been acceptable to all, and whispered amongst the common people, that she
had renewed the League to maintain her power of Regency the better, and to keep
the Princes the more securely far off. These whispers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with those who
knew not what violence she had undergone; nor what Wars and mischiefs would
have resulted from the contrary reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: For doubtlesly, if she had been
assaulted by the French for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusing to renew the League, she had been forced
to call in the Spaniards to her defence; who were very ready in such a case to
maintain her against her Brother. So as they might then have more justly
reproved her for calling in the Spanish Forces, which they so much desired.
More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the falling foul upon <hi>Piedmont</hi> was resolved upon in the
Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> long before the League was renewed. For they no sooner
heard of the League made between the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Swedes
and Hollanders, to the prejudice of the Spanish Crown, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the
State of <hi>Millain;</hi> but the King of <hi>Spain</hi> thought it became him
to provide for the necessary defence of those parts; and as for the 
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:53250:327"/> Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> he gave order to the
Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> that he should immediately march with his Army
against <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and should prevent the Forces of <hi>France</hi> and
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> by which he was likely to be immediately assaulted in the
State of <hi>Millain.</hi> To this effect, he sent him monies and men; and
promised him that he should be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with all things abundantly from
<hi>Germany,</hi> and from the Kingdom of <hi>Naples:</hi> So as the necessity
which the Civilians call <hi>Causativa,</hi> by which the Dowager was compelled
by the Cardinal to joyn with her Brother against the Spaniards, was turn'd to a
necessity, which the same Civilians call <hi>Praecisa;</hi> &amp; therefore she
who was very unwillingly drawn to renew the League, and who by many subterfuges
delay'd the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribing it, when she saw her self assaulted in
<hi>Piedmont</hi> by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, thought it no longer fit to defer it. The
Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> had scarcely done with the troubles before
<hi>Bremi,</hi> nor were the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers well cured of the wounds which they
there received, when these commands came to the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>
from the King; he thought that the State of <hi>Millain</hi> being now free
from the French by the recovery of <hi>Bremi,</hi> his Government should
hereafter be peaceful; but being surprized by new and unexpected orders, he was
forced to turn his sayles according to the unlooked for wind, which was
contrary to his calculation. He therefore by means of moneys newly received,
gave order for the raising of 4000 Swissers; and propounded <hi>Vercelli</hi>
to himself for his first enterprize; to the end, that when he should be master
thereof, his way might be open for further progress in <hi>Piedmont.</hi> This
new War made by <hi>Spain</hi> against <hi>Piedmont</hi> was made in the Kings
Name, without any mention of the Princes or their Interests, which the King did
not then think good to have to do with; were it either that he thought his
Forces sufficient to invade <hi>Piedmont,</hi> without those of the Princes, or
that he thought the making use of their name would do him but little good, and
be of great expence to him; or that he thought it misbecame his Forces to
embrue their hands in civil Wars, and to foment discord between the Nephew and
Uncles, equally allied in blood to him: However it was, the Governour, in
obedience to the Kings commands, sent speedily and secretly to all the
Souldiers that were quartered in the <hi>Lomellina,</hi> that they should march
towards <hi>Palestre;</hi> where having immediately thrown a Bridge over the
<hi>Sesia,</hi> he made his Horse pass over it, that the passes about
<hi>Vercelli</hi> might be taken, and so all supply kept out; and the Foot
being come the same day, towards night, they were suddenly quarter'd in several
places about the Town. The Spaniards and Burgondians were quarter'd between the
River <hi>Sero</hi> and St. <hi>Bartolomeo,</hi> the Italians were quarter'd
between St. <hi>Bartolomeo</hi> and the <hi>Zocolanti,</hi> or Franciscan
Fryars. The Dutch and Grisons, which were newly confederated, and which Grisons
were never before known to fight in the Spanish Camp, were quarter'd between
the <hi>Zocolanti</hi> and the <hi>Sesia:</hi> the Island which is made by the
<hi>Sesia</hi> and the <hi>Sero,</hi> being the most dangerous place of all the
rest, as most exposed to be assaulted by the Enemy, was allotted for quarter to
the Marquess <hi>Iovan Francisco Serra,</hi> a Genoese; to whom the Governour
gave a Brigade of old Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, that he might serve with them as
Camp-master in the present war: and because the place required a better
Garrison to defend it, <pb n="640" facs="tcp:53250:328"/> there were added some Companies
of Spaniards, and Grisons, and some Millaineses; and that so sudden and
unexpected a moving might not appeare strange and unjustifiable; the Governour
leaving Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Trivultio,</hi> at the Helm of the State when he marched
into the State, published a Manifesto in form of an Edict, wherein repeating
what hath been formerly said, he told; that the King of <hi>France,</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Articles of <hi>Ratisbone</hi> &amp; <hi>Cherasco,</hi> had
through threats gotten <hi>Pinarvolo</hi> from the late Duke; and had
afterwards constrained him to joyn in league against the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> which notwithstanding the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> bearing
with that Dukes Childrens minority, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that those States were
governed by a Dowager Princess, had pardoned the hostility committed against
him by the Father, and the Grand-father, and not using any resentment against
the Orphans, or the Widow, or State of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> had continued his
love and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection to that Ducal House; so as he had not onely forborn all
hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but had acquainted the Dowager, that if she desired peace and
friendship with him she should not assist the French Armies with men, Victuals,
or any other thing, nor continue the league with the King of <hi>France,</hi>
but should continue a real Neutrality between the two Crowns; offering her,
moreover, to assist her with all the Forces of his Crown, in case she should be
troubled by her brother, for her Neutrality; that the Dowager not being
permitted by her brother to embrace so justifiable, and so convenient a
contract, was forced to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a league against the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> to the end that the King of <hi>France</hi> might afterwards
possess himself of the Orphans State; that therefore his Majesty being desirous
to continue his Protection to the State, and knowing that there was no other
humane means to free it from oppression; but to make himself master of the
Towns of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he was compelled to assault them, not out of any
intent of keeping them, but to drive out the French, and to compel them to a
good peace; by which when they should restore <hi>Pinarvolo,</hi> and all other
the Dukes Towns, his Majesty would also restore whatsoever he should have
gotten by his Arms in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and that so the House of
<hi>Savoy</hi> being put into peaceful and quiet possession of the States which
it inherited from it's predecessors, might enjoy them in peace and security; he
profest therefore that he intended not to make War upon the Natural Subjects of
the Country, nor to enter <hi>Piedmont</hi> as an Enemy; wherefore he exhorted
the natural Piedmonteses, that as he would not suffer his Souldiers to injure
them, they should also for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear wronging his Souldiers; &amp; that keeping
correspondency with his Majesties Forces they would not oppose their so
justifiable intentions, which aimed only at the well-fare of their natural
Prince, and of <hi>Piedmont:</hi> and he lastly declared, that if they should
do otherwise, and assist the French Forces, he should be forced to alter his
manner of making War, and make them partake of the miseries which war brings
with it usually. This pretence of Protection, clad with graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and
affectionate appearance, was not generally thought real, and, in process of
time, was known to be feigned by the Governour, to make his taking up arms
appear less odious; for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> his Court, and whole
Nation, provoked by Wars made against him, <pb n="641" facs="tcp:53250:328"/> sometimes by
Duke <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> sometimes by Duke <hi>Victorio,</hi> who joyned
in league with <hi>France,</hi> to his prejudice, and now lastly by the
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Dowager; who having renewed the league with her brother, was ready to
make War upon him; not being able to suffer any longer so many hostile Acts,
resolved at last to cast aside all his Royal respects which inclined him to the
good of <hi>Savoy;</hi> and though he knew that the Dowager was compelled to
that War, and that neither she nor her young son were guilty of their
predecessors attempt, and much less of this whereunto they were forced; yet
seeing that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was more neerly concern'd in his
Sister and Nephews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, cared little for what of prejudice might redound
to them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, so as he might make War offensive upon the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did he the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who was the party
assaulted, think himself bound to suffer himself to be wrought upon by those
respects of love and compassion which prevailed nothing with the King of
<hi>France;</hi> The Edict being published, the Governour, in execution of the
Kings Commands, went to encamp before <hi>Vercelli;</hi> which was a City
begirt with walls, strengthned by Bulwarks, and environed by a large Ditch,
beyond the which were many fortifications, ordered and made with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
industry by Duke <hi>Charles Emanuel,</hi> when it was restored to him by
Articles of peace, in the year 1617, after it had been taken from him by Don
<hi>Pedro di Toledo:</hi> by which excellent fortifications which rendred it
almost impregnable, it was in a manner new built. The Marquess
<hi>Dogliano</hi> son in law to General <hi>Villa,</hi> a great confident of
the Dowagers, was Governour of the Town; who together with his Father in Law
opposed the Marshal, when after the Dukes death he would have taken it: two
days before the arrival of the enemies Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, there were two Troops of Horse
entred into the Town, which were sent from <hi>Turin;</hi> which came in a very
seasonable time: for the more secure the Town was by reason of the
fortifications, the more need it had of Souldiers; for there were in it only
three Troops of Horse, the two Troops that came last being therein numbred, and
the Foot of the Garrison, together with the Citizens which were fit to bear
Arms, were far short of that number which was requisite to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend all the
works; but the Defendants, though they were but few, trusting in the relief
which they shortly expected, betook themselves couragiously to the business;
they knew that the French Army was fallen down from the <hi>Alps,</hi> and was
come into <hi>Piedmon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> more
in number by what was given out then indeed they were; but in effect, being
joyned to the Dowagers men they made neer about 7000 Foot, and 3000 Horse. The
French Army was commanded by the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Della Vallette,</hi> and by his
elder brother the Duke of <hi>Candale;</hi> who though they Commanded the Kings
Forces in <hi>Piedmont</hi> with equal Authority, and with the like title of
General, yet the Cardinal had the preheminency in Authority; both by reason of
his being Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, and for that the Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> did more
confide in him; but as the news of these Forces, which were presently to come
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Town, did much encourage the Defendants, so did it make the
Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> the more careful to fence himself against such a
force, which he foresaw would fall upon him, when his Siege 
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:53250:329"/> was at the fairest; and therefore having allotted their
quarters to each nation he betook himself with all diligence to draw the line,
which was about ten miles in compass; a work not only strong for the large
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass thereof, for the greatness and heighth, but more for the deepness of
the ditch which it was environed with, for the Artillery which was set in
several convenient places, and for being very well tackled: the line was soon
finished through the diligence which the Governour caused to be used therein;
but though the work nor workmen were not disturb'd from without, for the great
store of rain which fell, kept the enemy from advancing fast, yet were they
often assaulted from within by the Garrison of the Town; who whilest the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
being busied about their Fortifications, did not much minde the Siege, made out
four Sallies at one and the same time; which being given in four several
places, they were at last repulsed, though they fought valiantly; and in one of
them, which was made on the Governours own Quarters, they left many behind
them, whereof four Captains, and one Serjeant Major. The line being finished,
they fell to make their approaches, and order was given to make batteries; the
Spaniards and Burgonians wrought over against a great Tenaglia which was before
them; the Dutch and Grisons wrought over against another Tenaglia which stood
on the Front of their Quarters; and the Italians wrought also hard against a
great Bulwark which was without the City, all of them striving who should be
the first that should finish their task. And whilst these were thus busied,
they ceased not to molest the City in several manners, particularly with
Granadoes, which flying on high, and then falling into the City, broke down
houses, and few many. They betook themselves also at the same time to the
taking of certain little houses, which though they were without the Enemies
Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were not abandoned by the Defendants. The Dutch went against
these on one side, and the Italians on another; and at last they took them,
though not without much loss of blood to the assailants; amongst the rest
<hi>Bartholomeo Palavicino</hi> was there slain, a Captain of Horse, whilst he
was backing the Foot who fought against the little Houses; Count <hi>Iulio
Cesare Boromeo,</hi> Camp-master, was also slain there. The Defendants were not
discouraged at the loss of these two Houses, but sallying out the next day,
they recovered that which the Dutch had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and slew almost all that had
taken it, and took the Captain Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who was notwithstanding rescued by
his own men before the fight was over, and the same House was again regained by
them, not without much loss of blood: But as the Camp without was held work by
the sallies from within, so did not they cease to molest the Enemies Country
which was without, by sending out Horse. Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> routed a
Troop of <hi>Tronsono</hi>'s Horse; and others did the like. The news of
succour which was coming did this mean while encrease; and the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager being
much concern'd in the preservation of this Town, resolved to go her self in
person to <hi>Crescentino,</hi> where the whole body of the relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Aemy was
to meet: Here she assisted at the general Musters, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the Souldiers
with her presence, and by her fair demeanour, and by her speech, wherewith she
was richly endowed by nature; she in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Captains, and chief Officers,
giving them rich presents, <pb n="643" facs="tcp:53250:329"/> and omitted not any thing
which might incite them to expedition, and to behave themselves bravely in this
business, which, the more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate them, she called hers: but the Army was
retarded by the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of rain, which kept them from marching; at last,
after long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, they marched on with ten piece of great Cannon. The
Cardinal, and the Duke his Brother, who were naturally given to be
extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumspect, slow and irresolute, in all their Military actions,
did also much delay this succour; insomuch as they appeared not in sight of the
besieging Army till 20 days after they had begun the Siege. The Governour had
therefore the longer time to perfect his Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to bring on his
approaches, and to throw a Bridge over the <hi>Sesia,</hi> by which he might
send to encounter the enemy, in case they should attempt to relieve the Town on
that side; at last the first ranks of the French appeared on this side the
River, and all the rest appeared soon after; but the Commanders stood some days
idle, contemplating the strength of the Trenches, which finding to be almost
unvanquisha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they also threw a Bridge over the <hi>Sesia,</hi> over against
the Abbey of St. <hi>Lasaro,</hi> by which they sent men to possess themselves
of that Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, which being defended but by 60 Souldiers, after the making of
some shot, surrendred; here the French made their head-quarter, and began
diligently to fortifie it; viewing attentively on which side, and where, they
might best bring the relief; and the Governour, though at the first appearance
of the enemy he seemed very desirous to fall to an assault, lest in case of
delay his Army might be assaulted by the enemy on the back, yet he was kept
from doing so, for that all things were not ready for an assault.</p>
            <p>For though the Spaniards were already come to the brink of the
ditch of the <hi>Tenaglia,</hi> on the front whereof there stood a Half-moon,
which was made undefensible by their Cannon-shot; and though the Dutch were
also gotten to the ditch of the other <hi>Tenaglia;</hi> yet the Italians, who
were in the middle between them, were not come within 45 paces of the Bulwark
which they were to assault; and yet the Governour fearing to be disturb'd if he
made any longer delay, setting all conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of whatsoever difficulties
aside, gave Order that every one should be ready in their quarters, about two a
clock at night. Thus the sign being given at the hour appointed, they fell on
couragiously; and finding the defendants awake and vigilant, the conflict was
great, and hard, the defendants assisting themselves with Granadoes, Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works
and Stones; and the assailants as valiantly overcoming all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
continued constant in the enterprise. The Spaniards having first of all bereft
the Half-moon which stood before them, of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence by their Artillery, got
upon the <hi>Tenaglia,</hi> and killing some, and taking other some of the
defendants prisoners, they became masters of it, and fortified themselves
therein; the like befell the Dutch, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise took the other
<hi>Tenaglia:</hi> The Italians met with more difficulty, as not being yet
fully prepared; the Bulwark which fell to their share yet overcoming all
difficulties, they advanced unto the ditch, and driving away the defendants
betook themselves to the Bulwark, which not having been plaid upon appeared
impregnable; yet being masters of the ditch they would not quit the enterprise;
but digged a Mine, the <pb n="644" facs="tcp:53250:330"/> fear whereof made the Bulwark be
abandoned the next day; and the assailants took it, and fortified themselves
there: the defendants were astonished at the loss of these three chief places;
the rather for that they saw it was done whilst the French Army looked on; who
without moving suffer'd these three so important Works to be lost; and yet when
those within the Town were offer'd fair conditions by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, they
shewed much courage and confidence in their answer: but, on the other side,
they acquainted the French Army with what they had suffer'd, and in how great
danger they were of being lost, if not soon relieved, not only in defending
themselves against assaults, and in sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying out, but for want of bullet, to
supply the which all the Pewter of the City had already been made use of; upon
which news the French Army advanced to within Musket-shot of the City on
<hi>Sandoval</hi> side, and intending to break down the enemies Bribge they
sent a Fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat down the River, which being detained fell on fire to no
purpose; yet resolving to bring relief, they cast their eye upon the Island
made by <hi>Servo</hi> and <hi>Sesia;</hi> and thinking that, as indeed it was,
to be the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est part, they resolved to pass by there; and to keep the
Spanish Camp from re-enforcing the Island, upon the coming on of night they
made several seeming assaults upon sundry parts of the Line: nor did the
Stratagem prove vain; for the enemy fearing that the succour would be attempted
on a part which was guarded only by the common people, they sent for some men
from the Island, thither; though the Marquess <hi>Serra,</hi> whose charge it
was to defend the Island, did sufficiently oppose it; so about the fourth hour
of the night a Body of 1500 Foot advanced, part French, led on by Colonel St.
<hi>Andrea;</hi> and partly Savoyards and Piedmontese, led on by Colonel
<hi>Senantes.</hi> The Cardinal deputed Monsieur <hi>di Castellano,</hi> a
Marshal of the French Camp, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess of <hi>Pianezza,</hi> General of
the Dowagers Foot, to order the whole action; who had leave to cull out the
best commanded men both of the French and Piedmontese, to order the business,
to discover the foords, and to pass their men thorough them, whilst the rest of
the Army stood ready to keep off any diversion: the relievers waded over the
foord, which came up to their middle; and the Marquess <hi>Serra</hi> prepared
for defence industriously, notwithstanding his Forces were dismembred, they
were stoutly resisted every where; and the attempt would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly have
failed, if aguard of Grisons, who were placed between the Spaniards and
Italians, had fought as stoutly as the rest did; but no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance being there
made (for they basely abandoned the station at the very first brunt) the
relievers began to pass over the Line. <hi>Serra</hi> who was imploy'd
elsewhere when the business began, came to that place; and finding that the
defendants had basely thrown away their Arms, and were directly run away, he
encouraged those few that followed him, and gave in amongst the thickest of the
enemy; where fighting with much danger to himself, and encouraging others by
his example, he stopt the current of the relievers; and though he was shot
through the Arm by a Musket, he continued fighting, till <hi>Francisco
Tuttavilla,</hi> Lieutenant to the Camp master General, came in to his relief
with a squadron of those who were under <hi>Bolognino;</hi> and who having no
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain place allotted them to defend, were appointed to go where there 
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:53250:330"/> should be most need: And <hi>Bolognino</hi> coming in
with the rest after <hi>Tut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavilla,</hi> those relievers who had not yet past
the line were repuls'd. Moreover, the Horse which being distributed into
several squadrons stood in guard between the City and the line, were faulty
also upon this occasion; some whereof ran down-right away, and part being
deceived by the succourers, who in the dark night cried <hi>Viva la
Spagna,</hi> past by those Horse, and stole into the City; and about 1200 of
them entred with the succour, which did prolong the life of the Town for a few
days, but was not sufficient to do so long: For the Enemy having possess'd
themselves of the chiefest out-works, those of the Town were not able to
recover them, though they endeavourd it. For they sallied to recover the
Bulwark which was taken by the Italians; here the conflict was greater then in
other parts and it had been recovered, had not <hi>Bolog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino</hi> advanced
with the most of his men; and, after a bloody contest, forc'd them to retreat;
and the assaults given for the two <hi>Tenaglia</hi>'s had the like fortune;
from both which, after a fierce fight, the Assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were beaten back. The
Governour being angry to see the Town relieved, made some Officers be proceeded
against and put to death; who thorough their carelesness were the occasion
thereof: And when he saw the Defendants beaten back from the recovery of those
places which his men had taken, he made that part of the Island be better
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and put more men into it, by which the Enemy had got in, and made
all the batteries be doubled, the approaches advanced, and all things necessary
prepared to give another general assault. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a squadron of Horse
appeared beyond the River, which turned towards the foot of the Bridge that was
thrown over on the other side, he ordered some Horse to go out against them,
who forc'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Horse to retreat, and slew many of them. The French
Army finding by these proceedings, the impossibility of advancing with
suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, they fell to battery, and placed 16 peece of Cannon on the side just
opposite against the City; which commanding the Island, play'd furiously upon
the fortifications wherewith it was munited. The like was done from the City,
not so much by Cannon, as by Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot; which being given fire unto neerer
hand, hurt many of the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the neighbouring works and Trenches. Those
who defended the Island did not onely shelter themselves against these
batteries, but raised a counter-battery, whereby they did much prejudice to
some Regiments that were come to quarter neerer. In this interim, those of the
City made out a good and gallant sally with 600 Musketeirs, against a little
Fort which was raised in the Island, by which (if it had been taken) great
relief might have been brought into the City. And to this purpose Marquess
<hi>Villa,</hi> who held intelligence with those within the Town, was come to
the River side, and was ready to introduce it; but neither did this attempt
succeed; for those that defended the little Fort stood firm, and with-stood the
first affault, till fresh Horse came in to their assistance; who playing upon
the Enemy on the flank, forc'd them after a long and obsimate skirmish to
retreat, having slain above 50 of them, and taken eight of their Captains,
whereof four dyed, and four remained Prisoners; by reason of this misfo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and for because the Spanish
Horse scouring the Country, kept <pb n="646" facs="tcp:53250:331"/> back victuals, and
keept the Enemies Camp from forraging, the Cardinal, and Duke of
<hi>Vallette,</hi> who had made the battery onely to satisfie the pressing
desires of the Dowagers Commanders, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think upon giving over; they were
hereunto incited by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcement of 4000 <hi>Swissers</hi> which were by
the Governours orders newly come unto the Camp; but they were compelled much
more to abandon the enterprize speedily, hearing that Cardinal
<hi>Trivultio</hi> was come from <hi>Millain,</hi> with 8000 good Foot, and
that he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his march to assault them in their works; so as growing
cautious, and circumspect, according to their custom, they were resolved not to
be entrapped between the Cardinal and the Governour, who was now re-inforced
with new men; they therefore removed their Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and past back over the
<hi>Sesia,</hi> and going round the line by long marches, they intended to fall
upon the enemy on the opposite part of the line which was over against the
<hi>Pralvolo;</hi> which resolution, as it occasioned great consternation
amongst the besieged, who thought themselves abandoned; so did it much comfort
the besiegers, who were not long able to continue in that condition, by reason
of the prejudice they received by battery, from which they could not well
shelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by reason of the stony &amp; gravelly earth; and more by
reason of the thunder of Cannon, and hail of Musket-shot, which absolutely
impeded their works by day, and beat down those which they could make in the
nights, which were now grown short; and it was thought by the
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montese,</hi> and by the Spanish Commanders, that if that battery had
been continued a little longer, the Town would undoubtedly have been freed, and
the Victory gotten. The Lords of <hi>Vallette,</hi> being freed from
<hi>Trivultio</hi>'s imminent danger, by passing over the <hi>Sesia,</hi> sent
some of their Horse a little lower, to the end that being past over the
<hi>Sesia</hi> at <hi>Palestre,</hi> by which way victuals were brought to the
Spanish Camp, they might block up that Avenue. <hi>Palastre</hi> was not onely
taken, but sack'd, and great booty was gotten there; these Horse quarter'd in
the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Towns, thinking that by their yet further keeping the
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Camp from Victuals, it would the sooner be forced to raise the Seige:
they failed in this design, as well because the Camp was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready provided with
as much as might serve them for a fortnight, (in which time the enemies horse
would have been forced to seek new quarters) as also that though the passage by
<hi>Palastre</hi> was blocked up, that of <hi>Novara</hi> was open, by the
enemies departure from the Abby, which was more commodious for the conveying of
Victuals. There hapned many Skirmishes between these Horses and those who
guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the line on that part; and it being known that the French Army, though
it was past over the <hi>Sesia,</hi> would not give over the business; but
rather that being recruited by new Forces come from <hi>France,</hi> they would
quickly return, and joyning with the Horse at <hi>Palastre,</hi> would resume
it with more vigour; therefore the quarter by the Abby was better fortified,
whither that recruit of men were sent, who did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Island when it was
in greatest danger; nor did their provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions cease here; the Governour did
greatly desire to make use of this advantage of the enemies being gone, that he
might the more safely give a general assault, without danger of being fallen
upon by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my <pb n="647" facs="tcp:53250:331"/> on the back: he therefore ordered all
things with the greatest dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that might be; to this effect, he
sollicited all his men to throw gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries over the Ditch; he made the battery
by Cannon be redoubled, to make breaches; and provided for all other things
necessary. So as all their endeavours were to get to the walls by the shortest
way, though it were not very safe doing so; and whilest they were intent
hereupon they heard that the enemy would quarter the next day at
<hi>Prarnold,</hi> a Town on the right hand of the river under
<hi>Vercelli,</hi> not above a mile distant from the line; wherefore though
things were not very well in order, the Governour gave directions for a general
assault to be given the next day; the Italians battery had not as yet made a
sufficient breach in the Wall; and the Spaniards though they had sprung a Mine
between the Bulwark <hi>de Nobili</hi> and that of S. <hi>Andrea,</hi> yet it
proved uneffectual, by a strange accident; for twenty yards of the Wall which
was blown up by the violence of the fire fell down entire and whole into the
same place where it stood before, and did so joyn, as there appeared not any
the least gap whereby they might enter; the Dutch were onely in somewhat a
better condition; for they had made themselves masters not onely of the
platform, but also of a half Moon which was in the <hi>Tenaglia</hi> which they
had gotten a little before; these three Nations going, by the Governours
orders, to the assault, they fought with more courage then fortune: for the
Italians, who under Count <hi>Iovanni Boromeo</hi> coming with much courage to
the breach which was made by the Cannon, and which was not yet perfected, were
sorely gauled both on the Front and Flank, by four pieces of Cannon, by
Musket-shot, and by stones, So as not being able so much as to get over the
Ditch, which was partly full of water, and partly full of stiff Clay, they were
forced to go about by the Gallery, at the Foot of the Wall, and to go round
about above fifty paces, to find the breach, to which not being able to get
without much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice (for they were every where exposed to the enemies
Muskets;) Don <hi>Carlo Della Gatta</hi> resolved to fall with his Brigade upon
the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark from whence the assaulters were played upon; this Bulwark was made
of earth and Fagots, and was environ'd with a dry ditch; so as <hi>Gatta</hi>
thought he might easily gain it; which if he had done, he held for certain
that, the impediment ceasing, the breach might be easiy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; but he was
deceived: for being shot in the leg by a Musket, he was forced to retreat; and
though his Serjeant Major <hi>Iovan Battista Brancaccio</hi> got, with some of
the hardiest of that Brigade, beyond the middle of the Bulwark, yet they were
stoutly resisted, and at last re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd: as were they also who were gotten to
the breach through so many dangers, under <hi>Boromeo;</hi> nor did the
Spaniards do what they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; for having in vain attempted that place where
the Mine had played to no purpose, and failing of their hopes by reason of the
green bulwark, by which they were play'd upon on the Flank, they sent 500 Foot
to take it; who having fought a long while, they sometimes thought to gain it;
as they had done, notwithstanding that it was stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defended, had not the
Governour <hi>Dogliano,</hi> who saw the danger, sent a body of French
seasonably thither under Colonel S. <hi>Andrea,</hi> a stout and understanding
Commander of the same nation; who though <pb n="648" facs="tcp:53250:332"/> he fell being
shot by a Musket; yet having together with the rest dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the part of a
gallant man, the Assailants were forced to retreat; nor did the assault given
by the Dutch prove more effectual; who when they had gotten the plat-form and
the half moon, (as hath been said) went to assault the breach which they had
made: For though it was noysed that the Spaniards had scaled the walls, which
made them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to appear no less forward then they, yet finding the
Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants very ready and resolute, it was not possible for them to advance.
So as the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> finding by the many disadvantages of
the unseasonable assault, and by the good order and resolution of the
Defendants, that it would be but loss of time to persevere in the enterprize,
and that it was impossible to do more; after four hours fierce and obstinate
fight, he ordered a retreat to be beaten, and that the assault should be given
over, by which there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing got but the plat-form and half moon which the
Dutch had taken, and the death of Colonel St. <hi>Andrea,</hi> which was
reputed a great loss by them within the Town. But neither did the Dutch keep
that long which they had gotten, for they were driven from thence within a few
hours, being assaulted before they were fully fortified. And notwithstanding
that they resisted stoutly, yet so furious was the assault, as (none coming to
assist them) they were but hardly dealt with, and many of the chief of them
were slain; amongst which, the Lieutenant of Prince <hi>Borso,</hi> who
commanded them: The reason why no succour was sent, was, for that the Enemies
Horse hearing that the assault was given came from <hi>Parvolo,</hi> and by
falling upon the Line endeavoured to assist the assaulted City, at least by
diversion, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enemy from assaulting the City, to defend their own
Camp, as they necessarily must do. The Assailants and Defendants having vied
who should shew most Valour and Resolution, the Marquess of <hi>Caracena,</hi>
with his Brigade of Spaniards, began to sink a Mine under that wall which
played, and the Italians sunk another under the wall that was batter'd; and the
Dutch, not being able to sit down by the affront which they had received,
endeavour'd the next day to regain the works which they had lost; and going in
a great body to assault them, after a long contest, they lodged in the half
moons pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapet, advanced to the foot of the plat-form, under which they sunk
another great Mine: And when fire was ready to be given, and that they were
prepared for a general assault, the Marquess of <hi>Caracena,</hi> as he was
ready to give fire unto his Mine, and to fall to an assault, might hear a parly
beaten from within the Town, wherewith he presently acquainted the Governour;
who commanding that all offence should be forborne, wish'd him to know of the
Enemie what Articles they demanded? they demanded that Hostages might be given,
and then that the treaty might begin; which being granted, the Treaty lasted
long; at last the difficulty was reduced to the time of surrender: The Town
demanded eight dayes, and the Governour would give but two hours, and both
parties being stiff in their proposals; and answers, it was at last agreed,
that the Assailants should enter the works that were yet in the Defendants
hands, beyond the ditch, at two hours before sun-set next day, and that the
Defendants should march out of the City at <pb n="649" facs="tcp:53250:332"/> two of the
clock the next day, and deliver up the City to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; with leave to
carry away the bones of Duke <hi>Victorio,</hi> who was there slain and buried:
In performance of which agreement, the works were presently quitted, and
afterwards the City was delivered up unto Marquess of <hi>Caracensa,</hi> who
took possession of it, at the end of 40 dayes after the siege was begun. The
Souldiers marched out with their Arms and Baggage, Drums beating, Bullet in
mouth, Match lighted, and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours flying, and carried with them three peeces
of Cannon, with a safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct, to convoy them (and necessary carriages) to St.
<hi>Ia,</hi> as was agreed upon by Articles. And they marched out, if not
glorious for their gallant defence and keeping of the City, at lest with much
honour both to the Commanders and Souldiers, for the singular Valour which they
had shewed in defending the City. The Dowager was much troubled at the loss of
<hi>Vercelli,</hi> she being thereby deprived, at the beginning of her Regency,
of so noble and important a place, the very Bulwark and Frontier of
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and she was not well satisfied with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of
<hi>Valletta;</hi> who being at the time of the surrender in <hi>Parvolo,</hi>
but two miles from <hi>Vercelli,</hi> if he had behaved himself otherwise then
he did, it was thought the City might have been preserved; for he was taxed
commonly with coolness and irresolution, in the whole carriage of this
business. <hi>Vercelli</hi> being surrendred, the Spanish Army kept there,
busying themselves in demolishing the line, and in repairing the walls which
were beaten down by battery. And at the same time the French and Piedmontese
retreated not far off to <hi>Costanza</hi> and <hi>Petegno,</hi> where they
tarried till the Spanish Army returned to the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> which
they did not till they had furnish'd <hi>Vercelli</hi> sufficiently with
Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals and Munition, and with a very good Garrison; At whose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, the
French and Piedmontese Army went to the parts about <hi>Cassalle,</hi> where
they lay loytering all that Summer. For the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our fell fick of a Fever
which he had contracted thorough his pains-ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king during the siege, and which
made him keep his bed two moneths; so as he forbore troubling the Enemy, &amp;
was not troubled by them. But Don <hi>Francisco di Melo,</hi> who was gone long
before into <hi>Spain,</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned into <hi>Italy</hi> about the end
of Summer, with the command also of Governour of the Forces in the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> went not long after the beginning of <hi>September</hi> into
the Field with an Army; and passing over the <hi>Sesia</hi> at <hi>La
Motta,</hi> made as if he would go to <hi>Trino,</hi> that he might draw the
Enemy into those parts; but turning suddenly upon <hi>Bremi,</hi> he past over
the <hi>Poe;</hi> and sending <hi>Carlo della Gatta</hi> to take
<hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maro,</hi> he kept in <hi>Giroli</hi> till the business of
<hi>Pomaro</hi> was ended: which whilst it was prolonged by the difficulty of
battery, and by the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of reiterating Mines, the Cardinal went out of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> together with the General of the Horse, to spy what the
Enemy did; and finding that they came to meet him, he retreated to
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> leaving the Gene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

resistance, between whom, and the General of the Spaniards Horse, some little
skirmishes of very small moment past; and the Spaniards being on their way
towards <hi>Alessandria,</hi> the French and Savoyards past over the
<hi>Poe,</hi> and having taken <hi>Montemango</hi> and <hi>Rifrancore,</hi>
they went to <hi>Filiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zano;</hi> where throwing a Bridge over the

<hi>October,</hi> daily skirmishing with the Enemy, till both of them, forced
by the cold weather, and for want of Forrage, returned to their winter
quarters; the Castle of <hi>Pomaro</hi> being first taken, which was
immediately demolished: whilest affairs proceeded thus slowly in
<hi>Lombardy,</hi> there hapned a Sea conflict, and that no small one, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
<hi>Genoa,</hi> between fifteen French, and fifteen Spanish Gallies: those of
<hi>Spain</hi> were conducted by Don <hi>Roderigo di Velasco,</hi> Captain of
the Admiral of <hi>Sicily,</hi> whom all the rest were under; and they were
full of Foot, who were to land at <hi>Finale,</hi> and so to go for the State
of <hi>Millain;</hi> which being known by the French Gallies, which were come
from <hi>Provence</hi> in equal number under their General, Count
<hi>Poncurletto,</hi> well provided of rowers, and fighting men, and who
keeping upon the Seas of <hi>Provence</hi> went in pursuit of the Spaniards,
but with intention not to fight them till they had landed their men; it hapned
that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, for some occasion of their own, came to Anchor upon the
shore of <hi>Finale;</hi> which when the French knew, they thought that they
had landed their men there, and that therefore they might safely fight them,
and take them whilst they returned empty to <hi>Genoa:</hi> the Spanish
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, who was more couragious then considerate, being aware thereof,
refused not battel which he thought was presented by the Enemy, not considering
how much the Kings interests were concern'd in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict: the French made
towards the Spaniards, full of fervour, and hope; but when they were come neer,
and found them well provided of men, they were somewhat astonished; yet being
so near as they could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, they must be content and fall to work; but
one of them which shut up the left wing, for meer fear, hoysed sail before the
fight began, and escaped the danger: they encountred some miles above
<hi>Genoa,</hi> on the first of <hi>September,</hi> the day being fair and
calm; they fought a long while with equal fortune valiantly on both sides: The
Spaniards were more in number of fighting men then the French, but came short
of them in number and quality of Mariners, who were all Voluntiers, and well
furnished with pebble-stones, which (abandoning their Oars in the conflict)
they threw in such abundance, as the Spaniards not being able to hold their
Muskets in their hands, and much less govern them, they were for a while much
impeded, and of no use: The French exceeded the Spaniards also in Targets, and
in certain little Castles which stood on their Prows, lined some with course
Canvas, some with Mattresses, whereof they provided themselves well, as being
come with an intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to fight; whereas the Spaniards, who came casually to
fight, were unprovided of any such defences; but the French had much more the
better of the Spaniards, by the shameful running away of four of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Gallies, who, the first Volley of Shot being given, withdrew themselves, and in
the heat of the conflict abandoned their compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and yet the eleven
Spanish Gallies which remained fought so valiantly, though upon such
disadvantage, as when the hail of stones ceased, they slew many of the French,
and begun to have the better of the business, had not a stratagem used by the
French gotten them the victory; who began to cry out liberty, liberty; at the
hearing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Spanish Gally slaves, who were partly Turks, partly
people that were condemned to the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

to turn upon their Masters, who not being able to resist their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies at
home, and abroad, after an obstinate and fierce Fight were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Conquered
then Conquerours; and the French being but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dealt with, the Fight was
rather parted, then given over; where in an hours space, there were slain 4000,
between Souldiers, Mariners, and Gally-slaves; the French took five of the
Spanish Gallies; and the Spaniards took three of the French Gallies; the French
returned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Provence,</hi> but with so few men of any condition
whatsoever, as they could hardly rid any way, not sailing above 12 or miles a
day; and set aside the greater number of Gallies that were taken by the French,
and the Spanish Admiral's being taken Prisoner, who being sorely wounded died
within two days, and that the French were Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Field; they got
nothing of advantage by the Fight; and they return'd so slowly, as they left
the Admiral of <hi>Spain</hi> by the way, not being able to carry her
along.</p>
            <p>Not long after this conflict the young Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>
died, in the seventh year of his Age, on the third of <hi>October,</hi> 1638,
within one year after his Father; whose death was the last thing that hapned
that year, and made more way for what hapned afterwards. <hi>Charles

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ending with her for
succession; but that changing the title of Guardian into that of absolute
Prince, he of the two Princes who was to succeed might remain Duke without any
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of right. These ends and intentions were corroborated by speeches
that were quickly given out both in <hi>Italy</hi> and elsewhere, that the
Child, who was of perfect health, was melancholy, and of a weak complexion, and
like his Brother, not likely to live long, and that he was subject to great
sicknesses; that the Dowager joyned closer with the French; and did not only
willingly keep them in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but brought them in; that she treated
of putting Towns and Forts into their hands; and that which irritated the
people more against the Dowager, and took them off from the good inclination
they bare her before, was, that the King of <hi>France</hi> his first Son being
born a little before the Duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> death, the Dowager was in
treaty of a marriage between the young Dolphine and her eldest Daughter, with
the States of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi> for her portion; as if the
succession did belong to her after the death of the two last Dukes, excluding
her two Uncles; and for the better confirmation of this rumour, it was also
said, that the Court of <hi>France</hi> had fallen upon the same consideration,
as might be known by certain printed Papers which were publickly sold in
<hi>Paris</hi> touching this business; and that the Dowager had put this case
to her favorites, the Civilians of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which was very unlikely,
not to say, a ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for, not to say any thing of the disparity of ten years
in age, which was between these two young Princes, and of the various
contingencies which might disturb this match; it was more then certain, that
the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager <pb n="652" facs="tcp:53250:334"/> could have no such thoughts during her Sons
life; and in case he should die, her authority would be at an end, whereby it
would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to effect it; and yet these rumours had some impression
upon the common people, who look not inwardly into things, and upon such as
though they consider them and know them to be very vain, are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
born away with passion, and desire of novelty. The Princes pretences being
favoured by these rumours and new accidents, began to be embraced and protected
by the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Forces, whose Agents had been hitherto deaf to
all entreaties, and far from embracing them; and the people having been found
to be averse to those ends and intentions in the business of <hi>Vercelli,</hi>
wherewith they adorned the war already made against that State, they began to
believe, that if war should be made in <hi>Piedmont</hi> upon the score of
putting the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into the Princes hand, the business would proceed the
better; and that if the Princes would appear therein themselves in person, it
would excite the people to be more fervent in driving out the French, and in
suppressing the Dowagers party; they therefore applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to maintain
the Princes pretences with their Forces, and to listen the more willingly
thereunto. The Prince Cardinal, hearing of his Nephews death, was once more
privately stollen from <hi>Rome,</hi> and was unexpectedly come to
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and because at that very instant the Town of
<hi>Carmagnuola</hi> was found to favour him, and soon after the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Citadel
of <hi>Turin,</hi> it was thought that he was come with a firm belief to be
admitted into them both; in which case, taking it for granted that he should
undoubtedly be favoured by the people, and back'd by the Spaniards, he was sure
that the Dowager would be able to do little, and that his pretentions would be
brought to a happy end; but such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, being usually fallacious, proved to
be so very much in this case; for being come within a few miles of
<hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> he found the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was discovered and prevented; so as
being kept out from thence he turned towards <hi>Cheri,</hi> as a fitting place
whereby to get into the Citadel of <hi>Turin:</hi> being come to <hi>Cheri</hi>
he found there, that the Treaty of the Citadel was also discovered and
prevented. The Dowager was not a little moved, when at the unexpected coming of
the Prince she found so important Treaties discovered; and much more when she
saw the Spanish Forces were advanced to the Confines of <hi>Alba</hi> and
<hi>Asti;</hi> yet not at all dismaid, she failed neither in Courage nor
Counsel; but drawing the Piedmontese Garrison presently out of the Garrison of
the Citadel, she put thereinto a Regiment of Lorreiners, commanded by the
Signeior <hi>di San' Martino,</hi> a Gentleman well vers'd in Arms, and an
ancient ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Court of <hi>Turin,</hi> who had been often imploy'd by
Duke <hi>Victorio</hi> in the Government of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> and of other
chief Towns; and she secured the former Governour, and the other complices of
the treaty; she got the Cardinal <hi>della Valetta,</hi> to convey them to
<hi>Sommari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na del Bosco;</hi> she doubled the Guards of the City, and those of
the Dukes Palace, and put all the Souldiers in Arms; which being done, she
dispatched away Count <hi>Gabaleone,</hi> who was Commissary General of her
Foot, to the Cardinal with Letters, and with a Company of her Guard; who coming
into <hi>Cheri,</hi> and making himself master of one Gate, went to the Prince
Cardinal; and giving him the Dowagers <pb n="653" facs="tcp:53250:334"/> Letter, he told
him how much her royal Highness wondered at his Highness coming in that manner
to <hi>Piedmont;</hi> he acquainted him with her jealousie, by reason of the
circumstances which preceded, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied his coming, and with what had
been then discovered; and finally, he let him know how unsafe it would be for
him to tarry there, in respect of the French Forces threatning him with so
imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; he told him that, notwithstanding, he was very loth that any
thing of bad should befal him; to witness the which, he offer'd him her Royal
Highness Guard to wait upon him to some place of safety. To all this the
Inhabitants of <hi>Cheri</hi>'s intreaties were added; who fearing to be
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with severely, if they should be thought to receive the Prince,
desired him that he would not be cause of so much mischief to them by his
tarrying there; wherefore the Prince finding that his intelligences did no
good, that the Dowager was fortified and well provided upon all occasions,
himself unarmed, being accompanied onely by two Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, a Secretary, and
three Foot-men, he thought fit to give way unto the times, and to wait a better
occasion; wherefore staying but one night in <hi>Cheri,</hi> he departed thence
the next morning, and went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Annone;</hi> being still followed at a
distance by the Dowagers Guard, conducted by <hi>Gabaleone;</hi> but with such
respect, as he seemed rather to be honourably attended by them to the confines
of the State, then compel'd to go out; he tarried in the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> expecting the Prince his Brother, who was to come thither
shortly from <hi>Flanders;</hi> and being displeased he writ back to the
Dowager, that under vain pretences, and contrary to all Laws both Divine and
Humane, he was banish'd from his Paternal Country which God and Nature had
given him; and complaining of the imputations wherewith he was charged, that he
held intelligence in the Towns of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and of his being threatned
with the French Army, he added, that as the small company which he brought with
him into <hi>Piedmont</hi> did fully demonstrate the vanity of the imputations
which were laid unto him; so it shewed how little he feared the French Forces,
building upon the peoples love and favour, against any attempt of the French;
he, finally, desired her not to credit such imputations, and not to shew any
resentment upon those who were maliciously blamed to have held treaties with
him; but this his intercession prevailed not; for being found guilty, they were
by the Senate condemn'd to be put to death; process was made against the
Governour, who was kept prisoner in <hi>Turin,</hi> till such time as he was
set at liberty by the Princes when they took <hi>Turin,</hi> as shall be said
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; and he died afterwards of a natural death, whilst he took up Arms
in the Princes behalf, whose quarrel he embraced as soon as he was at liberty.
The Princes forbore not, for all this, to pursue their pretences; and being
desirous that their justification might precede their taking up Arms, they made
use of the anger which the house of <hi>Austria</hi> had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived against the
Dowager, for her having renewed the League, and for her having joyn'd in Arms
with the King of <hi>France;</hi> and by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Court of
<hi>Spain,</hi> which had embraced their cause, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Monitory
Decree, directed to the Dowager from the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, as from the Sovereign Lord
of <hi>Savoy;</hi> wherein she was fairly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted, to forego the League which
she had renewed with <hi>France,</hi> and <pb n="654" facs="tcp:53250:335"/> to appear
before the Cesarean Tribunal, to justifie the Guardianship of her Son, and the
Regency of the State which she had taken upon her. The Senate, and Nobility and
people of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> were also ordered by the same Decree, to perswade
the Dowager that <hi>Cesars</hi> Orders might be duly executed; but all this
would not do, the Dowager would not admit of such Decrees or Citations;
pretending them to be novelties, and attempts upon the Sovereignty of the
Piedmontese Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality; no Emperour having ever formerly interssed himself
in Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianships.</p>
            <p>This mean while Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> about the end of
<hi>February,</hi> in the year 1639, came from <hi>Flanders</hi> to the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> to prosecute his and his Brothers pretentions; whither as
soon as he was come, they agreed upon the manner and way of making war upon
<hi>Piedmont.</hi> The whole business was by the Emperour refer'd to Don
<hi>Francisco di Melo,</hi> the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Plenipotentiary to the
Princes of <hi>Italy,</hi> with whom, after many discourses, it was concluded;
that war should be made, to possess the Princes of <hi>Savoy</hi> in the
Guardianship of their Nephew, and in the Regency of the State; and amongst
other things it was agreed, that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should assist them
herein, and should work with the Emperour, to declare them to be their Nephews
Guardians and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of the State, to the exclusion of the Dowager; that the
Towns whereinto the Princes should be received by the peoples free will should
have Garrisons put into them by the Princes; and that those which should be
taken by Force of Arms should have Garrisons put into them by the Governour of
<hi>Millain:</hi> he being bound to restore them to whom they should be decreed
by the general Peace; and that howsoever the Politick Government of Justice,
and the Revenues, should belong unto the Princes, as Governours of the State:
but the Governour, who was to make the war, refused to subscribe these
Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulations; for he said, he was ordered by the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to
make the War of <hi>Piedmont</hi> upon his Majesties account; wherefore he
could not alter the title without new Orders: but he assured the Princes, that
he would connive at, and underhand allow them whatsoever was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the
Capitulation. The Princes might clearly see by this, that the Spanish Agents
were not to fight upon their interests, but upon those of the King of
<hi>Spain;</hi> and that they were to make use of the favour and assistance
which the Princes had with the people, for the more happy progress of the Kings
Forces in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and they might have known it better by the very
substance of the Agreement, though the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour should have subscribed it:
but the necessity which the Princes were brought into made them care the less
for future danger, so they might escape the present; or were it that they did
assuredly hope, that all the Towns, even those wherein the strongest Garrisons
were, the Garrisons and Governours being Piedmontese, would willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them, when they should appear with convenient Forces; for they were so
confident of the peoples favour, as they thought it would be always in their
power to dispose of them as they listed; wherefore being desirous to forward
the business, they thought good to give way to what the Spaniards desired. The
Governour making use of the pretence of putting the Princes into the Government
of the State, did <pb n="655" facs="tcp:53250:335"/> not only think to drive the French out
of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self master of the chief Towns of that
Principality; and so to make the Princes, and all <hi>Piedmont,</hi> depend
upon the King. Things being thus established, the Princes plainly let the
Dowager know their intention; which was, to come to <hi>Turin,</hi> to keep
there, to serve her, to take order for their own and for the common affairs, to
defend the Vassals, to free the State from the imminent danger of Forreign
Forces, and to preserve it for the Duke, to whose Guardianship, as also to the
Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the State, they were chosen and deputed by the Emperour, even to
the exclusion of her the Dowager; and yet they added, that they would be
contented to take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in, for a
third, in the Guardianship and Regency; declaring finally, that nothing less
would content them, and that they were resolved to do their utmost, and to lose
their lives, rather then not compass this that was so justly due unto them. The
Dowager, who neither in respect of the King of <hi>France</hi> his authority,
nor for her tie of consideracy, could not only not receive the Princes who
ad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed to the Spaniards, in part,
nor in whole, into the Guardian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Regency, but neither suffer them to
tarry in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> thought this answer to be an intimation of War; but
was not thereat any whit abash'd, but gave order that Proclamations should
presently be made throughout the State, that the people should take up Arms for
the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Lord the Duke, whose preservation was concern'd in this
War; and for the defence of their Country, which was shortly to be assaulted by
Spanish Forces, led on by the Princes; she hoped by this means to prevent their
intentions, but she failed therein; for the people (as the sequel will
demonstrate) were much devoted to their natural Princes; and more inclined to
be govern'd by them then by the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager, who was not now so well beloved by
the people as she was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this innovation, by reason of her so great
dependency upon the King of <hi>France,</hi> by her renewing the League, and by
her removing of the Garrison and Governour of the Citadel. On the contrary, the
people did much compassionate the Princes, by reason of the hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
wherein they were, being banish'd their Country, deprived of their Revenues,
and kept, as if they were publick enemies, from the administration of those
State Affairs wherein they were so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. The Dukes unhealthfulness
(as it was given out) and the small hopes of his life, did much work upon the
peoples affection, on their behalfs; as on those whom they expected should
quickly succeed in the Principality; and the rising Sun having already found
many worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, the generality of the people thought they had but small
reason to place any hopes in the Dowager, and were more inclined to the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the rising Princes, then to that of hers, which for the
aforesaid reasons they thought would be quickly at an end: they also doubted
that very much which the Princes themselves gave out, that in case the young
Duke should sail, the Dowager had resolved to make her Daughter Queen of
<hi>France,</hi> giving her the States of <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Savoy</hi>
for her Dowry, to the irreparable prejudice not only of the succession of the
Princes, but also to the peoples liberty, wherein when the Ducal-house should
be debar'd succession, they ran manifest danger to be subjected to the French
yoke, and be made slaves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; <pb n="656" facs="tcp:53250:336"/> wherefore thinking
themselves more concern'd to adhere unto the Princes then to the Dowager, they
forsook her intrest, and past violently over to the Princes party; and yet many
others confiding in the Dukes health, and in the Dowagers authority, adhered
constantly to her: the people of <hi>Piedmont</hi> were therefore no less
confused, and differ'd no less in opinion, then were the Dowager and the
Princes; between whom no composition being to be made, War must necessarily
ensue. The Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> did, of all other things, chiefly
design to end a petty business; which though it was but a small one, was of no
small consequence; which was, to take <hi>Cengio,</hi> a little Castle in the
<hi>Langhe,</hi> seated on the back of <hi>Savona,</hi> but strong, &amp; fitly
situated, not only for the predomination of the <hi>Langhe,</hi> but for the
passage of Souldiers, who landing at <hi>Finale</hi> go into the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> and of those who upon occasion were to be sent from the State
of <hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Finale,</hi> in relief of that Marquisate, if it
should be assaulted by the French Fleet, as it was then doubted it would be:
the Governour thought also that the Princes would be much helped by this to
enter <hi>Piedmont,</hi> assisted by the King of Spains Forces: for this Castle
was very necessary to <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> for the keeping of the
<hi>Langhe,</hi> which the Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi> did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly affect;
wherefore both the Governour and the Princes thought assuredly, that the
Dowager, who would be forced to succour this place with all her forces, would
be necessitated to draw out the Garrisons from out the more inward parts of the
State, and would leave them undefended, and open, to be assaulted by the
Princes; Don <hi>Antonio Sotelo</hi> was therefore sent with some Brigades to
clear the ways which led to that Castle, and to keep it from having new
Garrisons put into it; and after him went Don <hi>Martind' Aragona,</hi> who
was intended to be the chief Governour of this enterprise, with a good body of
men; who at his first coming there, as he was spying out the fittest places to
plant his Artillery, was shot in the head by a Musket, whereof he immediately
died; in whose place <hi>Sotelo</hi> was chosen by the rest of the Captains,
who fell all of them very busily to effect this business; but the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager, and
Cardinal <hi>Valletta</hi> hearing thereof, were not slow in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to
prevent it: The Cardinal marched with his French from <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle,</hi> and
Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> from <hi>Turin</hi> with almost all the Dowagers
Forces, and joyning together they came within sight of the Trenches which the
Enemy had made; who kept themselves patiently therein, suffering the Bravadoes
which were often made by the others; but when the Enemy seemed to be weary, and
tyred, they came unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly with much fury, out of their Trenches, and after
a long Fight routed the assaulters, killing about 300 of them; and having
pursued them a while, they retreated; and those of the Castle seeing no more
succour appear, and finding the batteries already all in order, and that the
Enemy were prepared to give an assault, they surrendred the Castle, at the same
time that the Governor sent to take <hi>Cengio.</hi> Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi>
went from <hi>Vercelli</hi> with 2000 Dragoons, about Sun-set, and having
marched all night, appeared about break of day before <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vazzo,</hi> a
great Town upon the left side of the <hi>Poe,</hi> twelve miles from
<hi>Turin;</hi> he sent Count <hi>Serravalle</hi> before with eight Horse,
under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of carrying Letters to the Governour of that place, kept there,
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:53250:336"/> till the Prince, who came after him with the Dragoons,
became easily Master thereof; there was then no Garrison in this Town; the
gates were guarded onely by some few Towns men: for though it was a place of
great consequence, yet being far from the confines of the State, and almost
within the bosom of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> it was not judged to need a Garrison,
the rather for that some squadrons of Horse were placed to guard the banks of
the <hi>Dora Baltea,</hi> which were thought suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to guard all the
places seated within that river: but the Prince past a little below them, so
they were no hindrance to him; but passing succesfully on, he made himself
Master of the Town; at which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected accident the Inhabitants were much
troubled; but when they heard [live Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> cried,] they past
from a great fear wherewith they were posses'd to great joy and gladness: and
flock'd unto him with much applause; and were the first of the
<hi>Piedmontese</hi> who rendred him ready obedience as Guardian of the young
Duke: the Inhabitants of <hi>Chivazzo</hi> were not they alone who seemed to
rejoyce at this happy success, but even those of <hi>Turin</hi> did the like:
wherefore it was the common opinion, that if the Prince had presently marched
thither, he might likely enough have been received there with the same
acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and applause, and acknowledged for Gardian of the Duke, and
Governour of the State; the rather for that that City was wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provided of
Souldiers, they being all gone to succour <hi>Cengio;</hi> the Dowager
therefore apprehending danger sent in great haste for the Cardinal, and Count
<hi>Villa,</hi> from the <hi>Langhe,</hi> to provide for the hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
condition of <hi>Turin,</hi> which was much the occasion of the loss of
<hi>Cengio;</hi> for the relievers hearing of the Dowagers from <hi>Turin,</hi>
went with all speed thither, and quitted the relieving of that Castle; the
Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager when she heard of what had hapned at <hi>Chivazzo,</hi> sent the young
Duke, and his sisters, from <hi>Piedmont</hi> into <hi>Savoy,</hi> as into a
place of safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; whereat the <hi>Piedmonteses</hi> were much distasted.
Marquess <hi>Villa</hi>'s wife, who had formerly been the Dukes Governess, went
along with his person: and her children went along with her, as play fellows to
the young Duke, and his sisters; or, as others would have it, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stages for
their fathers Loyalty; <hi>Chivazzo</hi> being taken, the Prince, no occasion
being known why, went not to <hi>Turin,</hi> but towards the City of
<hi>Inurea,</hi> which presently yielded; and the Prince Cardinal joyning with
him, they went together to <hi>Biela;</hi> where they were likewise very
readily received; then turning towards the Valley of <hi>Austa,</hi> they found
the people there also very ready to render them obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, wherein the Baron
of <hi>Castiglione</hi> had a great hand; though the Marquess <hi>di Broz,</hi>
who was Governour of that Valley, and very faithful to the Dowager, endeavoured
the Contrary; for which he was imprisoned by the Princes: thus were they
possest of that Valley, and in a very short time reduced likewise the whole
Countrey of <hi>Biela,</hi> and of <hi>Canevese,</hi> to their devotion; the
Prince Cardinal tarried to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the acquisition of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
whilest Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> went to joyn with the Governour of
<hi>Millain;</hi> who marching with his Army out of <hi>Vercelli,</hi> was also
entred <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and leaving S. <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>a</hi> and <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testura</hi> behind him, he marched tovvards
<hi>Crescentino,</hi> and by the way met the Prince, who was come from
<hi>Chavezzo</hi> to meet him: they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed <pb n="658" facs="tcp:53250:337"/> joyntly to
fall at one &amp; the same time upon <hi>Crescentine</hi> &amp;
<hi>Verrua;</hi> wherefore Don <hi>Iohn di Garrai</hi> being returned
victorious from <hi>Cengio,</hi> was ordered by the Governour, not to pass the
<hi>Poe,</hi> but to affault <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rua,</hi> at the same time that they
should sit down before <hi>Crescentino. Verrua</hi> was affaulted by
<hi>Garrai,</hi> and taken; and soon after the Castle was surrendred by the
Governour thereof, who presently past over from the Dovvagers party, and sided
with the Princes: and the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of <hi>Crescentino</hi> succeeded as
happily on the other side of <hi>Poe,</hi> where there was not above 800 Foot
in Garrison: some assaults were given, &amp; the best resistance was made that
could be: but when they saw the Artillery ready to play upon the Walls, they
surrendred: the Walls were immediately throvvn dovvn by order from the
Governour, to avoid the lessening of their forces, which must needs have been
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by frequent Garrisons: they resolved afterwards to go to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Turin;</hi> and therefore the Governour being past the <hi>Poe,</hi> and
joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the body of the Army, they marched towards it, verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
that the Dowager would not stay to be shut up in the City, and that they should
be the more easily received by the Citizens, she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gone; and that the
Cardinal of <hi>Vallette,</hi> and the Dowagers Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, <hi>Villa</hi> and
<hi>Pianezza,</hi> would not continue to defend the City which was ready to
mutiny; against so gallant an Army: but they found the contrary; for the
Dowager, not at all dismaid at what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; and knowing how necessary her
presence would be to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of that City, which was the Metropolis
of the State; and that it was onely her presence that kept the City from
revolting, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to tarry there; the Cardinal of <hi>Vallette,</hi> and
Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> were already come thither with their Forces from
<hi>Cengio;</hi> and though they heard that <hi>Verrua</hi> and
<hi>Crescentino</hi> were besieged, yet they went not to relieve them; thinking
it necessary for them to preserve their men to desend the Capital City, which
they thought would ere long be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by the Enemy; but hearing that the
Princes advanced with the Spanish Army towards the City, they sent some French
companies out against them; between whom and the Spanish Army there passed some
sleight Skirmissies: the Army marched towards <hi>Rivoli, Colegno, Grasasco,
Bienasco,</hi> and other neighbouring Towns; partly, to know the scituation of
the City; partly, to give time for the ripening of some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence which the
Princes held in the City: as also to observe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Citizens were better
inclined to the Princes, or the Dowager: perswading themselves that the abode
of the Army wherein the Princes were, thereabouts, would move the people to
insurrection: to move them whereunto the Princes Writ to the Chief Gentlemen,
Ministers, and Magistrates of the City, declaring that they would receive the
Gaurdianship of the Duke, and Regency of the State, from their hands,
acquainting them with their pretentions, and objecting many things, whereby to
make the Dowagers power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority invalid. But nothing could perswade the
City to favour them; for the Dowager had made extraordinary provision to curb
such Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens as were likeliest to mutiny; she placed <hi>Corps de Guard</hi>
in many parts, set forth severe Proclamations against any one who should but
offer to stir, she sent many of those who were most suspected out of the 
<pb n="659" facs="tcp:53250:337"/> Town, and imprisoned some: The Artillery of the Citadel
was also turn'd upon the City; and she her self coming out amongst the people,
with an undaunted and manlike Courage, did in her own person ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate some with
the suavity of her speeches, and terrifie others with her bitter threats. So as
the Prince, contrary to his expctation, finding such quiet in the City,
resolved to draw the walls, and to streighten the Town; hoping that want of
things necessary would soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er make it yield then force: He did draw neer the
City, though he was shot at from the walls, and though many Companies both of
Horse and Foot sallyed out of the City, which he easily drove back, and made
himself mas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> of the Bridge, and
Covent of the Capuchins. So as the Horse passing over the <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>oe,</hi> by means of the bridge, came
to the new Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e, from whence some
Troops of French Horse came out against them, who were also forced to retreat
into the City; where the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens seeming very unwilling to take up Arms
against the Princes, there was no confusion wanting. And the Dowager being to
provide against inconveniences both within and without, would not have been
void of thoughts, if Affairs had continued long in that condition; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
since Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> was already drawn neer the walls, and was master
of the field, and endeavour'd to succour himself by Trenches, and by his
approaches to come to grapling; having environed the Suburbs with Trenches, he
sent a Troop of Horse toward <hi>ill Ponte della Dora,</hi> to drive away some
squadrons of French Horse which were there to guard it, but they could not do
it; for they were kept back, and forc'd to retreat by the Artillery of the
<hi>Porta Palazzo.</hi> The Prince Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall came at this time to the Camp,
who went to quarter with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Governour in the
<hi>Vallentino,</hi> a Palace of pleasure, within 400 paces of the City, upon
the left side of the <hi>Poe,</hi> a little above the Capuchins bridge, part of
the Army quarter'd about this Palace, and part quarter'd in the Suburbs between
the <hi>Poe</hi> and the City. They then planted two batteries; one at the
<hi>Casetta Verde,</hi> against the <hi>Porta Nova,</hi> and the other at
<hi>Albergo,</hi> from whence they they began to play upon the City. But this
was of more terrour then prejudice to the people, whom the Assailants did not
desire to harm very much, but to keep them well inclined to the Princes party.
Whilst things were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on thus, before and about the City, the Princes and
Governour found that the Defendants minded onely the safety of the City, for
the preservation whereof they had abandoned all out places; and being neither
willing, nor able to lie long idle there, wasting time more in expectation of
popular commotions, then in being intent upon taking the City by force; they
resolved to send Count <hi>Galleazzo Trotti</hi> with 600 Horse, and 600 Foot
to take <hi>Pontestura;</hi> who having easily mastered the Town, sat down
before the Castle, whither the French Garrison, who at the first appearance of
the Enemy had abandoned the Town, had retreated. And when the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> found that a great body of men were sent from
<hi>Cassalle</hi> to relieve it, he sent Don <hi>Luigi Ponse</hi> after
<hi>Trotti,</hi> with a good number of Souldiers; who coming to
<hi>Pontestura,</hi> just when <hi>Trotti</hi> being gone to encounter the
succour which came from <hi>Cassalle,</hi> had repuls'd them, began to pursue
them, which he did to underneath the Walls of <hi>Cassalle;</hi> and in that
interim, <pb n="660" facs="tcp:53250:338"/> the Castle seeing the relief repuls'd, yielded;
from whence six hundred French march'd out in good order, and went to
<hi>Cassalle:</hi> Some Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of agreement were had, whilst the Camp lay
before <hi>Turin;</hi> for though the Dowager were assured by her Captains and
Officers that she could run no danger, there being a competent number of
Souldiers in the City able to defend it, and by reason of the secure and ready
refuge which they had to the Citadel; as also of the succours which they might
confidently presume would speedily be sent from <hi>France;</hi> yet, were it
either that she might divide the Princes from the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of
<hi>Millain,</hi> or that she might allay the fervour of Arms by Treaty; she
listned to the propositions of agreement which were propounded by
<hi>Monsignore Caffarelli,</hi> the Popes Nuncio then Resident with her, in the
Popes name, and they were these. That the Princes should acknowledge her to be
Guardianess and Regent; So as they might have some Towns allowed them for
security of their persons, and that each of them should Governour of some
Province; into which Towns or Provinces no Forreigners might be introduced, as
neither into any other part of the State. And that there should no account be
made of the League made with <hi>France;</hi> nor that any of the parties
should hereafter enter into Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>gue
with any Forreign Prince or Potentate, without reciprocall agreement.</p>
            <p>These Proposals tended, as all men might clearly see, to take off
the Dowager from adhering to the French, to the end that being deprived of so
great a stay, the Princes Authority by the favour of the people might be
greater then the Dowager did now allow it to be. The Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger was aware of
this, who answered, that they should have Towns, and Governments, and all
reasonable advantages allowed them, if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reconciled to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> who she assured them should very willingly receive them into
favour, they would order things so as she might have no occasion to fear the
Spanish Forces. These Proposals being diametrically opposite came to no
conclusion; for the Princes perceived, that as they had endeavoured to separate
the Dowager from the King of <hi>France,</hi> that she might be subject to
their authority; so she, by her answer, shewing that she understood their ends,
did endeavour to separate them from the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> so to reduce
them under her Authority, which was maintain'd by the French Forces; so as not
being able to agree, and the Princes and Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> finding
at last, that by reason of the good order taken by the Dowager the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty made
no commotion, and that they were there without will, or wherewithal to force
it, they after having stayed there eight days, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to be gone, and to go
against such Towns of the State as were neither well provided, nor could easily
be succour'd: The Prince Cardinal departed first, and went down the
<hi>Poe</hi> to <hi>Chivasso,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Inurea;</hi> and the
Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> leaving eight Brigades of Foot, the Neapoli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>an Horse, the Dutch Curassiers, and
Dragoons, and four pieces of Artillery with Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> under
<hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> pass'd with the rest of his Army over the
<hi>Poe</hi> at the <hi>Capuchins</hi> bridge, and went to <hi>Pontestura;</hi>
and Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> with the men that were le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t him went by the bridge of
<hi>Montcalleri,</hi> strait towards <hi>Villa nova;</hi> whither being come
about break of day with a thousand Horse <hi>en croupe,</hi> 
               <pb n="661" facs="tcp:53250:338"/> he at the very first took a half Moon; and seeing the
Sun was gotten well up, wherefore he could not pursue his intended surprisal,
he pass'd that day in articling with Count <hi>Carlo Cacherano</hi> Governour
of the Town, wherein he strove to perswade the Count that he intended only to
keep the State for the Duke unprejudiced by the French Forces: But the
Governour being firm, and not consenting to any thing he could say, the Prince
ordered an assault to be given the next day two hours before day-break; which
was done unexpectedly, but with such rigour, as though the Garrison, which were
Piedmontese, and some French, made stout resistance, yet the Prince took the
Town, and made the Governour and Garrison Prisoners: The Town was sack'd; only
the Churches and what was carried thither was preserved: The booty was great;
for the Town was great, rich, and well provided of all things; and the
Towns-men, not thinking to be so used, did not much minde carrying their Goods
into the Churches. The Prince leaving a Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son there of 1500 Foot and 3
Troops of Horse, under Don <hi>Michele Pignarello,</hi> who was Camp-master,
went with the rest of his men to joyn with the Governour, who was gone to
<hi>Montcalvo;</hi> whither being come both at the same time, and <hi>Iohn di
Garray</hi> coming thither the next day, the Town was taken upon surrender, the
Captain retiring to the Castle, where he intended to make what resistance was
possible to be made; the which he valiantly did; insomuch as the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> seeing how obstinate defence was made, and being sollicited by
the Prince to greater Enterprizes, he left Don <hi>Luigi Ponse</hi> with 2000
Foot, and Marquess <hi>Caracena</hi> with 500 Horse, to continue the Siege; and
taking the rest of his men along with him, he went, together with the Prince,
to before <hi>Asti.</hi> The Commendator <hi>Balbiano</hi> was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
the Town, who being placed there by the Dowager appeared to endeavour her
service very much, but was so careless therein, as he was suspected to hold
secret intelligence either with the Spaniards, whom he had served in the Wars
of <hi>Flanders,</hi> or with the Prince, whom when the Town was surrendred he
served; for a Regiment of Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montese, which was of the Garrison of the City,
being revolted over to the Prince, and the Citizens being either terrified with
the sacking of <hi>Villa nova,</hi> or by the revolting of the Garrison, or
being given to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the Princes, they declared openly that they would not
bear Arms against them; so as the Governour not resisting so great a commotion
retreated with the other Garrisons into the Citadel, and left the City to do
what it listed; and the Citizens sent the Keys immediately to the Prince, who
was not well entred the City when the Castle was also sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred. It fared
otherwise with the Siege of <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> which held out against
Batteries, Mines, and Assaults, before it yielded; but when the Captain, who
was a Frenchman, was slain, the Souldiers yielded up the Town after eleven days
stout Siege.</p>
            <p>This fortunate success encouraged the Prince and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
<hi>Millain</hi> to undertake the Enterprise of <hi>Trino;</hi> but the
Captains of the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>my were against
it, fearing the success, by reason that it was so strongly munited as it was
thought impregnable: It was seated in a soil wherein was great store of water,
and little less then Marish; it was extraordinarily well munited 
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:53250:339"/> and fortified by Duke <hi>Charles Emanuel</hi> (who
understood Fortification very well) when he took it in the second War against
<hi>Cassalle;</hi> it was walled about double, and doubly ditch'd; the first
and most inward wall was very high, and strengthned by twenty great Towers,
upon which 20 pieces of Artillery were placed; the second circuit was a very
large and high Platform, whereupon were eleven half moons; and this did not
only keep the inward Wall unprejudiced by battery, but kept it from being seen
by the Enemy: Between these two circuits there was a large deep ditch, and
beyond the outermost another ditch as large and deep; Count <hi>Rovero</hi> was
Governour thereof; but Monsieur <hi>Mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lez</hi> was Captain of the Garrison, one of the most
ancientest French Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels which had served the Dukes of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
therefore of great esteem amongst the Piedmontese. All the Council of War,
hoping for little good by this, did disswade from it; but the Prince and
Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> who were much encouraged by their late fortunes,
feared not being forsaken thereby in this enterprise. The Dowager doubted that,
<hi>Asti</hi> being taken, the Enemies Army would come either upon St.
<hi>Ia,</hi> or <hi>Trino,</hi> both which were unfurnished of Garrisons; she
therefore committed the charge of them to Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> who went
immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately away from <hi>Turin</hi> with 800 Foot, and 1000 select Horse,
intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to distribute the Foot in those two Tovvns: As he came neer St.
<hi>Ia</hi> he understood that Don <hi>Ferrante della Monti</hi> waited for him
upon the way, who was sent into those parts by the Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> with about 500 Dragoons, to keep out any relief that might be
brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Trino.</hi> The Marquess hasted his march, desiring to
encounter Don <hi>Ferrante;</hi> but he failed of his desire; for he was
retreated towards <hi>le Vertole,</hi> neer to <hi>Crescentino;</hi> so as the
Marquess coming without any opposition to St. <hi>Ia,</hi> he left the 800 Foot
there, and two Troops of Horse, leaving order with the Governour of the Town
that he should keep half the Foot for his ovvn defence, and should send the
other half of the Foot, and the two Troops of Horse that very night to
<hi>Trino;</hi> and he himself went presently tovvards <hi>Livor no,</hi> and
<hi>Bianza,</hi> that he might finde out Don <hi>Ferrante;</hi> but missing
him, he pass'd over the <hi>Dora,</hi> and came back to <hi>Turin.</hi> The
Foot and Horse were kept two days in St. <hi>Ia,</hi> before they vvent to
<hi>Trino;</hi> vvherefore Don <hi>Ferrante,</hi> vvho had heard that
<hi>Villa</hi> vvith his Horse vvas pass'd over the <hi>Dora,</hi> made
tovvards the Foot and Horse that vvere going to <hi>Trino;</hi> and meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vvith them in the Forest of <hi>Lucidio,</hi> assaulted them, slevv many of
them, took many prisoners, and vvounded many; and those Horse vvhich could
escape got into thick Woods; and those fevv that escaped death got into
<hi>Trino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This happy success being heard in the Camp just as they vvere
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting upon going to <hi>Trino,</hi> made them resolve upon the
Enterprise; for the haste of sending these supplies did clearly shevv, that the
Tovvn vvanted Defendants, as indeed it did; for the danger of <hi>Turin</hi>
had dravvn the flovver of all the Garrisons of those parts to defend that
Capital City: And the Prince and Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> taking this
present victory as an earnest penny of happy success in this so great
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, thought themselves the more obliged not to refuse the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which fortune made them; going therefore from <hi>Asti,</hi> and passing 
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:53250:339"/> the <hi>Poe</hi> at <hi>Pontestura,</hi> they marched to
<hi>Trino,</hi> which they resolved to assault on four sides; they took up four
chief quarters; two of Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, in one whereof lodged Don <hi>Antonio
Sottelo,</hi> Don <hi>Luigi di Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>castro,</hi> and the Marquess of
<hi>Tavera;</hi> in the other the Marquess of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena</hi> and Don
<hi>Luigi Ponce;</hi> in the third, which was the Italians, were quartered
Marquess <hi>Serra,</hi> and the Counts of <hi>Bolognini</hi> and
<hi>Borromeo;</hi> in the fourth were the Dutch quartered, under Prince
<hi>Borzo</hi> and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Lener;</hi> and 14 pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>des of Cannon being disposed in
convenient places for battery, they began to play hotly upon the Town, and at
the same time to make their appreaches; and by the diligence of the Pyo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers
the approaches were already brought to the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ink of the ditch, over the which they threw two Bridges; and the
Neapolitans, under Marquess <hi>Serra,</hi> had already taken a Mill that was
very convenient for the assault, which was much desired to be given both by the
Commanders and Souldiers; at this time Colonel <hi>For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

<hi>Michiele Pignarelli</hi> with a Nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan Brigade; so as being encouraged
by these recruits, though all things were not yet ready to give assault, yet as
if good fortune had govern'd all things, contrary to all Military reason,
assault was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be given, which they thought it was the more necessary
to do, for that they heard that Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> and the Cardinal of
<hi>Vallette,</hi> muster'd men every where, wherewith they intended to relieve
the Town: all the Camp-masters and Colonels, which were twelve, had places
appointed them, where they were to fall on. The Prince, the Governour of
<hi>Mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

Garrai,</hi> and <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in the ordering of
Affairs; and the defendants apprehended by these preparations that assault
would quickly be given; and therefore endeavoured to fire the Bridges which
were thrown over the ditches, and the other Works which did faciliate the
assault; they persisted in a resolution to defend themselves; grounding their
resolutions not so much upon the largeness and deepness of their ditches, and
the marish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the ground by which the enemy must pass to give the assault,
as in the number of their Artillery; and yet all the assailants, as if they had
been assured of Victory, not considering these difficulties, went all of them
to assault the several places allotted them; and this they did with such brave
courage, as having overcome the Ditches and other Fortifications of the first
circuit, it was not hard for them to enter the City by the second; for all the
people being imploy'd in defending the outward Fortifications, where the chief
resistance was intended to be made, the inward Walls wanted defendants; so as
the former being gotten where the most defence was made, it was easie to enter
by the other, where there were but few defendants; and therefore whilst
Marquess <hi>Serra</hi> and Don <hi>Michiele di Pignatelli,</hi> who were to
fall upon two Half-moons which fenced the Circuit, and which were better
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and harder to be taken then the other Works; whilst I say, they
were intent upon what they had to do, the Marquess of <hi>Caracena,</hi> first,
and Don <hi>Antonio Sottelo,</hi> Don <hi>Lewis di Lincastro,</hi> and Count

opposite part overcome the outward circuit, entred the City; and being entred
assaulted those on the back, who constantly and manfully opposing
<hi>Serra</hi> and <hi>Pignatelli,</hi> manfully persever'd in 
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:53250:340"/> defence of the place; the defendants nor assailants in
these parts, not knowing yet that the Town was taken, and that the business was
done; the City was sack'd and the booty was great, for many had brought the
best things they had thither, as to a place of safety, from the Towns of
<hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and many were taken prisoners;
amongst which <hi>Rovere,</hi> the Governour of the Town, and Colonel
<hi>Meroles,</hi> who yielded themselves upon discretion, when they saw the
defence grew desperate; and so confident was <hi>Meroles,</hi> as being tempted
before the assault was given, by the Prince, to surrender the Town, he would
not hearken to it, but made the Artillery be discharged upon the Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
nor were the Citizens less confident, who fearing nothing less then to be
taken, did not carry their things of best value into the Churches, where they
might have been preserved from the fury of the Souldiers; who though they
spared nothing, were very observant of the Churches; and bare great respect to
what was thither brought, and towards those who had refuge to them; the paucity
of the besiegers death made the business much more glorious, who were not in
all 300, amongst which only two Spanish Captains; the justification of their
cause, in civil affairs, added much to the Princes good success in what was
Military; the Dowager being cited, as hath been said, to appear before
<hi>Cesars</hi> Tribunal, did never appear, no not so much as by her Proctors;
wherefore the Emperour, by publick Decree, named the Princes to be the lawful
Guardians of the young Duke, and Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the States, excluding the
Dowager by name; which Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it encouraged the Princes to continue
the War, so made it the people adhere the more unto them: this Edict of the
Emperours being publish'd by the Princes throughout all <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they
in the first place declared all that had been done by the Dowager as
Guardianess or Regent to be void and null; namely the League made with the King
of <hi>France;</hi> they commanded all the Magistrates and Officers not to
tender her any longer obedience; and that they should appear at <hi>Asti,</hi>
to receive from them the confirmation of the Offices and Charges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
upon them by the Dowager: they commanded the people not to pay her any thing
that was due to the Dukes Exchequer; and the Senate, Counsellors of State, and
Magistrates, that they should make no Confederate meetings, upon pain of losing
their places, and other arbitrary punishments; all these things being added to
the so sudden loss of so many principal places in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> whereinto
Spanish Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons were put by the Princes permission, made the King of
<hi>France</hi> not only endeavour to restore them to their former condition,
but under this pretence to desire the Dowager, that as the Princes had put all
the places which they had won into the hands of the Spaniards; so she would be
pleased to put those that yet remained in her possession, into his hands;
wherefore that she might not distaste the King, upon whose Forces she wholly
did depend; and for that she did believe that by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into the hands
of the French, she might preserve them from the Spaniards, the Dowager
condescended to the Kings demands; and gave way that <hi>Cherasco,
Savigliano</hi> and <hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> should have French Garrisons put into
them, upon condition that the Revenues, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Sovereignty of them should
belong unto the Duke, and that <pb n="665" facs="tcp:53250:340"/> the Towns should be
restored without any pretence to be made by the King, for any expence he should
be at by keeping the Garrisons there, and that the like should be done with
those that should be recovered from the Spaniards, which should be restored
immediately after their recovery to the Duke, without any defalcation to be
made for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their recovery; and it was, moreover, covenanted that
no peace nor suspension of Arms should be made in <hi>Italy</hi> for above one
year, wherein the Duke should not be restored to all Towns taken by the
Spaniards, or held by the French. The Dowager before these conditions were
agreed upon, and before the Towns should be assigned over, would acquaint the
Princes with them, informing them how much the Duke was prejudiced by bringing
the Spaniards into his Towns, and exhorting them to a good agreement, whereby
all these evils might be rooted out; and she offer'd them all fair dealing,
with preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to hers and her Sons dignity and safety; but she received no
other answer to all this, but the same which had been made unto her at
<hi>Valentino.</hi> The Spanish Army went from <hi>Trino</hi> to St.
<hi>Ia;</hi> where the Captain of the Town not awhit dismaid by the good
fortune which the Princes Forces had had, nor terrified at what had befallen
<hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> refused to accept of honourable proposals made by the Princes;
and shew'd great readiness and resolution to defend the Town, though he saw
himself every way begirt by Spanish Garrisons, and quite cut off from that part
of <hi>Piedmont</hi> which held out for the Dowager; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governour
of <hi>Millain</hi> went with part of his men to <hi>Livorno,</hi> and from
thence to <hi>Pontestura,</hi> where he fell to fortifie that place, lest the
French might succour <hi>Cassalle</hi> by that way, and the Prince remained
with part of his men before St. <hi>Ia,</hi> knowing that the place was in want
of victuals, wherewith it could not be full furnish'd from any part, so as it
would soon be forced to come to a Parley. He did, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so besiege
it at a distance, as the Dowagers Commanders despairing to be able to relieve
it, they resolved to try diversion; Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> went therefore out
of <hi>Turin</hi> with a body of Horse and Foot, and with 12 peece of Cannon he
went to <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> and from thence advanced to <hi>Asti,</hi> that
he might make the Prince rise from before S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

he had not Forces suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to take that City, he return'd to <hi>Turin:</hi>
where joyning with the Cardinal of <hi>Vallette,</hi> their joynt Forces
amounting to 8000 Foot, 4000 Horse, twelve peece of Cannon, and 40 cart loads
of Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, they resolved to go directly to relieve St. <hi>Ia;</hi>
marching at a slow rare, according to <hi>Vallettes</hi> custom, they found the
River <hi>Dora</hi> so swoln by rain as they could not throw a bridge over it;
so as they were fain to tarry there two dayes; in which interim, the Prince
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with some Forces to the opposite shore, some sleight skirmishes past
between them: And the Cardinal and <hi>Villa</hi> being hindred by the River,
and being stoutly opposed by the Prince; and hearing that the Town was
surrendred two dayes before the time prefix'd, for surrender, in case succour
should come, the Cardinal of <hi>Vallette,</hi> to the end that his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
might not prove altogether vain, fell upon <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> which
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution though it was then thought to be but to little purpose; yet since
it succeeded, was very lucky for the Dowagers party. They sent to
<hi>Turin</hi> 
               <pb n="666" facs="tcp:53250:341"/> for four other peeces of Cannon,
wherewith they planted their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery against the Gate which looks towards
<hi>Crescentino.</hi> The Prince and Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> were come to
relieve the Town with 4000 Horse, and 6000 Foot, and were gotten to the Chappel
called <hi>L' Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mita,</hi> within a mile of the enemies Camp; where taking up
their quarters, they put themselves in battle array; and began not onely to
annoy the enemies quarters with their Artillery, and with sleight ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursions,
but being come within shot of Musket, they fell to skirmish, wherein some of
the Spanish Horse that charged were beaten back. And just as the battle was
ready to be given, to which both the French and Piedmontese prepared themselves
with much Courage, came the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> whom the King of
<hi>France</hi> had sent with 2000 Horse, and 4000 Foot, when his Majesty heard
that the Spanish Army was encamp'd before <hi>Turin;</hi> a recruit which came
very seasonably both to the Camp and to the Dowagers whole party, which did
droop very much. At the Arrival of these men, which was just upon the coming on
of night, and the Spaniards Courage cooling, they retreated; the next day the
Spaniards finding how hard it would be to relieve the Town, by reason of the
recruit which was come to the enemy, they began to prepare to be gone, which
they did without any disturbance. The Cardinal of <hi>Vallette,</hi> and Duke
of <hi>Longueville,</hi> did then send to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,</hi> who was a Dutch-man
and Governour of the Town, wishing him, that since there was no hope of relief,
he would surrrender. To which he answered, that he desired first to have leave
to send to visit the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards quarters; the which being granted him, and he
being told by those he sent, that the Prince and Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>
were gone; he promised to yield the Town, if it were not relieved within three
dayes; and no relief appearing within the prefix'd time, he sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred the
place, and march'd out with 1500 Dutch, leaving such French and Piedmontese
there, according to Articles, as had fought against the Dowager in the Princes
behalf. The loss of <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> which being recovered, opened the way
to receive and send out any thing to <hi>Turin</hi> by the <hi>Poe,</hi> made
the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> fortifie <hi>Crescentino,</hi> which he had
dismantled a little before; to the end that Navigation by the <hi>Poe,</hi>
which <hi>(Chiavasso</hi> being recovered) was free from <hi>Turin</hi> to
<hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle,</hi> might be blockt up by fortifying <hi>Crescentino;</hi> but
whilst the two enemies Armies were busied before <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> the Prince
Cardinal was not idle, nor were his endeavours ineffectual: For coming out of
<hi>Asti,</hi> onely with his own attendants and some others, he over-ran the
other part of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where there being no forreign Garrisons, he
was received by all the inhabitants with great applause, <hi>Ceva, Cuneo,
Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doni, Beve, Saluzzo, Fossano, Droueto, Busca,</hi> and <hi>Demonte,</hi>
did willingly come in of themselves to his own person, or to those that he sent
to them; and all the chief Towns of those parts and places of any condition,
besides the mean people. All this was done without shedding of blood, and
without shot of Musket, meerly out of the peoples devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by Treaty of
the Governours of the several Towns: And putting Governours and Garrisons into
them, he retreated to <hi>Fossano,</hi> lest <hi>Chiavasso</hi> being taken,
the French might turn upon those parts, and retake the Towns that had
surrendred to him. Nor did he guess amiss, <pb n="667" facs="tcp:53250:341"/> for the
adverse Army turning upon those parts, <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> at their very first
appearance, sent Commissioners to surrender it self in a friendly manner. The
Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> went then with his men to <hi>Carignano,</hi> and
from thence to <hi>Racconiggi,</hi> ten miles from <hi>Fossano;</hi> but he had
no minde to go to <hi>Fossano,</hi> thinking it stronger then it was; nor would
he meddle with it though <hi>Villa</hi> and <hi>Pianezza</hi> strove to
perswade him it was not so strong as he thought: They therefore left him in
<hi>Racconiggi,</hi> and went with the Dowagers men towards <hi>Fossano,</hi>
to make <hi>Longueville</hi> see the easiness of the Enterprize; who when they
appeared, the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants thinking that the whole Camp came, surrendred the
Town that very night; but the Prince Cardinal was first retreated to
<hi>Cuneo,</hi> the strongest place of all those parts, and peradventure of all
<hi>Piedmont.</hi> From hence <hi>Villa</hi> and <hi>Pianezza</hi> went to
<hi>Bene,</hi> which Town, though it were strong enough, yielded the next day.
The Governour <hi>Vargas,</hi> who was a Spaniard, retired with the Garrison
into the Castle of <hi>Bene,</hi> resolving to hold it out to the last:
<hi>Villa</hi> and <hi>Pianezza</hi> divided the care thereof between them;
<hi>Pianezza</hi> quartered in that part of the Town which was nearest the
Castle; and <hi>Villa</hi> kept in the field with the Horse, to keep off
succour. <hi>Pianezza</hi> began to make Trenches; and whilest things were in
this posture, Duke <hi>Longueville</hi> appears with his men; who leaving the
Castle to be taken by <hi>Pianezza,</hi> kept also in the field: The mean while
<hi>Pianezza,</hi> who was come with his approaches to the Castle wall, fell to
make 2 Mines under 2 Bastions, whereunto, after nine days, giving fire, and a
sufficient breach being made, he fell to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault, which was withstood weakly;
for the Defendants thinking to save their lives, by retreating into the Keepe,
minded getting thither more then fighting; but they were so hotly pursued, as
that most of them were put to the Sword; and Captain <hi>Vargas</hi> being
wounded and taken Prisoner, the Castle was taken with much effusion of blood.
These two places being taken <hi>Cuneo</hi> remained, which was separated from
the acquisitions made by the Prince Cardinal, and were likewise the worse for
being separated from it: Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> fearing it, especially since
his Brother was there, went with a body of men from <hi>Asti</hi> to
<hi>Mondovi,</hi> to try whether by lending some help he might free them both
from the imminent danger wherein they were: But hearing that Duke
<hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> was coming to assault him with Forces much stronger then
his, he retreated to <hi>Ceva,</hi> from whence he joyn'd with the Governour of
<hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> who was with his Army in <hi>Asti:</hi> Wherefore
<hi>Mondovi</hi> being aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the Prince yielded to the Duke, who
without any opposition made there a rendezvouz of Arms for his own, and for the
Dowagers Forces, which were under her two Generals, joyn'd with
<hi>Longueville</hi> in that Enterprize. The French and Dowagers Generals
hearing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in what weak condition <hi>Cuneo</hi> was, they resolved to
go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; they had great hopes of taking it; for the Prince Cardinal would
either go out of <hi>Cuneo,</hi> or he would not; if he did, <hi>Corvo,</hi>
who was Serjeant Major there, offer'd to yield the Town to them; and if not,
they were sure to take it, by reason of the small provisions that were there;
and if they should take it, it would put an end to the Civil War, since the
Prince Cardinal, who was the Head of the controverted Guardianship, would be
therein taken Prisoner; whereof Duke <pb n="668" facs="tcp:53250:342"/>
               <hi>Longueville</hi> made himself so sure, as he writ thereof to the King, as
of a thing done; but they were much deceived, for <hi>Cuneo</hi> was not taken,
and <hi>Turin</hi> was lost, which the Prince Cardinal did cunningly foresee;
for Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> whilst he was in <hi>Mandovi,</hi> going to see him
at <hi>Cuneo,</hi> and having earnestly desired him, not to suffer himself to
be enclosed in that unprovided place, which was not such as he ought to
adventure his person therein, and therewith the whole affair, he absolutely
refused his advice; for he held undoubtedly, that if he should go out, the Town
would be lost; and on the contrary, that the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>
would either come with all his Forces to relieve him, or that else he would go
to <hi>Turin,</hi> which he might easily take, all the Dowagers and French
Forces being now in these parts; and the Siege of <hi>Cuneo</hi> being to be
abandoned for the necessary defence of <hi>Turin,</hi> the freedom of his
person, and the like of the Town would ensue; but these very thoughts falling
into the minds of those who fought on the Dowagers behalf, they likewise knew
what dangers <hi>Turin,</hi> and the Citadel, and the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager that was
therein, would be subject to; if when they should go with almost all the Forces
of <hi>Piedmont</hi> to an enterprise so far off, the enemy making use of the
occasion should come strongly against <hi>Turin,</hi> whilst it was unprovided
of defence: it was therefore thought necessary that the Cardinal of
<hi>Valletta</hi> should go with all his men to defend the parts thereabouts;
which resolution was approved of, and pursued by the Cardinal, and was as good,
as necessary; and if it had been as well perform'd as it was plotted, it had
quite ove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> both
<hi>Turin</hi> and the Dovvager would have been preserved from danger; and
<hi>Cuneo</hi> would have been taken, with evident hazard of the Prince
Cardinals person; but the misfortune in performance marred the design, and made
good the Prince Cardinals opinion; when the Cardinal <hi>Valletta</hi> was
gone, Duke <hi>Longueville</hi> went to <hi>Cuneo;</hi> and on the sudden, in
the night season, assaulted the out Works, and forc'd the defendants, with much
loss to them, to forsake the Works and betake themselves to defend the Walls
and the Gates, which the assailants had well nigh taken as they pursued them:
he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had happily begun his business, and had fair hopes of ending it
successfully; but before the Trenches were begun to be made, the whole thred of
the business was cut off by a Letter of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Valletta</hi>'s,
wherein he signified to <hi>Longueville,</hi> that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my came very strong
against him, and that he could not possibly withstand them, unlesse he were
recruited with eight hundred more Horse; though the Duke was somewhat amazed at
this demand, yet he readily sent the desired Horse, that the Cardinal might
have no occasion to fail in what was by common consent agreed upon; but the
want of these Horse forc'd the Duke to abandon <hi>Cuneo,</hi> and to retreat
to a Town neer to <hi>Fossano,</hi> called St. <hi>Albano;</hi> whereby one
part of the Prince Cardinals judgement was verified, that <hi>Cuneo</hi> would
be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to relieve <hi>Turin;</hi> and the other part proved as true, not
long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> having had speech with the Governour
of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain</hi> in <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, at least by diversion, got of him 600 Spanish Foot under

with express <pb n="669" facs="tcp:53250:342"/> promise that all the rest of the Forces
should immediately follow him; so he went forthwith from thence, and came
speedily to <hi>Villa nuova;</hi> where getting 500 other Foot under
Camp-master <hi>Tuttavilla,</hi> he past over the <hi>Poe</hi> about the
evening, and came by night to <hi>Vallentino. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la nu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

come with a great body of men to <hi>Villa nuova,</hi> they were both much
terrified, and began to cry out for help: The Dowager sent Count <hi>Piveas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to the Cardinal of
<hi>Valletta,</hi> desiring that he would hasten to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her and the City of
<hi>Turin;</hi> and the Cardinal fearing, no less then she, to be assaulted in
<hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> not knowing what to do, did not stir. The Prince kept in
<hi>Vallentino</hi> till midnight, giving out fitting Orders for the surprizal
of <hi>Turin,</hi> and in maturing intelligence with those that guarded it; and
having ordered all things well resolved to assault the Town on four sides: The
Marquess of <hi>Caracena</hi> was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to assault the Castle Gate with
the 600 Spanish Foot, which were the very best of that Nation; that beating it
down with a Petard, he might make himself master of it. <hi>Tuttavilla</hi> was
sent to scale the Wall between the Bastion of S<hi rend="sup">ta</hi> 
               <hi>Maria,</hi> and that of
<hi>Citta nuova.</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Alardo</hi> was ordered to fall upon the
<hi>Posto di nostra Signora</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Citadel; and Count <hi>di
Vich</hi> was sent to fasten a Petard to <hi>Porta nuova;</hi> and each of them
had sufficient Orders, Instruments, and Men, given them for what they had to
do; each of them did punctually perform what they were appointed, at one and
the same time, which was at fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> a
clock at night; and the darkness of the season was a great fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance to the
enterprise; and yet <hi>Caracena</hi> could not fasten his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard; for he
found the Bridge drawn up, and the Ladders wherewith he was to scale the Walls
were too short; he notwithstanding fell to break the Steccadoes which lay along
the Courtain toward the Bastion <hi>Verde;</hi> and entred thereby into the
Garden of the <hi>Pallazzo Ducale. Tuttavilla,</hi> who was abandoned by his
guide, who could not endure the noise of a Musket, marching alone with his
Squadron, and groaping in the dark, light upon a Half-moon which was defended
by 500 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; and after having skirmished a while with them, he at last
made himself master thereof; then entring the ditch, to fall to the Scalado, he
also found his Ladders too short; wherefore being called upon by
<hi>Caracena,</hi> he resolved to go to him, and being joyned, they entred the
City by the Garden, and formed two Squadrons upon <hi>Piazza San'
Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanni.</hi> The Dowager hearing that the enemy was entred the Town, withdrew
with her Guard into the Citadel, being waited upon by the Lord Chancellor, some
of the chief Magistrates of <hi>Turin,</hi> and by a great many Ladies and
Gentlemen. <hi>Caracena</hi> and <hi>Tuttavilla</hi> went to the Castle Gate,
they broke the Portculles, and appli'd a Petard to the Gate, which being
thereby thrown down, the Horse entred, which waited there to be let in.
<hi>Fontana,</hi> Captain of the Gate was thought to hold private intelligence
with Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> as also <hi>Amerino,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the
Swissers who were deputed to defend the Steccado; who being corrupted by moneys
made no resistance, but presently past over to the Princes party; for which he
was question'd by the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons. Count <hi>Vischio,</hi> by reason of the great
darkness, and opposition <pb n="670" facs="tcp:53250:343"/> made by the defendants, lost
his Guide, and his Petard; so as not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to execute his Commission, he
entred the City by the Bastion <hi>Verde;</hi> by which the Spaniards and
Italians also entred, the Castle-Gate not being as then opened; nor could
Colonel <hi>Alardo</hi> do what he was appointed, being stoutly opposed, but he
entred by the Castle-Gate, which was now opened; so as before full day the City
was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into the power of the Prince, not any of the Citizens appearing in
defence; for the Dowager had commanded, that upon pain of death, none of them
should stir out of their doors; but when they heard that she was retreated into
the Citadel, and that the Prince was entred the City, they ran out to the
streets and <hi>Piazzas,</hi> with unusual expressions of joy, and flock'd
about the Prince, with incredible applause; but their congratulations, which
lasted many hours, were not any hindrance to what was necessary for defence;
for they presently fell to block up the ways which led to the Citadel, to keep
the City from being from thence assaulted; which was diligently observed all
the rest of the day: at night Lights were put in all the Windows, and the
Citizens stood with their weapons in their hands, together with the Souldiers,
to defend the streets, fearing some sallies out of the Citadel; and the Prince
made the Rampiers be raised, to keep the City from being prejudiced from the
Citadel. The next day things were better secured, by the entrance of the
Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> with the rest of the Army; who, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with
the Prince, viewing all parts as well within as without the City, by which the
City might be entred, they munited it with Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and other necessaries. To
end the work, compleat the Victory, and to put an end almost to the War, there
remained the blocking up of the Citadel on the out-side, and the keeping it
from any succour by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual circumvallations, which required not the
guarding of above three miles; for the Citadel was more then half begirt by the
City. Five days after the City was taken, the French and Piedmontese Army
appeared coming from <hi>Cuneo,</hi> who when they heard the sad news of the
loss of <hi>Turin,</hi> marched speedily to relieve the Citadel; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
no Trenches to keep them off, nor any Forces in the Field to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them, they
secured the Citadel: they quartered their men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, opposite to the City,
towards <hi>la Porporata;</hi> and none but the chief Commanders went into the
Citadel, to kiss the Dowagers hand, and to consult of what was to be done. The
Dowagers affairs begun to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a little by so seasonable a succour, and the
French began to be much encouraged; the Spanish Army was in the City, and all
the Citizens that were fit to bear Arms were very diligent to defend it;
more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Trenches which were over against the Citadel were in good order,
and did shelter the City indifferently well from the shot which were made from
thence. The Marquess of <hi>Caracena</hi> having assisted therein with no lesse
diligence, then danger; who foreseeing how much the defendants might be
damnified by the Garden of the Carmelites which commanded the Trench and
streets of the City, if they should be possess'd by the Enemy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possess'd
himself thereof, and munited it well, and put a good Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son into it; and
therefore though both the French and Piedmontese, who were in the Citadel, did
much desire to assault the City, and to <pb n="671" facs="tcp:53250:343"/> drive the Enemy
from thence; yet the Cardinal of <hi>Vallette</hi> opposed it, and by his
Authority of Supream Command of the French Forces, curb'd the general desire;
yet being overborn by the General order of <hi>Longueville</hi> and of the
other Commanders, and for that he would appear to have some hand therein,
rather then out of his own addicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he consented that 300 of the best men of
the French Army should assault <hi>la Citta Vecchia</hi> under the Marquess
<hi>Nerestano;</hi> who accosted the walls, and fell on furiously; but being
stoutly opposed were forc'd to retreat, with the loss of many of them; amongst
which the Marshal <hi>Nerestano,</hi> and the Camp-masters <hi>Alincourt,</hi>
and <hi>Valiaci,</hi> together with other officers, and gallant Souldiers, and
with little loss to the assaulted; by which, as well he, as the rest of the
Captains, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found by experience how much harder it was then they had
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined to recover the City, and the Dowager being put to great streights in
the Citadel, they thought it fit that she should go from thence, and should go,
together with her Court, to <hi>Susa;</hi> which was so necessary as it was
presently done; she went out with an undaunted spirit, bearing in her bosom two
consolations amongst so many misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes; the one that if she had been
suffer'd to Govern according to her own will she had not fallen into such
misfortune; the other, that the King her brother, who had brought her into that
condition, would doubtlesly bring her out of it, at her departure she left the
Citadel in charge with the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who received it, as
deposited by her, in the King of <hi>France</hi> his name; for she confiding
but a little, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occasion, in the Piedmontese, and in so great
perplexity, and cross fortune, not having Forces sufficient to defend so
important a place, threatned by so neer and powerful an Army, and not having
wherewith to fight, nor to subsist for above two moneths, she thought she could
not do better, then to put it into the protection of the King her brother;
being come forth, and attended by a competent number of hers, she came to
<hi>Susa,</hi> where she waited, looking in vain where this so great storm
would finally fall; a treaty of Truce was afterwards introduced between the
Abbot <hi>Vasques,</hi> in the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>'s name, and
Mousieur <hi>d'Argenson,</hi> on the behalf of the Duke of
<hi>Longue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville;</hi> which was desired by <hi>Longueville,</hi> not so much
for the scarcity of provision in the Citadel, as for the precise orders which
he received from the King at his departure from Court, and which were often
after reiterated; by which he was enjoyn'd that he should rid his hands as soon
as he could of the Wars of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to the end that they being over
he might go into <hi>Flanders,</hi> or <hi>Germany;</hi> but Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> was totally against it, thinking any whatsoever Truce
injurious to his cause, and to the whole business; and for that he knew, for
certain, that the Duke had orders to rid his hands of the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness as soon as
he could; so as departing with the forces he brought, and <hi>Vallette</hi>'s
men being diminished, the French Forces grew very weak; for there was great
scarcity in the Citadel; he moreover (that he might keep the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> from consenting thereunto) added, that the Truce would be
destructive, not onely in relation to the Citadel of <hi>Turin,</hi> but to
<hi>Cassalle;</hi> it being certain that by the Truce some respit would be
given to them both; and did further alleadge, <pb n="672" facs="tcp:53250:344"/> that the
Truce would be prejudicial to the affairs of <hi>Flanders, Germany,</hi> and
<hi>Spain,</hi> as well as to those of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by reason of the
aforesaid orders given to <hi>Longueville,</hi> to go to some of those parts;
and that the King of <hi>France,</hi> when he should have respite from the Wars
of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> would intend those other Wars the more; but the
Governour, who did not believe that <hi>Longueville</hi> had any such orders,
desired to return to <hi>Millain,</hi> and be free from the troubles of Wars,
and perhaps also, being distasted, that such a Garrison should not be put into
the Citadel, when it should be taken, as he would have; and that so the victory
should not appear to be his, but anothers; he therefore was for listning to the
Truce; so they chose Deputies to Negotiate the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; the Dowager chose
Marquess <hi>Villa.</hi> Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> chose Count
<hi>Messerati;</hi> the Cardinal of <hi>Vallette,</hi> and Duke
<hi>Longueville</hi> chose Mousier <hi>d' Argenson;</hi> and the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> chose Abbot <hi>Vasques;</hi> all the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e meeting in <hi>Vallentino,</hi> the Truce was
concluded, which was to begin on the fourth of <hi>August,</hi> and to end on
the twenty fourth of <hi>October;</hi> the conditions to be these:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the City, and Citadel, should remain in the Condition
they were at the present, with power to either of them to make what
Fortification they listed; so as that neither of them should advance their
works beyond a Line, which should be drawn by common consent between the City
and the Citadel; that the Armies should withdrew into their own Towns and
Provinces, and should forbear all Hostility; that none should go from his own
quarters, into the others, without a pasport; that</hi> Cassalle <hi>should
continue in the same condition it was in at the present; onely that it might be
Lawful for the French to change 600 sick and infirm Foot of the Garrison of the
Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, for as many strong and able men; and that it might be lawful to
change Prisoners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Truce being thus concluded, Arms were forborn. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
retired to <hi>Millian,</hi> carrying some of his Army along with him, leaving
some in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and quartering some of them upon the Confines;
Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> was not onely unsatisfied with this Truce, but thought
himself thereby injured, thinking that the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> had
abandon'd him when his business was at the fairest, and when he was as good as
in possession of the Citadel; nor were the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, and the Infanta of
<hi>Flanders</hi> less displeased thereat then he, both of them apprehending
that when the affairs of <hi>Piedmont</hi> should be quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Longueville</hi> would come down with his Forces either into
<hi>Flanders,</hi> or <hi>Germany;</hi> so as they complained grievously
thereof, all three, to the Court of <hi>Spain;</hi> which being no less ill
satisfied therewith then they, feared that when the War should be at an end in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> it would for certain break out in greater fury in
<hi>Catalognia;</hi> wherefore the Governor of <hi>Millain</hi> was very hardly
spoken of in that Court; and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being scandalized both
for his ovvn affairs, and those of others, and the Governour roundly check'd,
and a strict account required of him for it, it was generally thought, in
<hi>Italy,</hi> that the contention touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the putting a Garrison into the
Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> had made the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Millain</hi> make
Truce fearing that it might occasion much strife; but the Governour alleadged
nothing in his defence but the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of his Forces, which was occasioned
by the many Garrisons <pb n="673" facs="tcp:53250:344"/> which he was necessitated to leave
in the Towns which were taken in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> whereby not being able to
keep the Field, he thought it better to desist with honour from that enterprize
by the way of Truce, then to do it with shame, as he foresaw he must ere long
be forc'd to do. But the expiration of the Truce shewed how little justifiable
this his plea was; for though the French Army was recruited with new men during
the time of Truce, and that no supply was sent to the Spanish Camp, yet the
Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> march<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d into the Field with more men then the French did, as shall be
said. But as the Governours plea in his own defence would not bear water; so
the Emperour and the Infanta's fear of <hi>Longuevill</hi>'s Forces proved
vain. For those Forces were left behind in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> to the end that
that Country might not be unprovided of men; and <hi>Longueville</hi> was sent
into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> with onely the Dutch Regiment, to succeed Duke
<hi>Weymer</hi> in being General of the French, which <hi>Weymer</hi> then
dyed; and yet the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> either to resent this action of the
Governours, or to satisfie Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> commanded the Governour
that for the future he would be advised by Prince <hi>Thomaso.</hi> The Truce
was not well concluded, when the King of <hi>France,</hi> and the Dowager were
held to be the breakers of it; he by her will having brought French into
<hi>Susa, Avigliana,</hi> and <hi>Cavor:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 600 sick men of the
Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> being by the Articles of the Truce to be changed for
as many strong and able men, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Millain</hi> would not allow
of the change; against which the French objected, that the reciprocal Articles
of the Truce did not oblige one party between themselves; they therefore said,
that the King and Dowager making joyntly one of the parties, they might do any
thing between themselves, without offence to the League; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they complained that the Truce was broken by both the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for that the
Prince Cardinal by authority of his pretence had made no less acquisition after
the Truce, then his brother had done by all his Forces; since going without any
Forces from <hi>Cuneo</hi> to the Maritime parts, he had obtained <hi>Villa
Franca</hi> and the haven thereof by volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary surrender; as also the Fort S.
<hi>Sospiro,</hi> and the City and County of <hi>Nice,</hi> where he was
received by the people with much applause; and that driving out the Governour
of that Castle, which by art and scitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was impregnable, he soon after
forc'd the Castle to surrender: And that all the people had sworn fealty to
him, as to the Dukes Guardian, which was verily a great acquisition; that City,
Castle, and Haven being one of the chief keys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> upon which
the French had alwayes an eye, and were alwayes intent upon the recovery
thereof, as part of <hi>Provence,</hi> which of ancient right did belong to the
Crown of <hi>France;</hi> and this purpose 4000 Foot were at that time sent
from <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi> under that Governour, and the Kings Fleet kept hovering
upon those Seas; but that the Prince Cardinal had subverted these designes, who
without Arms or any opposition, by the bare authority of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, and by
the peoples ready obedience, had obtained a Fort which had already wearied the
Forces of <hi>France,</hi> back'd by a powerful Fleet at Sea of the Turks,
which was sent to the taking thereof.</p>
            <p>The present conjuncture of times did assist the Cardinal much in
this affair for the French Fleet, which kept flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ng upon those Seas, and the <pb n="674" facs="tcp:53250:345"/>
people of <hi>Provence</hi> who came upon those Confines, made those of
<hi>Nice</hi> much afraid that they should lose that Fort, if it were not
secured by some powerful Chiestain, in those dayes wherein they could look for
no help from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by reason of the great alterations that were
there, and wherein the Dowager being necessitated to assign over her principal
Towns into the hands of the French, they feared she would be forc'd to do the
like with <hi>Nice:</hi> So as they thought they could not do better for the
House of <hi>Savoy,</hi> in these perillous times, for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
that important place, then to deliver it up to the Prince Cardinal, who for his
own concernment would not suffer it to fall into the hands of others; and who
by the assistance of the Spanish Forces might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it from the French. The
people of <hi>Provence</hi> came neer to <hi>Varo,</hi> where they did and
received some prejudice; but hearing of the Truce which was made at
<hi>Turin,</hi> they returned back; and the French Fleet which was feared would
assault the Town at the same time, either had no such intention, or, as the
people said, and thought, was kept from acting any thing by a thick mist. The
French pretended that this action of the Prince Cardinal in taking
<hi>Nice</hi> after the Truce was made, was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a more open and
manifest breach thereof, then the Dowagers bringing in of French into
<hi>Susa;</hi> especially since it was done by one party, to the great
prejudice of the other: And they thought that Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> had also
broken the Truce; who when it was made, obtain'd a Declaration from the supream
Senate of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> for the putting of <hi>Caesars</hi> Decree in
execution, touching the Guardianship and Regency, to the prejudice of the
Dowagers Affairs which were chiefly in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; though she, in defence of her
right, and to keep her Sons sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty indemnified, which she thought was
intrench'd upon by <hi>Caesars</hi> Decree, made the supream Senate of
<hi>Savoy</hi> declare both the Emperours Decree, and that of the Senate of
<hi>Turin-hall.</hi> But because the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Millain,</hi> and the
French, did truly observe the Truce, the rest did nothing to discompose it, but
onely complained; all the time of the Truce the Fortifications of the City of
<hi>Turin</hi> went on, and the French furnish'd the Citadel with whatsoever it
wanted; during the Truce some composure was also treated on between the Dowager
and the Princes: For the Princes presupposing that their advantage in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
should make the Dowager willing to divide, if not the name, at lest the
substance of Guardianship and Government with them; and being desirous also to
make the people see by these overtures of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that what they did was out
of necessity, and not of choice, they sent <hi>Messarati,</hi> a great
Confident of theirs, to <hi>Sus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o propound
some terms of accommodation to the Dowager; which were: That she should be
Guardianess and Regent, and they her Assisters or Coadju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; that all
writings and dispatches should be signed both by her and them; that the
Governours and other Officers should be joyntly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>n by her and them; and that the
publick Revenues should be also dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of and managed by them joyntly.</p>
            <p>These Proposals were neither wholly rejected nor wholly accepted,
but thus moderated by the Dowager: That the signing which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired by the
Princes should be granted them in things of greatest impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; as in
Leagues, Agreements made with Forreigners, Alienations, <pb n="675" facs="tcp:53250:345"/>
Marriages, in making perpetual Leagues, and the like: And touching the chusing
of Officers, that they should have leave to except against any that they should
not confide in, in the Offices of greatest concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: And as for the
Revenues, that proposal was totally rejected: No mention was made here, that
the Dowager should quit the League made with <hi>France,</hi> nor that the
Princes should pass over from the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s party to the French;
a chief point, and which was the basis and foundation of all agreement; from
whence it might be seen, that these Negotiations had rather semblances then
substance. But the French, who saw how hard it would be for them to maintain
the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of <hi>Turin</hi> and of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> the one being in an
Enemies Countrey, and the other far from any places which were held by the
French, and environ'd with Spanish Garrisons, they began to bethink themselves
how advantagious it would be for them, if they could win over Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> to side with their King; by which they should not only secure
both the Citadels, but should re-gain many places of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> by
means of the peoples favour, who they saw were much inclined to Prince
<hi>Thomaso:</hi> They thought therefore to draw him over to them by large
gratifications; they made very advantagious offers to him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in in process
of time, and upon occurrences, they enlarged themselves. The King was gone from
<hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Dolpheny,</hi> the more to countenance his Sister, and
the Affairs of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and when he was come to <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble</hi> he
was desirous to speak with her, and sent for her to come to him: She very
willingly pass'd the Mountains, and went to see the King, with great hopes of
receiving comfort from him in these her so many and so sad afflictions; but
instead of comfort or consolation, she found her self wounded with yet a more
mortal accident then all the rest. Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> being (as he
always was) desirous to improve the Grandezza of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi>
not content with such Towns of <hi>Piedmont</hi> whereinto the Dowager had
consented (as hath been said) that French Garrisons should be put; nor being
content with the very Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of <hi>Turin,</hi> which was lately assigned
over by the Dowager into the hands of the French, made the King desire her that
she would permit that a French Garrison, under a Piedmontese Governour, might
be put into <hi>Mommiliano,</hi> the only refuge, and, as may be said, the
sacred An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of the Principality. She had no readier answer for this so
unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected demand then her tears, which pour'd abundantly down from her eyes;
which, as they mitigated the Kings desire, so did they the more exasperate the
Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi>'s acrimony, who was the Authour of the demand; who
treating thereof afterwards with the Dowager, tried first to win her consent
thereunto by Reasons, saying, That since she was to fear her husbands Brothers,
and that she could not trust much in her Subjects, she ought to resolve upon
nothing but upon throwing her self into her Brothers arms, and absolutely rely
upon him: And when he saw he could not work upon her by his reasons, and found
that her denial proceeded from her Counsellors, who were by her, who perswaded
her never to yield to any such demand, he strove to terrifie them with threats
and angry looks, that they might alter their minds, and perswade the Dowager to
grant what the King demanded; but his perswasions to her were in vain, and his
threats and severe looks <pb n="676" facs="tcp:53250:346"/> as vain to the rest; for the
Dowager not at all astonished or dismayed at her former adversities, nor at
this present demand, which was fuller of horrour then all the rest, resented
the unjustness of the demand with a more then manlike courage; and her Officers
and Advisers, not daunted with the severe threats of one that was likely to put
them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, kept constant in their Loyalty to the Dowager, and to their
Duke: Moreover, the Savoyards, who had some inkling of this business, being
very averse unto it, entred the Town with a Garrison, resolving to lose their
lives rather then it should fall into the hands of the French. The Cardinal
being more then meanly incensed at this denial, began to sit upon the skirts of
the Dowager, and, in revenge, desired occasion to ruine her affairs, which he
was not long in meeting with; for Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> having sent Count
<hi>Messerati</hi> to the Court of <hi>France,</hi> to treat with the King and
<hi>Richelieu</hi> upon the large offers which were made him, he found them at
<hi>Lions,</hi> in their return from <hi>Grenoble,</hi> and brought back word
from the Cardinal, That not only the offers which were made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Prince
should be confirmed, but promised greater things touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his pretentions with
the Dowager, and that he should be maintained and upheld therein, so as he
would drive out the Spaniards that were in <hi>Turin;</hi> and that even the
Dowager should be excluded from thence; for he would order it so as she should
keep in <hi>Savoy,</hi> and that she should be forced to all his pretentions,
except such as the King could not with honour consent unto: But all these
offers would not prevail with the Prince, were it either that he doubted they
would not be made good, having small reason to expect that more account should
be made of his concernments than what he appa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ently saw was made of the Kings own Sisters; or were it that he was
advised to the contrary by the Prince Cardinal, and by <hi>Messerati</hi>'s
self, who was totally inclined to the Spanish party: But resolving not to break
off the Treaty altogether, the Prince answered, That he would not accept of any
of those offers, unless he might be permitted to remain a friend to the
Spaniards, or at least be a Neuter between the two Crowns; which not being
granted him (for the King of <hi>France</hi> his only end in making him so
great offers was, that, together with him, he might make War upon the State of
<hi>Millain)</hi> the Treaty broke off; and yet the greatness of these offers,
which at the present seemed to effect nothing, like seed sown in good ground,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced afterwards new and more high pretentions, which brought forth at last
the fruit of those dissentions and alienations which were at the present
expected; for the Prince, being proud to have such offers made him by the King
of <hi>France,</hi> began to be scandalized, that though he was a Prince, and
Child of <hi>Spain,</hi> and had been honoured so in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, yet in
reallity he was treated but as a private Cavalier, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any setled
allowance, whereby he might maitain his Court and menial Servants, but was fain
to use means daily to the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> for his maintaining of
them; and much more, that the had no independent Authority or Command, as
became a Prince of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and though when the Truce was made, and
wherewith the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was not well pleased, the King had ordered
the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Millain</hi> that he should do nothing for the future
without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ng with the
Prince: yet were it either that the Governour had some <pb n="677" facs="tcp:53250:346"/>
private Orders to the contrary, or that he was tied by his Order only to
consult, but not to execute, or that he abhorred to have his authority bounded
by the Prince his pleasure, he acted not according to the Prince his opinion,
but as he listed best himself, from whence dis-sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction grew daily. The
Prince began to demand that he might have an Army depending upon none but
himself, which he might manage as he would himself; and that he might have a
certain perfix'd allowance setled for the maintenance of himself, and of his
Court.</p>
            <p>These were high demands; and such as were not easie to be
grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the scarcity of men and moneys in these times being considered, and
the present condition of affairs; but though the passages between the Prince
and French had made the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> jealous of him, yet they made
him as necessary for them, since they saw the French endeavoured so much to
draw him over to them; so as neither the Agents in <hi>Italy</hi> nor the Court
of <hi>Spain</hi> durst exasperate him by denials: his demands were therefore
refer'd by the King to Count <hi>Sirvela,</hi> who going to the Prince assured
him of the Kings good opinion, and said he was very willing to give him
satisfaction; but because the Prince, when he came out of <hi>Savoy</hi> and
sided with the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> had sent his Wife and Children to the
Spanish Court, as Hostages of his fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and had given her Commission to
put him and his whole Family into the protection of that Court; and that his
Wife in performance thereof, by the consent of President <hi>Costa</hi> whom
the Prince had given her for her Counsellour, had subscribed a publick writing
to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose in <hi>Madrid,</hi> which the Prince would never ratifie,
though he had been often desired to do it; therefore the Count who was very
willing to give him all satisfaction, demanded the ratification of that
writing, before he would enter into any treaty with him. The Prince, who when
he had nothing to relie upon but the King of <hi>Spains</hi> favour was slow in
ratifying it, was now more obdurate therein when he was so sought unto by the
King of <hi>France;</hi> so as no treaty was commenced, the Count thinking it
stood not with the Kings honour to proceed otherwise; and perhaps he had
received such instructions from the Court, to prolong the conclusion of the
treaty by propounding such difficulties. The Governour of <hi>Millains</hi>
carriage to the Prince co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated to these proceedings, who was more liberal
to him in furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with monyes then he had been formerly; and did more
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently follow his advice in the managing of War; and granted more unto him
then he had formerly done; especially in things wherein the main business was
not concern'd, to the end, that obtaining that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which he could not do
by express covenanting, he might adhere the more constantly to the Kings party;
so as what by reason of the better satisfaction which he received, what by the
progress which the Spanish Forces made in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and by the yet
greater which he hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they would make, he bare the better with it.</p>
            <p>Let us now re-assume the thred of Affairs which ensued, from which
the Treaties of Peace, and the Interests of Parties have a little deviated
us.</p>
            <p>The Truce being concluded, and the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi>
being gone (as hath been said) into <hi>Alsatia,</hi> the Cardinal of
<hi>Valletta</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed in 
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:53250:347"/> 
               <hi>Rivoli,</hi> being much distasted and anger'd at the
heart, by reason of the unfortunate success which had hapned in his
Generalship, the blame whereof he saw was laid upon him; and his Brother, the
Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi> who was joyn'd with him in the Government of the
War, died seven moneths before him in <hi>Cassalle;</hi> so the Arms of
<hi>France</hi> in <hi>Piedmont</hi> wanting a Commander in chief, the King of
<hi>France</hi> sent <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Lorrein,</hi> Count <hi>d'
Harcourt,</hi> thither to be his General; he who by his Fleet at Sea had
happily recover'd the Islands of <hi>Provence</hi> from the Spaniards; who
being come to <hi>Piedmont</hi> a little before the Truce was to end, being
desired by the Nuntio to prolong it, seemed very willing thereunto; yet the
effects shewed that he dream'd of nothing less, then of consenting to any the
least delay; but he appeared other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that he might lull the Governour
asleep, and make him negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in making provisions; to the end that when the
Truce should be expired they might fall to War again, as he was resolved to do:
his reason of not proroguing the Truce, was, the necessity of relieving the
Citadel of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> which was ready to be lost if it were not
speedily relieved. On the contrary, the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> though
by his Speeches and Demonstrations he seemed to be wholly averse to the
prorogation; yet he desired nothing more, in his heart, then that the Truce
might be prolonged, out of his thirsting after the same Citadel of
<hi>Cassalle;</hi> which being but weakly garrison'd, and being every where
begirt with Spanish Forces, he knew that by a long Siege it would fall of it
self into his hands; and thought that it was reduced even to extremity: but
Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> who desired more to make the Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi>
sure, then to gain that of <hi>Cassalle;</hi> and who, contrary to his will,
had given way unto the Truce, was unwilling to have it prolonged, neither did
he believe it would be; for that the new General, as well as the Governour,
foreseeing how prejudicial the prorogation would be to the Citadel, he was sure
it would never be granted: he therefore admonished the Governour not to suffer
himself to be fed with vain hopes, nor to trust the enemies fair speeches, who
as soon as the Truce should be expired would assuredly march into the Field;
wherefore he exhorted him to be prepared, lest he might be assaulted at
unawares. The Governour was of another opinion, either out of his desire of
see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truce prorogued, or being detained by the inconveniences which
lying in the Field bears with it, or by reason of the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for
necessary preparations, which believing that they would be superfluous if the
prorogation should succeed, as he believed it would, he desired to spare; and
finding that <hi>Harcourt</hi> could not be rid of the Nuntio, who continually
sollicited him to prolong the Truce, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that he had a good mind
thereunto; but being at last ascertained by the Prince, that the French who
were quartered abroad in several parts of <hi>Piedmont</hi> during the Truce,
now that it drew neer to an end, went to joyn with their General, who lay in
<hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> he began to be un-deceived; wherefore going from
<hi>Millain,</hi> he went, but not with all his men, to <hi>Pavia,</hi> and
from thence to <hi>Asti,</hi> where he tarried observing the enemies
proceedings; who giving still good words, and holding on the treaty more then
ever, would not suffer the Governour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair of a good conclusion, which he
strove to make him believe was <pb n="679" facs="tcp:53250:347"/> now neerer then ever: at
last <hi>Harcourt</hi> making an express Messenger appear at the very
expiration of the Truce, who feigning to be sent from the Court, brought him
precise Orders from the King not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogue the Truce, but to carry on the
War, he bad farewel to all Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations, and also to the Nuntio, who out of
hope of obtaining a proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation did study it much. The French when this
feigned Post appeared were ready drawn out in order; so as the General, at the
same time that he dismiss'd the Nuntio, commanded them to march toward
<hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calleri,</hi> they being about 9000 fighting men, whereof about 7000
Foot, and the rest Horse, those Piedmontese being numbred in, who were come to
joyn with him under Marquess <hi>Villa.</hi> The Governour understanding
(contrary to his expectation) that the Treaty was over, went from <hi>Asti</hi>
to <hi>Villafranca,</hi> where he heard from the Prince, that the French
marched to <hi>Cheri;</hi> and therefore he counselled him to draw neer to St.
<hi>Paolo,</hi> and to the Towns within a mile of <hi>Villafranca,</hi> by the
ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ghbourhood whereof he might
secure <hi>Cheri,</hi> and oppose any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of the enemy, without exposing
his men to danger being so neer <hi>Villanova;</hi> he sent him word that he
would come out of <hi>Turin</hi> with 2000 Foot, and 600 Horse, and that he
would come to <hi>Cheri</hi> by the way of the hills, so as the enemy being
assaulted by one of them before, and by the other behind, he might undoubtedly
be discomfited. <hi>Cheri</hi> is a Town of large circuit, abounding in all
things, full of Inhabitants; and being one of those which made up the circle of
the siege of <hi>Cassalle, Harcourt</hi> having cast his eye upon it, thinking
that if he should take it, he might open a sure and fit way to send relief to
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> which was now his chief intent. There were but five hundred
Dutch in <hi>Cheri,</hi> who were sent thither, when the Truce was expired, by
the Prince under Colonel <hi>Formestre,</hi> together with some troops of
horse, too small a number for so great a circuit. The Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> sent the Prince word from <hi>Villafranca</hi> that he would
advance, and wish'd him to do the like from <hi>Turin;</hi> to the end, that
enclosing the Enemy between them, they might easily rout them. But fortune
often makes a laughing stock of the best grounded designs; the Governour being
come to the foot of a hill, which was the mid-way between him, and
<hi>Harcourt,</hi> and which kept the French and those of <hi>Cheri,</hi> from
discovering the Spanish Army: The Governour defer'd passing over this hill till
the next day, which if he had done the same day, as undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly he might,
<hi>Harcourt</hi> would not have dared to attempt <hi>Cheri,</hi> for fear of
being assaulted by the Governour, whom he would have seen upon his back; and
the Inhabitants and Garrison of <hi>Cheri,</hi> encouraged by the Governours
being so neer, would have done more then they d d in their own defence: but no
opposition appearing, <hi>Harcourt</hi> came to the Town; from whence-six
Troops of Horse issued forth, and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished four hours space with 400 French
Horse, which were the first that appeared. But af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er a long fight, the main body of the French Army came
up unto them, which forced the others to retreat to <hi>Cheri,</hi> upon whom
the Gates of the Town being shut, lest the enemies Horse might enter a long
w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>th them, they ran as fast as
they could towards <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> whither they got safe and unpursued. The
French being come to <hi>Cheri,</hi> were notlong in planting their Cannon
against the walls, but it <pb n="680" facs="tcp:53250:348"/> was more then needed; for
those of <hi>Cheri</hi> seeing none appear to assist them, and wanting men
enough to defend the Town, they feared to be plundred: So as the same night,
without the consent of the Dutch Captain, they by Marquess <hi>Villa</hi>'s
means articled to surrender the Town; the next day Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> who
marched with his men towards <hi>Cheri,</hi> might see the Dutch that were come
out of <hi>Cheri</hi> come towards him, and the Governour who had past over his
in another part, heard of the surrender. They both were astonished at the news
of so sudden a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render; and having lost the hopes of their expected victory,
they halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Hills, expecting to hear from one another, what they were
to do next; But <hi>Harcourt</hi> hearing that the Governour advanced, left his
baggage, artillery, and all incumbrances behind in <hi>Cheri,</hi> and march'd
with his men into the field, and advanc'd to fight him; which when the
Governour heard, he made two squadrons of Horse, and some Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketiers, advance,
that they might fall upon the enemies Van; and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ordered Don
<hi>Iohn di Garrai,</hi> to draw out the Souldiers in order; and whilst the
Horse which were sent before by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our skirmish'd with the enemies Van,
<hi>Carpano</hi> Captain of the Spanish Horse, and <hi>Tavanes</hi> Serjeant
Major of the French Army, were hurt; but <hi>Harcout</hi> hearing that Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> was faln down from the hills and was come to assault him on
the back, lest he might be taken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, made his Reer his Van, and with
speed retreated to <hi>Cheri,</hi> whose Inhabitants were doubly blamed upon
this account; First, for having been too hasty in surrendring, when two reliefs
were so neer; Secondly, for not having advertised the Prince of the enemies
going out of the Town, when they went to encounter the Governour, for then he
might have advanced, and might have recovered the Town, might have taken the
baggage and artillery which were left therein by the French, and might have
falne upon the enemy joyntly with the Governour. The Governour, when he saw the
occasion was over, went to <hi>Santena,</hi> a Town within three miles of
<hi>Cheri,</hi> upon the way by which you go from <hi>Cheri</hi> to
<hi>Carmagnuola;</hi> and mustering all his men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he resolved to
besiege the enemy, from thence, who were in <hi>Cheri.</hi> And knowing by
those that he had taken, that they wanted victuals very much; he made account,
that since they could receive none but either from <hi>Carmagnuola</hi> or
<hi>Montcalleri,</hi> he might hinder any from coming from
<hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> by his keeping at <hi>Santena,</hi> and might also keep
any from coming from <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> by sending a Garrison of a thousand
Foot thither, and some Horse, and that consequently the Town would quickly be
relinquish'd for want of food; which <hi>Harcourt</hi> foreseeing, he thought
by one and the same means to free his men from Famine, and (which was his main
end) to send relief to the Citadel of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> which stood in great
need thereof. He therefore sent 400 Horse out of the Town, with men <hi>en
croup,</hi> who passing by the hills of <hi>Montferrat</hi> which lead to
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> met with no opposition, except at the village
<hi>Gazzino,</hi> where some Troops of Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi>'s Horse were
commanded by his General Don <hi>Mauritio,</hi> who though they made some
resistance, yet the French made their way valiantly thorow them, and got with
little loss into <hi>Cassalle;</hi> and Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> came forth also
with almost all the Dowagers Horse, and thereby not onely freed the Town from 
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:53250:348"/> Famine, which began to be very great, but thought also
to get food for the Town; but he intended first to fall upon the Prince, who
over-ran the parts about <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> and raised contribution: And to
the end that he might not be hindred by the Enemies Army, the rest of the Horse
march'd out at the same time and faced the Enemy, thinking by this means to
keep them within their quarters: But being met by the Enemies Horse, he was
forced to retreat once more into <hi>Cheri;</hi> nor did the same Horse fare
more fortunately in the sally which they made out by night not long after, with
intention to fall at unawares upon the Horse quarter, which being commanded by
<hi>Gonzaga,</hi> lay in <hi>Poirino,</hi> a Town not far from
<hi>Santena;</hi> for the first Charge being stoutly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by
<hi>Aisaldo,</hi> who was Captain of the Horse guard, the rest of the Horse had
time to put themselves in order; who charging the Assailants, after a long
dispute and much resistance put them to flight, and took <hi>Aisaldo</hi> from
them, who being wounded in the head was carried away Prisoner by them. And for
all this, those that remained in <hi>Cheri</hi> wanted bread; so as the French
were forced to go elsewhere to get vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals, if they would keep there: They
therefore endeavoured to get some from <hi>Chiavezzo,</hi> which though it was
somewhat far off, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from <hi>Cheri</hi> by the <hi>Poe;</hi> yet the
water being then so low as that it was foordable, they thought that by great
conducts they might secure the passage; and because <hi>Cheri</hi> suffer'd
more in want of Grist then Grain, and <hi>Chiavezzo</hi> wanting Grain, they
sent Loads of Grain thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and brought as many Loads of Grist from thence;
whereby they thought they might sustain themselves, and prolong the Siege;
which they might have done, if a provision had not been found against it; for
the Governour had sent before to break down all the Mills of the parts
thereabouts, and placed Garrisons in the Towns neer the high-ways, by which the
Convoys pass'd, and made the Countrey people be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with their Arms in hand,
to oppose any of the Enemy that should passe that way; so as the Convoys being
often routed, provision of bread grew very scarce in that Town; yet Marquess
<hi>Villa,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his promise, brought some relief from
<hi>Carmagnuola</hi> to the great Famine that was in <hi>Cheri,</hi> which he
did luckily and without oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the Governour having removed his
Quarters from <hi>Santena</hi> to <hi>Poirino,</hi> the way which leads from
<hi>Carmagnuola</hi> to <hi>Cheri</hi> was left al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most open, which whilest the
Governour tarried at <hi>Santena</hi> was quite block'd up: But this relief
being but very slender, it being no more then what was brought <hi>en
croupe</hi> behind 600 Horse, and the French ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no hopes of any more from
elsewhere, it was impossible for them to tar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y longer there, especially in respect of straw which the horses
wanted extreamly. Almost all the French Horse which were in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
were in <hi>Cheri,</hi> which if they should be lost, neither the Citadel of
<hi>Turin,</hi> nor <hi>Chiavezzo,</hi> nor any Towns of <hi>Piedmont,</hi>
could be longer kept; and the very Citadel of <hi>Cassalle</hi> was held as
good as lost if these horses, which were the sinews of the French Forces,
should be lost: And many things made against the coming of new recruits from
<hi>France;</hi> for the King, besides provisions made for the Wars of
<hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> was wholly bent upon the Enterprize of
<hi>Catalognia,</hi> which was at that time in insurrection against the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and had sent <pb n="682" facs="tcp:53250:349"/> all the Forces that he
could raise in his Kingdom thither; so as no wise man could dream of any
supplies: To demand conditions of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my was the to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>al ruine of the King of <hi>France</hi> his Forces, and
of both his and the Dowagers honour; for the Prince and the Governour knowing
very well what advantage they had would not have been satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with mean
conditions; and if they should have yielded to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, they would have
demanded the Citadels of <hi>Turin</hi> and <hi>Cassalle, Chiavazzo,</hi> and
whatsoever was then upon the point to be lost; nay, they would hardly have
pardoned the Souldiers lives; so as they would have pretended to as plenary a
victory by way of agreement, as if they had won it by force of Arms. It
therefore was more honourable to venture life in maintaining the Towns they yet
had, then ignominiously to abandon them to the Enemy. <hi>Harcourt</hi> was
thus generously mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; who being in these streights would rather run the
hazzard of his life and fortune, then be forc'd to yield to ruinous conditions:
nor did this his Generosity prove vain; for Fortune, which always favours the
couragious, seemed to be desirous to preserve this gallant Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander for more
glorious Victories. He was to do one of three things, to get from thence, and
to escape an ignominious and ruinous surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; he must either get into
<hi>Chiavazzo</hi> by the same way by which he had caused victuals to be
brought, and from thence to the Citadel of <hi>Turin;</hi> or else go towards
<hi>Bat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>igliera,</hi> a Town which
stands upon the skirt of the hill, and from thence go through the
<hi>Langhe</hi> to <hi>Alba;</hi> or else (which was the most dangerous
undertaking) get into <hi>Carmagnuol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> by the way of <hi>Santena,</hi> which the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> had lately a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned: The greatest danger of the last lay,
that whereas if he should betake himself to either of the other two, he went
still further from the Enemy; by the third he should fall into his very jaws;
yet <hi>Harcourt</hi> liked the last best; for if he had endeavoured to get
into <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avazzo</hi> by the first way, he must pass through the narrow ways
of the hill; and in case he should be pursued by the Enemy, he must be forc'd
to abandon his Cannon and his Baggage; if he should go the second way, which
was exceeding troublesome, he could carry neither victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als nor ammunition with
him; and being to march still through an Enemies Countrey he exposed himself to
apparent danger of being routed, if the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> should
follow and overtake him: He therefore chose the third way as the securest,
though fullest of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And because he had made a false March to be beaten
when he stirr'd not, several nights before his coming, it hapned that when he
caused it to be beaten the night that he went away, the Enemy either did not
hear it, or believed it to be feigned, as were the former; so as he had time
and conveniency to be well advanced with his men before the Enemy knew he was
gone; but though he should have pursued him he could not have speedily
overtaken him, for several reasons: But howsoever
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e sent his Horse after him to
gall him on the Rere; but it was late ere these got to him; and when they came
they found the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my engaged with the Prince, who coming from
<hi>Montcalleri</hi> fell upon them, believing that the Governour would do the
like at the same time on his side. The Prince gave a furious and gallant
assault, with vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fortune for a while; but the French finding that the
Spanish A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>my <pb n="683" facs="tcp:53250:349"/> was got up unto them, they placed their Attillery loaded with
Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullets, in the Rere, and turning them upon the enemies horse, they hurt
them not a little; and therefore being forced to forbear, partly in
expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the rest of the Army; partly to keep from being further
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, they advanced no further; the Prince his own person was much
endangered, by the valiant resistance made by the French; but at last he made
himself master of a Bridge which they had abandoned; the coming on of night,
which was very dark, and the Countrey being full of underwoods, and Rivulets,
kept the Governour from falling upon the French, whilest they were in Fight
with the Prince; for he thought it better to make the Victory sure, by
deferring the Combat till the next day, then to undergo those dangers and
disasters which bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels by night are subject unto; but <hi>Harcourt</hi>
reflecting upon the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he should be in, if (carrying till broad day) he
should be assaulted on both sides, he fell upon the Prince at midnight so
furiously, as though he was stoutly resisted, he got the better of the
business, he regained the Bridge, over the which he past his men before the
daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the day, and secured both them and himself; when day was up, the
Governour found that the assured victory which he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himself over
night had escaped his hands; which if it had fallen out otherwise, it had
undoubtedly put an end to the War: as this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess redounded much to
<hi>Harcourts.</hi> Glory; so did it occasion much murmuring against the
Governour, in general, and in particular, by your Prince, who complained, as if
the Governour out of private rancour and indignation, had by affected delay and
slow marching shun'd falling upon the Enemy (who if he had been taken in the
midst between them, he must of necessity have been overthrown) as if he had not
onely not cared to put an end to the War, so to keep the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from
obtaining their pretences, which he seemed not to wish well unto; but as if he
had exposed the Prince his person to the Forces of a more powerful Enemy, to
the end that he might be defeated, and have his own person endangered: the
Piedmontese joyned all, general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with the Prince in his Complaints, and not
a few of the Captains of the Spanish Army; who could not know why, when the
Governour might have followed the Enemy in a straight line, he had pursued him
in an oblique one; and yet there wanted not some who defended this action,
alleadging in excuse of what had hapned, that the Governours slowness was not
to be ascribed to affectation, or to any sinister inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Prince, but
to a good rule in War, which says, it is better to make a bridge of gold for an
enemy to march away over, then by incensing him to make him desperate, and put
the whole affair in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard; they praised him, for that he had been contented
to free <hi>Cheri</hi> from the Enemy, without unshe thing a sword, or
endangering his men; applauding the genius of the Spaniards, who are known by
so many experiences to shun pitch'd battels as much as they can, and never to
come unto any, but when forced by necessity; after this the Governour sent
towards <hi>Alba</hi> and <hi>Nizza,</hi> to drive all the French out of the
lower <hi>Moniferrat;</hi> and to this purpose he sent the Camp Master
<hi>Emilio Ghilino,</hi> to drive them from <hi>Vezzeme,</hi> and
<hi>Bubbio,</hi> two Castles neer this part of <hi>Moniferrat,</hi> where the
French were as yet; who defending <pb n="674" facs="tcp:53250:350"/> themselves better then
it was thought they could have done, he sent the Marquess of <hi>Caracena</hi>
thither afterwards with his Brigade, and with some pieces of Artillety; who
drove the French from both those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and reduced them to his power within
three days space: thus the Governour having put strong Garrisons into the Towns
of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and left 5000 Foot and 1000 Horse with Prince
<hi>Thomaso,</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp Master <hi>Bolognino;</hi> the winter coming on,
he retired with the rest of the Army to the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and
having quartered them in several parts of that State, he prepared all that
Winter for the next years War; this mean while the business was not given over
between the Citadel and the City of <hi>Turin;</hi> for as soon as the Truce
was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, those of the Citadel began to draw neer the Enemies
Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; by new Trenches, and works under ground; and having sprung a
Mine, a fierce Skirmish ensued, by which those of the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del advanc'd to very
neer the Trenches of the City, and could not be driven from thence till the
next night, when the Princes Souldiers, having also sprung a Mine under the
Enemies new advancements, they also made a great assault; wherein though they
were stoutly resisted, and were repuls'd more then once, yet they got the
better of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and made those of the Citadel not onely forsake the
station wherein they were; but forced them to retreat a little more backward
then where they had been before: they then fell to make use of their Artillery;
those of the Citadel endeavoured to beat down the great Tower in the great
<hi>Piazza,</hi> from whence they were play'd upon in the Citadel; and those
without strove to beat down the Keep within the Citadel, from whence the houses
of the City were beaten down by the Artillery of the Citadel; and each of them
obtained their ends, but not alike; for the Tower, after above 2000 Cannon
shot, was beaten down to the ground: and the Keep of the Citadel was onely
beaten down so low, as the City could receive no prejudice from thence; but
notwithstanding, the City and Citadel continued plying one another with Musket,
and Cannon shot, whereby many were slain, and many hurt, and (amongst the rest)
Mounsieur <hi>di Cavogne,</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Citadel, received a sleight
hurt in the face; and in this manner did things continue here all the Winter;
In which interim they forbare not to fortifie the City against the Citadel:
<hi>Harcourt</hi> being with them who were preserved at the Bridge gotten to
<hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd his men in those Towns of <hi>Piedmont</hi>
which held yet for the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager; amongst which were <hi>Saluzzo,</hi> with all
the Marquisate, <hi>Alba, Fos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sano, Chirasco, Savigliano, Bene, Carmagnuola,
Chiavasso;</hi> and yet <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> was not idle; for he furnish'd the
Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> with such things as were chiefly necessary, for some
moneths; and when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Millain</hi> was retreated, he vex'd
some Towns which held for the Prince; he took <hi>Busca,</hi> a Town between
<hi>Cuni</hi> and <hi>Savigliano,</hi> and passing to <hi>Rossona,</hi> and
<hi>Drovero,</hi> they yielded to him upon conditions, before his men came to
him: he went then to <hi>Rovello,</hi> which having easily taken, he quarter'd
there all that Winter; but the French were generally hated by the Piedmontese,
who taking up Arms denied to pay them usual contributions; and abhorring their
government, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themselves for the Prince; who that he might not spend
that <pb n="679" facs="tcp:53250:350"/> Winter idely, sent the horse which lay idle in
<hi>Turin</hi> to scour the parts about <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> where, together
with much other hurt which he did, he streightned that Town very much, which
the French desired to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, but could never do it; the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> met also with a no inconsiderable encounter, wherein he lost
five Troops of Horse, which were quarter'd in <hi>Constanza,</hi> and kept the
territories of <hi>Canava</hi> from being overrun by the Garrison of

            </argument>
            <p>THough the Princes saw their cause brought to an advantagious
condition through the assistance of the Spanish Forces, and by the Popular
favour, and that they had the better of the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager, who had not as yet been
assisted by the French, answerably to her need; yet finding it very hard to
recover the chief Towns of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> some of which were fallen into
the French-mens hands, some into the Spaniards; and the Citadel of
<hi>Turin,</hi> which was the head and foundation of the State, at the present
posses'd by the French, which if it should be recovered was likely to fall,
contrary to their will, into the hands of the Spaniards; they did inwardly
resent it, and began at last to find that, by experience, which before these
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions it was impossible for them to comprehend by Reason; that they were
not likely to be concern'd in the good of any victories they had got, or hoped
to get; and that by overcoming, they overcame not for themselves, nor for the
Duke their Nephew, whose protection they pretended; but that they submitted
themselves, the Duke, and the Principality of their family to the disposal of
others; they might also conceive how little reason they had to rely upon the
Spanish Forces which were managed with ends differing from theirs, and aimed at
things much more differing; especially if that were true which the Prince
complained of so bitterly, that the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> had abandoned
him, in the dangerous conflict which he had at the Bridge <hi>Dellarotta;</hi>
they also seemed to have reason, not onely not to confide in, but to abhor the
favour of, the Spaniards, which looked more after their depression, then their
exaltation; as they might find, moreover, by the Truce concluded so
unseasonably, and contrary to all expectation, before <hi>Turin;</hi> and much
more by their pretending to put a Spanish <pb n="688" facs="tcp:53250:352"/> Garrison into
the Citadel of <hi>Turine</hi> these things did certainly cause much greater
Commotion in the Dowager, who was powerfully as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted by her enemies, weakly
protected and defended by her friends, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>reft at the same time by both of them of her chiefest Towns, and
even of the City and Citadel of <hi>Turin:</hi> besides, forced by the
Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of <hi>Richelieu</hi> to yield to unreasonable conditions, or else to
be fiercely prosecuted by his bitter malice: all wise men thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that the frequent Negotiations which pass'd all Winter long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the
Dowager and the Princes, would have produced the desired, and so necessary
agreement; but they were deceived.</p>
            <p>The Princes were at the present in much Authority and Grandezza,
and were, with no expence to themselves, brought by the Spanish Forces almost
to what they desired. The Prince Cardinal was possess'd of the City, Fort, and
almost of the whole County of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Cunco, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dovi,</hi> of
the Marquisate of <hi>Ceva,</hi> and almost of all <hi>Piedmont,</hi> from
<hi>Carmagnuola</hi> to the Sea. Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> had the City and
County of <hi>Asti, Trino,</hi> together with the <hi>Canevese,</hi> the
Valleys and Cities of <hi>Inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea, Biela,</hi> and <hi>Aosta,</hi> and the City
of <hi>Turin:</hi> They executed all Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in all these places; they
chose all Officers and Governours; they received all usual Revenues and imposed
Taxes; the people did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly freely follow them, but readily obey'd them;
they had moneys from <hi>Spain</hi> to maintain the present Wars, and their
Courts; and, what was most considerable in these ruptures, they were much
sought to by the King of <hi>France,</hi> by whom, before this War, they were
not only kept from the Guardianship and Regency, but banished out of
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> as publick Enemies: Wherefore considering their former
condition, their present State, and what they were to be, if, abandoning such
noble ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions, they should submit to the Dowagers Regency; it was
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that they should forsake their present fortune, to receive
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as a great favour from the Dowager, their Childrens Portions,
which were so short of the splendour they lived in now: Neither did their ends
and hopes cease here; for believing that the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi>
would undoubtedly put them the next Spring in possession of the Citadel of
<hi>Turin,</hi> they thought they should have atchieved their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
pretences, and be become absolute Arbitrators of all things; and that they
should be in a condition, not only of not receiving Laws from the Dowager, but
of doing what they listed in <hi>Piedmont:</hi> Neither did these their hopes
appear to be idle; for besides that they might hope well by what was past, they
saw the French were very thin in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and that they had but small
or no hopes to be recruited from <hi>France.</hi> On the contrary, the Spanish
Forces in <hi>Italy,</hi> by what recruits were already come, and by what was
expected the next Spring, were very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; so as not being likely to meet
with any that would withstand them, they promised themselves assured Victory.
And no comparison being to be made between what they were offered either by
<hi>France</hi> or the Dowager, and what they at the present enjoy'd, and might
promise themselves for the future, from the peoples favour, and the assistance
of <hi>Spain,</hi> they could not parallel the slender hopes of what was to
come, with their present advantagious condition; so as they could not listen to
any accomodation; and if they did, it was but to feed the people 
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:53250:352"/> with vain hopes, to sell their conjunction the dearer to
the Spaniards, and for other particular ends of their own. On the other side,
the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager, though it might be thought that her unhappy present condition
might make her accept of any thing, yet, finally, she could not allow but of
what stood with the joynt safety and dignity of her self and Son. Several
Proposals and Articles pass'd between them all the Winter, by which the Princes
questioning her lawful Authority, they aimed at bringing all to a Triumvirate,
consisting of her, and of themselves, to the Arbitriment whereof all things
should be referred; a specious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position in appearance, but which finally
comprehended nothing but the absolute exclusion of the Dowager from all
Sovereignty and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezza, and the bereaving her of all Liberty; for the
Princes being sure to joyn in any whatsoever resolution, she must necessarily
be excluded from all choice, and must submit to their joynt opinion: What would
her Authority be then in this Triumvirate? What would her Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anship and
Regency be? How could she secure her self of her own and her Sons Affairs? Was
not this to put her self, the State, and her Son, into the absolute discretion
of the Princes, between whom and her there were so many differences and
diffidences? It was better for her assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be at her Brothers will, and
to run any fortune together with him, then to joyn with her Brethren in Law,
who were her Rivals, and so bitter Competitors. And as the Proposals made by
the Princes were not in reason to be accepted of by the Dowager, so neither
could the Princes, being in so advantagious a condition, allow of the Dowagers
Proposals, though they were more justifiable. The Dowager pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, That as
the Principality of <hi>Savoy</hi> was Monarchical, so the Regency in her must
be Monarchical; so as detesting that it should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate into an Oligarchical
Triumvirate, she would be sole and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign in the Regency.</p>
            <p>The considerations wherewith the two Crowns proceeded in these
Affairs, were such, as no cure was to be found for these present evils, without
a general Peace; for the King of <hi>France</hi> pretending that
<hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont</hi> should be absolutely at his disposal, his intention therein
was to carry the War freely, and without any let, into the State of
<hi>Millain.</hi> On the contrary, the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> endeavouring to
keep the French For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as far as possibly he could from his Dominions, was
necessitated to uphold the Princes pretentions, and to use all means to exclude
the Dowager and French from <hi>Piedmont;</hi> and so under colour of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
War there in the behalf of the Princes, to make himself master of all the chief
Towns, and to keep the French from the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and this
design proceeded so successfully, as the King of <hi>France,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strusting
a good end of his designs, by reason of the great obstructions he met with,
forewent the rigour of his proceedings hitherto against the Princes, and was
induced to make great offers to Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> to the end, that by
his joyning with him, he might miss those opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the people of
<hi>Piedmont</hi> and the Spanish Forces made to the progress of his Arms; and
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was forced to consent largely to the will and
interest of the Princes, and to command his Agents that they should not
distaste them, lest being distasted they might pass over to the French party;
and might bring the Arms of that <pb n="690" facs="tcp:53250:353"/> King into the Confines
of the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> so as a general peace seemed to be the only
means to piece up all these rents; but though all treaties of accommodation
were in this desperate condition, yet the Dowa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er from the profundity of her sad fortune found out so adequate an
expedient, and so proportionate to the present conditions, as if it had
succeeded well (as it was very likely to do) the Civil Wars had been wholly
ended, and Forreign Wars, unfomented by the Civil, would have been much ceased,
if not quite extinguished: She was very apprehensive that she should be wholly
excluded all administration, if Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> should accept of the
offers made him by the King of <hi>France</hi> and Cardinal <hi>Richlieu;</hi>
and foreseeing that that would be as dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to the Prince Cardinal, she
sought to close with him; wherefore telling him that he was the more obliged to
endeavour the quenching of Civil Wars, which arising from domestick dissention
would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cease, when the others were at an end, by his being neerest
to succeed in the Principality: She therefore exhorted him to give way to her
just Regency upon fair and reasonable conditions; she offer'd to give him her
eldest Daughter, the Princess <hi>Maria Lodovica</hi> for Wife; she who it was
so much doubted might carry the succession of the Principality to the Blood
Royal of <hi>France,</hi> if she should be married to the <hi>Dolphine.</hi>
The offer was not mean, nor of small consideration; for the Prince Cardinal did
not only ascertain the succession of the Principality in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which
in case the Duke should die, he feared might receive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumberances thereby;
but did assure to himself the favour and good will of the Dowager, who from
being his Brothers Wife, becoming his Wives Mother, was interessed in a neerer
tye of alliance with him; so as he might promise himself she would be much
govern'd by him, and that he should have a great stroak in the Regency, and in
the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the State. I is to be observed that the Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>dinal was very de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> finding any Princess in these times more suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his ends, he
was very well pleased with the offer, and did readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertain it, which did
much facilitate the Articles of Agreement; which being dictated by him ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y conformable to the Dowagers
inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were sent to her from <hi>Nice,</hi> and were for the most part
accepted of; and those whereof there was any dispute were reduced to so neer a
composition, as there were great hopes all things would be well agreed; for it
was not very impossible but that the Prince Cardinal might come over to the
King of <hi>France</hi> his party, when by this m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rriage he should be become his Nephew: But Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> hearing of this Treaty was very much incens'd, and endeavoured
by all means to discompose it; he thought that though in reason he had not
equal pretence with his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Guardianship, he was not yet inferiour
to him in authority, by reason of his Military worth, by reason of the good
will the people bore him, and by what he had done in the present debates: they
were both likewise comprehended in the Emperours Decree; so as he thought it
not fit to give way to any accommodation, whereby he should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred all
authority and command: it was also thought that he liked not that his Brother
should ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ry; he and his Children

               </gap>izance; and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:53250:353"/> that if it should be concluded, he should sall to the
ground between two stools, he presently sent Marquess <hi>Bagnasco,</hi> and
the <hi>Commendatore Pasero</hi> to <hi>Nice,</hi> to disswade his Brother from
making any such agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the same reasons by which the Prince Cardinal
had disswaded him to accept the offers which the King of <hi>France</hi>
offer'd him; and to enter his protestation against it; in case he should make
it. When they came thither, they found the Prince Cardinal absolutely resolved
to embrace the Dowagers motion, the desire of quiet prevailing with him, and
marriage whereunto he was exceedingly inclined; but being put in mind and made
to see how fair a course of fortune, both to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and Brother, he brake by
that resolution; how great a prejudice their dis-union would be to the common
cause: what great offers the Prince had refused generously, to keep from
abandoning him; how little reason he had to confide in the Dowagers promises;
and how little good he could expect from the marriage, though it should
succeed: they exhorted him to follow his Brothers example, and to persevere
constant to the Spanish party, by whose favour and forces being so far
advanced, he might hope that when the Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> should be
gotten (as certainly it would be) they should be put into such a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as
he should not only obtain the marriage for certain; which was now uncertainly
promis'd him, but much greater things. The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal being won upon by these
reasons, and professing that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, he would value his Brothers
interest as highly as his Brother had formerly done his; he began to proceed
but cooly in signing those very Articles of Agreement which he himself had sent
to the Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; excusing himself, that he had sent them to let her see how
well he was inclined to her, and that he would use all means possible to bring
his Brother to be included the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ein; but that it became him not to divide the family further,
whilst the uniting of it was in treaty. Thus he sent the Articles to
<hi>Turin;</hi> where they were reformed by the Prince, and much altered in the
most essential parts; for being desirous to have a share in the Government, the
Prince inclined to the Triumvirate, wherein he being to make one, he was to
have his share in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the weightiest affairs; whereunto the
Dowager would not consent for the aforesaid reasons; and yet being desirous to
preserve the Dominions which he saw would be manifestly ruin'd by these
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions, she who was always a well-wisher to peace and quiet, strove to
keep the treaty on foot; which being handled with much patience and
accuratenesse would by her sollicitous endeavours have been brought to
perfection, had it not been sometimes interrupted, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prolonged by the
Princes delays, who were not yet well resolved what to do. The occasion of the
delays and demurs made by the Princes was attibuted, by some, to their
constancy to the Austrian par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by whose favour and forces being so far
advanced they thought they could not in honour abandon them, as they must have
done if they should condescend to the Dowagers desires; others said it was
because the Princes could not give over their aforesaid advantages, nor their
yet greater hopes, if they should prosecute the common cause by Arms; which and
by what means it hapned, it will not be far from our purpose to touch upon
briefly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="692" facs="tcp:53250:354"/> The Princes kept the Treaty still on foot
with the French, and by their means with the Dowager; and Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> did publickly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Monsieur <hi>d' Argenson,</hi> one in
great authority with the King of <hi>France,</hi> who was often busie about
him, beating the iron whilst it was hot, that he might bring the Prince to end
the business. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Millain</hi> and the other Spanish Agents
did resent this; and many thought that this which seemed to be a wavering from
the Spanish party, would at last break out into an open alienation. But the
Princes, who did not much confide in the Spanish Forces and Counsels, did not
resolve by abandoning the Treaties with <hi>France</hi> to deprive themselves
of the favour and assistance which they had thereby; for they making their
accounts also, found that the same continuation was not onely a great cause of
keeping the people faithfully devoted to them and their party, but served to
shew their greatness, which certainly was the more conspicuons and resplendent;
whilst the world might plainly see, that at the same time that they were
effectually protected and upheld by the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> they were sued
unto and entreated, and had large offers made them by <hi>France,</hi> which
they waged War against, to adhere unto the Crown of <hi>France:</hi> and which
was yet of greater importance, the continuance of the said negotiations did not
onely serve as a curb to the excessive power of those Arms which protected
them, to keep them within their due limits, but as a preservative against any
machination, which might peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be plotted against them and
<hi>Piedmont</hi> by the Spaniards; and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the fear of losing them, made
the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> much more willing to give them all possible
satisfaction. The Princes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being neither able, nor having reason to
neglect such advantages, they excused the continuing of the Treaty with the
French, by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity they were in of keeping the people constant to them
by these feigned demonstrations, by the hopes which they conceived of an
approaching peace, and of the sorrows of a not far off War; and to assure him
the more fully of their firm intention of persevering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant to the common
cause, they used to communicate freely unto him all that pass'd between them
and the French; and telling him that they could ground no certainty thereupon,
they strove to make him believe it was impossible it should be ever effected;
and thus they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to quit all jealousies, and to make the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ar with their
French negotiations; but their freedom in commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating their occasions to him
did rather irritate then appease the Governour: For he thought that the exact
notice which they gave him of what great offers were made him, was a secret
threatning of him that they would embrace them, if at any time they should not
be satisfied in their pretentions; which partly concern'd their private
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests, partly the publick concernments; the private consisted in what hath
already been said; that Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> might have an Army given him,
which might wholly and integrally depend upon himself, which he might manage as
he lifted upon all occasions; and that monies might be assigned to both of them
for maintaining their Courts; and that neither of them should have any
dependency upon the Governour: the publick aimed at being absolute Arbitrators
of the Regency of the <pb n="693" facs="tcp:53250:354"/> States: As for the first, though
Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> by denying the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which hath been formerly
spoken of, did himself hinder the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution therein; yet the Governour being
desirous to satisfie him, took order for providing him speedily with monyes,
and was fully bent to consolidate him in that regency, wherein at the present
he had put him, and to advance it. But the Prince not thinking all this
sufficient, and thinking it unworthy of his own greatness to keep in the Kings
Army without command, several distastes did many times arise, by the which the
Prince appearing to be daily less satisfied with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition, the
Governour did not onely desire to satisfie him in his own particular
concernments, but added a great willingness to content them in their publick
pretentions, so to keep them from fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s
party. To this purpose, he added his yet more powerful endeavours to those
great ones which were used by the Princes; for finding that all the Princes
ends aimed at the taking of the Oitadel of <hi>Turin,</hi> he held them in
hopes that that should be the first thing that he would take in hand the next
Spring; by which hopes being sed and dazled, they could not listen to the
Dowagers proposals, nor to those of <hi>France;</hi> neither of them being able
to make them any such offers. So these reciprocal hopes and jealousies
continuing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them all that Winter; when the next Spring of the year
1640. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the Princes seeing the Governour busie in drawing the Army into
the field, they quit their pretentions of having men and monies assigned them,
as inferiour to their conceived greatness, and minding this which was the
publick and greatest importance, they began to sollicite the Governour to make
good his promised assault; who sometimes held them on with the same hopes, and
sometimes raised difficulties, which made against their desired ends. But now
that the Spring was come, not being able to dissemble any longer, he declared
his mind unto them, and shew'd them the necessity of taking the Citadel of
<hi>Cassalle</hi> first; that going with his Army to <hi>Turin,</hi> he might
not leave that place behind him, from which much mischief might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the
State of <hi>Millain;</hi> that otherwise he must divide his Forces, and must
leave part of them in that State, and go with the rest to the taking of the
Citadel of <hi>Turin;</hi> that they might see how prejudicial such a division
would be to both those enterprizes; that they should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him therefore to
acquit himself first of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> which when it should be over, he
promis'd them faithfully he would apply himself wholly to the business of
<hi>Turin</hi> Citadel. The Princes strove by forcible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to make him
alter his mind; shewing him that the good suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of <hi>Turin</hi> would not
only be a great furtherance to the main of their affairs, but even to those of
the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> they told him that he who would make himself master
of the Citadel of <hi>Cassalle</hi> must first begin with that of
<hi>Turin;</hi> which being lost, the other must needs be lost also by the
French; who being driven out of <hi>Turin</hi> could not keep in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> but must be forc'd to pass back over the <hi>Alps,</hi> and
leave not onely <hi>Cassalle</hi> to the arbittrement of the Kings Forces, but
also the whole affairs of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> so not onely <hi>Cassalle,</hi>
but <hi>Chiavazzo, Carma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnuola,</hi> together with all the other Towns held by
them, must be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned; that therefore many other greatly good successes did
depend <pb n="694" facs="tcp:53250:355"/> upon this. They represented unto him the weakness
of the Enemy; who were reduced to a very small number; not exceeding 4000 Foot,
and 2000 Horse, ill appointed, not able to keep the field, nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the
Citadel of <hi>Turin,</hi> much less to cause any jealousie to the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> from <hi>Cassalle;</hi> moreover that the Kingdom of
<hi>France,</hi> which was not onely troubled with the Wars of
<hi>Flanders,</hi> but with those of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> and intestine risings,
was wholly diverted from the Wars of <hi>Italy;</hi> that <hi>Normandy</hi> was
up in Arms against the King, whose example would certainly be followed by many
other Provinces; that there was therefore no fear, that new Forces should come
from thence to <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> and on the contrary, that the Spanish Camp
being redoubled by so great recruits which were coming from several parts,
might easily compass any whatsoever enterprize; much more that of the Citadel
of <hi>Turin</hi> which was already half taken; they therefore earnestly
perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to betake himself to the taking thereof; but contrary reasons
perswaded the Governour from the going to take the Citadel of <hi>Turin,</hi>
and to go to the taking of that of <hi>Cassalle;</hi> first his jealousie of
the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations still continued between the Princes and the French; to this
was added the competition touching who should put the Garrison into the Citadel
of <hi>Turin;</hi> which not being yet decided, the Governour foresaw that the
Princes would bring it in play when the Citadel should be taken; so as he was
refractory therein, which when it should be taken would afford occasion of
disorders and dissentions, which might afterwards make the Princes go over to
the French, when they should not be masters of the Citadel; on the contrary,
the felicity which he promised unto himself in the taking the Citadel of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> made him believe that it became him not to weaken the flower
of his Forces, which he had assembled with so much trouble, and with such
expence to the Kings Exchequer, in the taking of the Citadel of <hi>Turin;</hi>
which Forces when they should be employed in the taking of <hi>Cassalle</hi>
would undoubtedly win unto the King a place of such impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the safety
of the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> and by which acquisition so great
preheminency and advantage would accrue to the Kings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs over the
neighbouring States; and (which was not least to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered) the
acquisition whereof would make so fair a way to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall peace; he was
moreover disswaded from taking that of <hi>Turin,</hi> lest the Princes when
they should be posses'd thereof, assenting to their self interests, and to the
Common concerns of the I alian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, would do what they could to keep that
of <hi>Cassalle</hi> from falling into the Spaniards hands, and that they would
hinder it by underhand dealing; wherefore preferring the good of the Kings
affairs before that of the Princes, he resolved to employ his fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ces which were then fresh and entire
in the enterprize of <hi>Cassalle;</hi> believing that the hopes of being
afterwards assisted in that of <hi>Turin,</hi> might keep the Princes faithful
to the Spanish party; and make them co-operate in that of <hi>Cassalle;</hi>
and what was of mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e importance,
the Governour knew how much the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> was concern'd in the
business of <hi>Cassalle;</hi> not so much out of the desire of getting it, as
for that they thought the French would have slackned the War of
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> for the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cassalle;</hi> or the Court
was not well satisfied with the orders gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven <pb n="695" facs="tcp:53250:355"/> to assault
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and that they were too exactly observed, and could have

so to draw the forces of <hi>France</hi> into those parts; so as though he was
honoured with the title of a Grandee for the taking of <hi>Vercelli;</hi> yet
he had some orders of Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contrary, which Revocation not afresh
to incur, and that he might at the same time help to secure the State of

                  </gap>,</hi> he could not but prefer the business of <hi>Cassalle</hi>
before that of <hi>Turin;</hi> amongst these publick reasons, there wanted not
some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones; arising from a certain ambition in the Governour, to
signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize his name in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> by the acquisition of that
place which he knew was so much desired there; and look how much he saw that
enterprize had proved unfortunate to his predecessours in that Government, the
more diligent he was therein, hoping that his glory would be the greater in
bringing it to a happy end, there were also cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain other private emulations
between him and the Princes, which did not make the Governour any thing at all
well affected to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests; for an being Infanta of <hi>Spain</hi> they
treated somewhat briskly with him, punctually expecting from him all those
observances and respects which are due to the Infanta from the subjects of that
Crown; to that heighth, that in the Campagnia where great Princes use to keep
open table, and to honour their Commanders with sitting at meat with them, they
never invited him to dine with them, nor ever did he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate with them but
bareheaded, and standing; and when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposed in his feet, he treated
with them either by messengers or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; this his aversion was much
increased by the Princes arrogating unto themselves all the honour of the good
that had succeded; not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing it to the Kings forces, but to the love of
the people of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont;</hi> not to the Governours valour, or Counsels,
but to their own: alleadging for proof thereof, what great difficulties he met
with before <hi>Vercelli,</hi> when he attempted it without them; on the
contrary, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who came not short of them either in counsel or
Military valour, alleadged; that the peoples affection would have been curb'd,
and kept back by the Dowager, without the assistance of the Kings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; just
as befel the Prince Cardinal, when being entred into <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> he
would try what the Authority of a Prince of the blood un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed could do: and
when the Princes came first with a powerful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my before the Walls of
<hi>Turin,</hi> the Dowagers Authority was such, as she did so hold the people
within bounds, as none durst ever speak, much less declare themselves in favour
of the Princes, or raise any sedition, so as to let them see that he was able
to undertake, and to effect great enterprizes without them, he was desirous to
apply himself to this, wherein the Princes not having any thing to do, the
business might be acknowledged to be wholly his: and consequently the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
which he undoubtedly expected from the happy success thereof, might belong
wholly to him, and not be communicated to any others, private and publick
interests being thus joyned, the Governour ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving all things in readiness sent
<hi>Carlo Della Gatta,</hi> general of the Neapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan Horse, at unawares to
preoccupate the ways that led to <hi>Cassalle,</hi> to keep the
<hi>Monferrat</hi> Souldiers who were dispers'd abroad in that State, 
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:53250:356"/> from entring thereinto; and he sent the Count <hi>di

which having observed their Orders, they appeared on <hi>Palm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it; so as the Governour made himself sure of Victory: To this was
added the intelligence which was said to be held between the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and
some of the chief of the Town, not without the Dowagers knowledge (as was
thought) who was not well satisfied with the French Garrison; being come within
sight of the City, he thought to fall to work, to the end that when he should
have taken the City, as he thought he should e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and by a short line to be drawn without the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel he thought to save the
time and labour of making large Trenches, as his predecessors had done, when
they were to lodge their Army in the Campagnia: he therefore made only two
quarters; the one at the foot of the Hill; and the other upon the Plain towards
<hi>Frassinero,</hi> two good miles distant one from the other. To the latter,
whither he sent above 1000 Horse under <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> and 400
Foot, under the Camp-masters <hi>Serra, Trotto</hi> and <hi>Gliglino,</hi> was
added 900 Swissers; that of the Hill was divided into two bodies. The Marquess

lodged in one of them, commanded them both: here were eight thousand Foot, and
four thousand Horse; they then began their approache against the City, which
was besieged on three sides; on two, between the Citadel and the Castle; and on
the third, neer the <hi>Poe,</hi> which they called <hi>Degli Italiani,</hi>
intrusted to Marquesse <hi>Serra,</hi> and they also took a certain House

               </gap>ssured hopes of the Governour and
his great Forces, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very little favourable to him from the very
beginning; for the great rains which fell for many days together, were of great
preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to him, not only in the commencement of his works, by which he was
to make his approaches, but in preserving those which wee alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made; for it
destroy'd them all: and the water having sunk down the ways had also made the
fields unmanagable; so as the two quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which were far one from the other,
could not communicate toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To these hinderances was added many fierce
sallies, which (though they were with equal fierceness repuls'd) they did not a
little disturb the Works and hinder the Work-men: Whilst the Army did thus
little good, expecting fairer weather, the Governour that the Souldiers might
not be idle, sent <hi>Thomaso Alardo</hi> with his Regiment of Dragoons, and
400 Foot to take <hi>Resignano,</hi> who having at first taken 
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:53250:356"/> the out-works, had also begun a Mine, which when it was
finished, he gave fire unto, and did thereby much good; for throwing as much
Wall as sufficed to give an assault, he went thereunto, but unfortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for
some of the Souldiers would not fight, and others were crush'd by many Gabbions
of earth which fell from the earth-work of the Wall that was blown up, falling
down, when they hasted to get upon the breach; those who were forwardest in
advancing were repuls'd with the death of the valiantest amongst them; and many
Spanish Captains were wounded, and <hi>Toby Palavicino,</hi> who fought
valiantly, though they were forsaken by their Souldiers. This mean while it was
given out, as it proved true afterwards, that <hi>Harcourt,</hi> taking the
greatest num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the French Souldiers that he could out of the Towns of
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> accompanied by Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> who brought 1500
Horse with him, and by the Marquess <hi>Pianezza,</hi> who brought 2000
Piedmontese Foot, to whom also some Montferrians were gorten, had got together
a body way of an army, with which he betook himself to bring succous by the of
<hi>Villanuova,</hi> and that he brought with him twelve pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and
some Carriages of Victuals and Munition. The more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected this news was to
the Governour, they made the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in him; calling therefore a
Counsel of War, it was consulted whether they should march out against the
enemy, and fight him in the open field, or rise from before <hi>Cassalle</hi>
and go speedily to <hi>Turin;</hi> giving out that the business of
<hi>Cassalle</hi> was but a feigned attempt, to draw the enemy thither, so to
keep up the Souldiers reputation: The great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in number of Souldiers,
far more valiant then the enemy, who were said to be most of them Vagabonds,
driven from their houses by Famine and War, made for the first opinion; that
(therefore) Victory was not to be doubted, if they should come to battle; and
that body of men being destroyed, wherein were all the Forces which the enemy
could make in <hi>Italy,</hi> not only <hi>Cassalle,</hi> with the Citadel
thereof, would fall into their hands, but also the Citadel of <hi>Turin,</hi>
together with all the other Towns of <hi>Piedmont;</hi> which being unfurnished
of Garrisons, and not able to hold out, nothing could be imagined; but that
they would yield at the very news of the approach of the conquering Army. To
the easiness and advantage of this Course necessity was added; for the enemy
not being far off, and the Army which was before <hi>Cassalle</hi> lying in the
open fields, divided into two quarters, with a great inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val between them,
not fortified either by Trench or Rampier; it was impossible for them to resist
the joynt Forces of the enemy, without marching joyntly out into the field;
that therefore since the great store of rain, and the shortness of time, would
not permit them to fortifie the Camp, it was without all question necessary to
joyn all their men into one body, to march with them into the field, to
encounter the enemy with their accustomed bravery; being certainly assured,
that not being able to withstand them they would rather run away then fight,
and so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them occasion of a signal Victory, which drawing many other
Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories after it would put an end to the War, and would render his
Excellencies name immortal. Two things stuck with the Governour touching this
so good and glorious resolution; First, the doubt of the conflict, that it
might make way for the relief; presupposing that when <pb n="698" facs="tcp:53250:357"/>
the conflict should be begun the enemy would send relief to the Citadel by
another way, and having gotten their intent would withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the
battle; whereby the taking of the Citadel, which was thought would be soon
done, would be prolonged; the other, the Governours own genius, who did
naturally abhor pitch'd Battles; and perhaps precise Orders from Court, which
forbad coming thereunto, when it might be avoided; both which were powerful
occasions of the loss of a famous Victory, which would assuredly have been
gotten if they had fought, and would have ruin'd the enterprise; for if the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour presupposed so much courage in the enemy, who were inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to him
in Forces, as they might lessen their men, when the conflict was begun, to send
part thereof to relieve <hi>Cassalle,</hi> why had not he cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage enough to
send some of his men to oppose the succour? and yet <hi>Harcourt</hi> made it
be seen that dangers are overcome by encountring them, not by avoiding them;
and on the contrary, that to examine dangers and inconveniences too narrowly,
and to keep within Trenches expecting that good fortune should fall into ones
mouth, was nothing but to neglect the fairest occasions of overcoming; to ruine
enterprises and pull dangers and dishonour upon ones self. The Governour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore not pleased to encounter the enemy, nor shamefully to abandon the
enterprise which he had begun with assured hopes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing it; he chose a
middle way, which though frequently used in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream ruptures is usually
dangerous, and which in this proved direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ruinous; and it was not to expect
the coming of the enemy in open field, that he might keep from being forc'd to
fight; but within a line of circumvallation, which he gave Order should be
presently begun, and finished as soon as possibly might be; so giving over
making of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, the face of affairs was in an instant changed; and this
new work being to encompass Mountains and Plains, it required many Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneers to
bring it to perfection, and more men to guard it; wherefore great store of
Work-men were sent for from the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and the choicest of
the Militia of that State; and all this not seeming suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, those were
sent for back who were gone to take <hi>Rosignano,</hi> and 1500 of those who
were left in Garrison in <hi>Turin;</hi> Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> was also
desired to come and assist in the enterprise with his Cavalry, who though he
very much resented, that the Governour by going to before <hi>Cassalle</hi> had
deluded his expectation of going to take the Citadel of <hi>Turin,</hi> which
he had so faithfully professed all Winter long he would do; yet hoping for
mighty affairs by taking the Citadel, he held it not fit to break with the
Governour upon this occasion, nor by forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Spanish party not only lose
all his future hopes, but all that he at the present enjoyed in
<hi>Piedmont</hi> by means of the peoples favour: taking therefore all things
in good part, and making a vertue of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, he suffer'd that the Kings
business should precede his; and not thinking it fit to abandon the City, he
sent his bastard Brother Don <hi>Mauricio</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> to him with
800 of his best Horse; who passing over, after the taking of <hi>Turin,</hi>
from the Dowager (who had made him Captain of the Dukes Guard) to the Princes
party, was by Prince <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maso</hi> made General of his Horse: all which
diligence proved altogether vain and insufficient; for <hi>Harcourt</hi> made
such haste as he prevented the <pb n="699" facs="tcp:53250:357"/> perfecting of the line of
circumvolution; and besides they had not men enough by many to defend the vast
circuit thereof: it is true, that the Hill above <hi>Cassalle</hi> being
thought to be impassible, by reason of the deep stiff clay, they were not over
careful of minding the Trenches there; nor were there sufficient Garrisons
provided for defending that part, for the Governour held for certain that the
very situation thereof was enough to keep the enemy from falling on that part.
The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my being in this condition before <hi>Cassalle, Harcourt</hi> comes with
the two Generals <hi>Villa</hi> and <hi>Pianezza</hi> to <hi>Rosignano;</hi>
where mustering his Forces, he found them to amount to the number of 6000 Foot,
between French, Piedmontese and Montferrians; and to 3000 Horse, part French,
part Piedmontese; and the Governour continuing in his opinion, that the enemy
could do nothing of moment by the Hills, and that therefore he would advance by
the Plain, he placed all his men to guard that part of the Trench towards the
Plain, where the <hi>Gatt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>la</hi>
falls into the <hi>Poe;</hi> where he thought the enemy would come, thinking
that being stoutly resisted there, and desparing to make his way on that side,
and much more by the Hill, he would absolutely give over the business; for it
being impossible for him to maintain his Army, which wanted all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of
things in those parts, what could he do else but return to <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi>
but he was deceived; for <hi>Harcourt</hi> coming from <hi>Rosignano,</hi> and
appearing within sight of the Plain about noon, he made his Foot tarry upon the
skirts of the Hills, and being desirous to know the position of the enemies
Camp, and of the line of circumvolution before he did any thing, he descended
into the Plain, together with the Signeior <hi>della Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renna, della Motta,
Odancorte</hi> and <hi>di Plessi Pralin,</hi> with <hi>Villa</hi> and
<hi>Pianez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and with <hi>Roccacerviera,</hi> Serjeant Major of the
Battle, back'd for his more safety by some Troops of Horse, and advanced a
little into the Plain, where he staid till he had inform'd himself
sufficiently, and so return'd to the Hill, some Cannon-shot were made at him,
and he was saluted by some Dragoons, but received no prejudice at all by
them.</p>
            <p>The night coming on, the Spaniards thought that the Enemy had
found such difficulties in the Plain as he would forbear attempting any thing;
and they thought themselves safe enough on the Hills side, for the Reasons
already said: Wherefore thinking that the Enemy despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of any good success
would attempt nothing, they consequently held themselves sure of Victory; and
applauding the Governour for his wisedom and military wariness, they approved
of his counsel, who had chosen to sit still and overcome; so they minded
nothing but reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal congratulations: But <hi>Harcourt,</hi> not at all
deterr'd by any diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty he found on the Plain, after some consultations,
thought to assault the French towards the Plain on three sides that very night,
a good part whereof being spent in consultations, and in ordering their
marches, and one of the Guides b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ing run away, who was to have guided them to the furthest place
where they intended to fall on; at last, when day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to clear up, changing
his resolution, <hi>Harcourt</hi> resolved to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the natural
difficulties of the Hills would not be more easily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, then the
oppositions upon the Plain: he therefore made a Bridge be thrown over the
<hi>Gattola</hi> about break of day, in that Valley, by which 
<pb n="700" facs="tcp:53250:358"/> beginning his course, he afterwards made his men pass
over the Bridge before day, thinking to make them ascend the opposite hill, and
there to re-attempt the enterprise: which design being soon discover'd, the
Governour sent the Dragoons, with some Foot Companies, to desend that hill
which the enemy strove to get up; but the provision was but weak and in vain;
for <hi>Harcourt</hi> finding that he must either mount there, or shamefully
give over the enterprise, advanced almost all his Forces against those
Dragoons, and succeeding therein, drove them, after a long dispute, from the
station which they had taken but a little before; and being master thereof,
endeavoured to make twelve pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non be drawn that way. The Governour,
by the bad success of his men began to fear the worst; and going from his
quarter, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Don <hi>Mauricio</hi> to advance with half his Horse, to
defend a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain station beyond the line, seated upon the hanging of a hill,
behind an Hermitage, where 400 Musketiers were placed, that he might op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the enemy who was to ascend by that way, and not suffer him to get any higher.
<hi>Harcourt,</hi> when his Artillery was got up the hill, made four batteries
of them, wherewith he began from Sun-rising to play upon the opposite Plain,
with much prejudice to the quarters which lay below, and to the enemies
Squadrons; then leaving the Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montese Horse and Foot under <hi>Villa</hi>
and <hi>Pianezza,</hi> to the end, that holding the enemy play there they might
diver them from succouring the hill when the French should ascend; he march'd
by the climbing of the hill in this order. <hi>il Signore della Motta
Odencourt</hi> mounted on the left side with six Regiments of Horse, and as
many Foot, together with some Troops of Dragoons. <hi>Harcourt</hi> himself got
up with the rest of the Foot on the right hand, the rest of the Horse under the
Vicount of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin,</hi> march'd up in the Rere; they all got well up,
having not only overcome the difficulties of the situation, which the Governour
thought was not to be done; but the opposition which was made at the
Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which was abandoned at the very first assault; and then that of the
Horse under Don <hi>Mauricio,</hi> which were placed behind the Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
which not being back'd by any Musketiers, after some resistance made, was at
last forced to retreat; so <hi>Harcourt</hi> having overcome this impediment
also, pursued his march the more freely, and got to above the Trenches. The
hills were but badly fortified; for the line of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumvolution not arriving at
the height thereof, it was commanded by the part above it; and the Work was
made in such haste and disorder, as both the line and the ditch which munited
it were in many places overlooked by the ground that was without; and there
were but few defendants, for the Governour (as hath been said) thought that
part sufficiently secured by its situation; but some of the chiefest Spanish
Commanders thought that the enemy would not adventure an assault even from
hence; so much did they confide in their own Forces, and made so little account
of the enemy; amongst which was Don <hi>Antonio Sarmiento,</hi> one of no small
authority, but better at the Gown then Sword; and yet he did not only meddle in
giving Counsel, but in is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing out Orders in the Camp; and thinking that
<hi>Harcourt</hi> durst not give an assault, but that he endeavoured by feigned
attempts to divert the Camp from that side, by which he thought to steal in the
<pb n="701" facs="tcp:53250:358"/> succour, he persisted so much in this opinion, as he
would not alter his mind, though he saw <hi>Harcourt</hi> gotten to the top of
the hill: And seeing a certain lower part of the line subject to be damnified,
and not caring to defend it, he sent the Souldiers that had the guard thereof,
into the field, and placed them in an eminent part without the line, thinking
that defence might be better made there; but he was mistaken, and it proved to
be of very bad consequence. <hi>Harcourt</hi> being gotten to the top of the
Hill, and seeing his advantages, and the disadvantages of the Enemy, he began
to hope well, and that he should be Conquerour that day, wherefore he
cheerfully disposed of his men for an assault; and he himself, and Count <hi>de
Plessis Pralin,</hi> who commanded that stati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, went to assault the upper
part of the Trench; who having chased away those who were placed by
<hi>Sermiento</hi> to guard the more higher outward part, they went to assault
the upper part of the line, hoping to have the like success there; but it
proved otherwise; for two Brigades of veterane Spaniards, who were long
accustomed to War, being set to defend that place, the Assailants were thrice
repuls'd; but at the fourth assault, which was more fierce then the former, the
Defendants were forced to yield; and at the same time that part of the lower
Trench which was unfurnish'd of Defendants by <hi>Sermiento</hi> (as hath been
said) being assaulted by <hi>Turenna,</hi> was easily broke through; so as the
line being thrown open in two parts, the French, like a swift Torrent, (which
having broken down the bank doth overflow the fields) burst in into the
Spaniards quarters; and at the same time, <hi>Villa</hi> and <hi>Pianezza,</hi>
did not onely assist by way of diversion, in the plain, as they were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but valiantly advancing they also broke into the Trench in the plain, which was
much better munited then that upon the hill; a Fort munited with a good ditch
stood opposite to them, which without any defence made, was taken by the Foot.
So as they having forc'd the line below, at the same time that the other had
broken into that upon the hill, they entred the line; and speedily making a
Bridge, with materials which they found upon the place, to make the Horse pass
over the ditch, which <hi>Villa</hi> made them forthwith do; so they passed in,
and <hi>Turenna</hi> joyned seasonably with them, who having but a few with
him, pursued the disordered Enemy. The French being entred (as hath been said)
on the hils side, divided themselves into three parts; one, which was the
greatest, and which was led on by Count <hi>della Motta,</hi> fell on the left
hand upon the Spanish quarters, which were upon the skirts of the hill; the
other two, which were led on by <hi>Harcourt</hi> and Count <hi>Plessis,</hi>
took to the right hand; and being come over against the Citadel were met by
part of the Garrison there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and by many young men of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> who
stood in ranks under the Artillery of the Citadel; and all of them joyntly fell
to pursue the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who abandoning their Trenches in great confusion,
retreated partly because the French were entred the line of Circumvolution, on
the hills side, and the Piedmontese on the plain; partly, because the
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, hearing what had hapned upon the hill, was gone to his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:
So as finding themselves abandoned by their Commander in chief, and hearing the
bad success upon the hill, they feared to be assaulted on the back, and
confusedly gave over all defence: And such was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, 
<pb n="702" facs="tcp:53250:359"/> as they did not onely not know what they had to do, but
were so intangled within themselves, as the Pikes, without any distinction,
mingled with the Musketiers. So being pursued by <hi>Villa</hi> and
<hi>Turenna</hi> with their Horse, they were at first ill handled. The Dutch
and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godians who kept the lower Trench, the assault or confusion not being
yet come to them, kept their stations, and valiantly received and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered the
Enemy. Marquess <hi>Caracena</hi> helpt much to the extricating them out of
this confusion, who coming in, where he saw the croud of people intermingled
and in disorder, out of meer madness and anger fell upon the French on the
flank with a squadron of Horse that was at hand, routed them, and afforded
conveniency to the others to rally, and put themselves in a posture of defence;
and having freed them from the Enemy, seut them to recover a certain station
which guarded a Bridge over the <hi>Gattola,</hi> and which was taken a little
before by the French: Nor herewithall content, he rallied together many others
that were scattered up and down the fields; and in the interim whilst he
behaved himself couragiously, every where, amidst greatest dangers, he received
a mortal shot by a Musket thorow the left side, and was carried out of the
field almost dead to a poor Cottage. But two other Champions came in to the
rescue of the imminent ruine of the Camp; <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> and
Marquess <hi>Serra Gatta,</hi> being sent for by the Governour from his
quarters at <hi>Frascinero,</hi> a little before the fight began, came in with
a thousand Horse; and being come to the Camp when things were in greatest
confusion, he advanced with his thousand Horse, and with some other that came
in unto him, as neer as he could to the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, with keeping without reach of
Cannon, where he drew up a powerful squadron in the open field, under the
shelter whereof all that were disbanded and disordered, had safe refuge; and
Marquess <hi>Serra</hi> being with his Italians in their quarters neer the
<hi>Poe,</hi> heard the unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted news of the rout, and therewith received
strict and penal orders to retreat; and that since things were in disorder and
ruine past all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he should go with his men to beyond the <hi>Poe</hi>
over the next bridge, so to keep himself from the danger of the Enemy, who
would quickly be upon his back. But he, though he were much astonished at the
unexpected advertisment, did not forego the field, nor did he despa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>r of safety; but encouraging his men,
he drew them into a squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, and made himself strong in the field; and
sending his Artillery to beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> stay'd with his men in rank
to keep back the Enemy who made towards him; so as many Souldiers who ran away
escaped death under the shelter of his squadrons, as others had done under
those of <hi>Gatta,</hi> not onely Troops and Companies, but whole Brigades
saved themselves under these two refuges. The Camp-master General, Don
<hi>Iovan Vasques Conrado,</hi> came under the shelter of <hi>Gatta</hi> and
the Neopolitan Horse; as also the Brigade of <hi>Naples</hi> which was all
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards: Don <hi>Vincenzo Munsuriu's</hi> Brigade, that of
<hi>Lombardy,</hi> that of <hi>Martino Maxica,</hi> and <hi>Battavilla</hi>'s
Brigade of the Burgondians, together with the Artillery which were drawn from
off where they play'd against the City, and those which defended a little Fort,
not far from the Burgondian battery; behind <hi>Serra</hi> came the Governour
himself, with the greatest part of his Court, and part of the Artillery, who in
stead of his <pb n="703" facs="tcp:53250:359"/> threatned punishment gave <hi>Serra</hi> a
thousand thanks for not having obey'd his orders. <hi>Serra</hi>'s own Brigade,
those of <hi>Trotto</hi> and of <hi>Emilio Ghiglino,</hi> the Regiment of
Swissers, and a Brigade of <hi>Papenheim</hi>'s Dutch: And those that came
under the shelter of <hi>Gatta</hi> went safe with the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery to
<hi>Frassinero,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Bremi,</hi> by a bridge which was
thrown over there; and those who received shelter by <hi>Serra</hi> past over
the <hi>Poe</hi> with their Artillery by a Bridge neer his quarters, and got
with all quiet safety to <hi>Allessandrino:</hi> so the retreat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst so
great a discomposure proved safe, and honourable, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the admiration of
the Conquerours; who doubting least those who were rallied under these refuges
might have regained the Victory, were contented with the relief which they had
brought, which was the chief end of that days action: and ordered their men
onely to keep the Enemy from rallying, but not to provoke them to battel; and
truly the counsel was not bad, for when the confusion was quieted, and the
disorder over, the Spaniards had yet so many left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live, as, though they had
not been able to keep out the relief, they were sufficient to have routed the
conquerours, and to have taken the victory from them, so many Brigades as have
been named remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch'd; besides those who escaped away unhurt, and but
little pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced, elsewhere; for the Dutch Regiment under Prince
<hi>Borso,</hi> and the two Spanish Regiments, who had fought so valiantly upon
the hill, were retreated safe and unpursued, making their advantage of the
night, to <hi>Pontestura;</hi> the like befel some 400 who were placed upon the
hill, without the Trenches, who rallied together in an upper plain neer Saint
<hi>Georgio,</hi> under Don <hi>Alonzo Vargas;</hi> moreover the foot of
<hi>Frassinero</hi>'s quarter, which had not fought at all, nor were not
assaulted, were fresh, and untouch'd, about 5000 of the Horse were also
undamnified; so as the Victory being gotten rather by industry, and valour, in
having won the hills, then by much havock and ruine of the conquered Army, the
Governour might have kept the field with the remaining Forces, and have done
what he pleased; but these things are thought upon when the danger is over, and
when confusion is past, which bereaves the wisest of Reason; the Governour, who
thought he had ventured too much already, thought rather how to save his men
that were not yet routed, then to expose them to further hazard; out of these
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, the Governour chose neither to reassume the enterprize; nor to do
what was thought by many of the Commanders would prove successful in the siege
of <hi>Cassalle;</hi> who grounded their reasons upon the coming in of many men
into <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and but little victuals, so as it must necessarily be
brought soon to surrender: these advises were therefore far differing from the
Governours genius, who was cautious in all his actions, and too much cowed in
this; the quarters under the hill fared otherwise, where there was no fighting,
nor battel, but down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right plunder on the conquerours side, and running away on
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; the conquerours found the Enemies quarters almost void of men,
but full of booty: especially that of the Governour, wherein were not only
great store of Silver-plate, and of other moveables be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the
Governour, and so many other Lords and Commanders that lodged there; but also
monies, which were to be used in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, <pb n="704" facs="tcp:53250:360"/> which
all fell into the hands of the French; so as the Souldiers who were greedy of
handling money, loved not to handle Iron, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially not having to employ it,
for all the Enemies were fled; the Governours Cabinet was also Sack'd, wherein
many secrets were found, and amongst the rest the of King Spains Cypher, with
all wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of account; some of those that fled from hence got safe into
<hi>Pontestura,</hi> not being pursued by any; but many of those very many
which fled to the Bridge neer <hi>Margherita,</hi> over the <hi>Poe,</hi> were
drowned; for they crouded so fast one upon another, as they fell by the sides
of the Bridge into the River; and the great number of men, and cattle, and some
carriages, did so overload the bridge, as one of the Boats whereon it was
built, sank; and so great was the number as well of men, as cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and
carriages, that were there drowned, as they fil'd up the vacancy of the Bridge;
and those who were not yet past over saved themselves by passing upon the dead
Carcasses: there were not above a thousand of the Souldiers slain in the
battel; 2000 were wounded, and taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, amongst which some of the
chiefest of the Army; those who perished in the <hi>Poe</hi> were most of them
victuallers, and the poorer sort of people who follow after the camp.
<hi>Harcourt</hi> sent, generously, all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours servant, who remained
prisoners, to their Master; and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Villa</hi> redeemed all those
that belonged to Marquess <hi>Caracena,</hi> and to <hi>Vasques,</hi> and sent
them to their Masters; the writings also were sent back for some sleight
rewards disbursed, to those that had them in custody. <hi>Harcourt</hi> being
victorious by so happy and so important a relief to a place of such
concernment, with a number so far inferiour to those that were fortified within
their works, did not forget himself with this happy success: but having
scarcely refresh'd his men, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd the Citadel with some Victuals, he
went two days after the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory towards <hi>Turin;</hi> and being desirous to
purchase yet more glory, he thought he should have done nothing, unless he
should also set the Citadel of <hi>Turin</hi> at liberty, and put the Dowager
into the condition she was in, as she did earnestly request the King, his
Agents, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and as the King had strictly ordered his Commanders:
this could not be done without the perfect recovery of the Citadel of
<hi>Turin;</hi> whereunto he couragiously betook himself, and whereunto he was
much enheartned by the smallness of the Garrison that remained in the City,
from whence the Governour had sent for a good part to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> had sent away 800 Horse: and he
thought that but small succours would be brought from without for he held (for
certain) that the Governour, from whom succour could only be expected, would
not hazard the remainder of his men after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been so baffled and beaten in
the relief of <hi>Turin,</hi> to the so great prejudice of the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> he moreover was put in greater hopes, by the scarcity as well
of Victuals as of Warlike provisions, which he had learned by discourse was in
that City; for he calculated that the French, Spanish, and Piedmontese, which
one after another had been fed in that City, must have consumed all the
Victuals that were there; and the <hi>Poe</hi> being block'd up all the Winter,
on the one side by <hi>Chiavazzo,</hi> on the other side by
<hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> he thought it impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible it could be furnished by that
river; and much less by land, by <pb n="705" facs="tcp:53250:360"/> reason of the great
scarcity of Cattel that was in those parts; he thought there was greater want
of Warlike provisions, by reason of the great profusion which necessarily must
have been made thereof the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Winter, in the many Mines, Batteries,
Assaults, and Fights between the City and the Citadel; he also built much upon
the Citizens good will; not so much out of the inclination which many of them
might privately have unto the Dowager, as of the meaner sort of people, who
living upon their handy work, which was fed by continual concourse and
traffick, they could not hold out long, the Gates of the City being shut up, so
as it was thought impossible that they should hold out a siege long; all which
things though they had an appearance of truth, yet the sequel shewed that they
were badly calculated; for none of them co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated to that Victory which was
thought so sure; for the City (as was afterwards known) was provided with
victuals more then need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as for warlike provision, (which was that which
they wanted most) they wanted not witty new inventions, whereby they got
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough thereof; they might want Defendants to free the City from siege, but
not to defend it; the people, and all the Citizens, kept al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways constant in
defence of the City, and stuck close to the Prince; and, what made most for the
main affair, the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> contrary to <hi>Harcourts</hi>
supposal, appeared within a few days with a powerful Army before the City ready
to relieve it; for having a little digested the misfortune at
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> he feared (as it fell out) that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy would forthwith
come before <hi>Turin;</hi> and knowing how weak the Garrison was, and what
scarcity of Warlike provision there was in the City, he immediately sent 1500
Souldiers thither, part <hi>Italians;</hi> under Marquess <hi>Sirra,</hi> and
<hi>Vercelline</hi> Viscount; and part <hi>Burgondians,</hi> under the Baron
<hi>di Vattevilla,</hi> all of them choice and <hi>Veteran</hi> Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; to
which about 4000 others of several nations being added, which remained under
<hi>Bolognino</hi> in defence of the City, they amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to well neer 5500
Foot, who were all to obey Don <hi>Antonio Sotelo</hi> General of the Artillery
of the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> who was sent thither with supream authority
to command all the King of <hi>Spains</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; many loads of powder, and
other warlike tackling, were added to this succour; &amp; the Governour Writ
fervently to the Prince, encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to persevere in defending the Town,
and promising him that, to boot with these succors, he would come thither
himself shortly with a powerful Army to relieve him; and set him at liberty;
and telling him that what had hapned at <hi>Cassalle</hi> was but a trick of
Fortune, and had rather dispers'd then discomfited his men; that he stay'd now
to rally them under his Colours; to the end that with them, and with others
which he expected very shortly from other parts, he might come and relieve him
and the City; All those that were sent by the Governour got luckily into
<hi>Turin;</hi> and Don <hi>Mauritio</hi> got thither also, who was returned
with the Prince his Horse from <hi>Cassalle,</hi> though somewhat lessened by
<hi>Harcourts</hi> Cannon which thundered from the hills; but little powder
could be brought in for want of Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon horses; and the ways being afterwards
block'd up, and possessed by the En my, the rest could not enter without much
prejudice to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise; especially for that Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> had
sent 400 Horse before <pb n="706" facs="tcp:53250:361"/> the ways were block'd up, to be a
conduct to that Munition, which Horse was not suffered to return for the
aforesaid blocking up of the ways; so the Prince was not only deprived of that
provision, but also of those Horse, which had he had them, he would doubtlesly
have made great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er impressions upon the Enemy by sallies then he did; but now
he was forced to be more circumspect in his night Assaults: 3000 Citizens, able
to bear Arms, were added to the Kings men, who were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in desending the
City, and also many Country people, who were come thither for refuge, who were
a great help in their handy-works; so as the Prince, though he wanted fighting
men and war-like amuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet finding that the Governour was mindful of him,
and of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the City, and taking that assistance which he had already
sent as a Token of what he would do in the future, he was not wanting to
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in doing what he could, in so short a time, to defend the City.</p>

totally against the Citadel, and neglected securing the City on the out side,
but learning, by what had hapned at <hi>Cassalle,</hi> that instead of minding
the taking of the Citadel, it behoved him to take care of descending the City,
he fell with all speed and diligence to forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it from any assault that
might be made from without; and leaving smaller matters, his chiefest care was
to defend the Bridge over the <hi>Poe,</hi> which, as whilst it was in his
hands it kept the way open for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of succour, which he expected
would be brought from the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; so when it should be taken by the enemy,
it kept out any suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour that might be brought by that way; for then the
reliever must find some other way to pass his Army over the River, which was
almost impossible to do in the face of a powerful enemy. This Bridge is made of
Stone, and is the best that crosses the <hi>Poe;</hi> at the left side of the
foot thereof, towards <hi>Turin,</hi> stands a little Burrough; the other which
stands on the right side lies under a little hill, upon which there is a
Church, and a Covent of Capuchins; and this side being all hilly, other high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
hills stand above that of the Capuchins, one above another. The Prince munited
this Bridge at both ends with Trenches; nor herewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <pb n="707" facs="tcp:53250:361"/>
contented, he munited very well the aforesaid Church and Covent; and, Moreover,
built a little Fort upon another higher hill which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the Monastery:
he put 300 Foot into these Fortifications, and Victuals, and Ammunition
sufficient for fifteen days, within which time he hoped the Governour would
appear with his Army. These Works were not fully finished, when the French Army
appeared on three sides; the first that appeared having block'd up the Passes
of <hi>Susa, Lanza</hi> and the Canevese, advanced to the City towards the
<hi>Dora,</hi> and the new Park, which answers upon that Angle of the City
which is called the green Bulwark, and which includes the Dukes Palace and
Gardens, in defence whereof the Prince had made a sudden Trench, formed like a
pair of Shears; the other quartered on the upper hill, above the Church and
Covent of the Capuchins; and the third, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Poe</hi> at
<hi>Montcalleri</hi> by a wooden Bridge that is there, advanced to the Palace
<hi>Valentino;</hi> whereof, after a small Skirmish, making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
masters, they the next night took the Burrough, which (as we said) stands
between the City and the Bridge; and not meeting with any resistance there,
they assaulted the Bridge where they found some resistance; but having mortally
wounded the Captain, who did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, they made themselves also masters
thereof: the Garrison re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring towards the Monastery, as to an advantagious
place; which was not able neither to keep there long; for the little Fort which
(as hath been said) was built, and fortified by the Prince above the Monastery,
was at the same time assaulted and taken by those who had taken up their
quarters upon the hill which was above that Fort: whence play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the
Covent which was beneath, they easily took it, though they were manfully fought
with; for at a third assault the assailants entred the place, and from thence
went to the Church, whither the defendants had retreated; where, without any
respect to the holiness of the place, they put all to the sword that were
there, except the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; and sacking, moreover, not only such secular
things as were brought thither as into a place of safety; but without any
distinction laid hands upon such as were sacred, and dedicated to divine
worship; by which good success waxing more bold, and meeting with no
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position (for the Prince being desirous to keep his men within the Walls,
would not go out) they did not only give themselves to better the
Fortifications which they there found, but joyned another Fort which they
themselves made, to that which the Prince had erected above the Monastery;
which commanded all the other Fortifications, even those of the Bridge: they
likewise fortified the heads of the Bridge better; and extending their Trenches
towards the Burrough, they placed a very strong Garrison there of 2000 Foot and
1000 Horse, which were commanded by Count <hi>Plessis Pralin:</hi> the rest of
the Army was distributed into several quarters about the City; the Inhabitants
whereof were the same day so enclosed within their walls by theenemies Army, as
they could not hear news of any succour from the Governour; unless it were by
various inventions which they found, and which did often deceive them, by which
they inform'd the Governour of what streights they were in, and sometimes
received hopes of succour. The Governour was much troubled at the scarcity of
powder that was in the <pb n="708" facs="tcp:53250:362"/> City; wherefore he sent <hi>Carlo
della Gatta</hi> with 2000 Horse to <hi>Inurea,</hi> that he might endeavour by
a greater force to bring in that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition which was left there, but it
proved in vain; for <hi>la Gatta</hi> being come with that Ammunition to
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> five miles from <hi>Turin,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving found
conveniency to inform the Prince of all things, he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by him to
retreat; for that it was impossible for him to get into the City, he being
first to overcome <hi>La Stura</hi> and <hi>La Dora,</hi> which were then
munited with strong French Garrisons; but in his return passing thorough the
<hi>Canavese,</hi> he found the Town of St. <hi>Mauricio</hi> taken again by
the French, and ready to be sack'd, which he freed with the death of all the
French, whom he put to the sword. <hi>Harcourt</hi> kept this mean while in the
<hi>Vallentino,</hi> expecting that the people should rise in the City, as the
Prince and the Governour did, when they came first before it the preceding
year. But this proved in vain; for for all that he could do, there was not any
one amongst the Souldiers who was disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd to comply with the Dowager, or
were blemish'd so much as with any such thought, but all of them during the
whole siege proved faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the Prince. Wherefore <hi>Harcourt</hi>
failing every day more and more of effecting his desire by that way, he try'd
another; <hi>La Dora</hi> falls a little above the City, by a cleft into a
Channel which conveyes water to the Mills, which serve the people with grist.
He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave order that that cleft should be dam'd up with earth by
night; so as the Mills not being able to go for want of water, the City which
abounded in Corn, began to want bread: For there were onely two hand-mills
within the Town, which could not possibly supply so great a multitude with
grist; so as the City was in a short time like to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish'd for want of
bread, though it abounded in Corn. <hi>Harcourt</hi> resolved to reduce the
City yet to greater extremities, and to make it altogether despair of succour,
with hopes whereof being fed, it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently suffer'd all hardships: For at last
he began to draw a line of Circumvolution; which beginning from the bank of the
<hi>Poe,</hi> about a Musket-shot above the <hi>Vallentino,</hi> ran along the
plain towards the West, and came to the Church <hi>Della Crocetta,</hi> just
over against the Citadel; and then winding about the Citadel, came to the great
Edifice called <hi>La Porporata;</hi> and continued to the <hi>Dora,</hi>
crossing with it came to the little house which is called <hi>Bianchina;</hi>
and then declining by the <hi>Mada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene,</hi> to the mouth of the same River;
where being broken off by the source or course of water, it was reassumed
again, and terminated in the neighbouring banks of <hi>Poe;</hi> a compass of
eight miles, which being furnish'd with small Forts and other works was divided
into six quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; wherein the French and Piedmontese Armies were thus
distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted. Count <hi>Plessis Pralin,</hi> the first Marshal of the Camp, was
quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the bridge to the <hi>Parco.</hi> This quarter contained within
it the <hi>Burgo,</hi> and the fortifications of the bridge, and of the
Capuchins hills: From <hi>Vallentino,</hi> where the line began towards <hi>La
Crochetta,</hi> and so forwards towards <hi>La Porporata, La Dora,</hi> and
<hi>Le Cassine divia d' Albera,</hi> was General <hi>Harcourt</hi> quartered,
and with him the Viscount <hi>Di Turenna,</hi> Camp-marshal of the French
Horse: The Circumvolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made a great bow from one bridge upon the
<hi>Dora,</hi> to another bridge below the <hi>Parco,</hi> and neer the
<hi>Poe;</hi> to which <hi>La Dora</hi> served as a <pb n="709" facs="tcp:53250:362"/>
string: wherein <hi>Ill</hi> Signeior <hi>della Motta Odencourt,</hi> field
Marshal, was first quarter'd; who commanded a small body, part Foot, part
Horse; who were left by Duke <hi>Longueville,</hi> and were subordinate onely
to General <hi>Harcourt.</hi> But afterwards the <hi>Porparata</hi> was
assigned him for his quarter, together with a good part of the line on both
sides, and with him were <hi>Villa</hi> and <hi>Pianezza</hi> quartered with
the French and Piedmontese Horse. The Citizens of <hi>Turin</hi> saw themselves
thus sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded, and as it were imprisoned, and were not able of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to break the line, which did not onely threaten their liberties, but their
lives and fortunes. And in these great streights all their hopes lay in being
relieved by the Governour; which they were day by day inform'd should be ere
long: For he having rallied his men, and re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced his Camp, was come from
<hi>Vercelli</hi> to <hi>Crescentino,</hi> and by a bridge thrown over the
River there, marched straight to <hi>Cheri,</hi> where having stay'd some days
to get his men together, he endeavour'd by all possible means to get neer the
City, to free both it and the Prince from fiege; in which time the Prince
desirous either to try the Enemies Forces, or to give a trial of his, sally'd
very strong both in Horse and Foot by night out of the City, and fell upon
<hi>La Motta</hi>'s quarter, which was at the <hi>Magdalene</hi> beyond the
<hi>Dora;</hi> and charging him whilst they were all a sleep, his men entred
even into the Rendezvous of Arms of that quarter, wounding and killing many
before they could put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a defensive posture; which proved not
such, but that after having done them much prejudice, the Prince might get to
within the shelter of the Cannon of the City, whereinto he retreated with
little loss to himself, and more to the Enemy. This action revived the spirits
of the besieged, and much more the bringing back of the water of <hi>Dora</hi>
to the Mills, which was done by the Citizens; a great band whereof, back'd by a
squadron of Musketiers, went out of the City, and coming to where the water was
dam'd up, broke as much of the earth which closed the orifice, as made way
enough for water to turn four wheeles; and the next night the current of the
River broke down the rest, so as the water came plentifully into the Channel,
much to the comfort of the City, which thereby got bread enough.</p>
            <p>To these two happinesses, which amidst so many evils appeared to
be great ones; a third, yet greater, was added at the same time. The relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Army appear'd at the last upon the highest of the Capuchins hills, on the
twentieth day after the Enemy appeared, and the one and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth after the
business of <hi>Cassalle.</hi> In this Army were 4000 Horse, 700 Dragoons, and
12000 Foot; to whom were added no small recruits both of Foot and Horse, sent
by the Prince Cardinal, and 600 Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers, who being by the War driven out
of their houses had despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately taken up Arms. This so goodly Army was not
onely a terror, but a wonder to the French; who (thinking that the whole
Spanish Forces had been defaced by the Victory gotten at <hi>Cassalle)</hi>
could not believe that they could be so soon got together, and brought to
dispute the business with them; and being but few in number themselves, and not
sufficient to munite so great a Oircumvolution, they much doubted what the
success would be; the Governour was fully resolved to do nothing herein, but
was furthest out of the reach of fortune, and what <pb n="710" facs="tcp:53250:363"/> might
be gotten with least danger and effusion of blood. Wherefore be resolved to
bring the relief by that part of the hills which was sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated a long the
River of <hi>Poe;</hi> and particularly there where the Enemy had fortified
above the Covent of the Capuchins and the bridge; and where when they should
have taken the Fort which was built by the French, and which was above them
all, they might command all the lower fortifications and the bridge; in which
case he might have an open way to come with his men to the City, and not onely
bring what relief was requisite to the besieged, but by discomfiting the Enemy
would have raised the siege; and would have largely revenged himself for the
blow he received before <hi>Cassalle.</hi> This design would have succeeded
happily, if the Governour had been so diligent in executing it, as the Prince
was in assisting him: For guessing by the appearing of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Army from
those hills, and the rather by some lights, that the Governour would assault
the upper Fort that very night; he went out when it grew duskish, with all his
men, out of the Town, and drew neer the bridge, intending to assault it when he
should hear the assault given from above; by which being likely to make a great
diversion, he might have much assisted the Governour in his assault. But the
Governour who would consult with his Commanders what was to be done concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the main affair, before he would do any thing, put off the execution till the
next day; by which delay the Prince being frustrated in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
retired to the City; and the French were very careful to lay bare the Fort,
that very night taking the earth from it towards the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Camp, and so made
it unacceffible and impregnable. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they saw all the Enemies force
drawn up thither; they called all the best Souldiers and Commanders of the
Camp, as if <hi>Harcourt</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw how much the getting or losing of
<hi>Turin</hi> lay in the keeping or loss thereof. The Governour seeing, the
next day, how hard the taking of that place was made by that nights work, he
forbore assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and kept four days upon those Hills, upon which having
raised some batteries, he played upon the lower fortifications; and the French,
that they might free themselves of that molestation, sallied out one night very
strong upon the Enemies Works, to the end that if they got no other good else
thereby, they might at least cloy the Ordnance, and free themselves of the
mischief they received thereby; but meeting with stout resistance, they were
repuls'd with loss, and forc'd to retreat to their own fortifications. And yet
the Governour knowing that the laying of them level with the ground made but
little for the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, and that to beat down Forts, which would be
continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by the neighbouring Army, was to no purpose; and that the
City being streightned on many sides, he resolved to change his quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and
to go to <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> which is a great Town upon the right hand of the
<hi>Poe,</hi> a little above <hi>Valentino,</hi> where there is a wooden bridge
over the River, which is strong and safe enough; which the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our thinking
to make himself master of, that he might pass thereby over the River, when he
could not do so by that of the Capuchins; he when he came first upon the hills,
sent a Regiment of Dragoons to take the Town and Bridge. The Town was abandoned
at the first appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Dragoons, and the Bridge was at the same time
burnt; so as <pb n="711" facs="tcp:53250:363"/> the taking of the Town made nothing at all
for the Governours pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for he must find means to make another good and
solid Bridge, whereby to pass over his Army, if he would effect the intended
suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour; he therefore ordered <hi>Carlo della Gatta,</hi> to go with a good
strength of men to <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> and to throw over another Bridge a
little above that which the French had burnt, where two Islands were made by
the <hi>Poe,</hi> which were very commodious for the passage. <hi>La Gatta</hi>
went thither, and past over 500 Souldiers in boats to the other shore, under
Serjeant Major <hi>Lomelino,</hi> by which those who defended the further shore
being beaten back, he began a Fortification upon the bank which he had won;
that it might serve to keep back the enemy, if they should oppose the throwing
over of the Bridge; but as soon as <hi>Harcourt</hi> heard of the enemies being
past over, and of the Fortifications which they made there, considering of what
importance it might be, if the enemy should enter on that side, and accost
their Trenches, he forthwith sent the Viscount <hi>di Turenna</hi> to disturb
the Work; who went with a great body of Musketiers, and was followed by
<hi>Harcourt</hi>'s self, with a great strength of men to back him, if there
should be occasion. The place where <hi>Lomelino</hi> fortified himself was
environed, for the most part, with a great ditch full of the water of the
<hi>Poe;</hi> the Souldiers being afraid, and not daring to pass over it,
<hi>Turenna,</hi> to upbraid their cowardliness, threw himself, with some of
the chiefest that were about him, into the ditch, and undauntedly past over it,
though the water came up to his breast; the Souldiers being thereby encouraged
did all follow him; and surrounding the enemy who were busie in fortifying
themselves, and others coming in by where the ditch came short, a fierce
Skirmish began, wherein the assaulted, not able to save themselves by
retreating fought stoutly; but <hi>Turenna,</hi> who fought amongst the
foremost, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a sleight hurt in the heat of the conflict, was reported
to be dead, at which the assailants grew so enraged, as being recruited by new
men which continually came in, they began to fight desperately, killing not
only those who fought, but those who yielded; and being superiour both in
number and in force, they slew them all, part whereof perish'd by the sword,
and part were drowned in the water. <hi>Lomelino</hi>'s self, who was taken
prisoner, could find no mercy with the enraged rout, who refusing great sums of
money to save his life, allaid their anger in his death; by which cruel action
the Spaniards being highly incensed, they likewise grew cruel, so the conflict
began to be very bloody. The French were much rejoyced at this happy success,
who having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready kept the Spaniards twice from passing over the River
thought themselves sure of Victory; and made publick fires of joy in the Camp,
witnessing it with three Vollies of Muskets, and with discharging their great
Guns; but the City was as sad, and the Spanish Camp grew very diffident, both
of them finding how hard a business it would be to pass over the River;
wherefore it appearing impossible for them to relieve the City as they
intended, they began to consult how to do it by diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by going to
<hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> thinking that the French would not suffer
<hi>Carmagnuola</hi> to be apparently lost, for the uncertain hope of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<hi>Turin;</hi> and the Prince himself, seeing how hard it would be for them to
pass over there, advised them to go higher up, toward <hi>Villa 
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:53250:364"/> franca,</hi> 22 miles above <hi>Turin,</hi> where the
River being foordable, they might throw over a Bridge without any opposition;
but <hi>Villa franca</hi> was judged to be too far off, and that the march
would prove incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, as well in their going, as in their returning; and
so great a march so neer the enemy was not likely to be made without being
forc'd to fight; wherefore that resolution was not taken; and yet the Governour
had so great a desire to relieve the Prince, as he attempted to pass over once
more, a little below <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> where the <hi>Poe</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding it
self into three branches makes other two small Islands, more commodious for
passage then the former two above <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> which had been
unfortunately attempted; and though the River was much swoln by the fall of
waters, and that the further shore, over against these Islands, was well
munited with Trenches and Garrisons; yet he resolved to send the same
<hi>Gatta,</hi> with greater Forces then before, to make a trial.
<hi>Gatta,</hi> being come to the shore side placed some pieces of Artillery
there; and embarquing some Souldiers in some Shallops, he past them over by
night into the Islands; who when the Souldiers were landed, they began to send
over materials for Fortification in the same Sciffs; so as they made Trenches,
with great diligence, in the second Islands, before day break, and before the
enemy were aware; but at last being awakned by the going off of a Musket, which
unfortunately took fire, they presently put themselves in defence. This going
off of the Muske<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, instead of
disturbing them in their Works, made them work the harder; so as, about break
of day, the Islands were wholly cover'd with Trenches, and in a good posture of
defence: both the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals hasted immediately to the two several shores, to
provide against so sudden and so unexpected an accident; upon which the main
affair of the whole business was thought by both parties to depend; by the
Spaniards, for encouraging the enterprise; by the French, for the disturbance
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The French strived five times to fortifie their shore with new &amp;
better Fortifications; but were still beaten off by Musket-shot from the
Islands, and by Cannon, charg'd with small bullets, from the opposite shore,
with great slaughter to their men; notwithstanding that the chiefest of the
Army were sent for thither to defend it; nay, though Souldiers were drawn
thither out of the Citadel, and the Governour of the Citadel invited to come
and hinder the passing over; but, at last, giving over the defence of their
shore, <hi>Harcourt</hi> withdrew his men so far inward, as they were out of
the reach of the Spaniards Muskets which were placed on the side of the Island,
and made them stand ready to play upon those whom they should see first appear
upon the assaulted shore. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, when they saw the shore abandoned,
failed not to throw over their Bridge, and to fortifie the head thereof; where
they began a Half-moon; about the making whereof whilst a hundred Souldiers
were very busie, a good strength of Horse and Foot appeared on the shore to
hinder the work, and to drive away the Work-men; who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Orders which
they had r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

the Bridge back into the Island; and the Bridge not being yet well fastned,
broke, so as 25 of them fell into the River, and were unfortunately drowned;

Cannon, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Islands, which made much slaughter amongst the
French <pb n="713" facs="tcp:53250:364"/> who were upon the Plain beyond the River,
<hi>Harcourt</hi> was forced to cause a Retreat to be beaten, and not only to
abandon the shore, but even the Plain, which was full of dead bodies; and
retreated to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the line of circumvolution, leaving the Passage free to
the enemy; who fastning the Bridge better, past over the <hi>Poe</hi>
victoriously, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came masters of the Plain, which they had valiantly won,
and much to their glory; as many of the French, if not more, were here slain,
as were Spaniards in the first attempt; and many of them were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, amongst
which the Governour of the Citadel, and many of the Souldiers of the Citadel
were slain; so as expecting to be assaulted within their Trenches, the French
fell diligently to finish their line of circumvolution, making new Forts
thereupon for their more safety; and <hi>Harcourt</hi> having found by
experience what scarcity of bread the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged underwent by taking away the
water from their Mills; he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted once more to take it away by a greater
diversion; he therefore immediately caused greater banks to be thrown up
against the mouth of the Channel; which being the worst of evils that the City
could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo, the Citizens, and the Prince endeavour'd to disturb that work;
and to put the water into its wonted course: but they could not do it, for a
great many of the French assisting in the work defended the Work-men, and kept
the enemy from hurting them, and from impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the work; but going thither
afterwards with greater forces, they made a gap which brought water to three
Mills; but this lasted but a while, for the bank was quickly made up, and the
Mills went dry as before; yet some Hand-mills being in this interim made, the
scarcity was by continual labour lessen'd; and the City was somewhat better
provided of bread; but the people were more afflicted, when hoping by the
Armies so glorious and so victorious passage over the River, to see it apply it
self presently to their relief and freedom, they saw it lie idle in the Plain
which it had won, and that it did not any thing to shew that it c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>red for the welfare of the besieged,
which made them all complain grievously. That which kept the Governour from
acting, was, that he might fortifie himself in the place which he had taken,
against the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

battle there, where having the <hi>Poe</hi> upon his back, he had no where
whereby to retreat, in case of of ill fortune, but by that narrow Bridge, which
he had caused to be thrown over; but when he had fortified he was not over
diligent in assaulting the enemies Trenches, as if he intended not to hazard
his Army under the enemies Fortifications; preferring therefore cautious,

these; who thinking it reasonable that for the preservation of himself, his
Sisters and the City, all the Kings Forces and Interests were to be hazarded,
held it also necessary to be done so for the safety <pb n="714" facs="tcp:53250:365"/> of
the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> for all <hi>Piedmont</hi> being to be lost by
the loss of <hi>Turin,</hi> he held that that State would be but badly
preserved after such a loss; and he the Prince not being a bare Captain or
Governour of a Town, he thought he ought not to suffer himself to be reduced to
such extreams, as that he might afterwards be necessitated to beg his life, or
at least his liberty, of the Conqueror; that therefore it became him, when he
might see from a far off that it was impossible for him to hold out, and that
he could not be relieved, to prevent surrendring, by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles suiting with his
condition. These complaints went accompanied with tacite protestations, that he
would accept of the large promises made him by the King of <hi>France,</hi> if
he would yield to the treaties of agreement which were yet on foot; alledging
and giving out, that if the Governohr would carry on affairs, aiming only at
the Kings private interests, he ought not to wonder, if he the Prince, passing
by the common concerns, should advise and govern himself, according to his
private ends, and those of his house. These were the debates and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercations
which past between the Prince and Governour during the whole Siege, whilst the
Prince complain'd that he was abused in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, not seeing any effect
of so many promises, nor of his hoped for succour; and the Governour, that he
was drawn into precipices, as concerning the common cause, by the Prince, and
by the too cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious attempt propounded by him; which tended not to the good
leading on of the succour, but to the apparent ruine of the Army, and of the
whole enterprise; which would certainly be brought to a good and honourable
issue, by safer and more cautious Counsels. Thus the Prince, who was naturally
stout and couragious, detested the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours comportments, and accused him of
timerousness, and sometimes of double dealing; and the Governour, the more he
saw the Prince de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to hazard all, upon the fortune of a general assault,
the more he thought his Counsels and Proposals to be destructive: he therefore
would not be drawn from his resolution of delivering the almost fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mished City,
by famishing the French Army: he therefore sent his Cavalry to over-run the
Country, and forrage the highways by which Victuals might be brought to the
enemies Camp; and he found his counsel to be good; for he daily heard news of
the intercepting of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals. This his design was also more authenticated by
Letters writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten from the Dowagers Agents to the General, which were
intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, wherein he was told that he was not to build much upon any help
from <hi>Savoy,</hi> unless he would keep the ways open for succours from else
where; and the sequel did approve of the Governours counsel; for Victuals
growing very scant in the French Camp, their Souldiers would come to the Walls
of the City, and beg a piece of bread, which sometimes was given them even by
the Prince his permission; and for that the City wanted Grass and Forrage for
Horses more then bread, a bartering was agreed upon between the besiegers and
besieged for Grass and Straw, for bread; a great sign of the extream want the
besiegers were reduced to. The Prince complained grievously of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and propounded sometimes one thing, sometimes another, that he might be once
free of the misery he was in; but he was not at all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved therewith; he was
more moved by the treaties of agreement which <pb n="715" facs="tcp:53250:365"/> were still
kept on foot between the Prince and the French Agents, and with the great
offers that were made the Prince, if he would adhere to <hi>France,</hi> and
forego <hi>Spain,</hi> and if he and his Brother would quit all claim of
Regency to the Dowager; wherefore it became the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be very careful
of distasting the Prince, lest being allured by the French offers, and
scandalized at his proceedings, he might em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the former; wherefore the
Prince proposing, finally, that since he continued constant in overcoming the
French by famine, it would be better for him to leave a competent Garrison in
<hi>Montcalleri,</hi> which might secure that Bridge, which kept the way open
between his Camp and the parts beyond the <hi>Poe;</hi> and to go with the rest
of the Army to <hi>Giuliascho</hi> and <hi>Collegno,</hi> Towns three miles on
the back of <hi>Turin,</hi> upon the way which leads to <hi>Pinarollo,</hi> and
<hi>Susa;</hi> for that by residing in <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legno,</hi> which is situated
upon the <hi>Dora,</hi> he would not only block up the aforesaid ways of
<hi>Susa</hi> and <hi>Pinarvole;</hi> but those of the <hi>Canavese</hi> and of
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> by which the enemies Camp would be formally besieged, and
would be forc'd for fear of famine to rise in a short time.</p>
            <p>The Governour, were it either that he approved of this advice, or
that he desired to like whatsoever the Prince proposed, (provided that he were
not thereby to hazard his men;) resolved to follow it, the rather for that he
was counsell'd so to do by the Count <hi>Sirvela,</hi> who was Embassadour in
extraordinary from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth of
<hi>Genoa;</hi> a Gentleman of excellent parts, and who was then in the Camp,
and by whom the Governour was much ruled; and who, having by the Kings
appointment been ayding to the carrying on of the main affair in all this
Campagnia, had had his share therein. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour therefore had already
constituted Don <hi>Luigi Ponze, Di Lion,</hi> Commander of 2000 Foot and 800
Horse, who were to be left for the safety of that quarter, when he should go
with the rest of his men to those Towns: This advice was also furthered by news
from <hi>France,</hi> that the King being at last moved by the imminent danger
of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, if speedy succour should not be sent, had taken order to
send good recruits both of men and victuals to the Camp in <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
But on a sudden, (nor was it known upon what occasion) the Governour cut his
resolution in two, which certainly would have been better for the full
accomplishment of the enterprise, if it had been entirely executed as the
Prince advised: He sent Don <hi>Carlo della Gatta</hi> with a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of
Horse, and with about 4000 Foot to <hi>Collegno,</hi> to the end that
quartering and fortifying himself there he should do what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the whole Camp
was to have done if it had gone thither, which was, to block up all the avenues
from succour and victuals. <hi>Gatta</hi> past succesfully on with his men to
the place appointed, by the way of <hi>Mille Fiori;</hi> though a thousand
Horse went coasting along by him, which came out of the line of Circumvolution:
For the Prince sallying at the same time out of the City, had faln upon the
Enemies quarters toward the <hi>Dora;</hi> and the Governour was gone to give a
feigned Allarme to <hi>Vallentino;</hi> and the Garrison of <hi>Cheri,</hi>
being recruited by the Trades-men, had at the same time assaulted the
fortifications which were above the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins. So as the French being diverted
into many parts could not much impede <hi>Gatta</hi> in his passage; who coming
to <hi>Collegno,</hi> drove out <pb n="716" facs="tcp:53250:366"/> the French Garrisen, and
being master thereof, began immediately to fortifie it better: The Governour
also instead of taking <hi>Grugliaseo,</hi> look <hi>Bianesco,</hi> which
stands upon another way which leads from <hi>Pinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volo,</hi> but a little
lower then <hi>Graliasco;</hi> and consequently neerer the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of
<hi>Montcalleri,</hi> by which the besieging Camp was somewhat more
streightned, and almost as much besieged as the City. The taking of
<hi>Collegno</hi> caused much jealousie in <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that his Trenches might rather be assaulted on that side then elsewhere; and
they being weaker then the rest, he put stronger Garrisons into them, and
fortified them better towards <hi>Collegno;</hi> the same day that <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ta</hi> came to <hi>Collegno</hi> he
met with a fair occasion of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepting a great conduct of Victuals, as he
did; and of routing a Regiment of the Dowagers which served for a Convoy
thereunto: he also defeated 500 Horse, and 500 Foot of Count <hi>Verrua</hi>'s;
which were coming from <hi>Susa</hi> to the Camp, and either slew almost all of
them, or took them Prisoners, except the Count, who got safe with some Horse to
the Camp <hi>Vincenzo della Marra,</hi> a <hi>Neopolitan</hi> Gentleman, took
also 60 load of Corn and utterly defeated the Convoy; and the Governour having
sent the Horse of his quarters towards <hi>Mille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiori</hi> had a gallant
Skirmish with the Enemy, where the <hi>Corps de guard,</hi> which were therein
was totally put to the sword; at the same time, or a little before, the French
having thrown a Bridge over the <hi>Dora,</hi> between the Meadows called
<hi>Vanchiglia,</hi> and the New-Park, which made very much for Communication
between the quarters of the <hi>Burgo,</hi> and of the Capuchins, with those
beyond the <hi>Dora,</hi> the Prince took a fancy to try whether he could
deprive the enemy, or no, of that conveniency, and free the City of the
inconvenience which might result by the communication of those quarters by
means of that Bridge; he to this purpose Sallied out by night very strong, both
in Horse and Foot; and though he cut the Ropes in sunder which fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the
bridge on this side, yet the enemy easily mended it, and put it into it's
former condition, and made some fortifications for the safety thereof; the
Prince being desirous to attempt the same again, he sent Don <hi>Mauritio</hi>
with 300 Horse, thither, and Marquess <hi>Serra</hi> with two squadrons of
Foot, one Spanish, one Italians; these sent <hi>Fra. Iovan Pallavicino</hi>
with some Foot to discover the Bridge; who finding it newly fortified, whilest
some sleight Skirmishes past between him and the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, they might see five
companies of Horse come from the <hi>Borgo,</hi> and advance towards them, to
cut them off from joyning with their companions; against which Don
<hi>Mauritio</hi>'s Cavalry advancing, <hi>Fra. Iovanni</hi> had conveniency to
withdraw to a place of Safety, and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated himself with <hi>Serra,</hi>
who went not onely to shelter Don <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritio</hi>'s Cavalry with his
squadrons of <hi>Musketiers,</hi> but to fall upon the enemies Horse, which
were forced with much loss to face about, and get into a place of safety: and
though some other squadrons of Horse came from <hi>Vallentino</hi> to relieve
him, yet they came not time enough; for they were de ained by the Cannon which
played from the works of the City, and by musket-shot which poured down from
the Walls; but the Bridge not being ruined neither by this second attempt, the
Prince threw another Bridge over the same River, that he might pass 
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:53250:366"/> over to the other shore when he pleased, and receive any
succour that might come by that way; a difficult business; for all the Bank
beyond the River was defended by a Battery levell'd against the Mills; but the
knowledge that Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> (who together with <hi>Pianezza</hi> was
quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered there) was gone with most part of the Piedmontese Horse else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
and the Enterprise being intended at the third hour of the Sun, when the night
Guards being relieved grow remiss, encouraged them to the Enterprise, which was
wholly given to <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>lognino,</hi> who going forth with Horse and Foot, threw over the
Bridge with little loss, over which the Foot pass'd the next day; part of them
were sent towards the Park, against some Foot which guarded a Redout, which was
over the against the old broken bridge of the Park; which Redout being
assault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Defendants cut in peices, was taken; the other part went to
assault a body of men who guarded a half Cannon, placed over against the new
bridge; who being routed, the half Cannon fell into the assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants hands,
which they began to draw towards the <hi>Dora;</hi> but <hi>Pianezza</hi>
hearing thereof strove to repair the loss. He therefore headed two squadrons of
French Horse which were in that place, and the ordinary Troop, and spur'd on a
pace to assault the Enemies Horse; and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing fiercely with them, (the
half Cannon and those that carried it away put to flight;) the Foot with some
of the Horse past back over the <hi>Dora,</hi> the rest were chased by
<hi>Pianezza</hi> towards the Park; yet were the takers but little prejudiced;
for the Enemy having in the heat of the pursuit left the half Cannon behind
them, they immediately took it again, and brought it to the banks of the
<hi>Dora,</hi> where it was under good shelter; and being impossible to be
recovered, it was carried in triumph into the City. But the French were as well
damnified by the Garrison within the City, as by the Army without; for together
with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual pressure of victuals, the Garrison of <hi>Collegno</hi>
having ransack'd the Country as far as <hi>Pinarvolo,</hi> had spoiled the mils
which were not far from that Town; and put the Town in such a terrour, as it
kept the Gates shut for many dayes. And <hi>Gatta</hi> going with 1000 Horse
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into those parts, fell upon St. <hi>Secondo,</hi> a Town neer
<hi>Pinarvolo,</hi> where he kill'd 200 Dragoons, and took their Captain
Prisoner.</p>
            <p>The Prince Cardinals Horse likewise, which were sent (as hath been
said) to the Spanish Camp, being come from <hi>Beinesco</hi> under Count
<hi>Broglio,</hi> fell upon <hi>Rivalta,</hi> cut the Garrison in pieces, and
made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Masters of the Town; by these successes affairs proceeded well
for the relief of the City, and but ill-favor'dly for the besieging Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;
which was yet much more streightned by famine, and which was very grievous
within the time of Circumvolution, no victuals being possible to be brought
thither, so closely were all the Avenues block'd up; insomuch as they were
forced to make use of that small remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Victuals which was in the
Citadel, whereat the Governour there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of complained much, who being forced to
obey the Generalls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand protested that he would give over his charge meerly
for want of victuals, and that he must be forced to surrender the Citadel, when
the Army through famine should be necessitated to raise the siege; but
<hi>Harcourt</hi> cared but little for all those words and protestations, as
knowing that if the siege should be raised, the Citadel must inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably 
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:53250:367"/> be lost; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>nor herewithal content, he laid hand upon the victuals which were
le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t for the sustenance of the
Garrison in <hi>Chiavazzo</hi> which did but ill supply the want of the
famish'd army; so as <hi>Harcourt</hi> who thought to have furnish'd
<hi>Turin</hi> by siege, did famish his own camp, the the Citadel, and
<hi>Chiavazzo;</hi> and had he continued long in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the City had
not onely been freed by famine, but the Citadel and <hi>Chiavazzo</hi> would
have been taken by the relieving Army; and the Camp was already brought to that
low condition, as the daily allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of bread ceasing, some few ounces of
Rice taken from the Citadel, were in lieu thereof distributed amongst the
Common Souldiers; nor fared the Captains any better; and yet <hi>Harcourt</hi>
persevered constant in his resolution of taking the City; nay, being offer'd
composition by the Nuntio, he would not listen to it: but as if he had been
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, demanded that the City might be absolutely delivered to him, which
he would keep in the Dukes name during the Dowagers Regency; and as if he had
been certain of what was to ensue, he protested he would continue the siege,
till such time as the Horses that were in <hi>Turin</hi> should have eaten all
the Hay and Forrage that was in the City, and the men all the Horses; he
moreover continued making great offers to the Prince: in so much as such
constancy being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contrary to the Genius of the French, who are
impatient of suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it caused much wonder in all men, who confest that the
French did therein not only out-do themselves, but did even out-do the
Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards, who are excellent good at suffering; but it was now almost
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible that the business could hold out any longer: for the Souldiers
having undergone all the extreams which it was possible for humane nature to
tolerate, many of them fell sick, many died, and many ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, some into the
City, some into the Spanish Camp: and every one of them relating their share of
the great extremities that the besiegers were in, they occasioned (which was
miraculous) so various, differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and contrary opinions between the Prince
and the Governour, as the result thereof proved almost the utter ruine of the
common af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the safety of the French: the Prince, who grew daily more
and more impatient of delay, and infinitly desirous to see himself freed from
siege by a general assault, thought it was now high time to assault a body of
an Army which was languishing, afflicted, and macerated by famine, sufferings,
and assiduous labour, and which seemed not fit to manage Arms, and could but
ill bear with the Governours phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick patience, who ruling rather like a
Cunctator then Dictator, persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted the more in his resolution of overcoming by
sitting still, for that he saw the Enemy reduced to the utmost brink of
necessity, and that the main aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ir consisted in having patience for a few days: But the news which
was divulged of the great succour both of men and meat which was sent from
<hi>France,</hi> and was already arrived in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> troubled the
Prince above all things else, fearing that if it should come before the Siege
was raised, all the Governours calculations would be subverted, and the siege
would be reduced to its former condition, with little hopes that the Governour,
who would not move when he had so fair an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of overcoming, should
hazzard his men in keeping off the succour, or in relieving the City, when he
should see the Enemies Camp recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="719" facs="tcp:53250:367"/> with men,
strengthned, and invigoured by the great supply of victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. The scarcity that
was in the City of gun-powder, did make the Prince more desirous to see an end
of so great anxiety before so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary a sustenance of defence should fail:
And amongst all these agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mind, great jealousies and suspitions were
not wanting, making him believe, or lest doubt, that the Governour by whom he
thought he was abandon'd at the <hi>Ponte della Rotta,</hi> should be as
careless of reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at the present; not out of any wariness, or any
mystery of War, but rather for that hatching his accustomed tancour in his
breast, he looked with an ill eye upon his weighty interests, not caring to
assist him in his so great streights. These considerations made the Prince
impatient in expecting what the issue of the Governours designes would be. But
it was thought he was most grieved to see how happily the Governours designes
proceeded, which was no less hateful to him then to the Enemy, and was more mad
thereat then <hi>Harcourt;</hi> foreseeing by the manner of his proceeding his
own utter undoing, the ruine of his family, and the loss of his peoples liberty
for which he fought. The Prince knew as well as <hi>Harcourt,</hi> that if he
the siege should in any way raised, that if the siege should in any way be
raised, the Citadel would undoubtedly be thereupon surrendred. He also knew
that if the siege should be raised by famine and not by the sword, the
Governour would enter into the City victorious, with his forces entire, and
would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly use such supercheries as Victors usually do; and would set
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward his pretentions to the Citadel, which he the Prince being so short of
him in forces, could not obviate. Therefore not onely he, but all the
Piedmontese was so fill'd with horrour, as they were in doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it
would be better for them, that the City should be relieved by that way, or not
at all relieved. And not knowing what to do in so great extremity, they could
think of no better way to evade it, then by using their utmost means that the
Spaniards and the French might be brought to fight together; hoping that if the
French should be beaten, they might be masters of the City; and that if the
Spaniards should be worsted, they might be masters of the Citadel; and that the
Piedmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tese, who were in the midst between them, might be able to oppose the
Victors, and to preserve their Ducall Family and their own liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; in which
bustling the Prince might probably promise himself, that the remainders of the
French Army, as also those of the Citadel, being of Enemies become his Friends,
might joyn with him in exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Spaniards; and he was almost certain,
that the Governour, to shun greater inconveniencies, would give way that the
Citadel should rather remain in his hands, then in those of the French. The
Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dator <hi>Pas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ro,</hi> one
of much experience, and in great authority with the Prince, was cry'd up for
the Author of these counsels; which being divulged about the Court were
approved of by the Piedmontese no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, as those who being naturally more
inclined to the French then to the Spaniards apprehended, that to fall under
the Spanish Empire; was the worst of evils that could befall them. They
therefore thought that, to keep from that misfortune, they had best embrace any
thing how slender so ever, and expect better fortune. The Prince being
oppress'd by the nearness and by the greatness of the danger, which 
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:53250:368"/> though it was foreseen when a far off, yet was it never
so inevitable nor formidable as now. Being therefore resolved to do all that
was possible, he sent a Letter to the Governour on the seventh of
<hi>Iuly,</hi> wherein he signified unto him, that he could hold out no longer,
and that if he were not relieved within four dayes at the furthest, he would
without more a doe accept of the French offers, and would surrender the City:
Which Letter was very unfortunate for the Prince, and for the business in order
to the relief, and to the raising of the siege, was the ruine of the common
affairs, did overthrow the Princes cause; and on the contrary, raised the
French Army out of the extream precipice and danger whereinto it was more then
manifestly brought. The City was not effectually in so great streights as the
Prince would fain have made it been believed to be; for it had great store of
Corn, nor did it want grist as before, that default being much supply'd by
hand-mills which were daily made: And though, in conforminy to what the Prince
had writ, the Governour was also informed by Don <hi>Antonio Sotelo,</hi> of
the aforesaid wants, who though he was chief of the Kings men, and affairs that
were handled in the City, had upon many occasions appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e to please the Prince, then careful
of the Kings concernment; yet the Governour had received contrary intelligence
from other Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and in particular from Marquess <hi>Serra;</hi> who
looking more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly into affairs, knew that the City might hold out longer;
and woe his mind freely to the Governour, and did assure him that there were
those who had offer'd to maintain the City with bread for two moneths, at no
exorbitant rates: Which offers the Prince refused, as thinking them impossible
to be performed; and though there was more want of powder then of bread, yet it
was found that the City held out, and made stout sallies upon the Enemies
quarters, twenty days after the eleventh of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and yet had received
no recruit in powder; and the danger of the French succour, which was said to
be very neer, proved vain; for <hi>La Gatta</hi> being stronger in
<hi>Collegno</hi> then the relievers, who were not above 4000 Foot, and some
Horse, it was impossible for to pass that way, or to force the Garrison. The
Governour seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self taken off from continuing his designes, and bereft of
the victory which he so longed after, and was neer getting, by the Princes so
precise pressures, and resolute pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>estations, he was much astonished, and was the more confused, for
that by letters, which he received at the same time, he was informed (as hath
been said) that the City was in a far different condition from what it was
represented to be in by the Prince; so as suspecting the Princes pressures must
needs ayme at some hidden end; amongst many things which he thought upon, at
last he light upon one or two; either that the Prince had closed with the
French, or was upon agreeing with them. And that therefore, that he might the
better honest his surrounding of the Town, he put him upon the poynt of speedy
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that so he might provide for himself, abandon the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ake himself
to the King of <hi>France;</hi> or else that he would revive his claim to
putting of a Garrison into the Citadel. The Governour had alwayes proceeded so
reservedly with the Princes, as without either assuring them of his intent, or
making them despair, he had still held them in expectation that they should be
pleased; and they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <pb n="721" facs="tcp:53250:368"/> confident to have what
they pretended unto either with his will or against it; wherefore he was forc'd
to vary his determination in the Enterprise, though it proceeded on very
successfully, and to put the certainty of Victory upon the uncertain chance of
a Dye: He therefore began greatly to doubt what peradventure was true; he knew
no better way how to avoid this exigency then by feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Paseroe</hi>'s
Pulse with offering him six thousand Pistols to procure the Prince to delay his
expectation of succour for fifteen days, to the end that he might the better
attend the keeping out of that relief which was expected by the enemy from
<hi>France;</hi> hoping, nay firmly believing, that if that succour could be
kept out, the Siege would be raised before the desired time of delay should be
expired; and that by this means he should not need adventure his Forces in
relieving the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The care of this was committed to Marquess <hi>Serra,</hi>
who was chiefly trusted by the Governour in carrying on this Siege; but this
Negotiation not being to be ended so soon, by reason of the difficulty of
giving and of receiving advertisement, and for that it becomes those that
negotiate in such affairs to wait the conjuncture of times; the eleventh day
being come before the Negotiation was ended, the Governour, who had precise
Orders from the King not to give the Prince any occasion of foregoing his
party, he suffer'd himself to be pul'd on by necessity, and by the Prince his
inclinations, (as one doth sometimes who rides an unruly horse) and resolved,
to please him; he therefore agreed upon the doing of it in this manner. The
Governour was to go from his quarters of <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> and
<hi>Gatta</hi> from his of <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legno</hi> upon the break of day, on the
eleventh day, upon the sign being given by certain fires, and should fall upon
the enemies Trenches. <hi>Gatta</hi> was to assault those which were between
the <hi>Porporata</hi> and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Channel which is called
<hi>Martinetto;</hi> and the Governour, those which do terminate on the banks
of <hi>Poe</hi> neer <hi>Valentino:</hi> that the same night 1000 Horse should
be sent to the Prince by a Foord over the <hi>Poe,</hi> which being joyned to
his Horse might enable the Prince to sally strongly out of the City that same
night, and face the enemies Horse. The Prince was to go with this recruit of
Horse, and with the Spaniards which were with him, towards <hi>Valentino,</hi>
to facilitate the Governours entrance on the innerside; and to the end that
these three, which were the chief, actions might succeed the better, the
Governour was to place eight piece of Cannon upon the hills beyond the
<hi>Poe,</hi> and to play there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with upon the tops of the Trenches, and drive
the enemy from thence, and so facilitate the assault that was to be given on
that side. Divers provisions also were made to the same purpose, thus; The
Dragoons and Croats were to be sent to scoure along the other parts of the
Trenches, to keep them in aw with feigned assaults, and intent upon defending
themselves. Don <hi>Silvio</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> was to advance towards <hi>la
Stura,</hi> with the Horse that were without, and was to fall upon the Quarters
beyond the <hi>Dora,</hi> or at least to seem as if he would do so. The
Mountainers beyond the <hi>Poe</hi> were to assault the Forts upon the
Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puchins Hills, with the Horse which were of the Garrison of <hi>Cheri.</hi>
These three diversions were to be made at one and the same time, to the end
that the besiegers being assaulted on these three sides might not 
<pb n="722" facs="tcp:53250:369"/> come to assist the Trenches which were to be assaulted
by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and <hi>Gatta;</hi> things being thus ordered, an accident
hapned which made the Governour alter the hour appointed for the assault; he
heard that the succour from <hi>France</hi> was come to <hi>Giavenna,</hi> a
Town five miles from <hi>Collegno;</hi> and searing that if <hi>Gatta</hi>
should go to give the assault by break of day he might run danger of being
fallen upon by the French, who were the Convoy for the succour, on the back, he
ordered him to forbear falling on till noon; when if the French should not
move, he should; and according to Orders should give the assault; but if the
French should be already moved, he should keep within his quarters till he
should receive new Orders. <hi>Gatta</hi> heard, by his Scouts, that the French
would not move that day; whereof he advertised the Governour; and being come
four hours before Sun-set to the Trenches, he fell couragiously upon them with
4000 Foot, and 2000 Horse; his first assault was bravely received, and at last
he was repuls'd, and had some of his men slain, amongst which Camp-master
<hi>Emilio Ghiglino, la Motta,</hi> who was in defence of that part with his
Regiment discharg'd the part of a valiant Souldier, and judicious Commander;
but coming with more vigour to a second assault, the Foot scaled the Trenches,
and making way for the Horse, the Horse and Foot joyntly entered, who, had they
been more considerate, this very action had freed the City; for the breach
which was made being made good by Garrisons and Fortifications, the Line was
open, and at the disposal of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who without forcing the Trenches
at <hi>Valentino</hi> might have entred by this breach and have destroyed the
besiegers, and broken the line of circumvolution; and if he had not resolved to
put himself to this hazard by keeping that breach in his possession, he might
have sent what succours he had pleased into <hi>Turin;</hi> so as the besiegers
losing their hopes of the Siege would have risen of themselves, and have given
the business over; but whilst <hi>Gatta,</hi> when he had broke into the
Trenches ran with his Horse towards the City, according to his Orders received
from the Governour, to joyn with the Prince, and cared not to guard the breach
which he had made, and whilst some of the Foot that were entred fell to plunder
the enemies Huts and Pavili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other some to pursue in disorder those
that fled; the French who were driven from desending the Trenches had time to
get under the shelter of the Artillery of the Citadel, and to rally, and
re-order themselves; and being assisted by many others who were come from other
parts of the line to help here, they made a good body, and turn'd upon the
enemy, who were in disorder and busie in plundering, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they slew and
wounded many; and it hapned that Don <hi>Michele Pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natello,</hi> Captain of
the Rere, who entred therewith, when those that were entred before were ill
handled by the French, was assaulted as he would have defended himself; and
though he resisted stoutly, yet having no Horse, for they were all gone towards
the City, he found he could not well keep the field; so spying a little Fort
not far off, between the City and the line of circumvolution, he entred
thereinto with the best of his men, thinking to defend himself there; but the
Fort not being able to receive so many men, those who got in resisted as long
as their powder lasted, and afterwards betook themselves to their Pikes; but
the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants <pb n="723" facs="tcp:53250:369"/> valour was overpower'd by the multitude
of French, who still encreasing in numbers took the Fort, and put all the
defendants to the sword, except <hi>Pignatello,</hi> and some Officers, who
were taken priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; what with these, and some others that were amongst the
Tents, 500 of the Spanish Army were slain, but not without revenge; for many
more French perished, amongst which two Camp-marshals, twelve Lieutenants, four
Captains and seven Officers, and Colonel St. <hi>Andrea</hi> was taken
prisoner. The worst that befel the besieged was, that the French making use of
the errour committed by the relievers presently made up the breach of the
Trench which <hi>Gatta</hi> had aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and kept out 70 load of powder,
part whereof fell into the hands of the Enemy, and part was carried to
<hi>Collegno.</hi> The Prince had no notice given him that the hour of assault
was altered; for the shortness of time and difficulty of giving advertisement
could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it; he therefore waited all that night in Arms with his men,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an assault should be given at break of day, and that the
re-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of Horse by <hi>Vanchiglia</hi> should appear; he continued in
this posture till noon; but failing at last of his so long expectation, and not
expecting that any thing that had been promised should be performed, he much
unwillingly retreaed to the City, and dismis'd his men who were very weary,
that they might repose themselves after their long watching, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ins which they had taken the preceding
right: when not many hours after he heard of the assault given by
<hi>Gatta;</hi> and not long a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ter
he might see the Souldiers appear victorious, who brought him certain news of
the succours being entred; wherefore he suddenly summon'd all his Souldiers to
their Ensigns, and though he had not above 300 Horse with him, he
notwithstanding resolved to go towards <hi>Valentino,</hi> to facilitate the
Governours entry on that side, according to agreement; he took
<hi>Tavora</hi>'s and <hi>Serra</hi>'s Brigades along with him, and the
Burgondian Souldiers, and advancing with his Cavalry towards the Trenches be
took the hedge which incompassed the Fort which shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the way that comes
from <hi>Montcalleri</hi> and <hi>Pioppi;</hi> he sent others to get ground
upon the Fort which defends <hi>Valentino</hi> towards the City; and a number
of Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>izens, who went out with the
Prince, joyning with some of <hi>Serra</hi>'s men, took a redoubt first, and
then got in even to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of <hi>Valentino,</hi> which they took and
plundred. <hi>Gatta</hi> at this time joyned with the Prince, together with
2000 Horse which were entred before; so as being thus strongly recruired he
advanced towards the Trenches which were then assaulted by the Governour on the
out side, or ready to be assaulted; and being gotten to <hi>Pioppi</hi> he took
a Farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house and a neighbouring Chappel which environed the Fort which was
assaulted on the out side; and though he saw the souldiers very desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to
fall upon the same Fort on the inside, yet he held it better to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain their
forwardness, till he might see the succourers Ensigns
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in that Fort; for the
Governour, at the same time that <hi>Gatta</hi> assaulted the Trenches, was
gone from his quarters to <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> and went to assault
<hi>Valentino;</hi> but not with any intention of adventuring the rest of his
Forces the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e: his chief end was to
entertain the Enemy in desending that part, so as they might not oppose
<hi>Gatta,</hi> who when he should have broken into the line of circumvolution
was to joyn <pb n="724" facs="tcp:53250:370"/> with the Prince, and fall joyntly on the
Trenches on the inside, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the assault from without, to the end that
the Trench being thrown down both within and without, they might raise the
Siege, and ruine the besiegers. The eight Cannons on the Hill beyond the
<hi>Poe</hi> had from the break of the day plaid uncessantly upon the Parapets
of the Trenches about <hi>Valentino,</hi> which were to be assaulted; and
having broken down a Bulwark which was neer the banks of <hi>Poe,</hi> towards
which the Governour sent Don <hi>Lewis di Lincastro,</hi> with his Brigade and
with many Ladders, Bridges and little Huts, after whom he also sent the other
Camp-master Don <hi>Iovan Artiaga,</hi> with his Brigade, and with some of
Prince <hi>Borso</hi>'s and Don <hi>Iovan Pignatello</hi>'s Brigades, against a
Fort which flank'd the way from <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> and which was the same
upon which the Prince expected to see the victorious Ensigns set; but these and
the rest being somewhat at a loss, they occasioned some confusion: yet they
went on to an assault; but though the assault were twice re-inforced they could
do no good upon it, but were at last for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to retreat; wherefore the
Governour, finding that the aids from within were not answerable to his Forces
without, began to apprehend <hi>Gatta</hi>'s success, since he could not hear
that he was entred; so as night drawing on, and having lost 500 Foot in that
assault, and six Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, he caused a retreat to be beaten, and gave over the
enterprise; a more unfortunate or disastrous succour then this hath not been
read of; for it ended very unfortunately, not only for that <hi>Gatta</hi> had
no ways aided the Governour in his assault, nor for that he had not guarded not
kept open the breach he had made, and whereby he entred; but for that having
carried neither powder nor victuals with him, it served to no purpose; for
without these those that were entred were neither able to force the Enemies
quarters, nor to defend the City; so as their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance did but little good,
nay rather harm, since they were to be sed by the Cities Victuals; those who
entred, being as it were so many imprisoned <hi>Sampsons,</hi> imployed in
nothing but in turning about Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mills, to supply themselves with Victuals and
the City with Grift: nor did the mischief cease here; for the Governours Army
being deprived of so noble a part of his men, who being broken into the
Trenches were there shut up, was rendred unable for bringing any more succour;
and on the contrary, the French Army was hereby freed from all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; it
languished before for hunger, and was only sed with slender hopes whether the
succour which was expected from <hi>France</hi> would force its way, or no,
through the Pass, and opposition which was made at <hi>Collegno;</hi> where
their fear was certainly greater then their hopes: but <hi>Gatta</hi>'s assault
removed all difficulties; for that he might give, it he had left but a small
Garrison in <hi>Collegno,</hi> and the Gates almost open; so as the French
succour made use of the occasion, and almost beyond all expectation came the
next day after <hi>Gatta</hi>'s entrance to the Enemies Camp, and having
recruited it with Victuals and Men did in an instant free it from the misery it
was in, being almost ready to ask mercy of the Enemy, or to retreat as it did
at <hi>Cheri,</hi> and made it frollick and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, and of being almost
conquered it became Conqueror; and having no cause to fear the Spanish Army, it
became doubly formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as well by the encrease of its own Forces, as by the
weakning of <pb n="725" facs="tcp:53250:370"/> the Spanish Army. The Scene of affairs being
thus strangely altered, new and more fervent rancours and reciprocal complaints
arose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince and the Governour, and between their Souldiers and
Captains; each of them laying the fault of this disaster upon other. The
Governour, that he was too much importuned to this action by the Prince, and
said that if he had continued a few days longer in his own course he had
assuredly gotten a famous Victory, without effusion of blood; he also
complained that the Prince had not assisted from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the assault which he
gave without, which was the occasion of all the misfortune; on the contrary,
the Prince exclaimed horribly upon the Governour, for that he had not sent him
any Horse by <hi>Vanchiglia,</hi> that he came not really, and with all his
Forces to assault the Trenches; that he had altered the time appointed without
giving him any notice; and he also complained of some lesser failings, which he
said did concur to the misfortune of the success. It would be too tedious to
relate the bitter accusations which they laid one upon another, or rather the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargutions which past between the fautorers of them both; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon
which too accurately belongs not to the Office of a good Writer.</p>
            <p>The Governour, seeing this unfortunate success, and the loss of
those men who were entred the City without Ammunition, bit his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ends
for madness, was grieved at the very heart, and blamed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for having
suffered himself to be removed from his first resolution; and considering that
the mischief would be yet greater, and irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, unless he could find
some means to send Ammunition of War in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the City, he cast about how he might
do it; and having long thought upon the business, he could not light upon a
better way then to convey it over by the Ford of the <hi>Poe</hi> called
<hi>Margerita,</hi> over against <hi>Vanchillia;</hi> he therefore sent some
loads underneath the Hill, which coming into the Valley which answers upon that
Foord, they came to the River; but the Governour having made signs to the
Prince by some fires, that he should send Horse to the River to receive them
(for all commerce between the besieged and the Spanish Camp was so block'd up
as they could not converse but by such signs) that now hapned which doth often
times fall out, that the signs not being understood, but very little good was
got thereby; so as none appearing from the City at the Foord, the Carriages
returned back by the same way that they went: And on the other side, fearing
what might ensue if no help were found out against this default, got together
as much Salt-peter and Sulphur as he could, whereby he provided, though but in
a scant measure, for the necessary and daily defence: But the Governours Forces
being so dis-joyned as they could not be of any help one to another, and
finding that the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Forces were not only refresh'd, but recruited, he
began to bethink himself rather how to secure those men which he yet had, then
how to relieve the City, or how to recover his losses; so as giving over his
first design of famishing or besieging the French Camp, nay, doubting the
safety of his abode at <hi>Montcalleri,</hi> he would provide himself of a more
secure quarter: Repassing therefore back again over the <hi>Poe,</hi> over the
which he had passed a little before with such glory and honour, he went to his
first quarters upon the Hills, where he thought he might keep 
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:53250:371"/> more safe from being assaulted, where he might better
defend himself, and watch any occasion which should be offered of relieving the
City; which <hi>Harcourt</hi> perceiving he took a course, that fearing less to
be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sauted on the other side beyond the <hi>Poe,</hi> he might draw many of
his Forces closer toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>her, and
joyn'd them almost all in defence of the bridge and <hi>Capuchins</hi> Forts,
where he made new Forts and new Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, that he might the better resist any
attempt that the Enemy might make upon those confining parts: Nor herewithal
content, having by experience known how easily the Enemy had made way to
relieve the City, what danger his Army had incurr'd by <hi>Gatta</hi>'s
entrance, he strove to prevent the like disasters for the future: He therefore
began a second line of circumvolution, which was two thirds lesser in compass
then the former; which though it needed a lesser number of Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>end it, yet he drew a good part of the
Garrison out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel to guard this second line, which beginning from
the furthermost angle of the Citadel struck strait toward <hi>la Dora,</hi> and
crossing the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> ex ended it self a little further, and then falling
towards the <hi>Poe</hi> enclosed the new Park, and then crossing the
<hi>Dora</hi> again drew neer the banks of <hi>Poe,</hi> and running along
thereby to <hi>Valentino</hi> joyned in a crooked line to the Citadel, from
whence it began. The Citizens were much afflicted at this second line, whose
numbers being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased both in Men and Horse, they were forced to let them
partake of that Bread and Forrage which was hardly sufficient for themselves:
Finding therefore, for certain, that things could not continue long in this
condition, they began to think of a remedy: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny entreated the Prince to
attempt getting out of the City, and to get with a good strength of Horse to
the Governour; and to try whether he could prevail more with him by his
presence then by his Letters, to do some gallant action for the freeing of the
City more then he had yet done: They wish'd him also to consider, that when his
person should be safe, come what would come, the common Affairs would not be so
much damnified as if he should meet with any misfortune in his own person; and
out of this respect only he was sollicited by Letters from the Governour. But
the Prince re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>used absolutely to
do so, not being able to abandon his Sisters in the common danger, who had
followed their Brothers fortune with such constancy; nor to forsake that
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where he was born a Prince, nor those people who to maintain his
Cause had put themselves into those troubles: And this Proposal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
absolutely denied, it was resolved that <hi>Gatta</hi> (who whilst he kept idle
in the City, by reason of the Souldiers and Horse that were entred with him,
was rather an incumbrance then a help) should a tempt forcing the Line with the
same Horse that he brought with him, at the same place of the
<hi>Porporata</hi> by which he had entred, and should go joyn with the
Governour; whereby the City was to receive a double ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; which should
thereby be eased of the great burthen of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining so many Horse, and the
Relievers should be made better able to assist it. This motion was presently
embraced, and put in execution, every one thinking that it might be easily
effected; for the Enemy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving drawn almost all his Forces towards the hills
had left all the other parts slightly guarded. <hi>Gatta</hi> went out in the
dark of night with the <pb n="727" facs="tcp:53250:371"/> Neapolitan and Dutch Horse, being
guided by some Troops of Cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats, and one of the Prince Cardinals Troops, led
on by Count <hi>Broglia,</hi> which carried spades and mattocks to throw down
the Trenches, and which might levell the way for the rest, who kept with
<hi>Gatta</hi> under the Bastion <hi>della Consolata,</hi> expecting News when
the way should be le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd. These went out, and luckily threw down the first
Line, and afterwards (though with some more difficulty) the second; but they
met with a very great impediment beyond it, which was a great ditch newly
digg'd behind the Trench, whereinto the water of <hi>Dora</hi> was brought; and
for their further misfortune, the earth of the Trench which was beaten down
falling into the Ditch, and mingling with the water made it muddy, and harder
to be pass'd over: Wherefore being astonished at this difficulty, which they
saw was not to be overcome, whilst they were thinking what to do, they were
discover'd by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and though some of them escaped by wading through the
ditch, many, notwithstanding, who attempted the same stuck fast, and not being
able to recover themselves were taken Prisoners, or were stifled in the mud,
amongst which Captain <hi>Lamas</hi> was one of the first; the greatest part
fled towards the City, some whereof saved themselves, some were slain, or taken
prisoners by the Enemy. <hi>Gatta</hi> seeing this misfortune gave over his
intended voyage, and went into the City a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; which not being any wayes eased
by its disgorgement returned to its former streights; which the Citizens
endeavouring to get out of, and finding that the scarcity of Grist, which was
encreased by the many mouths which were added to the eating thereof, was that
which would hasten their deaths, they attempted to open another channel to the
<hi>Dora,</hi> a little below the old and accustomed one, which was
notwithstanding much hindred by the Enemy. The Engineers disputed very much
whether the lowness of the <hi>Dora</hi> would not hinder the design, but it
proved easie; though not without much danger and labour, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time;
for they could not work but by night, by reason of the Enemies Musketiers; yet
in a months space they perfected the work, but could bring water only to four
Mills, which was a great consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the City; but this comfort lasted not
long; for the Enemy after having endeavoured by divers Batteries to beat down
the Mills, which were notwithstanding frustrated by the diligence of the
besieged; <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> made an out-let for the water on the opposite side
of the River, by which the water was turn'd away and the Mills were left dry;
it remained that some provision might be found out to furnish the City with
Ammunition of War, since by the abundance of Hand-Mills which were made they
provided sufficiently for Grist. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour agreed with the Prince to send
him 200 load of Ammunition at a certain hour of night, which was to be
conducted by Don <hi>Vincen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo Gonzaga,</hi> accompanied by a good body of
Horse, which was to bring the supply to <hi>la Motta</hi>'s quarter; whither
the Prince was to send Horse to receive it: but neither did this design
prosper; for the nights being very short, and <hi>Gonzaga</hi> being to foord
over <hi>la Stura</hi> and <hi>la Dora,</hi> after he had foorded over the
<hi>Poe,</hi> before he could come to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, he knew he could
not get thither before the Sun would be up; so as perceiving day break a little
after he had gotten over the <hi>Poe,</hi> and <pb n="728" facs="tcp:53250:372"/> fearing
lest he might be met by the way, he returned back. This night the Prince was
come in his own person out of the City to receive so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and so desired
a recruit; and with him was Don <hi>Antonio Sotte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> with all the Horse,
back'd by Marquess <hi>Serra</hi> with Foot; and being come to the place
appointed he was discovered, and assaulted by the Enemies Horse. The Prince
withstood the assault manfully, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a sore contest repuls'd the Enemy,
wherein <hi>la Serra</hi> behaved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self gallantly, who sheltering the Horse
with his Musketiers afforded them conveniency of forcing the assailants to
wheel about, who being pursued left above 200 of their men behind them, and
five Captains wounded; not above ten of the Prince his Forces being left
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, amongst which a Dutch Captain, who being stript was, to the admiration

have obtained unworthily. The day beginning to clear, and the Prince seeing no
Ammunition appear, he ordered a retreat, which was orderly and gallantly made
even in the face of the Enemy, though not without much grief for not being
suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured by their long expected Ammunition; but ere long the besieged were
provided of Powder and all things necessary for defence, by an unusual and
never before practised or known way, convey'd with safety and speed from the
Camp to the City. Commerce being block'd up, as hath been often said, between
the Camp and the City, so as there was great trouble of giving and receiving
advice upon reciprocal occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and necessities; a certain invention was
found out, by a hollow Bullet, whereinto Letters were put, and the hole stop'd
up with a stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made of a piece of Wire; which being put into a piece of
Artillery, was shot from the Camp into the City, and from the City into the
Camp, the sign being formerly given by a great smoak, to them who were to
receive it; that they might watch where the Bullet fell: by this means the
Prince and Governour conversed freely, such convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance being to be sent
hourly; which were afterwards, by way of mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, called flying Posts; and as
it is not hard to add to things which have been formerly found to succeed well,
this lucky and useful invention was improved in the conveying of Ammunition for
War in bigger Bullets, capable of fifteen pound weight of Powder, which being
more carefully squeezed together and put into a Mortar-piece, were by the force
of fire blown into the City over the Heads and Trenches of the besiegers who
were very angry thereat; and finally, this invention served to furnish the City
with Salt-peter, and with Salt, for want whereof it suffer'd much; especially,
since men being glad, for want of other meat, to eat the flesh of horses, this
food eaten without Salt caused much sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and mortality in the City: above
a thousand of these Balls or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets were thrown into the City, which
furnished the besieged with above 15000 pound weight of Powder. Thus did the
besieged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have <pb n="729" facs="tcp:53250:372"/> themselves, sparing their Victuals by
parcimony, and encreasing their Grist by Hand-mills; and provided for their
defence by this new device of flying Bullets, comforting themselves with hopes
of being one day freed from so many afflictions; amongst these adventures it
fell out, that Monsieur <hi>d' Argenson,</hi> and Monsieur <hi>di Govone,</hi>
who was Governour of the Citadel, as they went from the Camp to
<hi>Pinarvolo</hi> were taken prisoners by two Troops of Horse, carried to
<hi>Cheri,</hi> and were by order from the Governour sent to <hi>Millain.
Argenson</hi> was Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident of the Senate at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> a Gown-man,
but very well credited in Affairs both of Peace and War; and of such authority,
as little of any moment was done without his approbation, not only in the Camp,
but neither in all <hi>Piedmont.</hi> The Prince and Governour were very well
pleased with the taking of these two Gentlemen; for having it in their thoughts
to surprize the Citadel, which was but weakly garrison'd, a good part of the

               </gap>he Garrison, which had formerly
been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of all the scandal, and of the ill Government of the present
War, and which, as it were, spoil'd and disordered all the common de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
could be no longer an obstacle; for the Prince having upon this occasion
desired the Governour, that he would give over his pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Governour,
who saw all things in so desperate and ruinous a case, was better content that
it should fall into the Prince his hands, then into those of the French; and
resolved at last, though too late, to please the Prince therein; but this too
late remedy served but little to the expiring enterprise. The Prince when he
had obtain'd his desire, said (for what reason it is not known) that it was not
now time to make the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ended
attempt; which made the Governour interpret the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed enterprise in a
sinister sence, as if the Prince, verily believing that he should have his
desire denied, had intended to take some fair pretence of concluding the treaty
of agreement with the French, which was never yet laid down; so the design of
surprizing the Citadel va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd, diffidence and mis-understandings did daily
encrease; all was full of jealousie, which discomposed all Negotiations: Yet
the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour took no notice of any thing, by reason of the precise Orders
which he had from the King; he continually provided the Prince with all things
necessary; and particularly with Powder, though not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great expence; he
listned willingly to any thing that the Prince propounded touching the relief
of the City; but he interposed such difficulties in all attempts, as retarded
the execution till the occasion was over; nay, to seem no less desirous of
relieving the Prince, then the Prince was of being relieved, he would sometimes
propound other courses which might appear better and more convenient then those
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the Prince; which afforded matter of dispute between them, which
of their opinions were the best; so as whilst the business was argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the
opportunity of putting either of their opinions in execution was let slip: by
which it might be conjectured that the Governour being unwilling to adventure
more then he had done on the eleventh of <hi>Iuly,</hi> enter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ain'd the Princes proposals more in
words and appearance, then <pb n="730" facs="tcp:53250:373"/> in reality; not so much
doubting the weakness of his own Forces, as distrusting the Prince his
corresponding with him in the executing what should be attempted, as he had
experienced in his assaulting <hi>Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentino.</hi> Amidst these diffidences
which past between the Prince and the Governour, a sad accident hapned in the
City, which might easily have ruin'd the whole business, had not a sudden
remedy been found. The Souldiers began to fail of their pay, and it was
impossible for the Governour to pay them; so as the want of pay being added to
their necessitous living, many began to speak big; the Grisons being more
seditious then the rest gave apparent signs of Mutiny; and the other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
were likely to have followed their example, had not the prime Authour and Head
of this sedition been imprisoned by his Colonel, condemn'd to die, and
presently made to pass the pikes in the presence of them all. The terrour of
which example, though it did for the present quiet them all, yet the same
necessity remaining, more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal sedition was likely to have arose: But
the meer fame of Marquess <hi>Serra</hi>'s wealth, which won him credit
thorough all the Towns of <hi>Europe,</hi> did the like in <hi>Turin;</hi> so
as the meer news that he desired to take up mony upon interest, brought him in
all the ready mony that those of <hi>Turin</hi> had; who thinking it more
secure in his hands; then in their own houses, lent it him, to secure them from
the Souldiers sedition, and from firing the City. He having by this means
borrowed about 150000 Ducates, did by making ready payment pacifie the
Souldiers not onely for that time, but during the whole siege; but the
jealousies did still encrease between the Prince &amp; the Governour; who
finding himself daily press'd by the Prince to new undertakings, and being
threatened by him that he would close with the French, unless the Governour
would do as he would have him; he bethought himself also of treating with the
French, so to make the Prince jealous: He held the imprisonment of President
<hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genson</hi> to be a good expedient herein; in whose writings which he
had with him, when he was taken prisoner, an instruction was found from the
King of <hi>France,</hi> sufficiently contrary to both the Princes interests,
and in particular, to <hi>Thomaso</hi>'s person: And this President being one
who knew most of the secret practices belonging to <hi>Italy</hi> and
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> the Governour sent Abbot <hi>Vasques</hi> to treat with him
in the Castle of <hi>Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain,</hi> where he was prisoner: The Abbot was wary
and quick-witted, and very fit to carry on such a business, and a great
Confident of the Governours; and (which was most requirable in this present
occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence) very ill inclined to the Princes, and to the House of
<hi>Savoy;</hi> and it was known, that <hi>Argenson</hi> being in
<hi>Vallentino</hi> the year before, when the last Truce was there treated on
and concluded, and wherein <hi>Argenson</hi> was imploy'd on the behalf of
<hi>France,</hi> and the Abbot on that of <hi>Spain;</hi> the Abbot in some
familiar discourse which past between him and <hi>Argenson,</hi> said (were it
in jest or in earnest) that it would do well for the two Kings, and for the
preservation of peace and common union, if they would destroy the House of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and divide the Territory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging between them;
since it was found by experience, that the Princes of that Family were the
fomenters of the continual Warr and Dissentions between the two Crowns. To
which speeches though the President answered somewhat roundly, that his Kings
intention was <pb n="731" facs="tcp:53250:373"/> not onely to maintain, but to support and
further aggrandize that House; yet it was thought that the Governour being
encouraged by these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions which were found with the President, failed
not to sound the business, and to introduce some Treaty which might not be very
good for the Prince; if for nothing else, yet that he might at least deal with
the Prince, as the Prince dealt with him. What the result thereof was is not
known, the business being wholly conjectural, and which had no foundation but
onely the Abbots going to the President. But it may well be affirmed, that the
Prince did contract no small jealousies by this expedition, which he thought
tended much to the prejudice of his interests; which he did manifest by taking
away the mannaging of the common concernments from the Nuntio, who was a great
Confident of the Governours, which he put into the hands of those that adhered
unto the French, all things necessary for bodily sustenance growing this mean
while daily more and more scarce in the City; and the Forces in the Spanish
Camp decreasing, affairs were brought to great extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to both of them: And
though about 2500 Foot were come to the Spanish Camp from the Maritime parts,
yet did this recruit last but a while, more falling sick then were well; and
the number of those that ran away being added to those that were sick, the Camp
was in a short time much lessened. On the contrary, the French Camp did daily
increase in numbers and Forces; and though there was much mortality amongst
them also, yet was the arrival of new recruits greater then the mortality. The
news of <hi>Harcourt</hi>'s good and generous actions being divulg'd in
<hi>France</hi> drew many noble men and Gentlemen from that Court to
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> many Lords came nobly attended thither at their own expence,
and many greater recruits came thither. Marquess <hi>Villeroy</hi> with 1500
Burgondian Foot, and 400 Horse, Count <hi>Tonniere</hi> from <hi>Dolpheny</hi>
with 400 Horse, all of them of the noblest of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which he commanded
under the title of Constable; and Monsieur <hi>di Castellano</hi> from
<hi>Provence</hi> with four Foot Regiments, and 400 Horse. So as in so great a
dis-equality of Forces, it was thought impossible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the City: And yet
the Prince, who was indefatigable both of body and mind, and very vigilant upon
all occasions, having by seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall night sallies found the Enemy to be dowfie
and negligent in their guards, did likewise observe a woodden bridge, which was
newly thrown over the <hi>Poe</hi> by the French, between <hi>Vallentino</hi>
and the Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins bridge. And judging it very convenient for his ends, he
designed to bring in succour by it; this bridge was guarded by onely two small
Forts, neer the foot of the bridge which was on the left side of the River
towards <hi>Vallentine,</hi> the other end being totally unguarded. They
therefore that would come thither from the City must make way by the lower
Valley, and then take some little works not far from the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said petty
Forts, and afterward the Forts themselves. These difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties did not at all
trouble the Prince, who thought they might all he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, if all the Forces
which could be raised in the City would go o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> unexpectedly by night and fall upon them: He therefore desired
that when he should have overcome all those difficulties, and should be master
of the bridge, that the Governour should be ready with all his Forces, on the
other side, to pass over the River by that bridge, and <pb n="732" facs="tcp:53250:374"/>
joyn with him in suppressing the French Camp; wherein he did not doubt of
success. And to the end that the weakness of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Camp might not
keep him from taking this resolution, he ordered Don <hi>Silvio</hi> to joyn
with the Governour with 1000 Foot and 600 Horse, and that the Marquess
<hi>Bagnasco</hi> should do the like with a thousand other Foot; by means of
which recruits, and of 2000 Foot that were come from <hi>Millain,</hi> he
thought the Governour could not under pretence of weakness refuse the proposal.
He therefore acquainted him with his advice, with his reasons for it, and with
the manner and form how it should be put in practice, desiring and exhorting
him, that he would assist him on his side with all possible force and
punctuality, and joyn freely in this attempt; which, as it might justly be
thought to be the last, so he did promise unto himself it should prove the
happy end of the siege and of the war. He also writ unto him what was to be
done for the happy conduct of the enterprise, which was, that he was to come
privately with all his men about the going down of day, and that he should be
two hours before day at the foot of the hill, that was nearest the Bridge,
where he should tarry till he saw the six squibs fly, which he would give fire
unto when he should be master of the bridge, that then he should advance to the
bank, and joyn with him by the bridge; concluding that he should let him know
sometime that day, whether he would do this or not; for otherwise he protested
he could hold out the siege no longer, but was resolved to close with the
French. This proposal, to boot that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diffidences made against it, and
the Governours wonted aversion to hazard more then he had already done, seemed
full of difficulty and danger, and impossible to be effected, and destructive
to what both the Governour and the Prince was to do. For as for the Prince, he
being to fight by night against an Enemy, recruited by new and gallant Forces,
and many of the Nobility, against several Trenches and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, the
attempt would be more then rash; and as for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, though fortune
should so favour the Prince his bold attempt, as that he should make himself
master of the bridge; yet the other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes remained, which were to be met
with in passing over the River; for the bridge by which they were to pass over
was not made of sound timber, but onely sustained by small rafters, and so
streight, as not above three foot could march over it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>brest, without sides or parapetets, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed on the one
side to the Muskets of the bridge neer the Capuchins, and behind to the
Arillery placed upon the Capuchins Covent. So as give it for granted that the
bridge were both sound and firm, those that should pass pass over it must needs
be torne in pieces by the Musket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot and by the Artillery; and those few who
by miracle should get to the other shoar, not being shelter'd by those very
little Forts, they must necessarily be welcomed over by the Enemies Musketiers,
who would undoubtedly be come thither and would kill them; so as they should
not come to relieve others, but to be slain themselves. Out of these Reasons,
the Prince his design which was carried on rather out of a great desire of
freeing himself, then by any well weighed reason, was not approved by the
Governour: But because the closing with the French, and surrender of the City,
was added in case of refusal, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour <pb n="733" facs="tcp:53250:374"/> resolved to
satisfie the proposal rather in shew then in substance. The Prince was
therefore inform'd, that he should be satisfied according to his own manner;
and to this purpose the Governour moved the same night with his men towards the
place appointed. The Prince believing in the Governours correspondency betook
himself cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the business; he gave order that a thousand Dutch, who
guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Trenches opposite to the Citadel, should at the sign of going off
of a Cannon assault the Citadel; to divert the Enemy in so important a place,
he disposed of the Ecclesiasticks, and others of the weak vulgar, in defence of
the Walls; he went out of the City himself with the rest of the Garrison, and
with such Citizens as were fittest to manage Arms; and being full of hopes, he
appointed several parts for falling on to his best experienced Commanders; he
deputed others to defend those ways by which the Enemy might break in to
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb them: all these Commanders did their devoire; the line of the inward
Circumvolution was broken, and the other Fortifications taken; then coming to
the Bridge, they also easily mastered the other smaller Forts; so as the Prince
seemed to have wholly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rformed
his pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>. The last thing that was
to be done was to give fire to the squibs, whereby to call in the Governour;
but he came not; some said, because he was killed who was to fire the squibs;
but this appearing to be too unlikely, others said, that the Prince knowing
that the Governour was too far off to come in time enough with his men to his
succour, thought it was su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous to give fire to the squibs; which appeared
to be less likely then the former alledged reason; the truth was, that the
little Forts were not well taken, when all the French flock'd in so fast as
they were aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned as speedily as they were taken; those that defended one of
them ran away; and those of the other, who made some resistance, were cut in
pieces, so as there was no time to call in the Governour by firing; the squibs,
who had he been come to the Bridge which was recovered by the French; could not
have gotten thereby over to joyn with the Prince. The whole French Camp moved
at the first going off of the Cannon, which was the sign given by the Prince to
his men to fall on; and General <hi>Harcourt,</hi> accompanied by a good body
of men, hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himself in the business; but being entertained by Marquess
<hi>Serra,</hi> who was appointed to defend that station, though he met with
stout op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, yet more men coming in unto him, he made his way thorow the
Enemy; in which conflict <hi>Serra</hi> fought valiantly; but having lost his
Serjeant-Major, six Captains, and many of his best Souldiers, he was forced,
for safety of his life, to throw himself down head-long into a Valley that was
below.</p>
            <p>General <hi>Harcourt</hi> did at this time also run great hazard
of his life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shot with a musket-bullet thorow the brims of his hat, and
thorow the lock of his hair; and yet having rid his hands of <hi>Serra,</hi> he
hasted to recover the Bridge, whither at the same time came also Viscount
<hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renna, Plessis, Pralin,</hi> the Dowagers two Generals, Count
<hi>Tonniere,</hi> and the chiefest of the Camp, from several places, who
presently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the little Forts; and when it was cleer day, the
Assailants being plaid upon by the Cannon from the Capuchins Covent, the
Prince, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a long and stout resistance, got gallantly out of the Conflict,
and <pb n="734" facs="tcp:53250:375"/> retreated with his men towards the City, having left
behind him about 250 of his men, (whereof some were slain, some taken,) and
having slain as many of the Enemy. Thus the attempt which was so orderly, so
vigorously, and so hopefully made by the Prince, vanish'd: But the Prince not
at all dismay'd by this unfortunate success, quitted not the Enterprise; he
invited the Governour to make the same attempt the next night, either after the
same manner, or how the Governour should otherwise please; but he foreseeing
the unlikelyhood of the attempt, was further from it then before; wherefore the
Prince not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an answer sutable to his mind, seeing no hope of
succour, but that his condition grew daily worse, to keep himself from being
redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the utmost extremity, resolved not to defer surrendring the Town
any longer, but yielded it up at last upon these Conditions: 
<q>That on the 22. of <hi>September</hi> the Prince should put the
  City into Count <hi>Hancourt</hi>'s hands, who was to receive it in the King of
  <hi>France</hi> his Name, who would re establish it in the Regency of the Lady
  his Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, under the Sovereignty of her Son the Duke of <hi>Savoy:</hi> That
  the Prince should be permitted to go whither he would; and, That it should be
  at the Infanta's will, either to tarry, or go out of the City, and follow the
  Prince: That the Spanish Garrison might have leave to return to the Governours
  Camp: That the City should enjoy her Priviledges; and, That Justice would be
  therein administred as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, in the Dukes Name: That the Citizens should
  peacefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy their Goods and Fortunes; and, That Hostages should be
  reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procally given for the performance of what was agreed upon.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing was concluded touching the differences depending between
the Dowager and the Princes, notwithstanding that during the Siege it was
tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ated on by the Marquesses of
<hi>Pianezza,</hi> and <hi>Villa,</hi> the Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers Lieutenant-General in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and Abbot <hi>Mondino,</hi> General <hi>Gunsiero,</hi> and
by Count <hi>Muzane,</hi> in the Names of Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> and of the
Cardinal: Nor was there any mention of the Princes their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the
Crown of <hi>France:</hi> But three moneths were appointed for the discussing
and concluding of these things.</p>
            <p>Cardinal <hi>Richelieu</hi> seemed not to be any ways satisfied
with this Agreement, when he heard thereof, being desirous that
<hi>Harcourt</hi> should never have conseted that the Prince should have had
his liberty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obliging himself to joyn with the King of <hi>France</hi>
his party: But <hi>Harcourt,</hi> were it either that he found his Army much
weakned, or that he was transported with the greediness of Victory, or that, as
a Prince of Noble descent, he commiserated the misfortune of a Prince as
high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly descended, and with truly generous and singular moderation, he thought
it greater glory to use a mean in Victory, then to triumph ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after the
dangers and troubles which he had undergone in this Siege; he shun'd delay, and
deferred the discussion of this point, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure was of more
importance for his Kings Affairs, till another time.</p>
            <p>The Articles being concluded, such abundance of rain fell, as the
Rivers overflowed the Campagnia, and hindred commerce; so as the delivering of
the City was necessarily defer'd for two days: but it was resigned on the 24 of
<hi>September,</hi> four moneths and fourteen dayes after the fiege was
begun.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="735" facs="tcp:53250:375"/> The Prince march'd out of the City, if not
gloriously, yet worthy of praise, being rather content to let fall so principal
a part of his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then to dispute it further, to the manifest danger
of his State, and of the Principality of his house, it being certain, and
afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Prince himself, that though he might often have
taken the Citadel, he cared not to do it, left (as it was very probable) it
might fall into the hands of others, whereby the exclusion of the Duke his
Nephew and of his whole Family, might ensue; the Infantas, his sisters went
along with their brother; who though they were very much desited by the
Citizens, and by the Nobles of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> as also by the French, and
particularly by <hi>Harcourt,</hi> to tarry in the City, with profers and
promises to be honourably treated, yet they would, as they had still hitherto
done, follow the Prince in his Fortune; almost all the Nobles that were in
<hi>Turin,</hi> and an infinite number of Citizens, accompanied the Prince when
he went out, witnessing the like obsequiousness and constant devotion towards
him at his departure, as they had done during the siege. He went that night to
<hi>Rivoli,</hi> and the next day to <hi>Inurea,</hi> where he intended to
reside. The Spanish Garrison went to the Governour to <hi>Cheri,</hi> he being
retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thither with his men from the hills, who parted soon from thence to
<hi>Asti,</hi> resolving to make a Magazine of Arms there: and he quartered his
Horse, and part of his Foot, in the parts about <hi>Montferrat,</hi> to refresh
themselves after their sufferings in the siege. Many of the French No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
went into <hi>France,</hi> and part of the Souldiery were distributed in the
Towns near <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and part kept in <hi>Turin,</hi> whereof some few
Horse and Foot were sent to re-inforce <hi>Cassale.</hi> The City of
<hi>Turin</hi> remained under <hi>Harcourts</hi> Government; who after having
governed it two moneths with much equity, moderation, and satisfaction to the
peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, resigned it over to the Dowager; who coming from <hi>Savoy</hi> into
<hi>Piedmont</hi> made her solemn entry into <hi>Turin,</hi> on the 18. of
<hi>November;</hi> where she was received not onely with triumphant Arches, and
new Gates of Stone made in the Walls, but with unspeakable and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
applause of the People, who had not forgot the clemency and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity of her
Regency. A true example of the instability of popular affection, which feeding
alwayes upon novelty are as exactly cloyed with the present Governours, as
ready to embrace new ones: nor was the Dowager wanting to her self upon this
occasion; she received them all graciously; and as if she had forgotten all
that was past, she con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd her favours indifferently upon them all. The
first thing she did after her return, was, to abolish the Decree of the Senate
which was made in favour of the Princes their Regency, alleadging that it was
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted contrary to all right and reason, by the violence of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
Forces; and the Cesarean Decrees were also declared null, as repugnant to the
Sovereignty of the house of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which was never wont to receive
Laws in the like case from the Cesarean Tribunal: and successively she was, by
the joynt Vote of the same Senate, sworn Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verness of her Children again, and
Regent of the State. For the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire establishment of Affairs, it remained that
the differences between the Princes and the Dowager, and King of
<hi>France,</hi> should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, which in the surrender of <hi>Turin</hi>
was reserved to be treated of <pb n="736" facs="tcp:53250:376"/> during the Truce which was
then agreed upon, a little before the said surrender. Monsieur <hi>Iulio
Mazzarini</hi> was come from <hi>France</hi> with Title of the Kings
Plenipotentiary; who having been often with the Prince and his Agents, in
<hi>Valentino</hi> and <hi>Borgo,</hi> during the siege had handled these
Treaties long. The Embassadour propounded that the King of <hi>France</hi>
should forthwith restore such Towns as were in his possession to the Dowager,
as Regent, if the <hi>Spainiards</hi> would do the like with their Towns which
they had taken of hers; and that if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> should not do this,
the Prince should oblige himself to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here unto the King of <hi>France</hi>
his party, upon very satisfactory Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions which should be given him, and
this was wholly agreed unto by the Prince before he went from the City, upon
condition that he should first give notice to the <hi>Spanish</hi> Agents of
the offered restitution, and that he should desire them to restore what they
had taken; which in case they should do, the Prince should not be bound to
forgoe their party. He further protested, that he would first send to
<hi>Spain,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his Wife and Children which were kept in that Court
as Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of his fidelity; and it was agreed, that all this should be
carried on with much secrecie; lest being known it might prove an impediment to
his re-having his Wife and Children from that Court. The Prince going out with
this clog'd and conditional agreement inform'd the Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> immediately, how ready the King of <hi>France</hi> was to
restore what he had taken: and desired him that he would do the like on his
Kings behalf: and he sent Count <hi>Messerati</hi> into <hi>Spain</hi> to make
the same request for the restoring of the Towns, as also of his wife and
children; the Agents in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Spanish Court, were much
troubled to hear of this restitution; and it was conceived that the Prince was
absolutely agreed with the French, which it was always doubted he would do;
Count <hi>Sirvela</hi> was sent by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to speak with the Prince in
<hi>Inurea;</hi> to sound his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to feel his pulse; who though
he were greatly scandalized with the Governour; yet being moved by his loss of
<hi>Turin</hi> he could not forget the great hopes which by reason of his
former successes he had drunk in; not that he had already agreed with the
French, but, though he appeared otherwise, was far from it; and could not think
of foregoing his former hopes of so great a part of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which he
enjoyed whilst he adhered to the Spaniards, nor yield to the Dowagers absolute
Sovereignty, as if he had agreed with the French he must do. The Embassadour
was sure the Prince Cardinal would be of the same mind; who was possest of the
so important places of <hi>Nizza</hi> and <hi>Cuneo,</hi> and of so large and
fruitful a Country: he knew, on the other side, how highly the Court of
<hi>France</hi> was offended with him, what Orders had been issued out from
thence against his person; how Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Richlieu</hi> had abused others;
wherefore not holding it fit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in that Court, after several
complaints past at the first meeting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prince and Count
<hi>Sirvela,</hi> and much dispute touching their particular interests, it was
not hard for <hi>Sirvela</hi> to induce the Prince to persevere in adhering to
the Spaniards; but, because <hi>Sirvela</hi> would come to no agreement with
the Prince, before he should ratifie the Writing which was subscribed in his
name by his Wife at <hi>Madrid,</hi> 
               <pb n="737" facs="tcp:53250:376"/> whereby the Prince
put himself and his whole Family into the Kings protection, swearing fealty to
him: The Prince made the said ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and for what concern'd his private
interests, he was content to stand to what should be agreed upon by the Prince
his Brother at <hi>Nizza.</hi> The Affairs of <hi>Spain</hi> went well by this
Negotiation of <hi>Sirvela;</hi> for though the Princes did not assist much in
the present War, but occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned great expence by their adherence, yet by their
union they kept <hi>Piedmont</hi> a friend to <hi>Spain:</hi> The Towns which
were therein held by the Spaniards required lesser Garrisons, and (which
imported more,) this Union kept the French Forces from the State of
<hi>Millain.</hi> The Governour therefore sent Count <hi>Riviera</hi> to
<hi>Nizza</hi> to treat with the Prince Cardinal; but <hi>Sirvela</hi> had not
negotiated much, when the French Agents growing apprehensive, began to press
hard upon Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> to declare himself for their King, since the
Spaniards were very backward in restoring the Towns they held; and the French
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied, these their pressures with threats. The Prince procrasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
this business as much as he could, pretending that he was to wait the
resolution of the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> as well touching the restitution of
the Towns in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> as also the like of his Wife and Children;
pretending likewise that to hasten this business too much was to ruine it: but
two moneths and more being past; the French being impatient of longer delay
would admit of no more words, but were so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually buzzing in his ears, as
the Prince seemed enforc'd to yield to their importunities, or else to break
with them; and being in a weak place, not provided to defend himself, and not
finding the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish Forces in a condition to protect him, nor believing that
the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would adventure any further in maintaining him then he had done
formerly; and on the contrary, not finding any great certainty in
<hi>Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vela</hi>'s proposals; he knew he was but in a bad posture to withstand
the imminent thunder of the French, in case he should not yield unto their
wills; whereupon not knowing what better course to take, he came to this
agreement with them, about the beginning of <hi>December.</hi> 
               <q>That he would put himself into the protection of the Crown of
  <hi>France;</hi> that he would come himself in person to <hi>Paris,</hi> by the
  middle of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> at the furthest, to wait personally upon his
  Majesty of <hi>France,</hi> and to assure him of his readiness to serve him,
  with leave notwithstanding to return; That he would send to <hi>Spain</hi> to
  demand his Wife and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the restitutions of the Towns of
  <hi>Piedmont</hi> into the hands of the Dutchess, as Mother and Governess of
  the Duke her Son; which if the King of <hi>Spain</hi> should refuse to do, he
  would joyn with the Forces of <hi>France</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> against the
  Spaniards; That if restitution should be made that obligation should cease,
  with a <hi>salvo,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, to his protection from
  <hi>France,</hi> and his adherence thereunto; The King of <hi>France</hi>
  should be bound to preserve the succession of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> and
  <hi>Piedmont</hi> in the Male-line of the house of <hi>Savoy;</hi> That he
  should restore the Towns held by his Forces for the Duke under the Regency of
  the Dowager; so as the Spaniards should do the like with those Towns which were
  in their possession; That he would help to make a match between a Son of the
  Princes and a Daughter of the Duke of <hi>Longevile's,</hi> one of the richest
  Ladies of <hi>France;</hi> and that <pb n="738" facs="tcp:53250:377"/> he would co-operate
  in composing the differences between him and the Dowager, together with many
  Pensions to be given to him the Prince, to his Wife and Children.</q> Upon
which account some mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys were disburst unto him in present to prepare him for
his journey: moreover, some promises were made him, that he should have some
Territories given him out of such Lands as should be gotten in <hi>Italy,</hi>
whereby he might have where with to maintain himself and his posterity in a
condition becoming their qualities; it was agreed, out of the same respects,
that this Convention should be kept secret; and the Truce was prorogued for all
<hi>February</hi> next. The Prince also promised (but not under his hand) that
he would cause the Castle of <hi>Asti</hi> to be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to the French;
and he was not permitted to acquaint the Prince his Brother with any of these
agreements, so severely did the French press him in this agreement; but his
aversion to observe this agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was as great as was their urging him
thereunto, to witness which the Castle of <hi>Asti</hi> was not delivered up,
though 500 Horse with men <hi>en Croupe</hi> came to it by night to receive it;
who having told the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinels that they brought Letters for Don
<hi>Emanuel,</hi> Brother to the Prince, and Governour of the Castle, were not
admitted, but were bid to come when it should be clear day; when being
discovered they were saluted as enemies by Cannon-shot both from the Castle and
Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel; and the Garrison of the Castle, which were Piedmontese, was recruited
by the Spaniards. The Prince Cardinal having heard how great a blow he had
received by the loss of <hi>Turin,</hi> and how little the Governour had done
towards the preserving thereof, desired to find some way to preserve himself
from ruine, which he saw was not far off: he therefore sent the Abbot
<hi>Soldato,</hi> one in whom he did much confide, to the Court of
<hi>France,</hi> to lay the foundations of an union there, which he thought to
make with that King; offering to joyn with him upon some conditions. 
<q>The chief whereof were three; That a Lieutenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy might be
  permitted him, in the County of <hi>Nizza,</hi> and to keep the Towns thereof
  without any dependency upon the Dowager; that the Guard anship and Regency
  should be absolutely in the Dowager, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in matter of Peace and War,
  Confederacies, Alienations, and the like; That his Majesty should be bound to
  restore all the Towns to the Duke which he held of his, within three years
  space, together with any others that he should recover.</q> The other
conditions were of lesser concernment, and such as reflected only upon the
Prince Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals own occasions.</p>
            <p>The King abhorring that the Princes should hold so principal
places, whilst he should be prescribed terms of restitution, denied both the
Articles, not without some disdain; so the Abbot return'd to <hi>Nizza re
infecta;</hi> and the King having quickly notice of the Agreement made in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> not doubting but that they would be made good, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well pleased therewith, as was the whole Court; and desired very much to see
the Prince come; who sought nothing more then to evade the performance of those
Agreements, which he profest he had unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly consented unto; wherefore the
time prefix'd for his going into <hi>France</hi> being come, he did not much
mind the taking of that Journey, though he was much sollicited thereunto by the
Embassadour <hi>Mazzari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> 
               <pb n="739" facs="tcp:53250:377"/> and by the other French
Agents; but in lieu thereof, he past thorow the States of <hi>Millain</hi> and
<hi>Genoa,</hi> to <hi>Nizza;</hi> where being equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasted, as was his
Brother with the negative which was brought from <hi>France,</hi> they treated
of the common affairs. This so sudden departure of the Prince, and so contrary
to the late made agreement, did, and not without reason, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>use jealousie into the Embassadour
<hi>Mazzarini;</hi> who presaging the sinister influences, which that
conjunction, as an omi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Constellation of so great Planets, would cause,
went to <hi>Nizza,</hi> to see whether he might prevent the imminent influence
which he foresaw. But all was in vain, for the Princes were already almost
agreed with the Spaniards; so as being press'd by <hi>Mazzarini,</hi> the one
of them to persevere in, the other to enter into convention with the French;
they answered, that the Spanish Agents were at last perswaded to restore the
Towns; but that as the King of <hi>France</hi> offer'd to restore those that he
held to the Regency of the Dowager, so the King of <hi>Spain</hi> offer'd to
restore what was held by him to the Regency of them the Princes. The King of
<hi>Spain</hi> had not really done this, nor was there time enough past to have
a positive answer in the point come from <hi>Spain;</hi> nay, it was at this
very time agreed upon between the Princes and the Spanish Agents, that the
Towns should be garrisoned by the Spaniards in the same manner as they were at
the present, till the general peace should be made. The Proposal was an
artificial trick agreed upon between the Princes and the Spanish Agents; for
that all of them believing that the French would not accept of it, the
Spaniards might shun the odium which would be laid upon them for desiring to
keep what they were possess'd of; as also for that the refusal might make the
Princes adhere the more constantly to the Spanish party. And on the behalf of
the Princes, to the end that the same refusal might serve the one for a
pretence of foregoing the convention which he had entred into; and the other
from thereinto entring. The Embassadour as soon as he was come to
<hi>Nizza,</hi> hearing the proposals, perceived their ends in it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he immediately answered, that it was ridiculous, impossible, and a thing
procured by the Princes themselves. Many were the debates hereupon; the Princes
endeavoured by fair words to perswade the Embassadour to what he could not
believe; and if the Embassadour should not agree to the restitution out of his
mistrust of them, they might have occasion not to confide in him, who would not
trust them; but that if the business were rightly weighed, it must needs by
very advantagious for the Duke, for thereby the Towns would be taken out of the
hands of Forreigners, and put in those of the Natives, and would so come to be
posses'd by the Duke: A chief essential poynt, which so it might be done, the
manner mattered not; for means would not be wanting afterwards to accommodate
that touching which the form of estitution appeared now strange. And therefore
if he could think of any middle-way which might satisfie both the Crowns, they
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, him to propound it; for they would be ready to part with any thing
that should of due belong to them, so as the restitution might be made to the
Duk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>; at last, adding intreaties
to their reasons, they endeavoured by all means possible to perswade him not to
give over the Treaty, which was almost already brought to a conclusion, shewing
how much <pb n="740" facs="tcp:53250:378"/> the King did not onely study to preserve the
Dukes Grandezza, but to encrease it. Wherefore the Embassadour, who was the
King his Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potentiary, ought not, nor could not differ in opinion from his
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, but was bound to observe it; all these perswasions could not work
upon the Embassadour, who knew that the King would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the Princes
should have any thing to do in any of the Dukes Towns. For this would not be to
compose differences, but to occasion greater dissentions, to fortifie factions,
which the King thought made against his Nephew the Duke, to foment discord, and
rather to encrease then to appeale War in <hi>Piedmont:</hi> To shun which
inconveniencies, the King desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed
that the restitution should be made by himself, and by the King of
<hi>Spain,</hi> into the Dowagers hands as sovereign Governess and Regent;
which being the ground-work wherein the Dukes Grandezza and safety did consist
admitted of no allay; much less of what was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Princes, and
held to be diametrically opposite to the safety of his Nephews Dominions.
Wherefore the Embassadour not thinking that the business would admit of a
reply, said, that since the King of <hi>Spain</hi> would not restore the Towns
into the Dowagers hands, according to agreement, the Prince was absolutely
obliged to joyn with the King of <hi>France,</hi> in the recovery of them: He
therefore part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Nizza</hi> incens'd, and with but little hopes that
the agreed ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulations should take effect. The Princes were not at all
dismaid at his departure; but as if they had had the better end of the staff,
and had justified to the world that the agreement had not been impeded by them,
they made use of the Embassadours backwardness and departure, to justifie their
inclination to peace; to which purpose they published Manifestoes, and
endeavoured to lay the fault of breaking the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Embassadour;
alledging that when the Spaniards made no mention of restitution, the French
were wholly for restitution; but that as soon as the Spaniards mentioned
restitution, the French had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to say. At last the Princes seeing the
State of their Affairs reduced to the condition they desired, thinking all
Treaties broken with their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, and to their reputation, and all
conventions made with the French abolished, they agreed, on the fifth of
<hi>May,</hi> the year 1641. in <hi>Niz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> with the Embassadour
<hi>Riviera,</hi> and drew up in writing what they had spoken of; the sum
whereof was;</p>
            <p> 
               <q>That the King should keep all the Towns he had in
  <hi>Piedmont</hi> till the ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ral
  peace should be concluded, which should not be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out including the
  Princes: That Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> should have an Army raised for him of
  4000 Foot and 500 Horse, whereunto he should be bound to adde 1500 Horse more,
  and 2000 Foot of his own: That the Prince should be General of this Army in the
  Kings name, to whom he should take the same Oath that Generals use to do: That
  this Army should be paid by the King, by the hands of his Officers: That the
  Prince should be bound with this Army to joyn with the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour in defence of
  <hi>Piedmont,</hi> the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> and <hi>Montferrat.</hi> That
  the Prince Cardinal should have a thousand Spanish Foot given him to defend the
  County of <hi>Nizza,</hi> and 7000 Crowns a moneth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him for the
  maintenance of another thousand, which the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal should raise of his own
  men. That neither of these Princes <pb n="741" facs="tcp:53250:378"/> should treat directly
  nor indirectly with the French, with the Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, or any others, without
  consent of the King or his Agents: Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many other Heads which
  concern'd their own private Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Agreement being confirm'd by Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> with
Count <hi>Sirvela</hi> in <hi>Segli,</hi> a Village five miles from
<hi>Genoa,</hi> as the Prince return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> was afterwards
ratified on the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> in <hi>Gaila,</hi> a Town of the
NOvarese, by the same <hi>Sirvela,</hi> who was chosen Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
<hi>Millain.</hi> The first point, concerning the restitution of the Towns, was
moderated in a writing apart, in point of the time of reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; wherein it
was agreed, that in case the general peace should not be concluded within six
years, all the Towns except <hi>Vercelles</hi> should be delivered up to the
Emperour, who was to keep Dutch Garrisons there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in until the general peace. The
change of the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> did much good in the making of this
agreement; for whilst it was in treaty, the Princes having made several
complaints to the King of <hi>Spain</hi> against the Marquess of
<hi>Leganes,</hi> the King sent for him into <hi>Spain,</hi> and had appointed
Count <hi>Sirvela</hi> to succeed him in that Government; who was as great a
confident of the Princes, as <hi>Leganes</hi> was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and the
Princes confidence being much encreased by the change of the Governour, they
betook themselves more heartily to the Spanish party; and the rather for that
at the same time Count <hi>Harcourt</hi> return'd to <hi>France;</hi> and not
long after Embassadour <hi>Mazzarini</hi> and <hi>l' Argenson,</hi> all of them
the Princes chiefest Enemies; and after them many other Commanders; so as the
French Army in <hi>Piedmont</hi> was not onely much lessened in Authority, but
in Forces; so as that fear ceasing in the Prince which had compel'd him to that
Capitulation, he thought he was now in a better condition of safety and
liberty, and that he might dispose better of himself and of his affairs; he and
his Brother being therefore resolved to joyn with the Spaniards who sustain'd
them, and to part from the agreement made with the French, which reduced them
to nothing; Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> gave over holding intelligence with the
French about the end of the Truce, who sollicited him to go to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi>
and declared that he could no longer stand to the Capitulation, out of many
reasons; particularly, for that the things agreed upon were not kept secret,
they themselves having divulged it in the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> to the which
he attributed the detaining of his Wife and Children; and to aggravate their
omissions the more, he complained that that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging was a trick used by
them, to the end that he the Prince being the more irritated against the
Spaniards, for that their denial, might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here the closer to the French; but
that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to restore the Towns,
notwithstanding the publication of what was to be kept secret; as also to the
restoring of his Wife and Children; so as he would still adhere to him, he
could not forego such an occasion without offending the Laws of Nature, which
obliged him more streightly to so dear pledges, then any thing else could
oblige him to the King of <hi>France;</hi> that it would certainly be too mad a
resolution, and for which he deserved to be for ever blamed, if when he might
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have his Wife and Children, and the Towns without any noise or trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he
should chuse to recover them by force of Arms, by a thousand 
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:53250:379"/> dangers and calamities, by the tedious dangerous and
uncertain delays of War; to the irreparable prejudice of the Duke, and to the
desolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people, and of his Country, to the preservation and welfare
whereof, he as a Prince of the blood was bound by all Laws both Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and
Divine; that therefore there was no place left for the French Convention,
seeing the King of <hi>Spain</hi> was ready to deliver up unto him his Wife,
Children, and the Towns; and that if the offer'd restitution should not, for
some circumstances, be liked of, there was place left for some accommodation;
wherefore utter breach was not to be desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run upon: with these and the
like reasons the Prince endeavoured to honest his cause, and to justifie his
foregoing the former Convention; he complain'd also that the Embassadour
<hi>Mazzarini</hi> had way-laid him in his return from <hi>Nizza</hi> to
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> to take him prisoner; which he also discover'd was plotted
in the Court of <hi>France;</hi> not so much by what was discover'd in
<hi>Argensons</hi> instructions, as by the rumours raised by Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> when he heard that <hi>Turin</hi> was surrendered, with his
the said Princes freedom, and by many complaints which had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon been made
against General <hi>Harcourt;</hi> the same Cardinal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be more
troubled at his the Princes freedom, then joyed at the taking of the City; for
greater proof of his distrust in Cardinal <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu,</hi> he also alledged
that he had received advertisements from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Princes that were his friends,
at <hi>Paris,</hi> to be well advised<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

other mens power, he should not easily know how to get out of it. And,
more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that he had found by the Negotiations had in that Court, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his adherence to that Crown; that the Cardinal was absolutely determined
utterly to ruine his Kinsman, the Count of <hi>Soisons,</hi> who was then
accused of having plotted some novelties against the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that
Kingdom; whereof the said Prince being found neither conscious, nor complice,
he had reason to doubt, that since the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal durst dare so much against a
Prince of the Blood Royal, he could not expect more safety for his own person,
nor for the interests of his Nephew the Duke; for which reasons he thought he
had just occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions not to go to that Court.</p>
            <p>Amidst these debates, Count <hi>Turenna,</hi> chief of the French
Forces in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> head of those of the
Dowager, fell both of them before <hi>Montcalvo;</hi> and having easily taken
the Town, they betook themselves to take the Castle, whither the Spanish
Garison having forsaken the Town, had withdrawn themselves. The taking whereof
rested wholly on Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> for <hi>Turenna</hi> was retired to
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and though the enterprise was thought would prove long and
dangerous, by reason of the strength of situation, multitude of defenders,
abundance of Ammunition and Victuals which were in that Castle, yet, contrary
to all mens imaginations, Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> had it surrendred to him
within a few days; which had it been a little longer held out by the Captain
would have been relieved by the new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, who was raising men to that
purpose: whilst these things were adoing, the Governour took about a thousand
Foot from his own Army, to give a beginning to that of Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi>'s, that they might be at the Princes disposal, they being to
be defrar'd by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour; <pb n="743" facs="tcp:53250:379"/> part of these were sent
to garrison <hi>Inurea,</hi> under the command of Count <hi>Vercelline
Visconnte,</hi> where it was thought the French would first fall on; the rest
were sent to quarter in the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> for the ease of
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> moneys were likewise given him for the increasing of his
Horse, and for raising the 2000 Piedmontese Foot; and as, on the one side, the
Prince turn'd the moneys given to this purpose to other uses, not making his
obligation good; and did also refuse to take his O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Spanish Army was so small as that he could not make his word good to the
Prince, without almost wholly disbandoning it, or for the Prince his breach of
Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, particularly in refusing the Oa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

who refused to take the accustomed Oath. And yet each of them did bear with the
other in their equal unobservance; and the Governour kept the Army ready to
defend the Prince, and did apply himself to please him, as he could, in the
carrying on of the Warr; yea sometimes to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the common-cause.
The thousand Foot were also sent to the Prince Cardinal, commanded by well

all the rest of that Country, was abundantly provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with victuals, munition,
and with all things necessary for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from <hi>Naples;</hi> with
promise that they should, upon all occasions, be so still. Monies were paid to
both the Princes, notwithstanding the present necessity thereof to keep the

  badly satisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> for his non-observance of the
  Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by him, go to drive him out of <hi>Inurea;</hi> which being

            </argument>
            <p>THe not observing of the Agreement made with so much study and
industry between the King and Prince by the Embassadour <hi>Mazzarini</hi>
angred not only the French Agents and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but
also the Court at <hi>Paris;</hi> which being held on by the long hope and
desire of seeing a Prince appear as a Trophy of the Kings Grandezza, who had
been so totally alienated from him, and finding themselves abused therein were
much unsatisfied; and Cardinal <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who it was not known whether
he would receive him graciously or not, was not only offended to be so basely
deluded, but thought it a great affront, to that he should be seen by the world
to be so much mistaken in his trust; and that he had thereby failed of
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving that obstacle which had been so repugnant to the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of
the Kings designs: Likewise the King not being able to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate that his
favour and protection should be so little valued, was scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized, that a
Prince who had neither Towns nor Territories, nor any Authority but such as had
been obtained by Treaties, and which was dependent should so neglect him and
his protection; when in all reason he should have held it his greatest
happiness to be received thereinto, as into a safe Harbour; he did also much
resent it, that the Prince in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of his breach of word, should alledge
the anticipical publishing of the Agreement made in the Court of
<hi>Spain;</hi> he termed this conceit an abortive product of the Intellect,
and a shew of his sinister affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on who had formed it. The French Forces were
(as hath been said) much diminished at this time in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> but
General <hi>Harcourt</hi> was shortly expected to return from <hi>France</hi>
with a gallant re-inforcement of Foot and Horse: those few French who were yet
there were quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> not far from <hi>Inurea,</hi>
at which their aim was; and though the Commanders, to cloak their design,
feigned some other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; yet the Prince being jealous of their
neighbourhood, as consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of the wrong he had done them, went to
<hi>Millain,</hi> and endeavoured to have from the Governour (upon whose favour
he did much build) a certain number of men, which being added to his own Forces
might be sufficient to assault on the sudden one of the French quarters, which
lay in disorder beyond the <hi>Dora,</hi> not far from <hi>Inurea,</hi> hoping,
as he gave out, to rout it with a dry head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Turenna,</hi> upon the absence of the Prince, took occasion to
assault <hi>Inurea.</hi> To effect the which, he sat down before it, not
waiting for General <hi>Harcourts</hi> return, who was come neer
<hi>Piedmont:</hi> it was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought that he was put upon this by the
Embassadour <hi>Mazzari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> who having boasted in his Letters sent to
<hi>Paris,</hi> that he had brought the Prince over to throw himself at the
Kings feet, was troubled that he was cheated in his chiefest Negotiation.
<hi>Turenna</hi> having past over <hi>la Dora</hi> at <hi>Montalta,</hi> about
the midst of <hi>April,</hi> 41, took up his quarters upon the neighbouring
hill which commanded the Town; and the Horse passing over not long after, and
the rest of the Foot, they took up another quarter towards <hi>Vercelli:</hi>
Don <hi>Silvio di Savoy</hi> was Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Town, who was left there by
his Brother the Prince, when <pb n="746" facs="tcp:53250:381"/> he went for
<hi>Millain;</hi> as soon as he saw he was assaulted, he gave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice thereof
to the Prince; who was not then well satisfied with the Governour of
<hi>Millain,</hi> who had denied to send him the men he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, wherewith
to fall upon the French quarters: but finding now how necessary it was to
defend a place of such importance to the Prince, he needed no intreaties, but
was very ready to assist him; he therefore sent for his men immediately from
their quarters, which whilst they were assembling, the oppugners having notice
thereof caused some Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non to come, and plaid upon the City for two days space
on three sides; and having made 400 shot, they gave a fierce assault; there was
but few of the Prince his Souldiers at this time in the Town; the chief
bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of the defence lay upon the stout Garrison which was brought thither
by Count <hi>Vercelline Visconte,</hi> Camp-master, and a gallant Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; it
consisted of Italians and Spaniards; the latter under Don <hi>Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro
Gonzales,</hi> Lieutenant to the Camp-master-general, a gallant and well
experienced Souldier, subordinate to <hi>Visconte;</hi> by whom the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault
which was five times re-enforced being stoutly withstood, it was five times
more re-assumed in the space of four hours, and as oft re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd; wherein there
died about 600 of the assailants, amongst which many of the Nobility; and about
100 of the defendants. The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour advanced this mean while with the
succour; and the Van of the Army being come to <hi>Bolegno,</hi> three miles
distant from the French quarters, <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who was now come to the
Camp, hearing thereof, resolutely resolved to encounter it before the main body
of the Battle and the Rere should joyn with it; he therefore went towards them
with the most of his men, and they being fewer in number, he would easily have
scattered them, had not the Governour and Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Cavalier <hi>Aiazza</hi> to go with four Troops of Horse, and some Foot, from
the Village <hi>Birvolo,</hi> whither he was come to fall upon the French on
the flank, charging him to do all he could to entertain them, till the
Artillery and the rest of the Foot should come up, who were not far off; but
Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> coming out against <hi>Aiazza</hi> charged him so home
as he forced him to retreat to <hi>Birvolo,</hi> where through the advantage of
the situation the Foot who were pursued recovered <hi>Aiaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> whom
<hi>Villa</hi> had taken, and the rest of the Spanish Army coming in very
seasonably this mean while, the face of affairs alter'd; for the French being
plaid upon on the one side by the Artillery, and fiercely faln upon on the
other side by Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena</hi> who
was arrived with fresh men, they were forced to retreat to their quarters. The
Fight was fierce and bloody, wherein above 400 of the French were slain, of
which many Officers and Captains; about 50 of the Spanish Army were slain, and
as many hurt, whereof four Captains; it was thought that if the French had
assaulted the Van one half houre sooner, they had certainly routed them; and
had the day lasted but one half hour longer, the Spaniards would have gotten a
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Victory, and have ruin'd the Enemy totally; for they were in great
confusion when the night parted the Fray.</p>
            <p>Governour <hi>Sirvela</hi> sent a relief of 800 Foot into the
Town; and being desirous to make himself master of <hi>Chiaverano</hi> a Castle
two miles distant from <hi>Inurea,</hi> and as far from <hi>Colegno,</hi> he
sent men to take <pb n="747" facs="tcp:53250:381"/> it; who beating down the gate with a
petar'd met with such resistance as they were at first forced to retreat; but
afterwards re-inforcing their assault they took the Castle; the Prince desired,
and press'd very much that they might go to assault the Enemy in their
quarters; but <hi>Sirvela, Caracena,</hi> and the rest of the Commanders, were
of another mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to carry on affairs with more safety; but that
somewhat might be done whereby the Town might be freed, and the Prince not seem
to be abandoned, they resolved to try whether it might not be done by
diversion, they therefore went to before <hi>Chiavazzo,</hi> the loss whereof
would be of greater importance to the Enemy then the getting of
<hi>Inurea;</hi> so as it was likely they would give over the one to defend the
other; this counsel was so well taken as that <hi>Inurea</hi> being reasonably
well relieved, they might spin out the defence thereof, and not endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the
loss of it by their going to <hi>Chiavazzo;</hi> the design did not fail,
though the Prince was not much pleased with it, being loath that the other Town
which was of so great importance to him should be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered; but finding the
Spaniards loath to hazard all upon one chance, he consented to the diversion;
passing over the <hi>Dora</hi> therefore at <hi>Riva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rotta,</hi> the Army
marched to <hi>Chiavazzo,</hi> the Prince going foremost with 1000 Foot, and
Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> with 1000 Horse; being come to the Town, the
Prince desired to try the taking of it by Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladoe, whereunto the Governour
was hardly perswaded, yet he gave way unto it, that he might not seem to reject
all the Princes proposals: but it succeeded not well, for the Assailants were
repulsed, and many of them were slain, and wounded, to the number of above 400;
so as the enterprize proving harder then was thought, they began to repent
their diversive resolution; but knowing that if they should give it quite over
they would be laugh'd at, and that the enemy would not rise from before
<hi>Inurea</hi> when that Army should be gone from <hi>Chia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vazzo,</hi> they
began to make approaches; whereby they came in three days to the Ditch; which
being full of water, they found it redious and troublesome to pass over it; yet
they got over upon galleries and planks; and coming to two Bulwarks they fell
to mining; the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Sallyed out upon them stoutly, but were beaten back,
leaving many dead behind them, and some Prisoners, amongst which the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Town's Lieurenant, who led, on the Sally; the Horse were not this mean
while idle, but scouring the Country they took the Victuals and ammunition
which were bringing to the Camp before <hi>Inurea;</hi> as, on the other side,
those which were brought to the Spanish Camp were hindred by the Cavalry of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> which passing over the <hi>Poe;</hi> made inrodes oftentimes
as far as to S. <hi>Ia,</hi> and <hi>Vercelli,</hi> when the Spanish Army was
gone to <hi>Chiavazzo,</hi> the French being out of fear of being assaulted on
the back began to make several assaults upon <hi>Inurea,</hi> and to play with
their batteries upon the walls; but so valiant were the Defendants, as they
rendred all their attempts vain; nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with defending themselves
they made out several Sallyes; one whereof was done so resolutely as they past
on even to a battery of three pieces of Artillery, which they had takes, had
they not been assaulted by the French, whose Horse was come up to them when
they were come to the Battery: and then seeing it would be rashness to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose 
<pb n="748" facs="tcp:53250:382"/> so great a Force, they retreated to within their walls,
still fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in good order; whereby the French finding how hard the
business would prove; and hearing that <hi>Chiavazzo</hi> was very neer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken, and that it would be assuredly lost unless it were speedily succored,
<hi>Harcourt</hi> was forced to abandon the one, that he might not lose the
other; so as after 35 days fiege, wherein he had lost about 3000 men, he
resolved to quit it, and to go relieve <hi>Chiavasso;</hi> the Prince and
Governour perceiving that the French Army was march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards them, and that
they had therefore obtained all that they had pretended to by their diversion;
they past over the <hi>Poe</hi> upon a bridge of boats which they had purposely
prepared, and retreated with their Artillery, baggage, and with all their men,
cutting the bridge behind them, and dragging the boats to the other shore, to
the end that they might not be pursued by the Enemy: all was done in good
order, without the loss of one man through the great diligence &amp; skill of
Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> and of the Marquess <hi>Caracena,</hi> to whose care
the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate was committed; but understanding whilest they made their
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, that <hi>Harcourt,</hi> when he went to <hi>Chiavazzo,</hi> had left
the bridge over the <hi>Dora,</hi> before <hi>Inurea,</hi> well munited, that
he might return to his former quarters, when he should have freed
<hi>Chiavasso,</hi> and reassume the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e mitted siege; or else that he might withdraw his
baggage and ammunition which he had left in his quarter, to the end that he
might the more speedily relieve <hi>Chiavazzo;</hi> to keep him from doing
either of these, Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> was sent with 500 Horse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the bridge, that foording over the <hi>Dora</hi> at <hi>Verolengo</hi> he might
get speedily into <hi>Inurea;</hi> nor was this in vain; for <hi>Gonzaga</hi>
was not well come to <hi>Inurea,</hi> when he might see the enemies Van upon
return, and make towards the bridge; part whereof being already past over was
assaulted by Don <hi>Gonzaga</hi>'s Horse, which were enforced by many choice
Foot of the Garrison, and after a long and stout dispute, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Enemy
to give back, and to forsake their quarters, with the loss of much victuals,
munition, and instruments of War, which were found there; which being brought
into the Town, <hi>Inurea</hi> was well furnished with what they wanted most,
at the cost of the Enemy; wherefore <hi>Harcourt</hi> thinking it impossible to
reassume the siege, gave order that the bridge should be broken, and retreated
to <hi>Visea</hi> and to other neighboring Tovvns; the Spanish Camp passing
over the bridge at <hi>Verva</hi> went to <hi>Livorno,</hi> where hearing of
<hi>Harcourts</hi> retreat, the Prince went joyfully to <hi>Inurea,</hi> and
the Governour, with Cardinal <hi>Trivul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> and other Commanders, to
<hi>Millain:</hi> whither being come they sent their Army to their quarters:
<hi>Harcourt</hi> being gone from before <hi>Inurea,</hi> though his Forces
were weak by reason of the men that he had lost there, and because the recruits
which were usually sent from <hi>France,</hi> every spring, were not yet come,
he applied his mind to the surprisal of <hi>Alessandria,</hi> which was
proposed unto him by Seignior <hi>Covogne,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of
<hi>Cassalle,</hi> as an easie enterprize; and which now that the Enemies Army
was sent to their quarters, might be effected with a few men, and maintained by
small Forces; he therefore sent Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quess <hi>Villa</hi> towards it about the
end of <hi>Iune</hi> with the Dowagers Horse, which amounted to about 800, and
with 1000 French Foot <pb n="749" facs="tcp:53250:382"/> which <hi>Harcourt</hi> gave him
of his men: and <hi>Harcourt</hi> to back him went to <hi>Battigliere</hi> a
Town in the territories of <hi>Asti,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Cerisola:</hi>
where hearing that the business was not to be attempted, for that Cardinal
<hi>Trivultio</hi> was entered that City with a good body of men, and that
therefore <hi>Villa</hi> was gone towards the parts about <hi>Alba,</hi> he
fell to consider what was next to be done; he aspired after great actions, and
such as might equal his former; but he wanted Forces equal to his desires:
Marquess <hi>Pianezza,</hi> General of the Dowagers Foot, propounded the taking
of the Fort of <hi>Ceva,</hi> alleadging that it would require but a few days,
and small Forces, and was notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of great consequences, to pursue the
rest of the Campagnia; with more considerable progress; and that
notwithstanding <hi>Harcourts</hi> self might be free with the whole body of
his Army, fit to oppose any attempt of the Enemy, and to secure the Country the
mean while, till supplies might come from <hi>Frances</hi> whereby when he
should be recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he might be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ake himself to more important enterprizes; he said moreover that
Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> would approve of it, by reason of the great advantage
that would thereby redound to the Dowagers affairs; and for that being already
upon the way to <hi>Ceva,</hi> he would advance thither the more easily with
his Horse, and with the French Foot which were with him; and lastly, he p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ofer'd to go thither himself in
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with 1500 of the Dowagers Foot; 'desiring only one Regiment of French,
and three small pieces of Artillery, assuring him that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further
incommodating his Army, he and <hi>Villa</hi> would speedily dispatch the
business. <hi>Harcourt</hi> was pleased with the proposal, and gave way unto
it; so <hi>Pianezza</hi> went towards <hi>Alba</hi> to joyn and settle the
business with <hi>Villa;</hi> who approving of the design took upon him to go
with 800 of the choicest Musketiers, and with the greatest part of the Horse,
but without baggage, to prepossess himself of the Town, and of the victuals
that were there, and to block up all Avenues from the bringing of any succour
to the Fort, whilest <hi>Pianezza</hi> should ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance with the Foot,
Artillery, and Munition; <hi>Villa</hi> at his first ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival made himself
master of the Town, and of some neighboring places, which might have been a
hindrance to him in taking the Fort: and <hi>Pianezza</hi> having overcome the
difficulties of the ways which were bad enough for the bringing of Artillery,
came within three days to the Town of <hi>Ceva,</hi> and joyning with
<hi>Villa</hi> the next day, which was the fourth of <hi>Iuly,</hi> began to
attach the Fort; their men were divided into two parts: <hi>Villa</hi> placed
himself with one part under a certain Tenaglia which had been abandoned by the
Enemy; and <hi>Pianezza</hi> with the other part, on the right side of the said
<hi>Tenaglia</hi> against a bulwark which was neer the gate; and ordering their
Cannon they betook themselves to take away their defences, and then to fall
upon the wall, and to make mines; whilest these things were doing,
<hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> kept about <hi>Alba</hi> to oppose any succour which should
be brought to the Fort, or to prevent any design that the Spaniards might have,
of falling upon any other place: but it was more then needed: for

to expect reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from <hi>Millain,</hi> which not being according to the
Prince his Genius, the time for action was spent in sending &amp; re-sending
the consultations, answers and replyes, between <hi>Millain, Alessandria</hi>
and <hi>Inurea.</hi> Wherefore the siege continuing without disturbance,
Marquess <hi>Pianezza</hi> had been very diligent in working the Mines on his
side; and though he had met with some obstacles, yet he overcame them and went
on. So as his Mine being per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

might blow it up; be summoned them to surrender, threatning that otherwise he
would give fire to his Mine, which when it should be once done there would be
no more place for parley: And answer being made that they desired first to see
some effects, <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anezza</hi> drew up his men immediately that they might
fall on, as soon as the Mine should have play'd; which having made a breach of
25 paces br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ad, the besiegers made
a furious assault; which being man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with-stood by the Defendants, order
was given for redoubling it with greater vigour: But the Defendants having done
their best at the first, they feared what might ensued if they should be
re-assaulted. Where<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

surrender; whereupon about 200 Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards and Piedmontese march'd out, and were
according to Articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy'd to <hi>Bagnasco.</hi> This business was of
great consequence to the Dowagers affairs; for to boot with the great advantage
she got from that whole County, the taking of this place drew after it the like
of the City, Citadel, and County of <hi>Mondovi:</hi> For the Fort of

               </gap>; especially since it could not be succor'd by the
County of <hi>Nizza,</hi> on which it confined; not so much for that the Prince
Cardinal had no Forces to draw into the field, as though he had had any, or
that he should be furnish'd with any from <hi>Spain</hi> by sea, yet the ways
were so bad which led from the se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>mont,</hi> and the
passages so difficult, as it was impossible to convey men thither: So as no
Forces were to be feared from that side; and <hi>Harcourt</hi> being willing to
make use of the occasion threw himself imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before it, with his own and
with the Dowagers men. The enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize was very hopefull, nor of less advantage
and consquence, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <pb n="751" facs="tcp:53250:383"/> of the scituation, which
being placed at the foot of the <hi>Apenine,</hi> where being cut off from the
<hi>Alps</hi> it divides the County of <hi>Nizza</hi> from <hi>Piedmont.
Conio</hi> is seated in an eminent place, enclosed between two Rivers, which
falling down by two Valleys, formed by the <hi>Apennine,</hi> and running some
few miles by the plain which lies beneath, enclose that Town between. Of these
two Rivers, the one, which is called <hi>Ghez,</hi> runs so close by one side
of the Town, as it serves it for a safe and deep ditch, and by the height of
the steep banks makes it unaccessible; the other, which is called
<hi>Stura,</hi> being about a bow shot from the Town, is not of so much safety
to it; wherefore the Fortifications are the stronger on that side. These
Fortifications, according to the ancient custom, were very great and good; but
being much ruin'd by time, they were well secured by many Rampiers, with some
half moons and out-works, after that the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> (as hath
been said) had been before it: So as, at the present, it was sufficiently well
fortified. In the uppermost part of <hi>Conio,</hi> there stands a Citadel,
which is well munit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the nearness of the two Rivers, which joyn together a
little beyond it, and by Fortifications; the Garrison consisted of 1400, part
whereof were paid by the Prince Cardinal, part by the Spaniards. The first were
commanded by Count <hi>Broglio,</hi> the others by Leiutenant Colonel
<hi>Catteneo;</hi> to these were added all the Citizens, and many of the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try people who were fit to bear Arms. Count <hi>Iovan Baptista
Vivaldo</hi> was Governour of the place, which was sufficiently provided of
Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and Victuals; it was much esteemed for the opinion which was held
of it, that it was not to be taken; this Fame it had gotten, not onely by the
scituation thereof, but for its having withstood four Royal Armies, led on by
excellent Champions. Wherefore <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who thought the glory he had
won in his former action, somewhat eclips'd by his unfortunate success in the
siege of <hi>Inurea,</hi> aspired not onely to regain his former reputation by
this action, but to purchase much greater, if he should effect that which many
famous Commanders had failed in: He ordered Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> to
prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess himself of the avenues, taking with him 1500 of the Dowagers Horse,
and 1500 of the Kings Horse; who at the very first rou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed a Corps de guard of Carbines, commanded by the
Commendadore <hi>Pag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liero;</hi> then going to St. <hi>Dalmatio,</hi> to block
up the wayes which le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d from
<hi>Nizza,</hi> and passing within Cannon-shot of <hi>Conio,</hi> 300 Horse
from the City fell upon his Rere; which facing about, and being led on by Count
<hi>Camerano,</hi> Son to General <hi>Villa,</hi> a young man, but of great
expectation, beat them back to beyond the River <hi>Ghez.</hi> The like befell
400 Country people, who as they arrived at the Town fell upon them behind; but
being pursued by the same <hi>Camerano,</hi> they were routed, so as
<hi>Villa</hi> quarter'd safely in <hi>Borgo</hi> St. <hi>Dalmatio;</hi> the
next day as he would have passed over the <hi>Stura,</hi> so to go to
<hi>Nostra Lignora del l'Olmo,</hi> he found the Bridge prepossess'd by about
400 of the Country neighbours, who broke the bridge and defended the passage;
but <hi>Villa</hi> causing the bridge to be re-made before their eyes, made his
Horse pass over thorough a foord not far off, and his Foot over the bridge, and
fell upon the Country people, slew many of them, and went to quarter at
<hi>Nostra Lignora d' Olmo,</hi> and at the old Town. The mean while Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral 
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:53250:384"/> 
               <hi>Harcourt</hi> advanced with the whole Army, and
within sight of the City; where he taking up his quarters before he began his
siege, he heard that the Prince had muster'd all his men together in the
<hi>Canavese,</hi> and the Governour his in <hi>Alessandria,</hi> whereby they
caused apprehension in <hi>Chiavasso, Turin, Carmagnuola,</hi> and in the
neighbouring Towns; wherefore he ordered Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> to go to the
parts about <hi>Turin</hi> with the Dowagers Horse, and some French Foot
Regiments, not so much to oppose the Enemies attempts, as for the safer and
easier conduct of the Artillery, which were to be brought from thence to
<hi>Conio;</hi> which when they came to the Camp, they began to make Trench es.
The first was drawn on against the Bastion <hi>di Nostra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> Signora d' Olmo,</hi> where <hi>Castellano,</hi>
Camp-Marshal, was to fall on, the second against the Bastion <hi>del
Caraglio</hi> under Count <hi>Plessis Pralin;</hi> against whom those within
the Town made a fierce sally, which proved very bloody, and prejudicial to the
besiegers, and wherein they lost many men, amongst which two prime Gentlemen,
<hi>Leva</hi> and <hi>Fausone. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> caused a third Trench to be afterwards opened against
the Bastion St. <hi>Anna,</hi> whilst <hi>Plessis Pralin</hi>'s men were
already got to the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scarf of the Ditch to lodge there, but he was
valiantly repulss'd by the Desendants. Wherefore <hi>Motta</hi>'s men joyning
with <hi>Pralin,</hi> after a long and bloody fight, they took the place, where
Seignior <hi>della Moretta</hi> was slain; yet the Defendants lost no Courage,
nor the oppugners: They sprung several Mines in several places, and many
sallies were made by both parties, to hinder each others works; wherein the
Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants shew'd much valour, particularly Count <hi>Broglio;</hi> the
business was very doubtful on both sides, and dangerous; which was increased on
the besiegers side by news of Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> who press'd the
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of <hi>Millain</hi> extraordinarily for speedy succour, and who, it
was said, would speedily appear with powerfull Forces. Treaties of Agreement
were therefore willingly listned unto, which were introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Ripa,</hi>
Bishop of <hi>Mondovi,</hi> with the Prince Cardinal, whom by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by
the means of Abbot <hi>Soldato,</hi> he advertised what danger
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> was likely to run, if the French should become masters of
that place. He therefore moved that the Town might be surrendred upon fair
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Duke, under the Dowagers Regency; which would be much better
for the Family of <hi>Savoy,</hi> then to suffer it to fall into the French
hands. The Cardinal was not averse to the Proposal, he therefore sent Abbot
<hi>Boschetti</hi> immediately away from <hi>Nizza</hi> to <hi>Limone,</hi> the
furthermost Confines of the County, to hold on and to conclude this Treaty,
which could not but be very acceptable also to the Dowager; since thereby the
Princes and the French should be excluded from pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing the place, which
without any hazard should fall to her and to her Son. Wherefore she sent
Instructions to her Referendario <hi>Philippo,</hi> who was in the Camp, to
hasten the conclusion thereof; and not onely the Dowager, and Prince Cardinall,
but <hi>Harcourt,</hi> without whose consent the Dowager would do nothing, gave
way willingly thereunto; thinking that the case being so doubtful, much glory
would redound to him by the surrender of the Town, though it should not fall
into the Kings hands, since by his means it should be taken from the Prince
Cardinal, and be put into the Dukes hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="753" facs="tcp:53250:384"/> Many were the debates and many the
Proposals which were made to the Prince Cardinal, to make him condescend to the
surrender; but he would accept of none, being assured by the besieged, and by
many of his Court, that the siege would finally prove vain: <hi>Harcourt</hi>
therefore wished it might speedily be concluded; for when the Town should be
ready to surrender he would hear of no Treaty, but his threats were in vain;
for the Prince Cardinal was resolved not to admit of any treaty, not so much
out of the strength and impregnability of the place, as out of the great hopes
he had of powerful succour. Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> who was as desirous to
preserve the Town, press'd the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Millain</hi> exceedingly for
forces to relieve it; but could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver get him to come directly to the relief
of <hi>Conio;</hi> for the Spanish cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness would not permit him to hazard
so great a strength of men so far within <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and leave so many
of the Enemies Towns on his back; especially being to pass over so many Rivers
with Artillery, Baggage, and Victuals, to overcome difficult passes, to fight
continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and to defend himself from being infested by Marquess
<hi>Villa,</hi> who beating the Campagnia with his Horse, would gaul him, now
on the one side, now on the other, and would continually incommodiate him; and,
which was of greater consideration, he was to affront an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, stronger then
himself, and who was intrench'd; wherefore the Governour and other Captains,
not thinking it fit to hazard themselves in so dangerous a business, they
resolved to try whither they could free <hi>Conio,</hi> or no, by diversion, as
they had done <hi>Inurea;</hi> they therefore gave the Prince a good strength
of Horse and Foot, who went from <hi>Asti,</hi> together with the Marquess of
<hi>Caracena,</hi> to <hi>Ceri,</hi> whereby they infused jealousie into
<hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> and <hi>Chiavasso;</hi> but Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> mar'd
these designs, who either foreseeing, or fearing these drifts, put forces into
both those places; so as the Prince being frustrated in his intention, turned
back upon <hi>Chirasco,</hi> a place of greater concernment, and fitter to
relieve <hi>Cenio</hi> by reason of the neerness thereof. <hi>Cherasco</hi> is
one of the strongest places of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> not so much by nature as by
art, but not equally on all sides, and which had been long neglected, as being
no frontier Town, and wherein was at this time but a weak French Garrison, it
being one of those Towns which were assigned over by the Dowager to the King of
<hi>France,</hi> in the year 39. so as the Prince thought he might securely
take it; but Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> did here also deceive him; for fearing
that the Prince being kept out of the other two Towns would come before this,
he sent word immediately to Seignior <hi>di Savigni,</hi> who was Governour
thereof, that he might call in all the Country people thereabouts; and he also
sent him a Troop of Dragoons, and 500 foot were sent to him from the Camp; nor
did <hi>Villa's</hi> diligence cease here, for fearing also
<hi>Savig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liano,</hi> and the quarters of the Camp, in case the Prince should
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to fall unexpectedly upon either of them, he sent men into
<hi>Savigliano,</hi> and went himself at the same time into the Campagnia with
the rest of his men, advancing so neer <hi>Cunio,</hi> as he could not be kept
from thence, if it should be needful for him to go to the Camp; the Prince
going from <hi>Cheri</hi> with 1500 choice Foot, and with all the Cavalry of
the Camp except the <hi>Neapolitans,</hi> marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards 
<pb n="754" facs="tcp:53250:385"/> 
               <hi>Chirasco;</hi> and not having notice of the new
recruits sent by <hi>Villa,</hi> he betook himself with much courage and hope
to the enterprise; he divided his Foot into two parts, and making the greatest
part of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry get off Horse-back, he ordered assaults to be given by
night on sundry parts; but all the Squadrons which were sent met with such
hinderances as they could not fall on at the same time; so as they did but
little good, and gave the defendants opportunity to make the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
resistance where they were assaulted, and the Towns-men who shew'd themselves
faithful to the Dowager took up Arms, and ran couragious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make defence; so
the Prince being repulst, not without much loss, retreated to
<hi>Sommariva,</hi> where he tarried some days; but being egg'd on by honour,
and by the prejudice which would redound to their party if the Town should be
lost, he would try his fortune once more, which, the place being newly
re-enforced, did not favour him; yet both parties fought valiantly for many
hours, the assailants mounted the Walls several times, and were still beaten
back: they sometimes entred the Town, and were repuls'd; and in these
interchanges of fortune, the defendants having the better of the businesse,
about break of day the Prince was forced to retreat having lost above four
hundred men: The more unfortunate these diversive attempts proved, the more
successfully did the Siege of <hi>Conio</hi> proceed; for <hi>Harcourt</hi> not
being at all diverted by these the Enemies attempts, and joy'd that
<hi>Chirasco</hi> was out of danger, which otherwise might, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, have
made him forego <hi>Conio,</hi> to relieve it, he continued more constant in
the Siege; he therefore laid aside all treaties of agreement, and betook
himself more roundly to the taking of <hi>Conio:</hi> but neither were the
Prince nor Governour discouraged for their bad success, nor did they forbear
attempting to relieve the Town by diversion. The Governour sent Don <hi>Iohn
Vasques,</hi> Camp-master-general with the Foot, and Don <hi>Vincenzo
Conzago</hi> with the Horse to assault <hi>Rossignano,</hi> who when they were
come neer it, hearing that above 200 Montferri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were entred the Town,
forbare doing any thing there; and went by Order from the Governour to
<hi>Montcalvo,</hi> where whilst there was fair hopes of doing good, the
Prince, who was with almost all the Horse, and with 600 Foot, in the parts
about <hi>Villanuova,</hi> advertised the Governour that he heard there was not
above 600 Foot in <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> wherefore he thought it fit to attempt
the taking of it; for it being a place of almost as great concernment as
<hi>Conio,</hi> it was not unlikely but that the Enemy might forego the one,
not to lose the other; but the Governour who had oftentimes found the Princes
Forces to be more forward then fortunate, was not willing to yield to the
proposal; the rather for that he was very neer taking <hi>Montcalvo:</hi> yet
being much sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited, he (though much against his will) bad the Prince take
up his quarters about <hi>Chiavasso;</hi> and that if he should hear that no
new recruits were entred the Town he should send him word, and he would come in
to his assistance with all his men; hoping that in the mean while he might take
<hi>Montcalvo.</hi> The Prince upon the Governours promise went with 600 Foot
which he caused to come from <hi>Inurea,</hi> and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him went the
Marquess of <hi>Caracena</hi> with the Horse, and took up their quarters; and
finding that the Town was not re-enforced, he <pb n="755" facs="tcp:53250:385"/> advertised
the Governour thereof, desiring him to joyn with him in the Enterprise. The
business of <hi>Montcalvo</hi> was not yet perfected, though it advanced
prosperously every day; wherefore the Governour, who that he might not prefer
the certainty of the business of <hi>Montcalvo</hi> before the uncertainty of
that of <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> had against his will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Prince to go to
before <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> the more he saw the Siege of <hi>Montcalvo</hi> draw
neer an end, the less fit he thought it to abandon the one, for the uncertainty
of the other; wherefore feeding the Prince with delays, he entertained him so
long with words, with sending and re-sending Messengers, till he might see
<hi>Montcalvo</hi> taken; but the Prince being frustrated of all hopes, and
finding that the Governor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his delays, arose from before
<hi>Chiavasso,</hi> and retreated to <hi>Inurea;</hi> being sufficiently
scandalized that the Governour should rather suffer him to ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e from before <hi>Chiavasso,</hi> then
<hi>Vasques</hi> from before <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> which he alledged did not only
redound to the prejudice of his the Princes honour, but to the like of the
whole present War; for he said that the streightning of <hi>Chiavasso</hi>
would certainly have forced <hi>Harcourt</hi> to abandon <hi>Conio,</hi>
whereas the loss of <hi>Montcalvo,</hi> being of much less importance, would
have contributed nothing thereunto. The Prince being gone from
<hi>Chiavasso,</hi> the Marquess of <hi>Caracena</hi> foorded over the
<hi>Poe</hi> with his Horse, and went to St. <hi>Sebastiano,</hi> were he
quartered his Horse in the Towns of <hi>Montferrat</hi> neer <hi>Verrua.</hi>
The Siege of <hi>Conio</hi> was not in this interim at all intermitted, but
continued with more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour on both sides: Sallies, Assaults, Mines, Galleries
were made use of; great were the endeavours of the Assailants, and great that
of the Defendants; neither yielded to other in courage nor valour; their
vigilancy and diligence were equal; every one was so ready to die, as death it
self being afraid at their countenance seemed for very terrour to shun them;
but <hi>Harcourts</hi> singular fortune, which appeared averse unto him in the
enterprise of <hi>Inurea,</hi> and which was not undertaken by his advice,
would make him an amends in this, which was done by his consent: being
therefore very much gladded that neither the business of <hi>Chiavasso</hi> nor
of <hi>Chirasco,</hi> had necessitated him to forego the Siege of
<hi>Conio,</hi> he endeavoured the more to put an end to that enterprise, that
he might come time enough to relieve <hi>Montcalvo;</hi> he therefore placed a
Battery on the edge of the Ditch, ordered a Mine at the <hi>Bastion del
Ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo,</hi> sollicited Count <hi>Plessis</hi> to finish another Mine which was
begun against the Bastion of <hi>Madonna;</hi> which when they were perfected,
he caused a parley to be beaten for the surrender of the Town; but the
defendants being resolved to see the effect, 25 Foot of Wall was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
blown up; and yet the besiegers could not come conveniently to the breach, for
the Bastion was Plat-form'd wit sand and stones; so as it was not without blood
that they quartered themselves at the foot of the Wall that was blown up.
<hi>Harcourt</hi> not being here with dismaid, would gain the top of the
Bastion by a new assault; and the other Mine at the Bastion <hi>del Olmo</hi>
being ready to play, the defendants resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to parley; and after some debates
Articles were drawn up, and Hostages were given; and after 53 days Siege, on
the 15th of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Harcourt</hi> entred the Town triumphing and
victorious. The Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory was the more singular, for that this Town had not been
taken in <pb n="756" facs="tcp:53250:386"/> many age<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>: it was surrendered upon honourable conditions, and the Garrison
marched out, which was reduced to the number of 400 Foot and 200 Horse.
<hi>Harcourt</hi> having dispatch'd this enterprise went spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to relieve
<hi>Monicalvo,</hi> which he would without doubt have done, had it not been
surrendered two days before his arrival. <hi>Conio</hi> being taken, the
Dowager ordered Marquess <hi>Pianezza</hi> to go with all speed to recover
<hi>Rovello,</hi> a strong Town, and held by a Garrison of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal, as
<hi>Conio</hi> was. This place confined upon the County of <hi>Pinar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volo,</hi>
and was very convenient for the French interests, by reason of their desire to
dilate that Confine; and the Dowager thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to the prevent the
French from throwing themselves before it; nor was she therein deceived; for
Orders being come from the King that <hi>Conio</hi> should be restored to the
Dowager, <hi>Harcourt,</hi> knowing how desirous <hi>Richlieu</hi> was of
getting that Town, detain'd the Kings Order, and used several pieces of cunning
that the Siege might not succeed, or that it might be defer'd; but
<hi>Pianezza</hi>'s diligence prevailed, who made himself master thereof, and
put a Garrison of Piedmonteses into it; so as the restitution of
<hi>Conio,</hi> as it was ordered by the King, was not disturbed: by the
demolition of this Castle, it was assign'd over to the Dowager the next year by
the Duke of <hi>Bullion,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Harcourt</hi> in the place of
General; and not long after <hi>Demont</hi> was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise assign'd over to her,
a Town in those parts, which was possest by the French; which actions being
glorious to that King, who shared not therein in what his Forces had done, nor
in the arbitrement of fortune, but did all out of his goodness and Royal
Magnanimity; it is incredible what gladness it caused in the Piedmonteses, and
in all the Italians; and these <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Conio,</hi> and the two other adjacent Towns, being taken, the
Princes authority was totally excluded from out this side of the Mountains; and
their power being confined to the County of <hi>Nizza,</hi> it was thought it
would not be of any long consistence; not long after the Armies were retreated
to their quarters, the Prince of <hi>Monaco,</hi> having driven the Spanish
Garrisons out of that place, brought in the French; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived the Spaniards
of that station situated in the utmost Western <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guria</hi> upon a Rock,
which thrusting out into the Sea shapes a kind of Haven which is of great
consequence and conveniency to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards: The occasion of so great a
novelty and alteration is diversly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. The Prince thereof complain'd of
the subjection he was held in by the Garrison, of the little account that the
Spanish Agents made of him, of the losses which he suffer'd by adhering to that
Crown, not having received those emoluments from the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi>
which were assigned unto him for his adherence to the Spaniards, which he
formerly was used to receive; and, moreover, that when the Garrison wanted
their pay, he was sometime forced to appease them by satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them out of
his own purse, and to shun the plunder which was threatned by the Souldiers, as
also to avoid the danger of the place, which being by occasion of the present
Wars much diminished in the <pb n="757" facs="tcp:53250:386"/> Garrison thereof, the Kings
Agents minded not the re-inforcing thereof, nor the putting a sufficient number
into it for necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; especially at this time when the King of
<hi>France</hi> his Fleet lorded it over the Mediterranean, and lay not far
from <hi>Monaco;</hi> and whereby he found the designs which the French had
upon that place, it being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>o
weakly Garrison'd; so as out of these respects he was forced to free himself
from these apparent injuries and dammages at home, and from the imminent
dangers threatned from abroad; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Kings Agents, partly,
denying the blame that was laid upon them, partly lessening it, and excusing
it, partly by the calamities of the present times, pretended that all this had
hapned by the Prince of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naco</hi>'s own instability; they complained
that both he and his predeces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sort having enjoy'd priviledges and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>enenues for above 120 years from
the King of <hi>Spains</hi> liberality very punctually; that he, now when he
saw the Crown reduced to such streights, should without any occasion abandon
it, and betake himself to the French, meerly to better his condition; and that
when in reason he ought to bear with some incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of the present
times, considering what great affluence he had formerly received, and ought to
shew himself more constant in his devotion to that Crown, he was past over to
the Enemies party, not without prejudice to the Crown of <hi>Spain.</hi> But
these are things, the verification and discussing whereof would require more
time, and the decision thereof not appertaining to the Author of this History,
it will suffice to have lightly touch'd upon the accusations and excuses. Yet
the same Agents who had some knowledge of the fact before it was done
endeavoured to prevent the danger; but the success was so sudden, as all
provisions and remedies came too late; and truly the more unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this blow
came, the soarer and more insufferable was it: But greater blows then this,
which the Crown of <hi>Spain</hi> received at these times, both in
<hi>Italy</hi> and elsewhere, made this appear the less; for the Kingdoms of
<hi>Spain</hi> we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e so shaken,
first by the Insurrection of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and afterwards by that of
<hi>Portugal,</hi> a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> they never
were the like since that Crown arrived at so much greatness. The Catalonians
after their Insurrection had recourse to the King of <hi>France,</hi> and by
submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Crown had got assistance against the King of
<hi>Castile,</hi> whose Forces were entred <hi>Catalonia</hi> to reduce it: So
as the French Forces en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring that Province also, they often routed the
Castilians, and having finally made them almost all retreat to the neighbouring
Kingdom of <hi>Arragon,</hi> they rendred the recovery of <hi>Catalonia</hi>
very difficult, which was almost wholly lost; and the King not being well
provided of men to quell the Catalonians, and to drive the French out, who had
almost made themselves Masters thereof, he was forced to make use of the
Portugal Garrisons to subject the Catalonians. So the Portugueses being quite
rid of the Castrlian Garrisons, made use of this occasion to withdraw
themselves from the Castilian Empire, which was to them so hateful and so
insufferable. They thereto made Don <hi>Iohn,</hi> Duke of <hi>Braganza,</hi>
their King, who was descended, by the Mothers side, from the ancient Kings of
<hi>Portugal;</hi> and the Castilian Forces not being able to subdue both these
Insurrections, they were necessitated to insist first upon that of
<hi>Catalonia,</hi> whereinto the French poured in men at their 
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:53250:387"/> pleasure; wherefore the <hi>Portugal</hi> Insurrection
was but weakly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, so as it grew daily greater. The new King was better
established in his new Kingdom, as well by reason of the peoples love, as of
the friendship and favour of other Princes; who out of Emulation to the Spanish
Grandezza fomented the Insurrection of the Portugueses: So as what by the
natural Forces of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and by what he received from forreigners,
the new King kept the Castilian Forces conveniently from the Confines of
<hi>Portugal.</hi> To the loss of the Kingdom of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> was added
the loss of all the Kingdomes and Provinces of the <hi>East Indies,</hi> and of
all the Seas and Islands belonging to that Crown, and in the Western parts of
<hi>Brasil;</hi> for being govern'd and garrison'd onely by the Portugueses,
and none but Portugueses being suffer'd to saile towards those parts, nor to
tarry there by the way of Traffick; as soon as the news of the new Kings
exaltation to the Crown, who was of the Royal lineage, was come into those
parts, they all joyntly &amp; with great applause acknowledg'd him for their
King, and readily swore Allegiance to him. The Spaniards also at this time lost
many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable places, and battles, of no small consideration in
<hi>Flanders;</hi> the Fleets of the said Crown were almost dissipated by naval
Conflicts, by contrary Winds, and by other casual disasters; their Forces being
afflicted by several misfortunes in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont</hi> had
lost their former lustre The Austrian Empire suffer'd also very much in
<hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> and not being able to hold that mutual correspendency, nor
to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive such aid as had wont to pass between it and the Crown of
<hi>Spain,</hi> both those Crowns lost much of that Authority and Grandezza
whereby they had made themselves so considerable, and so formidable with the
greatest Princes of Christendom, for almost one whole age; and because
<hi>Germany</hi> being lacerated by continual Wars, and impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in
people, could not furnish the Wars of <hi>Italy,</hi> and the State of
<hi>Millain,</hi> with Souldiers, as it had wont to do; nor <hi>Spain</hi>
whose Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer was exhausted could subminister that quantity of monyes to the
Germane Empire as it formerly had done, nor take order for great Levies of
<hi>Dutch</hi> for <hi>Italy;</hi> the Spanish forces in <hi>Lombardy</hi> and
in <hi>Italy</hi> were necessarily reduced to great vveakness and discredit;
insomuch as the Potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> to vvhom they vvere so formidable
before, as doubting nothing more then to be over-run by them, they vvere
vvholly bent upon pulling them dovvn: being novv totally free of that fear, and
as much terrified with the apprehension of the French forces, which they saw
were gotten to a fatal greatness in <hi>Spain</hi> it self, in
<hi>Flanders,</hi> in <hi>Italy</hi> and in <hi>Germany;</hi> they studied how
to maintain that Spanish Empire which they endeavoured to suppress so much
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; all of them holding it for undoubted, that the lessening thereof would
prove the lessening of their ovvn States; amongst these the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, who
formerly had always been more averse to the ends and interests of the Crown of
<hi>Spain</hi> then any others, changing their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels with the alteration of
affairs, began to be their first and most zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous protectors; they being the
onely bank which could keep out the stood of the French fortune from
overflowing and drowning <hi>Italy,</hi> and their own Dominions; which they
willingly hazarded some few years before, when the Duke of <hi>Rohan</hi>
falling down by the Valley <pb n="759" facs="tcp:53250:387"/> of <hi>Sarfina</hi> from the
<hi>Valtoline</hi> into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> when the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> and Marshal <hi>Cricqui</hi> being past the <hi>Tessino</hi>
infused such terrour into the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> the same
<hi>Rohan</hi> being now to pass over a little patch of the <hi>Venetian</hi>
State of not above two miles long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could come to the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> the Commonwealth which had been so favourable to him before
in the getting and keeping of the <hi>Valtoline,</hi> were so averse unto him,
upon this occasion, as they would by no means permit him to come over that very
short space of Ground; which had they done it would have much increased the
danger of that State; not onely the Spanish Agents, but all the Potentates of
<hi>Italy,</hi> were very well satisfied with this action; who knew not so much
by her present, as by her past, nay, contrary carriage, how intent and watchful
that Commonwealth was over the well-fare and preservation of the publick peace,
and liberty; the same respects made the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Millain</hi> more
wary in engaging themselves in battle, finding that by the want of ready
leavies of men in <hi>Germany</hi> they wanted the conveniency of supplies to
their armies, when they shall by any acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent be routed, or otherwise worsted;
to this was added, that <hi>Spain</hi> it self by reason of the Wars that were
then very hot there, required men both from <hi>Germany</hi> and
<hi>Italy;</hi> so as not being able to send men into <hi>Italy,</hi> the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> were doubly weakned in <hi>Lombardy;</hi> both by the want
of those Souldiers which they could not expect neither from <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
nor <hi>Spain,</hi> and by those which they being to send into <hi>Spain,</hi>
could not employ them in the Wars of <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us return to the affairs of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where the
Armies being retired to their quarters, the cessation of Military actions
afforded op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to the concluding peace between the Dowager and the
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which had been often broken before, and often reassumed: but the
occurrences of affairs having taken away many difficulties which had formerly
obstructed it, both parties grew weary of the War; which the Dowager saw grew
daily more prejudicial to the people, and to the Duke her sons State; and the
Princes likewise found that their hopes grew daily less; the Prince Cardinal
who was naturally more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to peace and quiet then to the troubles of
War, desired daily to marry, out of the great desire he had of issue, whereby
he might continue the Principality in case of succession, which appeared not to
be far of, if not by the conceived weakness of his Nephew, at least by frailty
of humane condition; and not knowing any Princess in those times more
conducible to his ends, then his Niece, he desired very much to have her for
wife; and the Dowager, who had formerly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the treaty thereof, forbare
not to allure him to peace and union by this alliance. <hi>Conio</hi> being
lost, and therewith all that part of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> from whence he
received so much revenue, and seeing himself confined to within the confines of
the County of <hi>Nizza,</hi> he doubted he could not maintain himself long in
that State, notwithstanding that he was possess'd of the impregnable Fort of
<hi>Nizza,</hi> and of those of <hi>Villa Franca,</hi> and S. <hi>Sespiro;</hi>
all which were sufficiently provided with Warlike provisions from the Kingdom
of <hi>Naples;</hi> and that he might hope they might daily be supplied
therewith from thence; yet the present Agents being very slow in furnishing him
with monies, (which <pb n="760" facs="tcp:53250:388"/> he wanted more after the loss of
<hi>Conio,</hi> then before) he began also to fear, that he might want
provisions when he should need them; and which was of more concernment, he
being to introduce forreigners into them in case they should be assaulted, and
particularly Spaniards, there was such reciprocal distrust between him and the
Spanish Agents, that he held the Forts to be as good as lost, if ever he should
be compelled to bring them in; wherefore to free himself from the imminent
dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that he foresaw both he and his family was in, and to obtain his ends,
which were inclined to peace and marriage, he earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red agreement; on
the other side Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> who knew the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and inclination of
the Prince Cardinal, feared lest the marriage might be made, whereby he should
be excluded from all pretentions: which if it should so happen, he could have
no pretence of taking up Arms against the Dovvager vvhen she should be united
to his brother; so as he had but small certainty of his present condition, and
vvas very doubtful of the future; Moreover he was ill satisfied with the
assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Forces which he received from <hi>Spain;</hi> but he was chiefly
ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at the prosperous success of the French, and the contrary of the
Spaniards; who failing in all mens expectation, as much as the French bettered,
did prognosticate the unfortunate fall of those who thought to better
themselves by them; these auguries and prognostications did so work upon the
Prince, as the dangers, and ruines which were yet far off seemed to him to be
present; he therefore thought it better to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his fortune on that side
which was uppermost, and to get at last free from the slavery and danger which
he foresaw he must undergo by adhering to the losers; it was also thought that
an accident which hapned at this time in <hi>France</hi> weighed down the
balance of the Prince his resolution; some Princes of <hi>France,</hi> who were
not well pleased with the present Government of that Kingdom, and consequently
not with Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s Authority, were gotten into
<hi>Sedan,</hi> a very strong Town of the Duke of <hi>Bullion</hi>'s; the first
whereof was the Count of <hi>Soisons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

thereof would be, and accordingly would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose of himself in his adherence
either to <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France;</hi> and that it had been the Counts
perswasions which had prevailed with him to forego the Capitulations made with
<hi>Mazzarine;</hi> wherefore when he saw the unfortunateness of the success,
and that his brother in Law was slain, he was forced to take new resolves;
either because he could build no more upon the conspiracy of <hi>Sedan,</hi> so
to joyn with the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards; or else for that his half-brothers estate being
fallen to his wife, he could not forsake so great a Fortune, but close with
<hi>France,</hi> from whence he continually received great offers; nor was the
Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ager wanting in promoting the business; but making use of what had hapned
in <hi>France,</hi> she represented unto the Prince with what oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to
advantage his interests with that Crown, and desired him that he would not
injure his wife and Children by refusing it; to this was added, that the
Spanish Agents, either for want of mony, or by reason of the news that was
given out, that the Princes who were ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude with <hi>France,</hi>
were somewhat slow in disbursing monies, fearing that they might not onely be
ill imployed, but to the Kings preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice; the Princes were therefore forced to
agree with the Dowager, not being able to maintain the Towns they were
possess'd of from being taken either by the French, or Spaniards, to the
irreparable loss of their Family: and, which was worse; if the French, whose
fortune they feared, should become masters of the Towns which were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sess'd
by the Spaniards in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> they saw they must be exiles from their
Country, and rely upon the Spaniard for maintenance: Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi>
being out of these reasons resolved to agree, made: his mind be known to the
Dowager by the Protonotory <hi>Bergera,</hi> who was after Archbishop of
<hi>Toledo,</hi> desiring that the City of <hi>Inurea</hi> might be assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to him for the security of his person, and that he might be Leiute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General
of that Province, and of that of <hi>Biela;</hi> upon which he promis'd her to
remit the Dukedom of <hi>Aosta</hi> freely unto her; and for what concern'd the
guardianship, and Regency, he would not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from what he had agreed unto,
and that he would absolutely joyn with the French; the treaty was readily
reassumed with the Dowager, and with <hi>France;</hi> President <hi>Leone,</hi>
the Count <hi>di Mussano,</hi> and <hi>el Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniale Moneti,</hi> were
chosen Deputies by the two Princes to treat thereof in <hi>Turin,</hi> and
<hi>Moneti</hi> was chosen President; the businesses as far as concerned Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi>'s interest, were as good as adjusted: greater and almost
insuperable difficulties arose touching the interest of the Prince Cardinal,
who though he desired agreement more then his brother, who being unwilling to
dispossess himself of the Towns in the County of <hi>Nizza,</hi> persisted in
his pretentions to the Lieutenancy of that County totally, and wholly
independent upon the Dowagers Regency, together with the retention of all the
Towns therein, and particularly of the Castle of <hi>Nizza,</hi> a place of
great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence; which pretentions being too repugnant to the Dowagers
Regency (whereunto she would not by any means consent) there was much a do to
salve all. At last, but after many months debate, the Princes condescended to
the Dowagers Regency, so as all things were <pb n="762" facs="tcp:53250:389"/> accorded
upon these Articles; that the Dowager should be Governess of the Duke, and
sovereign Regent of the States of her Son Don <hi>Charles Emanuel.</hi> That
she should choose a Council of State, consisting of such persons as were worthy
and capable of such an honour, wherein the Princes might intervene when they
pleased: That in the Letters Patents wherein it was wont to be said, with the
opinion of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, it should be said, with the assistance of the Princes
our Brothers, and with the approbation of our Councill: That in business of
great concernment the Princes should likewise subscribe, that the Prince
Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal should be the Dukes Lieutenant General in the County of
<hi>Nizza,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> in that of <hi>Inurea</hi> and
<hi>Biela:</hi> That the Governours and Officers of Justice, War, and of the
Finances, should be chosen by the Dowager, such as should be Subjects to the
House of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and capable of those employments; but those of the
County of <hi>Nizza,</hi> such as the Prince Cardinal might confide in: That
those who were already chosen by Duke <hi>Victorio,</hi> by the Dowager, and by
the Princes, should be confirm'd or removed as the Dowager should please; but
so as the Princes should be therewith satisfied. And to this purpose, there was
a writing made a part, declaring that all those who had adhered to the Princes
should be provided for, excluded, or changed: That the Oath of Allegiance to
the Duke should be renewed, with an expression, that if the Duke should die
without issue Male, the Prince Cardinal should succeed, and so successively the
Heirs Male; and that the said Princes should take the Oath of Allegiance to the
Duke: That for what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the order of the Annuntiata, and of the
religious orders of St. <hi>Mauritio</hi> and <hi>Lazaro,</hi> the accustomed
constitutions and rules should be observed: That the goods and reprisals should
be interchangeably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, and that all the Subjects should be received into
the Dowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers royal favour, and into the grace of the Princes: That to boot
with what hath been said, two thousand Foot, and a thousand Horse, should be
allowed to Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> for the Garrison of <hi>Inurea,</hi> and
for the defence of the Provinces allotted him; to boot with these Capitulations
made between the Dowager and the Princes joyntly, there should another
agreement be made, in particular, between the Dowager and the Prince

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>owns of the County of
<hi>Nizza,</hi> with a competent number of Souldiers: That the Governours who
should enter should be permitted to dismiss as many of the old garrison as they
should please: That the new Governours should, notwithstanding, swear unto the
Prince that they would not admit of any successour in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the
Town, who should not be a Subject of the royal House of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and
that the successor should do the like in the charge com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, before
he should enter the Town, and so should those do in the Government of the Town;
that as well the Governour, as his successors, should swear not to restore the
Town to any but him the Prince, or to the Heirs Male of the House of Savoy, in
case the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Duke should die without Heirs Male lawfully begotten. The
Prince Cardinal not contented with all this, demanded 30000 Ducates 
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:53250:389"/> of the Dowager, to distribute amongst the Spanish
Souldiers, whom he was to cashiere, and many other advantages for those
Officers who were to go out of the Forts. The Dowager, though she were reduced
to great streights by the present time granted all unto him readily; not onely
out of Princely Liberality, but out of singular Wisdom, as not ayming at any
thing, but at the assuring those so important Towns to her Son upon any
whatsoever conditions, and to reunite the House of <hi>Savoy,</hi> which was so
divided within it self, to real peace and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The same day the
agreement made by the Princes with the King of <hi>France</hi> was confirm'd

other potentates of <hi>Italy,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the restitution of the Dukes
Towns wherein he had any Garrisons. On the other side, the Princes promised and
obliged themselves to dismiss the Spaniards which were in their service, that
they should open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare themselves to be of the Kings party, and to
renounce all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the Spaniards, and that the Prince Cardinal, in
particular, should renounce the protection of the Empire, and that Prince
<hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maso</hi> should be bound to serve the King in person, in War, against
the Spaniards, as his Majesty should be pleased to appoint. All the other
Articles which were to be agreed upon, on the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Iune,</hi> the year
42, together with many other writings which were signed the same day, were
forthwith sent to <hi>France,</hi> that the King might approve of those which
related to the agreements between the Dowager and the Princes; and ratifie
those that were made between the Princes and his Embassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. By these
Capitulations (which were afterwards perform'd with satisfaction to all, as
shall be said) an end was put to the Wars of <hi>Piedmont.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Articles which were made between the Princes and the French
Embassadour the Princes were bound to dismiss all the Spanish Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that
were with them; but it was not express'd when; whereunto they thought
themselves engaged after Ratification made with the King. But this was the
hardest point of all others to execute, and which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed much trouble,
especially since the whole Garrison in <hi>Inurea</hi> were Spaniards; yet
Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> found means how to be easily rid of them.</p>
            <p>At the same time when these Affairs were upon concluding, instead
of General <hi>Harcourt</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bullion</hi> was made Commander in
Chief of the French Forces, he who had hatched the aforesaid Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion in the
Town of <hi>Sedan;</hi> but after the Battle, and death of the Count
<hi>Soisons,</hi> upon humbling himself to the King he was pardoned, and was 
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:53250:390"/> taken into the Kings favour, who when he was come into
<hi>Piedmont;</hi> and had ioyned with the Dowagers Forces, march'd into the
field, and passing into <hi>Alessandria</hi> was come as far as
<hi>Filizzano,</hi> and <hi>Corniente;</hi> Don <hi>Iohn Vasques,</hi> who was
Governour of <hi>Alessandria,</hi> and who was retreated with his men into that
City, fearing that he would pass over the <hi>Tanaro,</hi> sent all his
Cavalry, and 1000 Foot, under Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga,</hi> toward that river
to oppose the Enemy; some skirmishes past betvveen these and the Enemy on both
sides the river; but <hi>Bullion</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as if he vvould goe somevvhere
else, vvhich vvas said vvould be either to <hi>Pontestura</hi> or
<hi>Trino,</hi> the Governour went from <hi>Millain</hi> to <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celli,</hi>
to hinder any design of the Enemy, and to keep him from sitting down before
either of those places. Upon this occasion, Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> advised him
to take up one quarter before <hi>Pontestura,</hi> wherein he might put 2000
Foot, and 1000 Horse, offering him his Spanish horse and foot, which, as he
said, lay idle in <hi>Inurea:</hi> The Governour accepted his offer, being
unwilling to disfurnish other places; wherefore the Prince sent both Horse and
Foot from <hi>Inurea,</hi> towards St. <hi>Ia,</hi> but ordered the Horse that
when they should be come to such a certain place, they should hault, and suffer
the Foot to advance. But it being quickly known that <hi>Bullion</hi> was
retreated from <hi>Tanara,</hi> the Governour sent back the Foot to
<hi>Inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,</hi> and the Prince refused to receive them, under pretence that
there was a Truce made between them (the Princes) and the Dowager, and that to
shun that this reception might seem a novelty, he did not think fit to let them
in: They therefore retreated to <hi>Vercelli,</hi> so that by this cunning
trick the Prince quitted his hands of the Spanish Garrison. Nor did the Prince
Cardinal want means to free himself from the like incumbrance; for either
having received, or seeming to have received notice, that Don <hi>Francisco
Tuttavilla,</hi> Captain of the thousand Spaniards which were granted him for
the defence of himself, and of the County of <hi>Nizza,</hi> had treated with
the Garrison of the Castle to his prejudice; he sent for him into the Castle,
and seeming to resent the action he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to go immediately out of the
Castle, together with his men, who were there ready to depart, and that he
should go out of <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edmont;</hi> which being done, both the Princes were
masters of themselves; and might the better make good their agreement. This
dismission was done very seasonably; for had it been longer delaid, it had
hindred not only the execution of this so important business, but had hazarded
the whole agreement, by reason of a sudden accident which hapned in
<hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salle. Bullion,</hi> who after he could not get over the
<hi>Tanaro</hi> was returned to <hi>Montferrat,</hi> had quartered his men in
the Towns thereabouts, and going himself for pastime to <hi>Cassalle,</hi> out
of a desire to see that Citadel, which was held to be impregnable, when he was
come into the Citadel, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his own expectation, and the like of all
others, was by order from the King seized upon by the Governour of the Citadel,
and sent back well guarded into <hi>France.</hi> This hapned just ten days
after the agreement made by the Princes, and five days after they had cashiered
the Spaniards; which made it be generally conceived that this was done by way
of resenting what had hapned at <hi>Sedan,</hi> notwithstanding the Kings
pardon: this seemed to be an example to the Princes, who did always distrust
that the Articles made with the Court of <hi>France</hi> 
               <pb n="765" facs="tcp:53250:390"/>
would not be made good unto them; and it was commonly conceived that had not
the Princes declared so absolutely in the behalf of <hi>France,</hi> by
dismissing those men, they would have demurred upon those Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; but
being quite deprived of the Spanish assistance, though they knew not what might
succeed, they were forced to rest contented, and to expect from whence this
blow proceeded, and what it aimed at; but all doubts and apprehensions soon
ceased, it being known that the Dukes imprisonment proceeded not out of any old
account, but out of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ew
jealousies, that he was complice in a new conspiracy made against the Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> by Monsieur St. <hi>Mark, Grand Escuyer de France,</hi> and
favorite to the King; so as all occasions of diffidence ceasing, and the Kings
ratification being come from <hi>France,</hi> with satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all, they
fell to do what was at the present to be done; but there was a knot found in
the Prince Cardinals businesse which was hard to be untied, which proceeded
from whether the Marriage should precede the resignation of the Towns in the
County of <hi>Niz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> or the resignation the Marriage; whereof there being
great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust on both sides, some solution must be found for it; which after
much discussion, was; that the Marriage should be celebrated in <hi>Nizza,</hi>
by a Proxey to be of purpose deputed by the Princes; which Proxey was to swear,
upon pain of life, that the Marriage should be consumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as soon as the
Towns should be resigned; and that the Governours who were to receive them in
the Dowagers behalf should swear unto the Prince, before they entred the Towns,
to re-deliver them to the Prince, if they should find the Princess her Proxey
backward to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Marriage. Things being t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>us adjusted, the Prince Cardinal sent <hi>Iovan
Dominico Doria,</hi> Marquess of <hi>Cerie,</hi> to <hi>Turin</hi> with
suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authority to celebrate the Espousals by words, for the future,
between him the Prince, and the eldest Daughter of <hi>Savoy;</hi> after which
cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration, the Marquess <hi>Pianezza</hi> was chosen Proxey by the Princess
to celebrate the Marriage by words in present; and the Dowager de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
<hi>Carlo Vittorio Scaglia,</hi> Count <hi>di Verrua,</hi> to receive the
Castle of <hi>Nizza;</hi> and <hi>Iovan Baptista Solaro,</hi> Count <hi>di
Monestervolo,</hi> to receive that of <hi>Villa franca;</hi> and Count
<hi>Alessandro Borgarello</hi> that of St. <hi>Sospiro.</hi> The Proxey and the
Deputies went from <hi>Turin</hi> towards <hi>Nizza;</hi> and with them went
Monsieur <hi>Zecchinelli,</hi> the Popes Nuntio, who carried the Popes
dispensation with him, for the celebration of the Marriage, and power to
receive the Cardinals-Cap from the Prince; when they were come to
<hi>Nizza,</hi> they all took their solemn Oaths to observe what they had sworn
to in the Capitulations; and subsequently the Towns were deliver'd up, and the
Marriage was celebrated on the 21 of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> the year 1642, with
infinite satisfaction to all parties concern'd, with incredible applause of the
people, who being over-joyed to see the Princes joyn'd in a good peace and
hoped that being freed from the calamities of War th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y should enjoy the fruits of peace. Count
<hi>Verrua</hi> being entred into the Fort and Castle of <hi>Nizza,</hi> and
the others into the others of that County, they dismist all the old Garrisons
which they found in them; so as they remained in the full and absolute power
&amp; do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of the Duke &amp; Dowager; and the Princes when they had
dismist the Spaniards, before they publish'd the agreement which they had made 
<pb n="766" facs="tcp:53250:391"/> with the Dowager, and with the King of <hi>France,</hi>
they sent to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Millain,</hi> demanding the restoral of the
Towns that had been taken to their Nephew the Duke; and the Governour being
desirous to know from them, before he gave his answer, if when restitution
should be made, they would continue in Peace, or in War, with the Duke, he
could receive no clear answer, but one that was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and very dubious;
and the Princes thinking that if he should not be sure of peace
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e would make no restauration, and
that he would be hardly brought to do it when he should be assured of it,
wit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>out waiting any longet for
answer from the Governour, nor from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> from whence
resolution was to come, they published the agreement; and Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> marching into the field as a Souldier of the King of
<hi>France</hi> began to manage those Arms against the King of <hi>Spain</hi>
which before he had managed for the King of <hi>Spain</hi> against
<hi>France;</hi> he therefore headed the French who remained in those parts
after <hi>Bullions</hi> imprisonment; and being followed by Marquess
<hi>Villa</hi> with the Dowagers men he fell to recover the Towns which were
held by the Spanish Garrisons: he began with <hi>Crescentino,</hi> where he met
with grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>er resistance then he
expected; for the Governour seeing that the French Army after <hi>Bullions</hi>
imprisonment was retreated into <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and that being divided into
several quarters it lay about <hi>Verrua,</hi> feared <hi>Crescentino:</hi>
wherefore he sent the Marquess of <hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena</hi> with all the Horse, except
those of <hi>Naples,</hi> to recruit it with Men and Munition; which
<hi>Caracena</hi> having very well performed, passing over the <hi>Poe</hi> at
<hi>Pontestura,</hi> he went by Orders from the Governour to St.
<hi>Salvadore.</hi> Serjeant Major <hi>Alonso Vasques</hi> was Captain of the
Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison, who did not only vigorously sustain the Siege, but troubled the
Enemy with many sallies; and though the place were not much forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, nor
very hard to be taken by him who should be master of the field, yet it held out
stoutly for 15 days, in which time the Governour doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Trino,</hi> and
St. <hi>Ia,</hi> he had time to put good Garrisons, and other
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> into them, the charge whereof
he committed to Marquess <hi>Caracena,</hi> who stealing secretly out of
<hi>Vercelli</hi> re-enforced <hi>Trino</hi> twice by a way which leads not far
from <hi>Crescentino,</hi> whilst the Prince was hottest about it: The like he
did in St. <hi>

                  </gap>a,</hi> where he
found no opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. These provisions were very seasonably made; for the Duke
of <hi>Longueville</hi> appearing at last, after mid <hi>August,</hi> in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> who was appointed to succeed <hi>Bullion</hi> in the place
of General of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

and having brought many men with him, wherewith he was to carry the War into
the State of <hi>Millain;</hi> now that the Princes were past over to the
French, it behoved the Governour, who had not equal Forces to face him in the
Field, to munite the Towns of the State, and those of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> with
good Garrisons; and yielding the Field to the French, to watch where this
gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t cloud would settle at last:
it was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conceived that Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> was drawn to side with
the French, by strong promises that they would get him some Territories in the
State of <hi>Millain,</hi> which should be peculiar to him and to those that
should descend from him; and the sequel shewed that the County of
<hi>Tortona,</hi> and peradventure that of <hi>Alessandria,</hi> together with
all on this side <hi>Poe,</hi> towards the State of <hi>Genoa,</hi> was
promis'd him; that, moreover, <pb n="767" facs="tcp:53250:391"/> he was intended to be made
General of all the French Forces in <hi>Italy:</hi> but that Court not thinking
it fit to bestow upon him a charge of so great importance at the very first,
especially the Hostages of his Wife and Children being considered which were in
<hi>Spain,</hi> it was judged more convenient to give that imployment to the
Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> who was joyn'd by affinity and correspondency to
the Prince: wherefore that Court thought fit to mitigate the Prince his
pretentions by that choice, whereby they had sufficiently provided for his
interests; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Orders being considered, which, as hath been said,
were given unto <hi>Longueville,</hi> to carry on the War according to the
Prince his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs and ends; but the Prince not being content with these
provisions, and expecting better satisfaction, to the end that the Souldiers
might not lie idle in the interim, in a time proper for War, the Duke whilst
the Prince remain'd in <hi>Inurea,</hi> went with his own men only, to the
ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Nizza</hi> and <hi>Acqui;</hi> to the end that when those places
should be taken, way might be made for the intended design upon
<hi>Tortona;</hi> which when it should be effected, the State of
<hi>Millain</hi> was to be assaulted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ince his ends and interests. <hi>Nizza</hi> was not
much stronger then <hi>Crescentino,</hi> and whosoever was master of the field
might easily take it; nor was it very well garrison'd: Wherefore Baron
<hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teville</hi> was sent to recruit it with 200 Souldiers, who entring the
Town, after the places thereabout were t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ken, the Garrison was encreased to the number of 450, an
insufficient number to defend it, and yet <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teville</hi> did all that was
to be done therein; but a greater breach being made in six hours space then the
Enemy intended, by reason of the bad condition of the earth, and several Mines
being ready to play, they began to treat of surrender; and <hi>Longueville</hi>
being resolved not to yield to any other conditions, then those that were
granted to Count St. <hi>Paul,</hi> by Marquess <hi>Leganes,</hi> when he took
it the year before; the defendants were en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>orced to accept of such conditions as the Enemy was pleased to
impose upon them; which were, that the Garrison should be sent, thorough
<hi>France,</hi> to the County of <hi>Burgondy,</hi> which was under the King
of <hi>Spain.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>he Governour
had intended to relieve this place another time, by sending 100 Horse, and as
many Dragoons, thither before the surrender; but the resolution being divulged,
and the Conductor, who was no friend to <hi>Batteville,</hi> carrying the
business but ill-favour'dly, it succeeded not; for the relievers being come
neer the Enemies Camp, they found the Enemy ready to repulse them; so they
returned to <hi>Alessandria,</hi> from whence they were come, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done
any thing: a greater disaster befel a Regiment of Horse which were sent to
<hi>Montaldo,</hi> (a Town within six miles of <hi>Nizza)</hi> to incommod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

being fallen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a greater number of Horse, it was routed with loss of
seventy Horse, and the Captain had much ado to save himself. Not long after

Lieutenant General of the <hi>Millain</hi> Horse, whom he assaulted three hours
before day on two sides; the quarter was put into great confusion; and though
the Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, <pb n="768" facs="tcp:53250:392"/> with some of his best men, made
head against them, yet the rest fled awa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, and saved themselves by foording over the <hi>Sesia:</hi> The
Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant having but few with him, and being abandoned by the rest, got over
also by the same foord into the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> leaving all his
bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, and many of his Horse, behind him to the Enemy; there were not many
slain, for the foord being neer the quarter, saved many of them. Don
<hi>Ieronymo Salvaterra</hi> was taken prisoner, and Don <hi>Luigi
Benavida,</hi> both of them being wounded; and if Don <hi>Mauritio</hi> had
been aware to have placed some to have guarded the foord, the victory would
have been much greater: The Marquess <hi>Caracena,</hi> who was then in
<hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celli,</hi> thought to have served the Enemy with the like sauce; for
hearing that the Princes Horse were quartered in five places above
<hi>Biela,</hi> he ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied the Horse that were run from their quarters, and
joyning them to those that were in Garrison in <hi>Vercelli</hi> and St.
<hi>Ia,</hi> he marched with them and with 400 Foot about Sun-set, thinking to
fall upon the Prince his Horse which lay about <hi>Biela.</hi> But he fared not
as did Don <hi>Mauritio,</hi> by reason of the disparity of the Countries
through which they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for <hi>Caracena</hi> marched through an Enemies
Country, and <hi>Mauritio</hi> thorow his friends quarters. Wherefore the
latter past with great silence and secrecie, whereas <hi>Caracena</hi> found
the Country up in Arms, and the bells of the Towns by which he marched ringing
aloud; so as not being able to get to the place he intended before noon day,
his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment proved vain, save onely that he light upon 60 Horse which were
given to <hi>Biela,</hi> which he routed, and took some of them prisoners.
<hi>Nizza</hi> being taken, <hi>Longueville</hi> sat down before
<hi>Acqui,</hi> which he within a few days took, and went to quarter at
<hi>Gui,</hi> intending, as was imagined, to go to the taking in of
<hi>Tortona;</hi> but he was disswaded by Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> who thinking
to succeed in the surprisal of <hi>Novara,</hi> as he had plotted it, invi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed the Duke to joyn with him in that
enterprise. Wherefore the Duke returning to <hi>Cassalle</hi> joyn'd with the
Prince, who staid for him at <hi>Balzola</hi> and <hi>Morano;</hi> and passing
together over the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia,</hi> they marched towards <hi>Novara:</hi> But
whether it were that he could nor come at his appointed time to the Gates of
<hi>Novara,</hi> by reason of the excessive rain which had fallen for two days,
or that they had heard that the Marquess of <hi>Caracena,</hi> fearing what the
issue of this march would be, was entred <hi>Novara</hi> with above 500 Horse,
and a great many Foot: And that the Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi> who was then
in <hi>Alessan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> had sent some foot from Garrison to Garrison by
<hi>Valenza</hi> and <hi>Mortara,</hi> so speedily as that these recruits
coming before the Enemy arrived, the Prince began to doubt his design; he and
the Duke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to <hi>Confienza,</hi> and passing over the <hi>Sesia</hi>
distributed their men in <hi>Constanza, Dezava, Carenzana,</hi> and in other
Towns thereabouts. Where having tarryed a few days, and moneys being sent from
<hi>France,</hi> they went to the former designed enterprise of
<hi>Tortona.</hi> The French Forces, and those of the Dowagers in this Camp,
rose to the number of 5000 Horse, and 10000 Foot: Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> led
on the Van, <hi>Longueville</hi> followed with the Body of the Battle, and
Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> brought up the Rere; and passing over the <hi>Poe</hi>
to <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and over the <hi>Tanaro</hi> to <hi>Filizzano; Villa</hi>
advanc'd presently to possess himself of all the places neer the City, to keep
out Men, and Munition; which when it <pb n="769" facs="tcp:53250:392"/> should be done;
this so important City would undoubtedly have been reduced within four dayes:
For <hi>Tortona</hi> being far from <hi>Piedmont,</hi> none could imagine that
the Enemy should leave the Towns unrecovered, which were held by the Spaniards
in the heart of the State, and advance to this, especially since the winter
drew on, and by the difficulty of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing relief which was to be brought so
far through an Enemies Country; wherefore as if it had been out of all danger,
it had in it a Garrison of on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly 100 Souldiers, and no Commander of note. But
the enemies diligence was prevented by the Governor <hi>Siruela,</hi> who not
knowing what to think of the haste which the Enemy made, and not being able to
comprehend where they intended to go, though he wanted Foot to secure so many
places, subject to be assaulted by so great Forces; yet after having sent
succour to <hi>Allessandria</hi> from <hi>Valenza,</hi> he sent 800 Foot to
pass over the <hi>Poe</hi> at <hi>Bassignana,</hi> and to keep in
<hi>Piovera;</hi> and ordered Don <hi>Iohn Vas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques Coronado,</hi> who was in
<hi>Allessandria,</hi> that if the Enemy should tarry in those parts, he should
send for those 800 Foot, and with them succour <hi>Annone, Rocaurano,</hi> and
<hi>Aste;</hi> but if he should see them make towards <hi>Tortona,</hi> he
should forth-with send them to assist that City; which was wisely foreseen by
the Governour; and being punctually observed by <hi>Vasques,</hi> excellent
effects did the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>eby redound to the
Kings Affairs. For these 800 Foot being luckily got into the City before
<hi>Villa</hi>'s arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall, some few of them onely who were neer in the Rere,
not being able to escape <hi>Villa</hi>'s diligence who took them, the Town was
inabled to hold out the siege long, which consumed more then the moiety of that
flourishing Army; which if they had quickly taken, they might easily have made
themselves Masters of all on this side the <hi>Poe,</hi> towards the
<hi>Apennine;</hi> and would, (their Forces being entire) have had opportunity
to have effected the Prince his vast designes: Not long after <hi>Bernardine
Galeotti</hi> a Neapolitan, and <hi>Prestino,</hi> who was an excellent
Enginier, being sent by the Governour, stole into the City; passing over the
Mountain which was not as yet guarded nor possess'd by the Enemy, and were both
of them a great help to defend the City. The Army being drawn neer the City,
and having at the very first taken the Suburbs, they planted their Artillery
against the walls, trying if the Citizens would willingly surrender, which they
not doing, they began their battery; wherewith having made a breach,
<hi>Galeotti</hi> found the City was not to be defended, wherefore they retired
so hastily to the Castle, as they had not time to carry their victuals along
with them, nor to break down the mils which were neer the walls, things which
did afterwards much accommodate the enemy, who entring the City the fifth day,
when the Garrison had abandoned it, and the City by the Bishops interposing,
surrendred upon condition: So as the Enemy began immediately to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt the
Castle with Trenches, and possess'd themselves of the Church &amp; Monastery of
S. <hi>Dominico,</hi> which stood between the City and the Castle, the Garrison
not having fortified it, to keep from

having hardly enough to defend the Castle: And yet ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foreseeing, or
already finding how prejudicial the taking of that Convent would be unto them,
they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ndeavoured to recove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>. The Duke
sent the Horse afterwards to scour the Country, who without resistance took the
Castle <pb n="770" facs="tcp:53250:393"/> 
               <hi>Nuovo di Scrivia,</hi> which Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> chose for his quarters, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving placed a quarter also in
<hi>Pontecurone,</hi> he took <hi>Voghera,</hi> which threw the Gates open;

               </gap>bout, he got good store of Victuals, and brought it
together with much more booty into the City: but those who dwelt upon the hills
resisted, and preserved their goods and persons, with much prejudice to their
opposers; the first and most important resolution of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers was to take
<hi>Serravalle,</hi> a Town scituated upon the way that leads to the Sea, which
being a place of great consequence, whereby com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e of <hi>Genoa</hi> was either block'd
up, or maintained, the business was committed to Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> who
going from the Camp with the <hi>Piedmont</hi> Horse, and five French Regiments
of Foot, which in all made 1500 Horse, and 3000 Foot, he marched thitherward;
and took first <hi>Stasono</hi> which did willingly surrender, and came
after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to <hi>Serravalle,</hi> where taking the Town without resistance he
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himself to the Castle, whither the Garrison was retreated, and where
there was not any provision; and yet it held out, and afforded the Governour
<hi>Siruela</hi> time (who was very desirous to preserve that place) to get
together as many men as in so great streights he could from the Garrisons of
the State of <hi>Millain</hi> and of the Towns in <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> having
called Count <hi>Galliazzo Trotti</hi> from <hi>Asti,</hi> and Don
<hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenzzo Monsurio</hi> from <hi>Vercelli,</hi> who by reason of the
neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the State of <hi>Millain</hi> got into <hi>Allessandria</hi>
without any hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, with all their men: <hi>Fra. Iovan Pallavicino,</hi>
Camp-master, met with more difficulty, and danger, who was sent for by the
Governour from <hi>Villa nova,</hi> vvith order, that leaving men and munition
sufficient to keep that place from surprisal, he should come into

by the Garrison of <hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> which overtook him at the bridge of

their desire by re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>son of 200

<hi>Palavicino</hi> not at all abash'd at their approach placed himself with
his ranks in order before the carriages, and facing about made head against the
Enemy, and held them play till the Carriages and the Cannon past over the
Bridge, after which his men began to march in good order, with their faces
still towards the Enemy, and still fighting; who passing over after them did
still pursue them, till <hi>Pallavicino</hi> be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ng come with his men to <hi>Gombino,</hi> a Town two
miles distant from the Bridge, made himself master thereof, and fortifyed
himself in an advantagious place, where he stay'd with his men in order,
expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Enemy should advance; but they not daring to assault 
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:53250:393"/> him upon such disadvantagious tearms, left pursuing him,
and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated towards <hi>Carmagnuola,</hi> suffering <hi>Pallavicino</hi> to
pass freely into <hi>Allessandria,</hi> whither he came safe with his men and
carriages; this so great recruite being so luckily come to the Governour was of
great consequence; for with them, and with some other men that he had, he made
up a body of 5000 Foot, and 300 Horse; with the which marching into the field
on the eighth of <hi>Octber,</hi> he came to <hi>Fregarvola,</hi> a Town neer
<hi>Bosco,</hi> intending to go from thence to <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravalle,</hi> whither he
had sent some Foot already, that they might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to get one after another
into the Castle; and though his men were fewer in number then the Enemy; yet
the Enemy being distributed into several quarters, the Governour doubted not,
but that he being more in number then any one of the Enemies quarters, his
design might take effect: Nor was he therein deceived, for it fell out better
then was expected; the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> who was before
<hi>Tortona</hi> with but a few men, hearing of this expedition, and fearing
that the Enemy might fall upon some part of the Trenches which were ill
provided of Defendants, and might enter into the Castle, and so into the City,
and cause some important mischief, sent speedily back for all the Horse which
were dispers'd abroad in several parts, and brought them neerer
<hi>Tortona;</hi> and moreover sent for Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> from
<hi>Serravalle;</hi> who writ back that he thought it better to quit
<hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona,</hi> and be masters of <hi>Serravalle,</hi> then to abandon
<hi>Serravalle,</hi> and come to before <hi>Tortona;</hi> for that the way by
Sea being block up on that part to the State of <hi>Millaln, Tortona</hi> would
not be able to hold out long, and way would be made to further progress; he
therefore ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised him to give over that Siege, and to joyn with him in the
taking of <hi>Serravalle;</hi> but <hi>Longueville</hi> persisting in his own
opinion, redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his order with more efficacy; Wherefore <hi>Villa</hi>
leaving <hi>Serravalle,</hi> though unwillingly, forewent that Castle, and the
Town which he had already taken: So the Governour having by the meer fame of
his march luckily freed <hi>Serravalle,</hi> which was held as good as lost, he
sent a sufficient Garrison thither to guard it, and furnished it with munition;
keeping afterwards in the Town of <hi>Bosco,</hi> he stay'd there, to keep the
victuals and munition from coming to the enemies Camp, which were sent from
<hi>Piedmont</hi> by <hi>Montferrate;</hi> believing that the Enemy not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
able to maintain that siege long for scarcity of victuals and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, must
of necessity give over the enterprize; and to this purpose, he acquainted the
Commonwealth of <hi>Genoa,</hi> how unjustly they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to invade the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> and how prejudicial that would be to the
<hi>Genoeses;</hi> wherefore he exhorted that State not to afford any
conveniencies to their enemies; the Commonwealth hereupon took into
consideration, how that all the Castles which she held beyond t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

are of themselves not onely unable to feed Forreign Armies, but even not onely

               <pb n="772" facs="tcp:53250:394"/> then from

               </gap>cial to those people, who
would be thereby provoked to Military Licentiousness, by the pillaging and
plundering the whole Countrey in resentment of the affront; nor would the
mischief cease here; for the King of <hi>France</hi> would be offended with the
Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth for this action, which peradventure he would esteem little less
then Hostile; wherefore the Commonwealth having acquainted the Governour with
these reasons sent a competent number of Souldiers to <hi>Novi,</hi> under
<hi>Philip Palavicino,</hi> one well vers'd both in Civil, and in Military
affairs; and enjoyned him that he should endeavour the quiet of those confines,
and to keep them from the inrode of disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Souldiers, and not to suffer any
innovation whereby the liberty of that market might be prejudiced; so the
French whose quarters lay neer that Market, coming thither to buy victuals at
any rates, the prises rise to such a heighth, as it drew great store of
Victuals from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

beyond <hi>Tortona</hi> towards the <hi>Poe,</hi> could not make use of that
mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, as the French did; they complained of the Commonwealth, as if she had
favour'd the French more then them; not seeing, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to see, that
almost all the victuals which were brought to <hi>Novi</hi> came from the State
of <hi>Millain,</hi> and that they not being able by any means their own
scourers of the Country could use, to keep their own subjects from bringing
victuals to <hi>Novi,</hi> they were cause of that mischief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

without loss of any time, continued to besiege that Castle, about which having
taken up their quarters, and drawn a line about it, they made four approaches
toward it: two towards the City, and two towards the Mountain and
<hi>Turen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi>'s Regiment being quartered over against a certain half moon,

which they had brought to that end, they brought it safe to the Camp before
<hi>Tortona,</hi> whither <hi>Villa</hi> came safe also before the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> got from <hi>Pozzuolo</hi> to <hi>Sale;</hi> who since he had

that lay there in Garrison go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to discover the Enemy, they skirmished
with them, and were repuls'd by them; and the keeper of the Castle at his
return found the gates shut upon him by the Towns-men; so as failing of that
refuge, he went to <hi>Pontecurone,</hi> to joyn with the Horse which were
quartered there; and the Governour passing over the <hi>Scrivia</hi> with the
rest of his men, went to <hi>Castel nuovo;</hi> which made all the Country
towards <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tona</hi> on this side the River be abandoned by the Enemies
Horse and Foot which were quartered in those parts, who came all to the line of
circumvolution about the Castle: whereupon the Governour went to
<hi>Pontecurone,</hi> and finding it empty he made there a Rendezvous of Arms,
and placed some Troops of Horse there which were newly come from the State of
<hi>Millain;</hi> and hearing that there were only 100 French in Garrison in
the Castle of <hi>Voghera,</hi> he sent Forces to drive them out; which was
done without any difficulty; for the French at the very sight of the Spanish
Colours surrendred the place, and retired, as the rest had done, to the

               </gap>renches about <hi>Tortona:</hi>
all on this side the <hi>Scrivia</hi> towards <hi>Tortona</hi> being taken, and
the Governour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing master of the Field, he betook himself wholly to relieve
the Castle, the Condition whereof he could by no means hear, so dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e all the Avenues guarded;
which made him much doubt the preservation thereo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, not knowing how long it could hold out; and it was
given out by the Enemy that it would soon be surrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And yet because he
would not be failing to himself, nor leave any thing undone which might make
for the presesvation of so impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a place, he was very diligent in getting
provisions, whereby to keep the Castle from
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>urrendring; wherefore he hasted
to relieve it; he knew he could not effect his design by any way but by that of
the Mountain, <pb n="774" facs="tcp:53250:395"/> wherein he was to meet with two great
difficulties; the first, that the Enemy foreknowing it, would fortifie the
Trench on that side the more strongly, and would place his whole Forces there,
since he could not apprehend fear in any other place: The other difficulty
proceeded from the inconveniencies which were found in the scituation of the
Mountain. The Castle of <hi>Tortona</hi> stands upon the top of a Hill, which
being seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from higher Hills declines gently for the space of three miles
on the East side of the City, which lies just at the Foot thereof; so as the
Governour, if he would relieve the Castle, was to begin from the highest and
furthermost tops of the Hills, and by the ridge thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ch the well munited Trenches which
shelter the Castle on the Hills side: Nor was this all the difficulty; about a
mile before you come to the line of Circumvolution, the Hill declining by
degrees shapes out a gutter, which falls into a Valley, whither he who will
advance must fall down, and then climb up again to the opposite top: This
gutter or slit was very incommodious and dangerous, if the Enemy should have
mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited the edge thereof, as it was probable they had done; therefore the
resolution of bringing relief was fuller of danger then hope: But the
Governour, who thought the loss of this Castle to be the worst of evils that
could befal, was resolved to try his Fortune; he therefore took up two quarters
on the very top of the Hill, and possessed himself of <hi>Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gualdone</hi>
and <hi>Sarzano;</hi> and falling down from thence, he came with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any
opposition to the Gutter or Slit; where he found <hi>Longueville</hi> and his
men on the opposite height well prepared to defend that Pass; nor herewithall
content, he fortified himself with a good Trench, and with Artillery, upon the
edge of the top of his hill; so as from thence he commanded all the Enemies
Troops, and all the avenues by which he might be assaulted. The Governour being
come to the slit, began al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to fortifie the top of his hill; and
contemplating the Enemies ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious position, he began to find, that he
could not send to assault it, but by ways which by the fall of waters were made
slippery, and which were so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as but a few could march on front; so as to attempt an assault against a long,
stout, well munited row of men, would be a great piece of folly; there remained
but one thing to be done, that he might not seem to have moved in vain, and to
have done thus much to no purpose; which was, to send some men to try an
assault upon some <hi>Corps de guard</hi> which were without the Trenches,
placed upon the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the slit, neer a little solitary Chappel which was
there, to see whether the Enemy being provoked thereby would forego his
advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, and fall rashly down into the Valley, whereby fighting in an equal
place, way might be made for the intended succour; as this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t was idle, so proved it unuseful; for
though Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> came out of the Trench with his Horse, back'd
with some Squadrons, and falling upon the assaulters, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t them back to a certain little house which they had
formerly possest themselves of, and which stood in the middle between the two
Camps; yet no more was done; but all the <hi>Corps de guard</hi> being sent for
back, returned to the Trench; and the French Commande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s shewed themselves more wary in
maintaining the advantage of their
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, then ready to hazard the
unce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tainty of Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle either upon equal or unequal
terms; and therefore the Governour <pb n="775" facs="tcp:53250:395"/> finding that the
Enemy was not minded to forego his advantage, he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, but in vain, to
put 300 men by night into the Castle. Both the Armies kept their stations that
night, the next day the rain increased; so as the Spanish Army not being able
to convey in their Victuals, and their Souldiers being exposed to the rain, the
Governour was forced to think of retreating; he therefore made his Horse
advance, and left Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> with a good strength of Horse
and Foot, to keep the station where his Army was quartered till his Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
might be march'd off: who met with many great obstacles in their retreat; for
being to passe over the <hi>Gru,</hi> (a little rivulet at other times, but
which ran now with very much violence being much swollen by the fall of
waters,) they were fain to climb up a hill beyond it, and to draw up their
Artillery by it, which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the rain was become hardly passable;
wherefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved to march both Horse and Foot by the current of the
<hi>Gru;</hi> wherefore the General of the Horse, Marquess <hi>Caracena,</hi>
sent some Horse that night to guard the lower part of that rivulet, to defend
the Army in its march, by whom he was afterwards informed, that many Horse were
come out of the City of <hi>Tortona,</hi> marching towards
<hi>Vighiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volo,</hi> by which the Army was to pass with their Artillery;
wherefore the Marquess doubled the aforesaid Guards, charging them to mark well
the Enemies way, and to give notice of every the least proceeding: The Guards
returned, averring their former advertisement, and, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that the Horse
and Foot marched toward the same stations that the Spanish Army had left;
whereupon the Spanish Army haulted, to consult upon what was to be done: the
joynt opinion was, that they should continue their begun march, for that the
advertisement might be false; and if otherwise, they might by continuing their
march get to <hi>Vighizvolo</hi> before the Enemy; only <hi>Caracena</hi>
opposed the general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, averring that the Horse which marched in the
Rere should be so long held skirmishing by the Enemies Horse which advanced by
the Valley, as the rest of the Enemies Horse which marched by the hill might
come up unto them, and fall upon them, and that not being able for want of Foot
to defend themselves, they the Spaniards would be routed, that the Enemy would
pursue their Victory, and advancing forwards would also rout the Foot: he
concluded therefore, that it would be better to bring all their men into one
body, and keep in that station which was very strong, as being between two
hills, which were higher then those on which the Enemy was; and that keeping
the <hi>Gru</hi> before them which ran between the two Armies, it was
impossible they could fight them upon such advantage without passing over the
<hi>Gru,</hi> which he desired the Enemy would dare to do; for by so doing
their utter ruine would undoubtedly ensue, and the loss of all their men,
whereby they the French might obtain a signal vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>tory; and if, as it might be believed, the Spaniards
might think this too dangerous, and so keep idle where they were, they might
draw up their Artillery; which might be done in one day or two, and the Baggage
might march securely in the Rere. This advice was generally disliked, all of
them persisting in their former resolution of marching along the <hi>Gru;</hi>
but the Marquess knowing the certain danger they should run into by that 
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:53250:396"/> march, said resolutely he would not go that way, and
gave order to the Horse to march the way he should direct them; and was so
resolute therein, as the rest changed their minds, and came over to his
opinion; and ere long, by an accident that hapned, his opinion was clearly
found to be the best, and the only safe one; a thick cloud arose upon
day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>break, which took away the sight of the Campagnia and of the hill; which
vanishing away a little after <hi>Caracena</hi>'s opinion was approved of,
several Troops of the Enemies Horse and Foot were discovered on the hill; which
made them all aware, what imminent danger the Army would have incur'd had not
<hi>Caracena</hi> persisted in his opinion; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the whole Army very much
applauded the Marquess, as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer from so great a danger, and
acknowledged themselves infinitely obliged to him; and not long after they
might see the French Troops which lay towards <hi>Vighizvolo</hi> joyn with
those upon the hill, by which <hi>Caracena</hi>'s counsel appeared to be the
sole safety of that Army, which was at that time of such importance for the
preservation of the State of <hi>Millain.</hi> Both the Armies kept their
stations, not acting any thing: the French not daring to assault the Spaniards
began to retire towards the Camp, two hours before Sun-set; which the Spaniards
perceiving they also removed, and went towards <hi>Pontecurone,</hi> whither it
came without any encounter, but weary; the Artillery was drawn by the Dutch of
Prince <hi>Borso</hi>'s Regiment, and by some others of the same Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by
strength of Arms, up the hill, and safely brought to <hi>Pontecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone,</hi> for
which they had good store of drinking money given them: a retreat, which the
fuller it was of danger and difficulty, the more praise-worthy was it. The
Besiegers thinking that the Castle would immediately be surrendered, now that
the relieving Army was gone, whereby they were deprived of all hopes of relief,
sent to demand the Castle; but it was manfully answered, that affairs were not
yet brought to terms of surrender. In this interim a great supply of Victuals
and Ammunition was brought to the French Camp by the way of <hi>Acqui;</hi> nor
was <hi>Piedmont</hi> content only to send considerable succours to the
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise of <hi>Tortona;</hi> but the Dowager making use of this occasion
design'd to take such Towns from the Spaniards as they were possest of, and to
free <hi>Piedmont</hi> absolutely, whilst it was unprovided of requisite
Garrisons. To this purpose she got together a considerable body of men,
composed of the Military remainders in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and drawn out of the
Garrisons thereof, and of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> to whom she added those that
were sent by Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> when he parted from <hi>Serravalle;</hi>
and this was approved of by the French and Piedmonteses; for by send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of
these men into the field, one of two things was likely to result: either the
recovery of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e Towns, or the
withdrawing of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards from defending <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ortona;</hi> and because the recovery of the Towns was
the thing chiefly intended by the Dowager, her opinion was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of by
Marquess <hi>Pianezza,</hi> who propounded the enterprise of <hi>Verrua</hi>
first, and next that of <hi>Vercelli;</hi> not so much in consideration of
their slender Garrisons, as for the safety and conveniency which would redound
to <hi>Piedmont</hi> thereby, and for that nothing else would more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rt the defending of <hi>Tortona.</hi>
And the manner of effecting both these enterprises being discuss'd, the French
Embassadour who could hear <pb n="777" facs="tcp:53250:396"/> no more acceptable news then
the recovery of <hi>Verrua,</hi> which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the way to <hi>France</hi> for
the relief of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> joyn'd willingly with <hi>Pianezza</hi> in his
opinion: Wherefore some Horse were sent to <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rua,</hi> to possess
themselves of the Avenues thereabouts, that they might keep out the Spanish
succour which might be sent thither from the confining Towns of <hi>Trino,
Pontestura,</hi> or <hi>Villa-nuova.</hi> The good success of this enterprise
consisted in expedition; wherefore <hi>Pianezza</hi> having sent men by the
<hi>Poe</hi> to this intended enterprise, and ladders and other necessary
instructions along with them, he marched towards the Town; where he applyed
ladders that very night, by which he forced the Defendants to fly unto the
Castle, so he easily became Master of the Town, which did facilitate the taking
of the Castle. But before he would attempt it, he would try how the Defendants
minds stood; he therefore beat a Call, summoning them to surrender: whereupon
they par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed, and the next morning
yielded upon honourable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by which the place was restored by the
Spanish Governour to <hi>Pianezza,</hi> who received it in the name of the
Dowager and the Duke. <hi>Verrua</hi> was a place of gre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>t consequence, by reason that it commanded the

                  </gap>li,</hi> where the Garrison was much
diminished, by reason of the necessary defence of <hi>Tortona</hi> the Marquess
cast his eye upon two Tenag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

seemed easie to be taken, if they should be attempted by night; and when they
should be taken would be a safe quarter against the City. But this business
required more men, wherefore it had been forme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

against the Scalado, but against se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral assaults, and repuls'd the Assailants
much to their loss of blood: Who not knowing whither better to go, marched
towards <hi>Tortona,</hi> to bring that real help thither, which they could not
do by diversion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing sent for thither, as they said, by
<hi>Longueville;</hi> which resolution though it proved not so prejudicial as
the assaulting of St. <hi>Ia,</hi> yet it did no good; for being come to
<hi>Acqui,</hi> where they heard that Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> was come
from <hi>Bosco</hi> to oppose them, and to keep them from going to
<hi>Tortona,</hi> they haulted, waiting for an answer from Duke

<hi>Longueville</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> were not well pleased (as was

which proved every day more difficult; and therefore desired any just occasion
of quitting it with honour: They therefore were no sooner acquainted by

he sent some Forces from <hi>Pontecurone</hi> to strengthen it; he had also
sent Don <hi>Vincenza Gonzaga,</hi> with a body of Horse towards
<hi>Bosco,</hi> to fall upon the succour and munition which past from
<hi>Montferrat</hi> to the Enemies Camp; who when he was come to the place
intended, and heard that Colonel <hi>Mauzino</hi> was past over the
<hi>Scrivia,</hi> and that he was gone with some Troops of Horse to seek
forrage, went to meet him, and lighting upon him at <hi>Bazzaluzza,</hi> gave
order to assault him; which Don <hi>Diego di Villaroi,</hi> Captain of the
Horse, who marched in the Van, presently did. And the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our coming after
with the rest, a fierce skirmish ensued, wherein many of those that were
assaulted were slain, many fled, and many were taken prisoners; amongst which
Colonel <hi>Manzino</hi> himself, with many Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers and Souldiers, to the
number of two hundred; few of the Assail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants were slain; but Don <hi>Carlo
Caracciola</hi> a Captain of Horse, whilst he was fighting valiantly according
to his custom, was shot in the head by a Carabine, and kill'd. The Castle of
<hi>Tortona,</hi> this mean while, was streightly besieged, and the besiegers
being falne into the ditch, and got to the wall, fell to make Mines, and the
workmen were very much <pb n="779" facs="tcp:53250:397"/> prest by the Commanders, fearing
lest being much lessen'd in men, &amp; despairing of succor from
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> by reason of opposition made by <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> they
should be forced to give over the enterprize; and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Winter,
against which they had no defence, made them des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the more; another no
small inconvenience befel them by <hi>Serra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valle</hi> Garrison, which fell by
night upon the neerest and greatest of the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>s which furnish'd the Camp with Grist; and though they were play'd
upon by a neighbouring company of Musketiers, yet they at last wan the Mill,
and slew all the Musquetiers, set fire upon the Mill, and retreated with little
loss to <hi>Serravalle;</hi> the strong defence which was made by the
Defendants made the taking of the Town be much doubted; and the Governour not
being able to make the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my remove, did what he could to incommodate them by
keeping away succour, by turning the water from their Mills, by sending in
slender succours secretly to the besieged, that they might hold out the longer;
hoping in what the Enemy feared, that the approaching Winter which began to be
very bitter, it being now the midst of <hi>Novemb.</hi> would keep the enemy
from working: but the besiegers diligence did much ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the stealing in of
succour into the Castle; so as though some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was stoln in, yet being
discovered by the Scouts they were forced to fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e; at last, the Mines being ready to play, the enemy
were wished to yield before fire should be given to them: who returned no
answer, but that they expected commands from <hi>Spain;</hi> fire was therefore
given to the Mines; some of which, particularly those which were towards the
City, wrought good effect; so as a strong assault be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, wherein many of
the assailants perished, they at last lodged in the breach which was made in
the Bulwark by the Mine: yet the Engeneer <hi>Prestino</hi>'s diligence rendred
that advantage vain; who cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed a defence of boords and rafters to be made,
which cut off the Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks on which the enemy were lodged from the Castle; and
the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants having munited that work on their side with a trench began to
stand man for man, and to fight the oppugners upon equal terms; which they
might the better do, for that the Mines on the outside the Castle did but
little hurt.</p>
            <p>Three hundred of the choicest Foot that were in the Spanish Camp
were at this time convoy'd into the Castle, conducted by Don <hi>Diego
Alvarado,</hi> Serjeant Major of the <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Brigade; by which
recruit the Defendants being encouraged, and furnish'd with ammunition, which
every one of those that came in brought in a Wallet ride about their necks,
sallyed stoutly out upon the enemy, and forced them to abandon the breach
whereon they were; the oppugners see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so good a succour got into the Castle
began to despair of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, gave over mining, which they saw did but
little good, fell to their batteries again, more out of rage, then out of any
good they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected thereby; but it so hapned, that as they had got but little
good by all their attempts which they had hitherto advisedly made; so by this,
from which they expected little or no advantage, the whose victor was
occasioned; for they made one shot against the Keep of the Castle, which beat
down part of it, and the ruines thereof fell upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the
victuals, contrary to all expectation; so as the Defendants 
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:53250:398"/> having lost all their victuals, nothing but surrender
was to be thought upon; thus forced by necessity they parlyed, which ended in a
surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der upon honorable conditions, having leave to carry away five piece of
Cannon; a thing not heard of upon the yielding up of places fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd with
greater store of Artillery; and it was also expresly cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted, that they
might have five days allowed them to expect if any relief or succour should be
sent them; which time being expired, and no relief appearing, they march'd out
in number above 1000 Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with Arms, Baggage, Colours Flying, Match
lighted, and with their five piece of Cannon, which served to trumpet forth
their valour, and they were attended to the Confines of <hi>Allessandria,</hi>
being very well received in all places, and much praised for the resolution
they had shewed during the whole Siege; <hi>Galleotti,</hi> in reward of the
great valiour he had shewed in defending the Castle, was made Camp-Master;
which honour he did not long enjoy; for he was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately slain not long
after with a Musket shot; the Spanish Garrison marching out, the French entred
on the 26 of <hi>November,</hi> which was the day of surrender; who found the
walls so torn and rent by the Mines and batteries, as not being easily able to
mend them, they made what shift they could to defend them, with fagots,
rafters, and other things; the Conquering Army retreated to the neighbouring
Towns, where having tarried some days, they at great rates got all the victuals
they could from the neighboring parts, wherewith they furnish'd the Castle, and
departed to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but were much wasted and consumed; and as they
marched through <hi>Monferrat,</hi> they were yet more lessened by the great
store of rain that fell, and by other sufferings; a good part of the Horse
being gone to the Confines of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> were strucken with a pannick
fear at the meet same that the Governour of <hi>Millain</hi> was with an Army
upon their backs; So as running directly away they light upon a path that led
to the <hi>Orba,</hi> a little rivulet, which being swoln by the fall of waters
ran very swiftly; those who came first to the water side, not being able to go
back (so fast were they followed by those that came after) were forced into the
water, where entangled amongst themselves, both the first and the last were
misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly drown'd; the foot fared no better for being dispers'd, some here,
some there, they were pilladg'd, and slain; the few that got to
<hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> were quartered in several quarters, and rallied; so as, were
it not for the getting of a deserted City, and a Castle which was half beaten
down, the business prov'd prejudicial to both sides, and reciprocally ruinous.
But it is true, that the taking of this City, and the recovery thereof by the
Spaniards, was the occasion of the Piedmonteses reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of many places which
the Spaniards had taken in the former Wars; which was no little advantage to
the French and Piedmonteses; for otherwise it would have been more troublesom
and chargeable for them to have done it: The Governour of <hi>Millain,</hi>
though he had done all that was possible for the preservation of the Castle
that was lost, so as the loss the eof could not be ascribed to any default of
his; yet being very much troubled that it should fall out in the time of his
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that that had befaln him which had not hapned to any of his
Predecessors, since the State of <hi>Millain</hi> was joyn'd to the Spanish 
<pb n="781" facs="tcp:53250:398"/> Empire, he was grievously vext, and being desirous to
repair so great a loss he minded nothing but how to recover it; he therefore
thought every hour a year till the Winter were over, that he might wipe away
that stain which he thought lay upon him for that loss; which he the rather
hoped to do by the death which befel in <hi>France</hi> to the Cardinal
<hi>Richlieu,</hi> whose Authority and Counsel, as they had kept the Enemies of
<hi>France</hi> in terror whilst he lived, so they ceasing with his death,
eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one thought that so excellent an Architect failing to the good
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and prosperous conduct of the Affairs of that Kingdom, they would
decline apace from that height to which they were brought whilst he lived. He
died about the end of <hi>November,</hi> in the year 42, of a natural death,
after a long and noisome or troublesome disease; he was very stiff for the
advancement of the Regal Sovereignty, as also of his own Authority; and this to
that degree, that so he might arrive at any thing which might advance either
the one or the other, he did not abhor doing any thing, though it were not clad
with honesty nor ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; so as he knew, better then any other, how to make
use of that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Iulius Caesar;</hi> That if reason were to be
violated, it were to be violated for reason of State; and therefore he was
termed by some the new <hi>Tiberius</hi> of our times: he rose to such
authority in the Court, and had so great a power over the Kings genius, as he
was to have many encounters, and to shock not only with the Princes and
Grandees of the Kingdom, and with the Queen Mother, but with the Kings only
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was then Heir to the Kingdom: insomuch as the Queen Mother not
able to tolerate such preeminence and authority, which did even out-do hers,
went out of the Kingdom, and would never return, unless the King would remove
the Cardinal; which the King not doing, she lived an exile from <hi>France</hi>
many years, and died in <hi>Cullen,</hi> a little before the Cardinal; whither,
having run through many Countries, she at last retired her self; and the
Brother, having gone several times out of <hi>France,</hi> for the same
Reasons, and severall times return'd, not able to bear with so great a
predominancy in the Cardinal, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired often against him; and how much the
Princes and Grandees of the Kingdom were distasted with this transcendent
authority, was shewn by frequent Conspiracies against it, and against the
Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Kingdom; not without danger sometimes to the Kings person.
The people also, and the Provinces of the Kingdom, not able to bear with the
many grievances which were laid upon them, for maintaining the immoderate
expences of War abroad, did often rebel; but all these Conspiracies and
Seditions did rather encrease, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his greatness, then any ways lessen
it; and the King himself was not able longer to endure it; because all the
Lords and Office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s of the Kingdom,
as well Gown-men, as those of the Sword, either dazled with the Cardinals so
great splendor, or attracted by hopes of favour, or drawn by fear of hatred and
revenge, which they saw they could not shun, followed the Cardinal, and did, as
it were, worship him; it was thought, that the last Conspiracy of the <hi>Grand
Escuyer de France</hi> was not plotted without the Kings tacite consent, as
being desirous to be rid of that over-shadower of his Regal Majesty; and though
the vanity of this opinion may be convinced by how easily the King might have
supprest <pb n="782" facs="tcp:53250:399"/> him, if he had listed, and by that the
Conspirators held intelligence with the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi> &amp; had been
promised assistance from thence; yet it is very certain that the King being
weary of such a Minister of State would, have been well enough contented to
have had his wings clipt, had not the managing of the great affairs which past
at the present through his hands made his service too necessary to his Majesty
at this time; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it was, the Cardinal died, if not in the greatest
voluntary and free favour of the King, which he had so abundantly enjoyed
before; yet in his forced and necessary favour, which did the more authorize
it; Forreign Princes also, who were Friends and Confederates with the Crown,
had no less reason to complain of his rigorous actions, then the French: he
having made them prove the acrimony of his genius, which was inclined by all
means to his Kings advancement and greatness, as if not fully, may, in some
sort, be comprehended by the context of this History; and yet all things
succeeded so prosperously both within and without the Kingdom, as that though
he entred into the conduct of publick affairs when they were sufficiently full
of trouble, variety of Religions, Factions and Contumacies, as well of the
Princes as People; and consequently in a tottering and dangerous condition, he
restored the Catholick Religion fully, and supprest Heresies, and restored the
Kingdom to perfect peace; won credit to Military Discipline; and re-ordered the
publick Government excellently well in order; he kept all Enemies not only out
of the Kingdom, but assaulted them vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously at their own homes: he did not
only secure the Confines of the Kingdom, but did much dilate them by the
acquisition of considerable Provinces; and finally, he rendred the name of
<hi>France</hi> glorious, and remarkable above all other Nations; he died full
of glory, and worthy to be honour'd for his singular service done unto the
Crown, with the glorious Title of 
<q> Pater Principis, &amp; Patriae.</q> Many attributed the
felicity of so many actions to his extraordinary good fortune; but because her
wonted inconstancy repugns such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual good success, we must needs confess,
that Cardinal <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s actions were not carried on by the will of
Fortune, but govern'd by a more then humane wisdom. The King, not without
reason, bewail'd the death of this great Minister of State; for he said well
who said, that the bounds of the Forces of the Kingdom consisted in the
Authority of his every where credited and feared Counsels; and doubtlesly, the
effects of so great a loss would soon have been felt, had not the same
Cardinals providence, whilst he was yet alive, repaired so imminent a danger,
by leaving a new successor to that Government which was like to be vacant after
his death; which was <hi>Iulius Mazzarini,</hi> whom we have often mentioned,
who being at the Kings intercession created Cardinal not long before; and
brought by the said <hi>Richlieu,</hi> whilst he was yet alive, into the
Government of the most important business of the Kingdom; which shewed that he
knew him to be the ablest man, and most capable of all others, to enter upon
the conduct of Publick Government; and therefore preferring the publick good
before his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conveniences, and before the interests of those that were
neerest <pb n="783" facs="tcp:53250:399"/> to him in blood and alliance, he propounded him
to the King for his successor, though he were a Forreigner, and an Italian by
birth; who after <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s death, having by the Kings good will,
taken the Reins of Publick Government into his hands, with fortunate presage,
and more fortunate success, gave proof that the Kingdom wanted not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
neither at home nor abroad, nor found it any change of Governour; so uniform do
the Affairs of the Kingdom run now, as they did before (as shall be said in its
proper place) and, if it may be lawful to say so, not onely equally well, but
advantagiously better.</p>
            <p>Two moneths after Cardinal <hi>Richleiu</hi>'s death, the
<hi>Conde Duca</hi> fell from his grace of being Favorite in the Court of
<hi>Spain;</hi> wherein he had continued for the space of 22 years in absolute
authority, but with uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal hatred: which hatred, added to the great
misfortunes with befel that crown under his conduct, was the occasion of his
fall; for the King, moved by the exclamations of so many people, who were
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented with the Government of this Favorite, and with the blame laid
upon his publick and private comportments, from whence they professed all their
disorders and misfortunes had proceeded, resolved at last to remove him; and
taking from him the management of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Affairs confined him to
<hi>Locches,</hi> not far from <hi>Madrid;</hi> but not long after he was
confined to <hi>Thoro,</hi> a City in old <hi>Castile,</hi> where after some
years he died. Truly it cannot be denied, but that this Gentleman was very
zealous of his Kings greatness, and was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily accurate in ordering
publick affairs, wherein, foregoing all Sports and Pastimes, he was very
assiduously diligent and careful. Moreover, he was not to be bribed; nothing in
him was vendible; he seemed wholly intent upon the Kings grandezza, and upon
the good Government of publick Affairs; but these excellent gifts were, I will
not say, corrupted with as many vices, but distemper'd by the excess of the
same vertues; for he, taking the advancement of the Kings and the Crowns
Prerogative to be the most refined Maxime, and the end of all good and perfect
Government, seemed so intent thereupon, as not at all minding the peoples
satisfaction or interest, he cared for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else: not knowing that the
peoples satisfaction is the true basis and surest founda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ion of Principality; and that no Empire that is
vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent is long lived; so as this, which he thought to be the true and perfect
Rule of Government, did degenerate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into manifest Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Hence
proceeded his immense desire of extinguishing the Liberty and Franchise which
the Spaniards call <hi>Fueros,</hi> by which the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Provinces of
<hi>Spain,</hi> under pretence of liberty and exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have always been
willingly obedient to the Crown of <hi>Castile;</hi> whereof they do boast
much, and have been always careful exactors: but this State-minister not caring
to distaste them in this which was the foundation of their ready and willing
obedience, as Vassals to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, endeavour'd to annul those their Customs
or <hi>Fueros,</hi> and to reduce the people of <hi>Spain</hi> into the form of
meer Provincials, absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as subjected to the Crown of <hi>Castile;</hi>
which did so embitter their very souls, as made them fall into rebellion. Many
have said, and it is generally believed, that this Minister of State did use
the Cataloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans <pb n="784" facs="tcp:53250:400"/> with all extremity of rigour, purposely
to make them rebel, to the end that upon that pretence he might deprive them of
all priviledges as guilty of High Treason, and reduce them to meer subjection,
till by his continual vexations he wrought his ends upon them, and gathered the
bitter fruits of his Tyrannic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<hi>Portugal,</hi> for their King; which when the <hi>Conde Duca</hi> heard of

               </gap>erwards to whip them soundly:
His Government was grown so hateful to the very Castilians themselves, as he
grew detested and abhor'd by them all; the Grandees of <hi>Spain</hi> being in
several sorts distasted and ill tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ed were not able to endure it, went volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily to the Court, and
retired themselves from their own juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, so as the King was almost
left solitary alone at Court; it was observed that the two greatest Princes of
Christendome were, at the same time, and by severall wayes, deprived of their
chiefest favorites, and almost rob'd of that lustre and splendor which Princes
use to receive from the numerous attendance of the greatest Personages of their
Kingdomes. One of them by the excellency of Vertue, which drew them after her
possessour, and with drew them from the King; the other, by the hatred which
all men bore to the Favourite, which made the great ones keep far from Court.
Wherefore when the Favorites fall was hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>d of, as the King re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

               </gap>rom the <hi>Escurialle</hi> to
the Court, he was met by ten Grandees a league before he came to
<hi>Madrid,</hi> which caused the King who had not for a long time before been
so attended, ask what the matter was, and if any strange accident had hapned at
<hi>Madrid?</hi> to which Don <hi>Melchior di Borgia</hi> answered, in all
their Names; that now the time was come wherein his Majesty should know the
true devotion which the Grandees <hi>Spain</hi> bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e to the Crown and to his person; and that if they had
not waited upon him formerly as they ought, it was out of those reasons which
were well known to his Majesty. Nor were they the Grandees onely that were
distasted with the grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ness of
the <hi>Conde Duca,</hi> but the Nobility and all other inferiour persons lived
dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contentedly, by reason of their hard usage; and those few who enjoy'd any
favour at Court came so hardly by it, as they thought it hardly thanks worthy.
So as the Fountains of Regal bounty being shut up, and those of hardship and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>igor only open, the publick
Government was become nothing but severity, which made men only not
dissatisfied, but mad and desperate; and though he were not ignorant of all
this, yet did he not alter his way of proceeding; but being sure that all this
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <pb n="785" facs="tcp:53250:400"/> for his being wholly intent upon the Kings
service, he did rejoyce and glory in it; and if the Castilians fell not into
rebellion, as did the Catalonians and Portugueses, or into conspiracies as did
the French, it must only be attributed to their great continency, and to their
obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious devotion towards their King, which made them, by a singular example
of Love and Loyalty, rather suffer the indiscretion and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled Will of the
State-Minister, then under pretence of reforming the publick Government venture
upon disturbing the publick Peace, to the prejudice of all men. All men, and
himself acknowledged that fortune crost all
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>his undertakings; and just as he
was far from favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other mens desires, so fortune appeared to delight in
thwarting his. But though it may be true that his unfortunate Genius had a
great part in ruining his designes, yet it cannot be denyed that much of his
mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages proceeded from his choice of those whom he deputed to work his
own and the publick ends; for he alwayes prefer'd his own confidents before
those that understood more then they; and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving himself and the Kingdom of
their worthy parts, he commonly committed the carriage of the most important
Affairs to the hands of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced men, as may be seen by some unfortunate
successes by us related. And so faulty was he herein, as having not long before
his fall, declared one <hi>Iuliano</hi> to be his natural Son, and Heir to his
County of <hi>Olivares,</hi> and Dukedom of St. <hi>Lucar,</hi> whom, as if he
had been born again, he called <hi>Henry</hi> by his Fathers name; and never
having made any the least account of this <hi>Iuliano</hi> before, had suffer'd
him to live a Vagabonds life in Taverns and Bawdy-houses, exposed to all those
miserable adventures to which men that are so given are subject, even till by
good fortune he had escaped an ignominious death, to which for enormous faults
he was adjudged by Law; this his declaring of his Son-ship was publickly
confirm'd by Regal Authority, to the loathing and detestation of all men, but
more particularly, to his neerest of Kin: Which hatred and detestation grew the
greater, for that this new <hi>Henry</hi> having gotten nothing by his formerly
led life but customs answerable thereunto, he had nothing in him of gentile or
handsome, but a rusticity of manners, and an incapability not only of what was
Lord-like, but even of what was civil, or like a Gentleman. To this his
Declaration that this <hi>Henry</hi> was his Son, was added the undoubted
succession of his Paternal Inheritance, which contain'd very large Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories
and Titles, deriving from the supream dignity of Grandee, together with an
infinity of riches. So as this new <hi>Henry</hi> was raised to the highest
pitch of greatness in <hi>Spain;</hi> and being desirous to match him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
he endeavoured to marry him to one of the prime Ladies of the Court, to the
Daughter of the Constable of <hi>Castille,</hi> a chief Lord of <hi>Spain,</hi>
who boasts himself to be descended from the race of five Kings; &amp; not being
able to effect his desire, by reason of the Constables detestation of the
match, not thinking that the immense wealth, nor the great titles honours,
which this new <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> had
accumulated, was a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent recompence for the sordidness of his past life,
and of his unhappy inclination, by which his blood and those that should
descend from him should be contaminated; which the <hi>Conde Duca</hi> pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ceiving, he got the King to command
the Constable to consent to the Marriage without <pb n="786" facs="tcp:53250:401"/> reply;
which the Constable would not give way unto, unless it were absolutely declared
in the Matrimonial Covenants, that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd thereunto by the Kings
Command. Nor did <hi>Olivares</hi> his vast ends and desires cease here, for he
was ambitious to introduce him into the management of the principal Affairs of
the Crown, albeit that his said sordidness, and the incapacity of his Genius
was unfit for any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment: So as at the very first step, he destined him to
be President of the <hi>Indies,</hi> removing the Count of <hi>Castriglio,</hi>
a worthy Gentleman, and meritorious State Minister, of much Power and Trust,
from that place. He aspired also to procure him the honour which the Spaniards
call <hi>Aio del Principe,</hi> to whom the Government of him that is to
suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, to be King of so many Kingdomes, and the instructing of him in noble
and generous Sciences, belongs. Thus he by degrees aimed at the making him his
Colleague, and to succeed him in his place of Favourite, which he could not
believe that himself should ever fore-go, no not when he was even upon his
downfall; an example very unlike to that of Cardinal <hi>Richlieu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Favourite being removed, the King would take the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Kingdom upon himself; which though all men were infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely glad of, yet
did not the change prove very happy, but the remedy came too late apply'd to
the malady with which it was already gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gren'd, and become almost
incurable.</p>
            <p>Let us now return to the Affairs of <hi>Italy,</hi> which we have
left off by so many digressions of Affairs in forreign Courts.
<hi>February,</hi> in the year 1643. was not well begun, when the Governour of
<hi>Millain</hi> march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>d into the
field with his Army, which consisted of 5000 Foot, and 1500 Horse, and going
out of <hi>Alessandria</hi> went to quarter in <hi>Figar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volo</hi> and
<hi>Bosco,</hi> and sent the Marquess of <hi>Caracena</hi> from thence, with
2000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, by <hi>Pozvolo,</hi> to possess himself of the
passes above <hi>Tortona;</hi> who coming before day to the <hi>Scrivia,</hi>
over against <hi>Tortona,</hi> advanced two files of Musketiers, whereby he
made himself Master of the Capuchins Covent, which stands a little without the
Gate that leads to <hi>Serravalle;</hi> the French not being aware of him, by
reason of the thick mist which kept them from discovering the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but
finding, when the mist was over, that the place was taken, they presently
endeavoured the recovery thereof, but in vain; for <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racena</hi> advancing
with 200 Horse, and with some Musketiers, drove them back into the City;
whither Don <hi>Iohn Vasques Coronado</hi> being come by the way of
<hi>Castelnuovo</hi> with the other 3000 Foot and 1500 Horse, he possess'd
himself of some houses neer the opposite Gate which looks towards
<hi>Millain;</hi> and not long after, the Governour came thither with his
Guards, and Don <hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga</hi> with the Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Horse: here
they called a Councel of Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>,
whither <hi>Caracena</hi> was called for from his quarter, which was on the
opposite side: in which councel they took not onely into consideration how they
were to carry on the enterprize, but whether they should begin it or no; in
both which points the Captains of the Army did disagree: but the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
desire prevailing, and for that they had already proceeded so far as there was
no away left to avoid it, all other considerations were laid aside; the rather
for that Marquess <hi>Caracena,</hi> opposing the difficulties 
<pb n="787" facs="tcp:53250:401"/> and delayes which were objected, touching only the
taking of the Town, cleared all that could be said, by assuring them that he
would give the City into their hands within less then two days. The quarters
were therefore disposed of; that of the Capuchins which was already taken was
assigned to <hi>Caracena,</hi> and to <hi>Vasques</hi> that on the opposite
side over against the Gate that leads to <hi>Millain,</hi> to which two Spanish
Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades were added. <hi>Caracena</hi> was also appointed to chuse a place for
bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; which being chosen he began to batter; and a great part of the Wall
being beaten down within two hours, the City capitulated. The Garrison which
was left in the City by <hi>Longueville,</hi> and Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi> were
fifteen hundred Foot; amongst which were many good Officers; Monsieur <hi>di
Frolenville,</hi> Governour of the City, commanded over them; a Gentleman well
experienced in Warre, who not finding himself able to defend the City with so
few men, abandoned it; and keeping the Covent of St. <hi>Dominico</hi> in his
hands, retreated into the Castle: four Batteries were immediately erected by
the Governour against this Covent; from which the defendants not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well
able to defend themselves, they tried to free themselves of that trouble by
sallies; in one of which the assailants had well nigh taken that station of St.
<hi>Eufemia,</hi> from whence the Covent was most annoid; but the frequent
sallies did not incommodate the opposers so much as the season. The Country was
laid desolate by the former Siege, from which no Forrage was to be had for
horse, for the space of twelve miles, and there was great scarcity of all
things necessary for humane life; and, moreover, the store of rain that fell,
and the earth being cover'd with Ice and Snow, hindred the making of provision;
and the excessive cold weather made the Souldiers unable to work; they seemed
to be more besieged by the season of the year, then the enemy was by them
besieged. The Governour had foreseen these difficulties, and had in a great
part provided against them, having made all things necessary be brought to the
neighbouring places, and brought them commodiously to the Camp by Mules, which
were provided on purpose; he shelter'd the Souldiers from the cold by store of
clothes which were already pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them; he had made great provision of
Hay and dry Straw for the Horses, of Bread and Ammunition for the Souldiers;
and what was wanting in these provisions was supplied by the constant suffering
of hardship, which could not last long. The Army was not a little comforted by
provisions of Victuals, and other things which they had from <hi>Novi,</hi>
from whence and from the State of <hi>Millain</hi> victuals were sent in more
abundance then formerly, as also from the State and City of <hi>Genoa;</hi>
which did much pacifie the anger of the Spanish Officers, who complain'd of the
Commonwealth, for not keeping the like as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance from the French Army the
year before; and served to let them see that the Commonwealths good will was
not lessen'd towards that Crown: Wherein the dexterity and discretion of
<hi>Gasparo Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zone,</hi> sent in Commission at that time thither from the
Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth did much good, who behaved himself to the satisfaction of all
parties, for the Spaniards were sufficiently provided with all things
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary from <hi>Novi;</hi> and the French were also the like upon many
occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which they had of stealing succour into the Castle; and upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny 
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:53250:402"/> other occurrences, they found the Commissary not averse
to their Interests. The Enterprise therefore (though with many and infinite
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties) was continued till a better season, which they might prosecute
more commodiously, according as the several inconveniences lessened; and this
the rather for that they were comforted in these their sufferings by being
certain that they should not be disturb'd by any considerable succours: they
knew that there were no Forces in <hi>Piedmont</hi> to draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the field;
and the last years Army (as hath been said) was almost quite extinguished; and
the same rigour of the season withstood bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of new supplies from
<hi>France,</hi> to boot with the urgent occasions of Wars in <hi>Catalonia,
Flanders</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> wherewith that Kingdom was opprest.
Moreover, the Governour judging that the Castle was not over-well provided with
Victuals, thought rather to take it by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine (after the first skirmishes and
batteries) then by the sword; and the defendants were of the like mind; who
being left by the Duke of <hi>Longuevllle,</hi> and by Prince <hi>Thomaso,</hi>
in great hopes of being relieved, and wanting Ammunition wherewith to maintain
fight they held it better to spare those few that yet were left, till such time
as the undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed succour should come; to the end that they then might assault
the besiegers on their backs, and facilitate the succourers approach to the
Castle; so as the Governour forbore batteries, and they forbore sallies. Thus a
kind of tacite truce and suspension of Arms seemed to be agreed upon between
them. The Governour when he first resolved upon this enterprise, though he
could not be disturb'd by new succours from without, for the aforesaid Reasons;
and therefore though he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the line of circumvolurion on the outside,
yet thinking it better at the present to streighten the Castle with Trenches,
so to keep them from sallying out, he gave over the line, and applied himself
wholly in muniting, and fortifying himself against the Castle: but he failed in
his account; for the Governours falling upon <hi>Tortona</hi> being known in
<hi>Piedmont</hi> and in <hi>France,</hi> both th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>se places resolved to prepare for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of that
place which they had gotten; wherefore they began to make ready a great and
gallant succour: Men and Moneys were sent by Sea and Land from <hi>France</hi>
for this enterprise; those which were sent by Sea landed in <hi>Oneglia,</hi>
that they might go from thence to <hi>Piedmont,</hi> where in a short time
there was a strong and well munited Army put together, which caused the
Governour to alter his mind, who thought that the Victory would consist chiefly
in keeping out succour; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he began to re assume the working of the
other line of circumvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution which was already commenc'd (as hath been said)
about the Walls of the City, which was full four miles in compass, and was
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>girt with Ditches, flanks, with Forts munited with Stoccadoes, and
Fortifications both within and without; the Work surrounded both the Castle and
the City, serving to keep the City from being ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ulted from without, and the Castle from relief, if any
should be brought: the outermost houses of the City towards the Castle were
well muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the Streets mouths which led unto the Castle were stop'd up
with earth, which served for a fence against the Castle on the inside; and not
content with all this diligence, and provision, the Governour strove to keep
succour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s far from the Castle as
he could. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <pb n="789" facs="tcp:53250:402"/> he sent 500 Horse towards the
Frontiers of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> not only that they might keep back the
succour which might come by <hi>Piedmont,</hi> but also that by laying the
Country waste, they might keep the relievers from accommodations, if they
should advance by that way; nor did these diligences prove vain, for Monsieur
<hi>Plessis Pralin,</hi> the King of <hi>France</hi> his Lieutenant General in
<hi>Piedmont,</hi> and the Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared together about the
midst of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 43, with 2500 Horse, and 5000 Foot, and
advanced to St. <hi>Salvadore,</hi> within five miles of <hi>Alessandria;</hi>
and Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> passing over the <hi>Dora</hi> with 1000 Horse, and
2000 Foot, threatned <hi>Novara,</hi> and the adjoyning parts; wherefore the
Governour, for the better security of those parts, had sent the Marquess
<hi>Caracena</hi> thither, with a good strength of Horse and some Foot, most
whereof were taken out of the meaner sort of people of that State, that he
might observe what way the Enemy went, and cross his designs; but the Prince
returning quickly to <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and joyning with the French and
Piedmontese Army, told them they must cast a Bridge over the <hi>Tanaro;</hi>
wherefore <hi>Caracena,</hi> by Orders from the Governour, went from the
<hi>Novarese</hi> to <hi>Alessandria,</hi> to open that way, and to keep the
Bridge from being cast over; but the Prince find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself opposed by
<hi>Caracena</hi> desisted from his design; and passing back over the
<hi>Poe</hi> at <hi>Cassalle,</hi> he went with the joynt forces towards
<hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestre</hi> and <hi>Vespolano,</hi> and <hi>Caracena</hi> went to
<hi>Mortara,</hi> where some skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes past between the Horse of either
party, in one whereof <hi>Cavagli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ere Aiazza</hi> being engaged with 150 Horse
was taken prisoner; but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racena</hi> fearing lest the Prince, to relieve
<hi>Tortona</hi> by diversion, might fall upon some Town in that
<hi>Marca,</hi> past back into the <hi>Lomelina</hi> and the <hi>Novarese,</hi>
in pursuit of the Prince, to oppose his proceedings in those enterprises,
whereunto he saw him most inclined. The Prince know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he was followed
and observed by strong Forces approached sometimes neer <hi>Novara,</hi>
sometimes neer <hi>Bremi,</hi> sometimes neer <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tara,</hi> as if he
intended to fall upon all, or some of these places; but durst not fasten upon
any: but fell to over-running the Country, where plundering and pillaging the
best things that were there, he much pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced the Inhabitants, and took away
much Corn and Cattle, which for the most part he sent to <hi>Cassalle.
Caracena</hi> being somewhat inferior in Forces, durst not face the Prince, who
having more men was master of the field, and seeming as if he would march along
the left side of the <hi>Poe</hi> to <hi>Giarvola,</hi> threatned to pass his
men over there to the other side; and so to go to the relief of the besieged
Castle; which the Governour having notice of, he got as many men as he could
from <hi>Serravalle,</hi> and other places, dissolving the quarter at
<hi>Pontecurone,</hi> and sent a great bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of men, with six pieces of
Artillery towards the shore over against <hi>Giarvola,</hi> to resist the
Prince, if he should venter to pass over the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: which the Prince
perceiving, he retreated again to <hi>Cassalle,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make way for
relief by the <hi>Tanaro:</hi> which the Governour doubting, he sent
<hi>Caracena</hi> and <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> with almost all the Horse, and between
three and four thousand Foot, to defend that River; wherefore the Prince
resolving not to venture upon that Pass, threw himself at last before
<hi>Asti,</hi> imagining that the Governour would either quit the Siege of the
Castle, and come with all his Forces to defend <hi>Asti,</hi> 
               <pb n="790" facs="tcp:53250:403"/> or else would not at all move from the Castle: if he
should not move he assured himself he should take <hi>Asti,</hi> by reason of
the weakness of the Garrison, and the Inhabitants inclination to love him; and
if he should move, he should certainly relieve the Castle, and City of
<hi>Tortona,</hi> and might peradventure take <hi>Asti</hi> also; there were
but 1000 Foot, and 200 Horse in <hi>Asti,</hi> under the command of Captain
<hi>Pietro Gonzales,</hi> a valiant Commander: the Governour fearing the loss
of that City, left a competent number of Souldiers before the Castle of
<hi>Tortona,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending the care of that Siege to Don <hi>Iovan
Vasques Coronado,</hi> went with the greatest part of his Forces into
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> that he might offer at relieving <hi>Asti</hi> at a
neerer distance; the Prince at his drawing neer that City endeavoured to steal
over the <hi>Tanaro;</hi> and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose having got a barque which served
to pass travellers over the river, and a Mill which was fitted to the Haven, he
by means of these past some Souldiers over to the Abbey of S.
<hi>Bartholomew;</hi> that they might raise a little Fort to guard that shore,
where he left four Companies in Garrison: the Governour having notice thereof
sent Don <hi>Vincenzo Gon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaga</hi> that way with 3000 Foot, and 200 Horse; who
when he came to the Abbey slew some of the Defendants, and drove other some
away, took and destroy'd the Fort, and made himself master of the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>que, and of the Mill; and the next day
the Governour came to the same Abbey, and clim'd up a hill together with the
same <hi>Gonzaga,</hi> and the Marquess of <hi>Caracena,</hi> and
<hi>Serra,</hi> from whence he discovered the City, and the Prince incamp'd
before it; and having by the consent of his companions sent 400 Horse over the
Foord of <hi>Tanaro,</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Asti,</hi> giving the Captain express
order, that as he went towards the Foord he should observe what signs should be
given him from the hill; and perceiving that the Prince marched with all his
horse to withstand their passage over the Foord, the Governour made signs
immediately to the Captain of the Horse, that he should retreat, who obeyed
him; the Governour by this unfortunate attempt lost all hopes of relieving the
Town; and not daring to forgo <hi>Tortona,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was so much
concern'd, for the preservation of <hi>Asti,</hi> which he could not possibly
effect without coming to a battle; which <hi>Gonzales</hi> foreseeing, or as
some others say, being advised by the Governour so to do; and finding it
impossible for him to defend so great a circuit of Wall with so few men, after
some shot was made, he agreed with the Prince to abandon the City, retaining
the Cattle, and the Citadel, so as 200 Horse which he had with him might be
suffer'd to pass safely into <hi>Alessandria;</hi> which being agreed upon, and
performed, the City came into the Prince his power, who presently fell to make
Mines un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Castle, and Citadel; so as the Castle being play'd upon by the
Artillery, and molested by Mines, and some assaults, which were vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly
withstood, surrendred after three days space, upon condition that
<hi>Gonzales</hi> might go with 200 men which he had with him into the
Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel; whereupon the Prince got the Castle, and fell to besiege the Citadel,
which not being able to hold out for want of Victuals did ere long sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ender upon honourable conditions, by which
<hi>Geonalea</hi> with the Garrison went safe into the City of
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> and the Prince by the full victory of that City became
also master of the <hi>Tanaro;</hi> the <pb n="791" facs="tcp:53250:403"/> Governour
foreseeing that <hi>Asti</hi> being taken the Prince would present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall to
relieve <hi>Tortona,</hi> and to that purpose that he began to send quantity of
provision into <hi>Nizza,</hi> and <hi>Asti,</hi> ordered Marquess
<hi>Cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cena</hi> to go with Horse and Foot to the taking in of
<hi>Acqui:</hi> whereunto <hi>Caracena</hi> thinking that it was needless to
use Cannon by reason of a breach that was in the wall, which though it were
fil'd up with earth and bavins, he went to give an assault on that part: but
not being able to force it, he tarried there till Cannon were brought from the
City of <hi>Alessandria,</hi> which as soon as the Citizens saw they
surrendered <hi>Acqui,</hi> their lives being saved, the womens honours
preserved, and respect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing born to Churches: that the Citizens might suffer
less prejudice, onely the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were suffer'd to enter, who sent
much of the meal that they found there into <hi>Annone,</hi> and much whereof
during the Siege was carried into the Castle: about which <hi>Caracena</hi> not
willing to busie himself, especially since he had sent back the Cannon into
<hi>Alessandria,</hi> he sent Colonel <hi>Stoz</hi> with great part of his men,
to oppose a body of Horse which was sent by <hi>Plessis,</hi> and
<hi>Villa,</hi> to relieve the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged place; which relief being repulss'd by
<hi>Stoz, Caracena</hi> past on to <hi>Rivalta</hi> in <hi>Montferrate,</hi>
where he fell to lay the country waste, as well to feed his Horse with the
unripe corn, as to incommodiate the succorers in their march, as much as he
could: 800 <hi>Neapolitan</hi> Horse were at this time come unto the camp,
which the Governour sent to <hi>Pozzvolo,</hi> and the parts adjacent, that
they might keep off whosoever should come to relieve the place besieged: he
moreover caused deep ditches to be digg'd about the line of circomvolution,
and, finally, om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not any thing that was necessary for the obtaining of
the victory, which he so much desired. Souldiers came also daily to within the
line from the States Militia, and many Millainese Lords, amongst which Prince
<hi>Trivultio,</hi> who in the siege the year before came to the camp with 1500
Foot and 200 Horse, all of them being his own <hi>Vassals,</hi> and at his own
charge conducted; and not at all wearied with so great an expence, he was one
of the first that came now to the recovery of the lost City: Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> came also with so numerous a succour, as was thought could not
be withstood; and foording over the <hi>Scrivia</hi> four Miles beneath
<hi>Tortona,</hi> he came to within four Miles of the City; and kept his men in
the Towns of <hi>Alvernca,</hi> and <hi>Castellari,</hi> which are at the Foot
of the hill; the next day being accompanied by Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> he went
up the hill with four hundred Horse, to discover the most convenient stations,
which when he had done, he caused his men to come up the hill with the
Artillery, and placed them in Ranks, together with the Artillery against the
Line, and made as if he would presently fall to an assault, but did not; the
Spanish Army was ran ked on the other side, with in the Line, with their
Artillery, ready to receive and repulse the threatened assault, but resolved
not to stir out, nor to forgo their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nor to hazard that victory
which they thought they were sure of as long as they kept within the

                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>renches; at last after four days,
the Prince drew off, and foregoing the thought of relieving the City, and
conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the victory which he had so much striven for, he came down the
hill on the same side that he had come up, making his Rere his Van, &amp; his
van his rere; being come upon the plain, he made some shot towards the 
<pb n="792" facs="tcp:53250:404"/> Castle, which served for a sign to the Desendants to
wish them to surrender; which they did the same day upon Honourable
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, of carrying with them four pieces of Cannon; they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to
the number of 1300, and were convoy'd to <hi>Rivatella</hi> whither the Prince
was retreated. The Prince retreated some days after towards <hi>Asti,</hi> and

               </gap>e yet held by the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and to joyn with other Forces
which the Dowager then raised to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her own Towns: for when she saw
Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> gone with the Army to relieve <hi>Tortona,</hi> she
gathering together all those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained to defend <hi>Piedmont,</hi> sent
them under Count <hi>Broglio,</hi> together with her own guards, and those of
her Sons, to recover <hi>Villa nova;</hi> which was reinforced, by orders from
the Governour, by two hundred Horse, which were sent thither from
<hi>Trino</hi> and <hi>Pontestura,</hi> as soon as he discovered the Dowagers
intentions: so as it seemed to be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently secured; wherefore the Dowager,
as soon as the Prince was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd with the Army from <hi>Tortona,</hi> sent
Marquess <hi>Villa</hi> thither with his own Cavalry onely, to keep the French
from concurring in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; <hi>Villa</hi> when he was come to the camp
weighed the condition of the place, which being seated in a plain, far from any
woods, from whence onely he could have bavins to make Trenches, that place
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared untakable; being therefore content to besiege it at a distance, he
imploy'd himself in keeping out succour, and in laying the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey waste, so
to bring the Towns-men to surrender; and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Town coming
within a few days to Parly, the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render was agreed upon, on condition that
the Articles should be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of by the Governour of <hi>Millain;</hi> and
being commanded by the Governour to make good the Town, for that he would come
quickly to relieve him, the treaty broke, and the siege continued; during which
time the French Army was recruited with new men brought by the Viscount
<hi>Turin;</hi> so as those being added to the Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agers men, the Army was made
15000 Foot, and 5000 Horse. Prince <hi>Thomaso</hi> was to command them all,
for <hi>Longueville</hi> was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready returned to <hi>France;</hi> wherefore
the Prince, hearing that for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain there wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>es considered,
thought it not fit to let slip the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of making himself master of
that City either by Scalado, secret intelligence, or by storm; for he thought
his Forces so far superiour to the Garrison, as he should meet with no
resistance; and hoping that when he should have taken it, it being almost upon
the confines of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he might keep it more easily then
<hi>Tortona,</hi> which was far from thence, he joyned his Forces to those of
<hi>France,</hi> and of the Dowagers, in the plain of <hi>Cassalle,</hi> and
betook himself to <pb n="793" facs="tcp:53250:404"/> the enterprize with firm opinion of
good success; being come to the Walls of <hi>Allessandria,</hi> he quartered
himself in the Orchard neer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, on both sides of the <hi>Tanaro,</hi>
and sent Viscount <hi>Turen</hi> to take up his quarters on the East side.</p>

wherefore he went from <hi>Pavia</hi> where he then was thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ward, giving
order to his men to follow him: But having heard before he came to
<hi>Valenza,</hi> that the Prince was gone with all his Forces to before
<hi>Allessandria</hi> he was much more surprised, by reason of the small
Garrison which he knew was in it; wherefore he sent for Count <hi>Galliazzo
Trotti</hi> and ordered him that he should endeavour by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to
get quickly into <hi>Allessandria</hi> with all the Horse that he could muster.
<hi>Trotti</hi> failed not in obeying his orders, and having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together
about 1500 Horse, went about it, he knew that it was not safe to enter by the
Gate which was nearest <hi>Valenza,</hi> because the Prince was incamp'd before
it; he therefore resolved to enter by the Gate which looks towards
<hi>Genoa,</hi> on the opposite side. But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Count <hi>Turen,</hi> who
he knew was incamp'd on that side, he marched towards <hi>Tortona,</hi> seeming
as if he went to guard that City; and when he was advanced so far by that way
as none could observe him, he returned on the right hand and went towards
<hi>Castellazzo,</hi> where he past over the <hi>Bormio,</hi> and deceived
<hi>Turen,</hi> who conceiving that

entred with so great are inforcement, Don <hi>Antonio Sottello,</hi> Governour
of the City, being as it were revived from the dead, went out and fell upon the
Prince his quarters, where there hapned a long and bloody skirmish, which
continued till the coming on of night; when the Prince finding for certain that
so great a succour was entred, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently failing of his hopes, thought
it best to make use of the obscurity of night, and to retreat; so the City of
<hi>Allessandria</hi> was miraculously free'd. Count <hi>Siruela</hi> ended his
Government honourably with the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of <hi>Tortona,</hi> and the freeing
of <hi>Allessandria</hi> from so neer and so immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger, who was

               <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la;</hi> not without some imputation to the Governour of the Town, who 
<pb n="794" facs="tcp:53250:405"/> being cited to <hi>Millain</hi> to give an account of
3000 sacks of Corn, which together with the Town were delivered to him, by
which he might have maintained the Town longer, he durst never appear;
wherefore he was thought guilty of fraud in delivering up the Town: This loss
was ere long followed by the like of <hi>Trino;</hi> for Prince
<hi>Thomaso</hi> retreating from <hi>Allessandria</hi> to <hi>Cassalle,</hi>
after having stay'd a while in those parts, causing no little jealousie in the
Towns of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Piedmont,</hi> he
at last sat down before <hi>Trino,</hi> the Garrison where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he knew was
lessened a little before by the new Governour. But having quartered his men at
his first arrival in the neighbouring Towns, and keeping as it were idle for
three dayes, he gave occasion for the entring of two succours; the one of two
Companies of Horse, and one of Foot from <hi>Vercelli,</hi> the other of 300
Dragoons from <hi>Bremi;</hi> so as the Prince beginning to believe that if
more relief should be suffer'd to enter, the enterprise which he thought would
have been easie would prove otherwise, he began to begirt the Town at a nearer
distance, and drew his line round about it; and whilst this was in doing, the
oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers advanced by a covered way to a half moon, who being repuls'd by a
fierce sally made by the Governour <hi>Batteville,</hi> were forced to retreat
a little with much loss: But the line being afterwards perfected, the Prince,
with his Brother Don <hi>Mauritio,</hi> and Viscount <hi>Turen,</hi> divided
the out-fortification between them, and fell to take the half moon; which when
they had taken, they betook themselves to the Cities Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, and made a great
mine underneath it, which made a great breach, by which the Prince did verily
believe he should enter the City. Wherefore before he came to an assault, he
intimated to <hi>Batteville,</hi> that he would have him surrender; which
<hi>Batteville</hi> refusing to do, a fierce assault was made, which being
thrice given was thrice repuls'd with loss to the Assailants. But the Prince
preparing for another assault, <hi>Batteville</hi> who found his Munition grow
low, his men weary by their long pains taking, by their continual watching, and
not able to make any longer defence, surrendred upon honourable conditions, in
case he should not be relieved within five dayes: Which being expired, and no
relief appearing, he march'd with his men out of the Town, which was delivered
over to the Prince, and furnished with a French Garrison, as were all the other
Towns of <hi>Piedmont</hi> which were regain'd. The Prince went from
<hi>Trino</hi> with his Army much lessened, by the running away, sickne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, and death of many, occasion'd by the
badness of that ayre, the malignity whereof had influence not onely upon the
meaner sort, but upon the chief Commanders; for <hi>Turen,</hi> Marquess
<hi>Villa,</hi> and his Son Count <hi>Camerano,</hi> fell sick, and were forc'd
to return for cure to <hi>Turin.</hi> Nor did the Prince himself scape free,
for falling sick of a Fever he tarried many dayes in <hi>Inurea,</hi> so as the
care and government of the Army fell to Monsieur <hi>Plessis Pralin,</hi> who
being recruited with more men from <hi>France</hi> sat down before
<hi>Pontestura;</hi> where meeting with no resistance save only some sallies
which the Garrison made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his quarters, he proceeded slowly in the siege;
but having afterwards gotten into the Town by a breach made by Cannon, &amp;
taken it, he soon a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ter took the
Castle (upon conditions of fair war) whereinto the Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was retreated;
which Castle was afterwards demolish'd by the French <pb n="795" facs="tcp:53250:405"/>
that they might not be forced to munite it, (as would have been requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site)
with a good Garrison.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Spaniards lose the Towns in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> which
they had gotten with much effusion of blood, and expence of moneys, hoping to
make themselves thereby sole Arbitrators of that State, and to keep the French
out of the State of <hi>Millain:</hi> But by the misfortune of the Affairs of
that Crown, they failed in these designs; for the Forces which were sent
thither from <hi>Spain,</hi> having occasioned the coming of the French
thither, the Spaniards saw the French not only possest of many Towns, and even
of the Castle of <hi>Turin,</hi> but of those which were taken by the
Spaniards, and which they recove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Spaniards saw the French become Arbitrators of <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> and saw them come even to the Confines of the State of
<hi>Millain.</hi> The new Governour finding his Forces too weak to make
resistance minded more the defence of the State of <hi>Millain,</hi> then the
maintaining of what the Spaniards had gotten in <hi>Piedmont;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he gave himself wholly to view the Forts, to furnish them with all things
necessary, and to re-enforce them with strong Garrisons, in case they should be
assaulted, as he feared they would be; there rema<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="796" facs="tcp:53250:406"/> having kept her Gates lock'd one
whole day; about two a clock at night, sent out 1500 Horse, under Don
<hi>Vincenzo Gonzaga,</hi> and two Foot Brigades: the one of <hi>Fra. Iovanni
Pallavicino</hi>'s, the other of Don <hi>Gregorio Britto. Gonzaga</hi> was to
take the City of <hi>Asti,</hi> and <hi>Pallavicino</hi> and <hi>Britto</hi>
the Citadel; <hi>Gonzaga</hi> failed of his intent; but <hi>Pallavicino</hi>
and <hi>Britto</hi> fared better; for coming by night to the Citadel, they
as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted it at unawares, and took it before the Garrison, which was but weak,
were well awake. The Dowager and the Prince, hearing of this so sudden and so
unexpected success, sent both of them speedily to repair it. The Dowager, with
fortunate speed, sent the Companies of her guard and of her Sons, commanded by
the Counts of <hi>Aglie, Feusasco, Piusasco</hi> and <hi>Tana,</hi> who coming
hastily to the City with their Souldiers, which were 300 Horse, and some Foot
which they took up in their march, entred the City in sight of the Enemy who
having taken the Citadel meant to take the City, which they easily might have
done, had not the Citizens and the Garrison, who were encouraged by this
recruit, put themselves in a posture of safety, not fearing to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered,
as they had hourly reason to doubt before; they therefore breathed a while,
expecting the Prince his coming; who not being able to march so fast, by reason
of the number of men which he brought with him to relieve the languishing City,
came thither just then when the Enemy, by reason of his appearance, thought it
good to draw off from the City, to the necessary defence of the Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del. The
Prince having reduced the City to her former condition of safety, did so munite
it, as that it was not only able to defend it self, but to threaten the
Citadel; and retreating to <hi>Camerano</hi> he gave himself to impede any
attempt which might be made by the Spaniards, who notwithstanding conveyed both
men and munition into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tadel, which were sent them from the Governour,
who was come into <hi>Alessandria:</hi> but the Siege of St. <hi>Ia,</hi>
although somewhat disturb'd by this accident, was not given over; for the
Prince having substituted the Governour of <hi>Cassalle, Covogne,</hi> in his
place, it was strongly conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued; the Town was much plaid upon by batteries,
and sallies stoutly repuls'd; insomuch as Don <hi>Diego Alverado,</hi> who was
Governour of the Town, having made honourable resistance, when he saw the Town
was no longer to be maintain'd, surrendred it upon honourable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The
Prince having rid his hands of this business, betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self wholly to the
recovery of the Citadel of <hi>Asti,</hi> which being besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and batter'd
in vain, held out, and did not only annoy the besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with their great and
small shot, but even the City it self; but not being able to do any more, it
yielded to the Prince; who, since the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants had suffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ed themselves to be reduced to the
utmost extremity, would not receive them, but upon discretion; which he used,
notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, very modestly, suffering the common sort to go forth
friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and detaining their Captains and Officers only till such time as two
piece of Cannon, which were drawn out of the Citadel, were restored by the
Governour, and some prisoners of War that were in his hands. The City and
Citadel of <hi>Asti</hi> being freed, the Prince went with some 5000 Foot into
the <hi>Langhe;</hi> and having left Marquess <hi>Villa,</hi> with the Dowagers
Horse, for a relief on his back, he advanced to the Ligustick 
<pb n="797" facs="tcp:53250:406"/> Sea, even neer to <hi>Finale,</hi> intending to fall
upon that Marquisate both by land and sea, when the French Fleet should be come
from <hi>Catalog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> to <hi>Provence,</hi> and to make himself master of
it; and the Prince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already come to the Gates of the Town was lodged in
the Church called <hi>Pia,</hi> within Musket-shot of <hi>Finale,</hi> and had
taken up some other convenient quarters. The Garrison was but weak in
<hi>Finale,</hi> a good part thereof being sent two days before by Don <hi>Iohn
di Castro,</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of that Marquisate, to defend <hi>Cingio,</hi>
fearing lest the Prince should assault it; and it wanted provision of bread,
but both these wants were supplied by <hi>Genova</hi> the Spanish Embassadour:
victuals were sent thither by Sea, and the Governour sent <hi>Fra. Iovanni
Pallavicino</hi> with 1300 Foot from <hi>Millain,</hi> who with no less speed
and fortune then he had done at <hi>Arona,</hi> past over the Mountains neer
<hi>Genoa,</hi> and being come to <hi>Voltri</hi> went by the sea side to
<hi>Finale,</hi> where he entred with his men before the face of the Enemy. The
Prince had not brought vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals with him to feed his men in that barren
Country, for he expected to be furnished therewith by the French Fleet; which
not appearing, the Prince seeing the Town well recruited and provided, himself
and his men in great scarcity of victuals, and hearing that the Militia
gathered together apace round about, knew he could not tarry there without much
danger; wherefore he gave over the enterprise, and retreated into
<hi>Montferrat,</hi> freeing that Marquisate from the danger it would have
fallen into, had the Prince tarried therebut one day longer; for the very next
day after his departure the Fleet appeared at Sea; which hearing that the
Prince was gone towards <hi>Montferrat,</hi> return'd also to
<hi>Provence,</hi> from whence it was come.</p>
            <p>This being the last thing that was done by the Spaniards, French
and Piedmonteses, in the year 1644<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (for the Armies were sent to their
Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Quarters, after this business of <hi>Finale;)</hi> We will end this our
se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part: and in the third, will treat of the Wars which were raised
elsewhere, between the Pope, on the one side, and the Commonwealth of
<hi>Venice,</hi> the great Duke of <hi>Tuscany,</hi> the Dukes of
<hi>Modena</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> on the other side; which having hapned at
the same time that these by us related did, we, that we might not confound
order in the Affairs of the two first Books, have reserved for the following
part; where looking back they shall be related and pursued with all truth and
sincerity.</p>
