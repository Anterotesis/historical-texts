            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Here you may be satisfied by evident Demonstration, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stanced in the Lives and Deaths of these men, of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Vertue and Vice; that they are not empty Names, or significant Nothings, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heaven has interposed as a party, not suffering any of them to go out of this World</hi>

But <hi>Lycaon</hi> for all that, commanded him to fall to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and see what the event would be; and at the same time draws out of his pocket a little Manual, and falls on his knees, constraining the Country-man to do the like: but he knew not what to infer from these mysteries, and would willingly have been in another place to make his Orisons; for his devotion was much abated by his fear: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing he was forced to kneel down and wait the issue of this pious adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Lycaon</hi> had mumbled three or four words betwixt his teeth, feigning an extraordinary devotion, he enquires of the Country-man how it fared with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57596:10"/>
him, telling him withal, that Heaven was not ungrateful to the pious addres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of devout Petitioners; wherefore he bid him feel in his pockets, that they might see what God had sent him; which the Country-man did, but could finde nothing: upon which <hi>Lycaon</hi> fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in his own pockets, pulls out Five pence, telling him withal, that for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain he prayed not heartily, that 'twas expedient for him that he prayed again; shewing him, that if he looked directly towards Heaven, he needed not fear, nay it could not be otherwise but he must get something as well as he: whereupon he pulls again out of his pocket Ten pence, and still the other could not finde any thing in his; and was rather for praying that there might not be any thing found there, than that there should. To make short, <hi>Lycaon</hi> fell to prayers again the third time, and produced a Five-shilling-piece; and seeing that the Country-man was still upon the negative, he told him, That

Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>Lycaon</hi> dealt with him better than he expected, returning him the one half of his money with these words back again: <hi>What!</hi> saith he, <hi>you would have cheated me, and would not let me</hi>

                  <hi>share with you (though your Companion.) Is this the compact? this the agreement we made before we set to prayers? Good Lord, how few are the just upon the earth! And yet notwithstanding this thy churlish humour, I will not be as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful as thou art, for look you, here is half of what Heaven hath sent me; wherefore you have no reason to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain: now indeed you might, if I shared with you in your acquisition, and not you with me.</hi> And so the poor Country-man was pleasantly wheedled out of his money: for <hi>Lycaon</hi> robbed a man of two or three hundred crowns as if it were really a sport or pastime, so small a sum was that with him.</p>
               <p>As soon as ever there was any Fair, though never so far off, he was sure to be at it in disguise, that he might with less suspition observe the business of each person there concerned, to the end that at their return homewards he might set upon them.</p>
               <p>But as he skulked up and down with

them were taken Prisoners; from whom having taken their Livery-coats, they hang'd them on several Trees in the most solitary places of the Forest, their Habits serving afterwards to execute sundry Villanies.</p>
               <p>For going one night to a Castle not far off the Forest, he commanded the gates in the Kings name to be set open to him, saying, for a pretence, That <hi>Lycaon</hi> and his Companions had hid themselves there; which Order was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed without the least suspition of what happened afterwards. <hi>Lycaon</hi> made as if he would search every where for Thieves, bustling in all corners of the house with the greatest eagerness ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; but at last he would needs have it that the Thieves were hid in the Trunks: wherefore he caused the keys without any more ado to be brought him, and having loaded himself and Companions with every thing of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable value, he returns with his Booty to the Forest.</p>

In the mean time the Lord of the Castle findes himself not a little moved with just indignation, that he should be thus robbed, thinking that the Provosts men, under pretence of looking for Thieves, had thus pillaged his Castle: Whereupon he makes his Address to the Parliament of <hi>Roan,</hi> giving them an account by whom he thought himself thus robbed; who presently gave order for the examination of the Provosts Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, and being put on the Rack, the torments thereof made them confess that whereof they were never guilty: so that there was one of them hanged, to see what effects that would work on the rest.</p>
               <p>The Provost of <hi>Roan</hi> being justly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed against <hi>Lycaon,</hi> as well for this as other his villanies, resolved to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged at any rate: which <hi>Lycaon</hi> having got notice of, caused his men to retreat into the Forest of <hi>Machecou,</hi> the usual place of their Rendezvouz. He in the mean time staid alone there,

where he was informed they would attack him, having notice likewise of the very hour when they would give their intended Onset; which fell out punctually according to his expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Wherefore seeing them, he makes up towards them in the habit of a Peasant, mounted upon a most piteous beast, and who to look on was not worth two pence, without either bridle or saddle, having onely a Sack under him, and a great greazie Hat on. And thus accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred he meets the Provost, who deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him whence he came, and what he had seen. He made answer, That for his, part he met nobody; but told him, there was great talk of robbing, and especially of one call'd <hi>Lycaon,</hi> a very naughty fellow, and one who did much mischief to the Country.

And as he had a notable way with him to conceal his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, so he trapt these strangers with such specious pretences, that it was impossible for them to take him for any other than the best-natured man living.

planted expressly by him, who took from him his Cloak first, to take away all suspition; and in the morning he was sure to have it again, and with it the greatest share in the Booty.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he would carry six or seven of those strangers to the Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, where he would pay for them; but then he failed not to place them among his Accomplices, whom he had on purpose sent there before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, who never let them go till they had pickt their pockets.

               <p>These were some of the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions he made use of: for should we relate them all, they would be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

               <p>Having heard one day that there was some persons to be executed at <hi>La Greve,</hi> the apprehension which he had lest there should be some of his Companions amongst them, made him hasten thither; where amongst the erowd he singles out a young man, well clad, and of a good mein, named <hi>Florizard,</hi> and enquiring of him what one of the Prisoners had done, whom he pointed out, <hi>He hath killed,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered <hi>Florizard, my Lord</hi> D'Alize, <hi>a man of great esteem at Court, as well for his birth as excellent qualities; and the common report is, that he went even to his bed and there stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled him.</hi> At which words <hi>Arpalin</hi> smiling cri'd out, that <hi>he was a silly Rascal to suffer himself to be taken.

In saying which, they both walk out of the Crowd, and <hi>Florizard</hi> carries his new Acquaintance to a Tavern where he

was used to frequent; and there ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving conveniently seated themselves and drank a round or two, offers him, on the part of his Master, a Person of Quality, Five hundred Guineys, if he would undertake to murther an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient man, whom he named to him. <hi>Arpalin</hi> likes his proposals, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises him his man dead at midnight: Upon which promise <hi>Florizard</hi> gives him One hundred pieces in earnest, with a promise of the rest when he had done his work. They part thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>Arpalin</hi> goes immediately to one of his Comrades, named <hi>le Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fré,</hi> a man full of wicked resolutions, and ready at all times to execute the most horrid villanies; to whom he communicates his designe and Fifty pieces, half of that which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and agree together concerning the manner of the Murther. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at Eleven a clock in the night they go to the ancient man's house, and finding the gates shut, they with their

Betties and other Instruments got them open and entered, and having with them a Dark-lanthorn, they go softly up stairs, and finding the old man a bed, they most inhumanely murther him: Which having done, they put him in a Sack and carry him, each of them by turns, directly to the place where <hi>Florizard</hi> had appointed them. And having received the rest of the money, they together dig a hole and throw the Corpse in it: Which they had no sooner done, but these two wretches, fearing least <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizard</hi> should at some time or other discover them, fell upon him likewise and killed him, throwing him in the same hole with the other. And at the same time <hi>Arpalin,</hi> whether begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to mistrust <hi>Balafré,</hi> or being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And the Discipline and Trial which he put them upon who thus came to him, is not the least considerable: for he was wont to lock them up for two days together in a Chamber, without ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eating or drinking; and to make them lie out three or four nights bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the open air, that he might the better know who were fit for his purpose.</p>
               <p>One Winter-night, when the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was so unpleasant, by reason of Fogs, Hail, and Snow, that no body cared to stir out of their Lodgings, he divided his Crew into three Bands, and

               <p>It happened, that being one day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone neer the Citie of <hi>Mans,</hi> walking in the Fields thereabouts whilst hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Companions were gone to visit the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57596:36"/>
neighbouring Fairs, he entred at night into an Inne, where no body, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering his Garb and Mein, would have taken him for what he was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing excellently well mounted, and in all things like a Gentleman. Now it chanced that the Provost of <hi>Mans</hi> and his men having heard that he vaulted thereabouts, were set out on purpose to try if they could take him; but forasmuch as none of them had ever seen his face, it was impossible for them to know him. Being in the Inne, he enquires of the Inne-keeper what Guests he had; who returns an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that there was onely one Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Whereupon he bids the Host ask them whether they would not think it troublesome for him to sup with them: to whom the Provost return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed answer, That he should take it as a great favour if the Gentleman would be pleased to honour him with his company. Whereupon <hi>la Chénay</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being receiv'd with all the respect
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57596:37"/>
imaginable. To make short of it, they seat themselves, and he telleth how he returned from the Army, and that his Lacqueys, being not able to keep pace with him, were left behinde at a Village, which he named, not far from thence. They entertain one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother with several Discourses, as well what had passed at <hi>Languedoc,</hi> as at <hi>Vivarets, Rochell,</hi> and other places: but as they fell from one thing to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, especially concerning what had happened thereabouts, <hi>la Chénay</hi> perceived that he was in the midst of them who were set out on purpose to take him; whereupon he then (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding his part) acts accordingly, detesting all Thieves, and telling them how that coming out from <hi>Tholouse</hi> he was robb'd by a crew of Rogues of all he had brought from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>The Provost, who understood not whereto tended this discourse, very gravely listens to him, thinking that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57596:37"/>
truth it self spake by his mouth. To make short, having all supped, they betake themselves to their Chambers: and the best of it all was, that <hi>la Ché<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay</hi> lay in the same Room with the Provost; and being willing to give himself pastime, he orders the Hostler to get ready his horse at Four of the clock in the morning, intending to be before noon at <hi>Mans.</hi> Whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he gets up as soon as ever it was light, reckons with his Host, and pays not onely his own share, but the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vost's too: And as he was ready to mount on his horse, he draws the Inne-keeper apart, and chargeth him to tell the Provost, that he with whom last night he had supped, was <hi>la Chénay,</hi> whom he had so much sought after; and that he had paid his scot for him.</p>
               <p>Two hours after this, the Provost he riseth, demanding whether the Gentleman was set out yet; and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer being returned, Near three hours
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57596:38"/>
ago, and that he had remitted the account to them behinde; he at this falls into a passion, and admires that so brave a Gentleman as he should put such a trick upon him. The Inne-keeper perceiving him to sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack it so much, told him at last, that he that supped with them was call'd <hi>la Chénay,</hi> and that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed paid the whole reckoning for them: At which the Provost was ten times madder than before, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and swearing at the Inne-keeper, that he did not tell him of it sooner; th'other excuseth himself, as not knowing any thing of their concerns, having never before seen <hi>la Chénay,</hi> wherefore he could not be reasonably blamed, for giving him a simple account of what passed betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The Provost all in haste raiseth the Countrey to pursue him; but all in vain, for he had by that time gotten at least 10 Leagues off, escaping
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57596:38"/>
after this manner from them.</p>
               <p>But it is in vain for him to think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This counsel was assoon executed as proposed, <hi>la Chénay</hi> taking along with him <hi>la Faverie, la Pointe,</hi> and four or five more, and make straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies thither; giving out, that they went upon designe of helping a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,

About Midnight, when every body was in deep sleep, they rise and come from their Chamber, arm'd with Pistols, thinking to finde the Vintner's Chamber open, but it was lockt; they consulted a long time what to do, and how they might get into the Chamber; at length <hi>Postill</hi> told his Companion, he'd have him return
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57596:58"/>
to his Bed, and pretend himself sick; which he did, and presently he began to knock on the floor, under which the Vintner lay, and to call for Wine to fetch him again to life, pretending that he had swoon'd away. The man of the house awakens in a maze, and brings some Vinegar for this Counterfeit; but <hi>Postell</hi> told him, he thought it most proper to give him some of his best Wine, and that he knew his Companions constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereupon they went both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cellar. <hi>Postell</hi> takes a Pistol with him loaded with three Bullets, charg'd with white Powder, and as the Vintner stoops to draw Wine, he discharges it and shoots through his Head, killing him dead on the place: the Candle was put out, and he was above a quarter of an hour, before he could finde the way out of the Cellar. In short, he got out, lights the Candle, and goes up stairs, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Companion what he had
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57596:59"/>
done. The Woman of the House seeing a man, took him for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, not mistrusting he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered. <hi>Postill</hi> goes to bed to he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and she receives him for her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and bids him put out the Candle; but as he turn'd to draw the Curtain, she perceiv'd he had no Beard, and presently cries out: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Postill</hi>'s Comrade throws him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into the Chamber, and stops her mouth with the Bed-cloaths, and so accomplisht their brutish Appetites, and afterwards kill'd her with six stabs of a Dagger. It chanc'd that the Maid-servant was not at home, having got leave of her Mistris to be at one of her Brother's Wedding; so that these Murtherers knowing they were alone in the house, ransackt and pillag'd the best they could lay their hands on, breaking open Trunks and Boxes, till they met with four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds, which the Vintner had borrow'd of his Wives Father,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57596:59"/>
to buy Wines in <hi>Burgundy.</hi> Furnisht with this Booty, they gently open'd the door, at three of the Clock in the Morning, having carefully shut all after them, as if there had been nothing done. In the morning every one was astonish'd to see the doors fast, it being a well-custom'd house, the Master of it having the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be no Water-dasher, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing few of them in <hi>Paris:</hi> For of a Pint, they'll make a Quart, and of a Pottle a Gallon. The Neighbours did not at all mistrust mischief, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this their keeping the door shut, was out of some particular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; but at last they were doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the worst, and therefore sent word to his Relations, who broke open the door, and found the Mistriss bleeding in her Bed; whereupon all the Neighbourhood were in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar: the Commissary comes there, drawing up a particular account of what they had seen. All people ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57596:60"/>
the Vintner as guilty of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering his Wife, saying that he came home drunk the night before; and seeing he could not be found, what could be more probable? This was told his particular Relations, who could not tell what to think on't, as knowing not how to acquit or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him: But this they affirm'd, that to their knowledge he never had (a thing very rare) any quarrel with his Wife, being not of a cholerick temper. Whilst these debates were managed, the <hi>Commissary,</hi> whose business it is to take care of those matters, orders the dead body to be carried to the <hi>Chatelet.</hi> But before he doth so, the Parents of each of them desir'd him to search the house; which they had no sooner done, but they found the Vintner dead on the ground. The shriekings and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations are doubled on every side, and none could imagine th'author of these Villanies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:57596:60"/>
So these two Rascals went clearly. off with these spoils, and lay conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in Bawdy-houses, till they had consum'd it all, and then were fore'd to put themselves on new shifts. <hi>Postill</hi> had a rich Uncle, a Citizen of <hi>Paris,</hi> who knew not of the ill courses of this his Nephew, giving him always a favourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in his house. He finding all his Money gone, so contriv'd his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, that he at last got the Key of the Trunk in which his Aunt used to store up her Money: she not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that any of the house had it, much less her Nephew, caused a new one to be fitted to the Lock. He being willing to make use of an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion when offer'd, watches one Sunday till they were gone out of doors to Church, leaving no body at home, but a little Girl their Kins<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman and the Servant-maid: <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>still</hi> seeing his Uncle and Aunt safe at Church, returns, where he sindes
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57596:61"/>
the Maid washing the dishes. He who knew the customs of the house hastens her to the Sermon, telling her that 'twas already begun: she no doubting his designes, believes him and so they go out together, leaving the little Girl at home: <hi>Postill</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows her to Church, where being entred, he presently whips out and returns, knocking at the door, which was presently opened, telling her, that he had left his Beads behinde him; whereupon he marches up stairs, and pretends to look 'em, and opens the Trunk with his Key, and takes out a little bag, wherein was Two hundred Crowns, and so goes out of the Chamber, putting every thing in its place, as if he had never been there.</p>
               <p>Six or seven weeks after, his Aunt having occasion to look into the Trunk, and missing this bag, was much amazed, telling her Husband; who did not know whom to impeach, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57596:61"/>
a certain necessitous person that frequented the house: who knowing himself innocent, and yet not withstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding accus'd as guilty, did not know what to do, but takes notice of all co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers &amp; goers; and at last was given to understand by some of <hi>Postell's</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, that he spent his money like a Prince, and that his Incomes would not answer those Expences: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he informs his Uncle; who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd narrowly into his Nephews life, and found what was told him was too true: But not being willing to shame him, as being his Kinsman, gave him wholsome and severe Admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and withal, notice to his Father and Mother. The Father being much afflicted at this his Sons deportment, came to <hi>Paris,</hi> and would have had his Uncle severely punish him. His Uncle being angry at the loss, would not expose him; and thinking that he might one day be reduced, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising an amendment to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57596:62"/>
was received again into favour: but being not able to live without his accustomed pleasures, turn'd to his Debauch again, addicting himself more than ever to his old Cronies; among whom it was at length resolved to get a fresh Stock, for their Purses had been a long time empty: They thereupon take a house, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of making it a house for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, where they shewed themselves very courteous and noble; so that a great many young Students, newly come to town, visited them. They had on their parts returned all the civility imaginable, until they had found out who had the most mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and their usual course was to draw them along with them to their house; where being entred, after the usual Compliment, set themselves to play: The money being laid down on the table, one of the Comrades, seeming to come in as a stranger, would snatch all and run away.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:57596:62"/>
One of the Gang, a great Debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ché, being not able to continue his courses without supplies, resolves with himself on a Murther: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he goes one morning to one Mr. <hi>Gantier,</hi> dwelling in <hi>Paris;</hi> a man of unblamable Conversation, and who had been Tutor to this Scholar, and resolves to kill him and plunder his house.

This good old man asked him how he did, and what progress he made in his Studies; and for answer he stab'd him with his Dagger. This Servant which let him in was a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred maid, and Kin to <hi>Gantier,</hi> and kept his house, and who was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in marriage to a good honest Tradesman; she coming into the Chamber and hearing the noise, had her throat cut by this Villain: which done, he opens the Trunks, and findes

never before seen) he was so strong, that maugre the force of the River, he made up and ascended the Key. This action was admired by every one, as indeed it might well.</p>
               <p>The Woods were the ordinary places of his retreat; he lurk'd there all the day-time, and was often seen on a Tree with his Harquebuss watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Passengers. It is reported for certain he kill'd in one day six Merchants, who were all of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from a Fair not far distant thence. In short, all the parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts trembled with fear at his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties: he on the other side when he was flusht, returned to <hi>Compeigne,</hi> and no one durst be so bold as to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front him, carrying on always his busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness so slyly, that 'twas impossible to finde certain proofs against him.</p>
               <p>It hapned about the year 1609, when <hi>France</hi> was calm'd by a long and happy Peace, that people from all parts, as 'tis the custom, came to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57596:70"/>
the general Match of Shooting, every one striving who should bear away the Prize.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Veron</hi> being a man who loved to shew himself, would not let slip this occasion, resolving with himself to make one amongst them; but that for which he was most concerned was, that he had no Money, and not one of his Relations would lend him any, being by them well enough known to be a bad Husband; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding which, he was resolved to furnish himself some how or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, imagining people would reflect on him not appearing on so eminent an occasion; and seeing on the other side he could borrow none, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in his minde to get some by force.</p>
               <p>It is to be remarked, that about a quarter of a League beyond <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peigne,</hi> upon the side of the Wood, near the great Road which leads to <hi>Soissons,</hi> there is a little Hermitage,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57596:70"/>
called the <hi>Cross of the holy Signe,</hi> where there lives continually Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits who come begging to the City: There is likewise a very decent Chappel, where many people, whose occasions lie that way, turn in to make their Prayers.</p>
               <p>In this Hermitage dwelt then two good old Fathers; one of them was called <hi>Frater Claudus,</hi> the other's name I do not remember. Now <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> was wont very often, after he had been weary with ranging the Wood, to retire there. They ever gave him entrance when he knock'd at their Gate, and also imparted to him what they had gotten in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He had frequented this Hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage for at least two years before this business of the Shooting-match was talk'd of; so that notwithstanding all the bad reports which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually noised of him, these Fathers were not afraid of him, and ceased not to receive him whensoever he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57596:71"/>
to put in with them. But the easie access which they gave him, lost 'em: For frequenting there so often, he came at length to know they both had Money; he would not howsoever have harmed them, could he otherways have effected his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness; but finding himself urged by want of Money, and knowing he must contribute his part to the Prize, which was to a very rich one, and that very speedily; he resolves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to rob these Hermits, and take from them their Money, but he knew not what means to use that people might not mistrust him: but behold what he did! one night about eight of the clock, 'twas about <hi>Whitson<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

scarcely was he half an hour in his way to the Hermitage, where he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, no body without seeing him go in, where he addresses himself to the Eldest of the two Hermits, (for the other was gone to draw Water out of a Well hard by there) and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands his Purse. The good old Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior thought he was in jest, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any reckoning of what he said; but was immediately astonish'd fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himself on the Ground by a blow given him by this Parricide, seconding it by another with his Poignard about his left-breast: the Hermit feeling himself thus struck, shewed him the place where his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lay; the other redoubles not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding his blows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> piercing him to the Heart, and so was dispatched without any farther noise; for <hi>Veron</hi> held his Foot on his Throat; which having done, he takes his Money, amounting to about three hundred Livers.</p>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57596:73"/>
This Counsel was put in execution, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Which being known in the City, they were all astonish'd at so dreadful a relation, flocking to see this woful spectacle: <hi>Veron</hi> came amongst the rest, and made shew of no small sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the loss of these two good Fathers, cursing with a hundred im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations those who had done this wicked fact: <hi>They,</hi> saith he, <hi>must cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have a great stock of Cruelty and Hardheartedness, who have exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted so execrable a perfidiousness to have killed two so Religious and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Personages, even at the very Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>

This suspition took dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per root in the mindes of the Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants, when he came before the Corpse of the two poor Hermits; for at the same time the Corpse, which were dry and withered, having bled all the Blood in their Veins, began then to bleed again a fresh; whereupon all the people began unanimously to cry out that there must be one in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany concerned, seeing the dead Corpse so plainly called for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance; at which, every one cast their Eyes on <hi>Veron:</hi> nevertheless by

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57596:75"/>
walk'd together till they came over against the great Gate of the Prison, where they set to their Game: they who should seze on him, fail'd not in great numbers to appear there, lest any resistance should happen, for he was exceeding strong and robust, and would have given them their hands full, had he had but notice of their designe. As he was in the midst of his Game, there was a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant who trundled slily a Ball into the Entry of the Prison, praying <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi> to step for't; whereupon he goes, but was astonish'd seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self set upon by twelve or fourteen Officers, who charged him in the Kings Name to yield himself: <hi>Veron</hi> was not a little amaz'd, seeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self taken after that manner, being ready to burst with rage and fury, running about the Prison like a mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, seeking something to do mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief withal; and to say the truth, they who lay'd hands on him had
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57596:76"/>
enough to do with him; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all his efforts, he was forced to contain himself within the Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls, being loaded with Irons.</p>
               <p>In the mean time they draw'd up his Process, there coming from all parts those which deposed against him, being accused of divers Thefts and Robberies committed both in the Woods and elsewhere; but not one of them could say any thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him touching the Murther he was cast into Prison for, excepting the Baker's Boy, who affirmed that upon such a day he had heard, as he passed by the Hermitage, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Words. He for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence brought in two Citizens of good repute, who affirmed they had seen him in the Town at eight a clock, and at half an hour after eight; withal adding, 'twas impossible he could perform such an Enterprize in so little a time: this made them all at a stand, putting them in doubt
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57596:76"/>
what to think of it. Several of the Court seeing no sufficient proof, went from their Seats, and would be no farther concerned, fearing lest they should give a wrong judgement through want of certain knowledge, knowing not what to think of it. Likelihood indeed there was, but no sufficient proof; yet howsoever, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they could get nothing from him but a bare negation, and that the tortures of the Rack could not make him confess this crime, they procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded notwithstanding upon probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the other undeniable crimes which he was proved guilty of, for which he was sentenced to be broken on the Wheel, which did not a little daunt him; for there was no appeal; he must on force undergo it, though it went to the Heart of him, being in the flower of his age. There was sent to him a Confessor to prepare him for death; but he would by no means hear on't: for although condemned, he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57596:77"/>
himself with the hope he should not die this bout; but seeing there was no respit given him, they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by degrees to dispose him for his passage.</p>
               <p>This man had an undaunted Spirit, and could not be brought to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief he should die in the flower of his age: He threatned and calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niated his Judges, bidding defiance to Heaven and Earth, foaming with rage and despair, fury having so much possessed him that scarcely the Priest his Confessor durst approach him.</p>
               <p>He at length confessed to the Priest; but when he came to speak to him concerning his murthering of the Hermits, he cast it back with a thousand Oaths and imprecations: saying that in truth he had committed several Robberies; but touching the Hermits, so horrid a thing never so much as once entred into his minde.</p>

In the end, she who feigned in the beginning to be drawn by his promises, began to lay aside more and more her averseness; saying, that not onely her Poverty constrained his reception, but that
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57596:84"/>
he had likewise acquired such an ad vantage in her favour, that she coul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When scarcely had they seen one another, but <hi>Carildus</hi> asks of <hi>Helene</hi> if her Husband was at home, and when she expected his return; to which she answered, that he would not be at home this eight days; <hi>For he has,</hi> saith she, <hi>some business <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carildus,</hi> who on the other side
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:57596:84"/>
burned and consumed in his own flame, gives her a Purse full of Gold, and immediately comes to her Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where <hi>Meris</hi> had hid himself in order to the finishing of his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize; for he would together with the Money have the Cloaths too of <hi>Carildus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As they were entred, there was a good Fire made, and the Lawyer began already to undress himself, when <hi>Meris</hi> came with a Club and discharges it on his Head, felling him with the blow to the Ground; and redoubling his blows, he never left striking of him till he had killed him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Helene,</hi> not thinking that he would ever have killed him, was very much astonished in seeing him lie dead at her Feet: her Husband how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever assured her, telling her, that she should not trouble her self, fore would so order it, that it should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to be known that he killed
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57596:85"/>
him: Wherefore, bidding her go to bed, he takes the dead Lawyer on his Back, and enters directly by a Back-door (being well acquainted with the House) into the Lawyer's Lodging, where, the Night and Sleep favouring of him, he immediately discharges the Corpse in the place where people used to ease themselves; and so placed him on the Seat, that whosoever should come in there, would judge that he had died in this place and posture.</p>
            <p>Now the day before, <hi>Carildus</hi> told his Companion all the affair, and how <hi>Helene</hi> had promised him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess into her Lodging: It happened therefore that this Confident of his, rising at Mid-night by reason of the Gripes wherewith he had been for these four or five days troubled, as he came to the said place to ease him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, he perceived that 'twas occupi'd by <hi>Carildus;</hi> wherefore he was some time (being not willing to disturb
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57596:85"/>
him) a staying for him; but seeing that he came not out, he goes to him, pulling him by the Sleeve, which made the Corpse fall down at his Feet.</p>
            <p>This man being much astonished, takes his flight, and knows not what could be said in this matter; but being at length assured, he comes back again, and seeing <hi>Carildus</hi> dead, he doubts presently that he had been betray'd in <hi>Helene</hi>'s house to <hi>Meris</hi> her Husband, whom he had known of a long time to be a man of his hands. Wherefore for fear lest he should be accused that he had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered him, (for he was seen to rise) he takes him up on his Back, with intention to carry him before <hi>Meris</hi>'s Door. Hitherto we have seen the mischief which Poverty doth bring with it, instigating men to the doing of those things which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would be abhorr'd by them. Let us see now what hapned to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rildus</hi>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:57596:86"/>
after his death: for there is <hi>Plaisantrie</hi> and Adventures perhaps never before heard or thought of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Carildus</hi>'s Companion having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up the Corpse on his Back, went and placed it at the same House it came out of, setting it upright against <hi>Meris</hi>'s Door; then returns to his Lodging without any bodies taking notice of him. <hi>Helene,</hi> by chance too, through default of Nature, would go out of doors, it being about half an hour after Midnight, but was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much astonished that she had no sooner opened it, but the dead Body fell into the House. She cries out being affrighted, and tells her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that the Lawyer was come back again to their Lodging; upon which <hi>Meris</hi> rising up in haste out of his sleep, assures her, telling her she should not be troubled at the dead, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing that he would carry him so far that he should never finde his way back again. Wherefore he takes
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57596:86"/>
him up again the second time; and as he goes along the Street to carry him to the River, he hears a great noise, coming, as he thought, from the end of the Street; whereupon, fear, which before had no effect on him, seizes on his Courage, making him dread the just punishment he deserved; which made him stand up close in a Street which went across, that he might see them whom he heard com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and shun their meeting: but his fear quickly changed into joy; for them from whom he heard that noise were night-Adventurers, who just came from stealing two Flitches of Bacon from out of the House of a Baker named <hi>Philip duBois.</hi> As these Fellows passed along by this Lane where was <hi>Meris,</hi> who had got un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Bulk, he heard them talking that there was a man drew good Wine in that Street, and that they would leave their Bacon somewhere, and see whether they could make
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57596:87"/>
'um rise. The proposal was agreed to, and they put their Sack into the descent of a Cellar, covering it with some Straw which they by chance there met with; and there left it. <hi>Meris,</hi> who had observed all this from his Bulk, imagines that he needs not go any further to unload him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; wherefore he makes up to the place where the Thieves had laid the Sack, and having opened it and felt Bacon in it, he takes it out, and puts in lieu of it the dead Lawyer, and returns to his Lodging, where he findes his Wife up, and who was so concerned at what had unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctedly befallen her, that she could not (so much was she affrighted at what had passed) go to bed.</p>
            <p>But when she perceived that he came back again, she thought she should have died immediately with fear; for the imagined that her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band could not be rid of the dead Corpse: but he quickly appeased
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:57596:87"/>
when he shew'd the Bacon, and gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Thieves then go to the place
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57596:88"/>
where they had left their Sack; and having there found it, not at all dreaming of the exchange, they take it up, fancying it though to be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what heavier than it seem'd to be before; but of that they took no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther notice, and brought it straight to the House where they were drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which they had no sooner o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, but the Vintner sees poor <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rildus</hi>'s Head peeping out of the Sack: whereupon he begins presently to cry out upon them (for he knew the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) <hi>Oh! villains, what have you done?</hi> cries he, <hi>You have killed the Sieur</hi> Carildus, <hi>and are so impudent to bring him here to me to sell him for Bacon.</hi> The Thieves, more asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd than he, stood as men amazed staring one upon another, and knew not what Countenance to keep: the other cried out still against them, threatning to have them soon laid by the heels, and to send for the friends of the defunct. They on the other
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57596:88"/>
side desired him to have patience, and not to speak of it; for they knew where they had this booty: and to accuse them of intended theft they might, but not of murther; but howsoever they would carry the Corpse back again where they had it; which they did, wondering and tempesting at this their rencounter, asking one another what they thought of it, whether this was not a strange Metamorphosis, and how 'twas possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for them to be so much mistaken as to take a Lawyer for Bacon; which saying, they come to the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers House, where getting up to the place from whence they had taken the Bacon, they there place the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, and withdraw.

were at this business, they consulted how to get him from thence. The Baker had a young Colt never yet back'd, whom he causes his Man to bring-him; and having clapt on him a Saddle, he fastens the Lawyer on him, so that he could not fall off, putting likewise Spurs to his shooes; and thus equipag'd they lead him out into the Street, it being not past six in the Morning in the shortest days of Winter; the Baker believing that losing the sight of him he should lose him altogether, as indeed he did; for as this young Colt went on the way, it hapned that one of the Spurs struck by mishap into his Side, which made him so fall a running, that he cast off his Rider into a Well, where he was never more heard of.</p>
