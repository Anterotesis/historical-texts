            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

comforted in the Kings prudent and tender reſpect vouchſafed to their <hi>ſad condition;</hi> and have ever ſince, (though it be now about eight or nine Moneths) waited in a patient expectation of ſome timely ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to his Royal <hi>Declaration, Speeches,</hi> References and Commiſſion; notwithſtanding many of them have in the mean time been almoſt quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in their <hi>eſtates</hi> and <hi>credits,</hi> and ſome utterly ruined by the impatience of their <hi>Creditors;</hi> by the violence of untimely <hi>Intruders</hi> upon their poſſeſsions; by vexatious ſuits commenced againſt them; and by paying great taxes and other duties, for thoſe Lands by them purchaſed, which are intruded upon contrary to an <hi>Order of Parliament,</hi> and other <hi>Prohibitions;</hi> as alſo, becauſe ſome of the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers</hi> have been ſo impoveriſhed by former Oppreſſions, that (to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick damage, as well as to their own) much of the ſaid Lands lyeth waſte, in regard they have neither where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to ſtock thoſe which came lately into poſſeſsion, nor means to demiſe them to Tenants, whileſt their <hi>Titles</hi> are diſparaged. Which with other deſtructive grievances daily multiplying, have conſtrained this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant</hi> (who in his own perſon, is made ſenſible of other mens afflictions, well near in every kind) both for preventing the utter undoing of himſelf with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and of many thouſands more, together with their <hi>Creditors</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> humbly to Remonſtrate as follows.</p>
            <p>That the long delayed, and juſtly expected Relief of the ſaid Purchaſers and Lenders (of which this <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant</hi> is one) ſeems to him prolonged by the ſiniſter endeavours or neglects of ſome from whom they hoped better things, occaſioning no leſs diſhonour and hazard to the <hi>King</hi> and Nation, then injury to their patience,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44454:3"/>
whoſe dammages are multiplyed thereby: For inſtead of what was rationally hoped for, this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> and many more, are among other frequent upbraidings and provocations, jeered with this untimely and unſavoury caution, <hi>Caveat emptor;</hi> which hath obliquely, a worſe reflection upon <hi>Venders</hi> then <hi>Buyers</hi> in their condition; implying rather <hi>Caveant Venditores,</hi> in regard it is a <hi>Caveat</hi> to be given before-hand; and to thoſe only, who contract with perſons juſtly ſuſpected to be either <hi>Cheaters</hi> or <hi>Beggars,</hi> and ought not to be applyed to them who were Purchaſers from <hi>States</hi> or <hi>Parliaments,</hi> who have engaged the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> of a whole <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to confirm their <hi>Sales</hi> and <hi>Securities:</hi> For they ſhould with reverence be confided in, by all under their <hi>Authority,</hi> leſt ſuch become guilty of expoſing it to contempt; and therefore, the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders,</hi> were not (till really damnified) to ſuſpect or queſtion, Whether the Grants and Securities to them offered, would be valid or invalid; or Whether the Eſtates expoſed to ſale by the <hi>Parliament,</hi> were juſtly or unjuſtly bargained and ſold; becauſe it was to be preſumed that <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> are not only at all times able to make good their <hi>Bargains</hi> and <hi>Securities,</hi> or to give full recompence to thoſe who ſhall be thereby damnified, if it prove otherwiſe; but that (being thereto obliged both in honour and juſtice) they will alſo punctually perform the one or the other, without receding from their <hi>Bargains,</hi> or hagling like broken debtors: And therefore by one of theſe wayes, the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders</hi> preſume they ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly be ſaved harmleſs.</p>
            <p>And, it is their humble deſire, it may be timely and effectually done, in reſpect of thoſe deſtructive neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties afore-mentioned, whereinto many of them are
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:44454:4"/>
plunged; and that they may not be liſtened unto, who ſeek to perſwade thoſe who ſhould relieve them, that (as affairs now ſtand) there is no obligation upon the <hi>Supream Power,</hi> or upon the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> to take cognizance of thoſe engagements; For, whatſoever they think, the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> and the honour of the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> together with their <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> will therein be much concerned, whether their Power who granted thoſe <hi>Eſtates</hi> and <hi>Securities,</hi> were juſtly or unjuſtly conſtituted, or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed; conſidering it was then the ſole <hi>viſible Power in being,</hi> aſſented and ſubmitted unto as an <hi>authentick Authority,</hi> by the greateſt number of the people of every degree and qualification, in theſe three <hi>Nations,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any open contradiction (which implies an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall aſſent, or what is ſo equivalent thereto, that a factious or rebellious combination could not be juſtly thereto imputed.) It was acknowledged to be then the <hi>Supream Power,</hi> not only by <hi>popular voices</hi> in the air, but by voluntary <hi>ſubſcriptions</hi> alſo, under the hands of well near all the Magiſtrates, Knights, Citizens and Burgers of all Counties, Cities and Corporations in theſe Dominions, without any open proteſt made againſt it; and, <hi>de non apparentibus &amp; non exiſtentibus eadem eſt ratio:</hi> Thoſe things, which when they ſhould <hi>appear,</hi> appear not, reputed are, among the things that <hi>are not.</hi> Moreover, it was actually owned and obeyed by the <hi>Nobility,</hi> as the <hi>Supream Authority,</hi> and by the reverend <hi>Judges</hi> of our Land in every <hi>Court of Record;</hi> by the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of Parochial Churches, and Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of each ſeveral judgement, to be by divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and the examplary practiſe of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that Power (being then the Power which had ſole viſible being) whereto obedience was due: Such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44454:4"/>
alſo it was generally reputed and acknowledged by the <hi>Publick Miniſters</hi> of all neighbouring <hi>Nations, Kings, Princes,</hi> and <hi>Republicks;</hi> wiſer then whom, it could not be expected, that this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> or any of the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders</hi> ſhould have been. Therefore, if they were deceived, the examples of ſuch conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able perſons, and ſo much Reaſon deceived them, that no man living can be certain, wherein he is not decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; or that he may not be as much deceived now, or hereafter, as he, and others were heretofore.</p>
            <p>But, without queſtion, the <hi>Powers in being,</hi> whether by <hi>Gods</hi> Grace or permiſſion, all Power being given by him, (even that which <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> had to crucifie his Son) are to be the object of our obedience while they continue, whatſoever they ſeem; and no man can be juſtly blamed for ſubmitting <hi>actively</hi> thereunto in meer <hi>civil things,</hi> or with a <hi>paſsive obedience,</hi> in matters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Conſcience;</hi> nor can this <hi>Principle</hi> be diſadvantagious to the Power for the time being, but will be a great ſtrengthening and ſecurity thereunto, if well underſtood: Even as a <hi>man,</hi> whether he were lawfully or unlawfully begotten, is <hi>truly and eſſentially a man,</hi> and ſo reputed, as long as the <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue together, (howſoever he ſhall be diſmembred by others, or by his own default.) So, that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> by which the ſaid <hi>Securities</hi> and <hi>Sales</hi> were given and made, were a <hi>valid Power,</hi> and a true <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to all intents and purpoſes, ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that which was eſſential to ſupream <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> how ſurreptiouſly ſoever that Power was acquired, or whatſoever was but accidentally defective: Or elſe perhaps, the lawfulneſs of moſt <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments,</hi> (yea, and of moſt <hi>humane Authorities and Conſtitutions)</hi> would be otherwiſe found defective
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44454:5"/>
enough to be queſtioned, and to have all their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions rendred invalid: And ſo likewiſe, they may <hi>de facto</hi> (how juſt ſoever they be <hi>de jure)</hi> when a <hi>Power</hi> ſhall be permitted to raign, which is ſtrong enough to make WILL and PLEASURE the <hi>Supream Law:</hi> For (to ſpeak truth in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> which this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant</hi> heartily loves to do, when juſt occaſion is offered) a <hi>prevailing Power,</hi> in the hands of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> (howſoever acquired) is while it hath being, <hi>para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount</hi> to all <hi>Laws</hi> and rational Arguments; and will be obeyed in every thing as it pleaſeth, right or wrong; or elſe break or deſtroy all that oppoſeth it, till GOD extraordinarily reſtrains it, or breaks it into pieces.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be his name for it, we are not yet ſubjected to ſuch a Tyrannie as our ſins have deſerved; but, to a <hi>King</hi> from whom we have received an <hi>Earneſt,</hi> making us hopeful that <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> will equally flow from the Throne, either when he ſhall be fully and rightly informed of ſuch particulars as are pertinent to his cognizance and care; or when GOD's time is come: And therefore, this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> doth in order thereunto, hereby ſignifie on behalf of himſelf and ſuch other <hi>Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders</hi> as aforeſaid; that, when they engaged with and for the the ſaid <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (lent their moneys, and purchaſed the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned eſtates) they did it not upon any factious <hi>Principle;</hi> nor meerly to get ſatisfaction for what they had disburſed, or to have recompence for ſervices formerly done; but, for ſupply alſo of <hi>Publick neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities,</hi> and to diſ-engage the ſaid <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> from thoſe debts, which were originally contracted for the ſervice of the late <hi>King;</hi> by which debts, other <hi>engagements</hi> were (in part at leaſt) occaſioned; and

for diſcharge whereof, that Parliament was impowered to continue undiſſolved, till the ſaid debts and engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were paid and diſcharged: And this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> then believed, and ſtill believes, that the ſaid <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was fully authoriſed, both to raiſe money by what lawfull means they could, to ſupply publick wants, and to make ſuch <hi>Sales</hi> and <hi>Securities</hi> as they propoſed, to repay and ſatisfie for what was lent, bought, or acted by their commands, for the Publick honour or ſafety: And he ſo believes, becauſe <hi>Parliaments</hi> were that <hi>Supream Council</hi> of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> to whoſe <hi>Orders, Acts,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> the people had ever heretofore been obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, without ſcruple or blame; yea, whereto no leſs obedience was required, then to the Kings <hi>perſonal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands;</hi> nay, much more, as it was then thought, when <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudley,</hi> two eminent perſons, (and as this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> remembers) of the <hi>Kings privy Council,</hi> were condemned by Judgement in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted for their officious obedience, in executing the Kings illegal <hi>Commiſsion</hi> under the great Seal of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> which was more obliging, then his perſonal mandates. A <hi>Popular Supream Power,</hi> whileſt it is actually in being, cannot be properly impeached of Treaſon, nor any who acts by the commands or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity thereof: Becauſe, it was then our duty to be obedient thereto. And though a <hi>ſingle perſon,</hi> or <hi>few,</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> yea though <hi>Cities, Counties, Provinces,</hi> and whole <hi>Armies</hi> may be Traytors, it is not reaſonably ſuppoſed the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of whole <hi>Nations</hi> can ſo be, and if poſſibly they might, there is no competent Judge thereof but GOD himſelf, who uſually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termineth ſuch differences (as he is <hi>LORD of Hoſts)</hi> by the <hi>ſword,</hi> as he did lately upon a <hi>joynt appeal,</hi> and afterward, by reverſing again that <hi>Judgement</hi> for the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44454:6"/>
ſins of theſe <hi>Nations,</hi> hath righteouſly executed his dooms on both <hi>parties,</hi> for their mutual failings in their <hi>reciprocal Relations;</hi> and which dooms were recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally inflicted on both the ſaid parties for their treaſons againſt his divine Majeſty, for their groſs hypocriſies, apoſtaſies, prophaneneſs, unmercifulneſs and injuſtice, in which many imitate each other to this day. For even many of thoſe actions which ought not to have been done, lay obligations upon their actors and their ſuccſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, when they are done. <hi>Children</hi> ſhould not be unlawfully begotten; yet when miſ-begotten, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are obliged in all duties by them to be performed to their children. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were not to have made a league with the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> but when it was made, they were bound to obſerve it; and for the breach thereof, the whole Nation was puniſhed many years after, and ſeven of their Kings ſons hanged alſo for that tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Moreover, it is further conſiderable, that the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> which made the ſaid <hi>Sales,</hi> and granted the ſaid <hi>Securities,</hi> were both the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Peoples Truſtees,</hi> ſummoned by the late <hi>Kings Writ,</hi> to conſult about the moſt weighty affairs of the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and delegated by a <hi>popular Election,</hi> to diſpoſe of the <hi>Peoples Intereſt,</hi> as they ſhould find cauſe, for the <hi>Common good.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> conceived, he might reaſonably have confided as much in that Parliament, as in this now ſitting; and doth ſuppoſe, that they who make queſtion of the former, may as rationally be doubtful, both of this, and of all future <hi>Parliaments;</hi> eſpecially, if the ſucceſſors of that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> ſhall not, (or ought not in equity) to confirm their <hi>Sales</hi> and <hi>Securities,</hi> nor give recompence to thoſe who are damnified, out of the eſtates of thoſe who truſted them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44454:6"/>
with the Publick Faith, whoſe eſtates, as long as they ſhall be a <hi>people,</hi> will in conſcience, be liable thereunto. And, it ſeems to this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> by matter of Fact, ſince the ſitting of this preſent <hi>Parliament,</hi> that even in their judgement, the <hi>Sales</hi> and <hi>Securities,</hi> granted and given by the <hi>long Parliament,</hi> ſhould be made good according to their intention. For, they cauſed or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered payment to be made of very great ſumms to the now <hi>Lord Maior of London,</hi> and to Major General <hi>Maſſey;</hi> perſons who heretofore were of the ſame judgement with other men, now called <hi>Phanatiques;</hi> and who then oppoſed the <hi>Kings</hi> armed power, both in <hi>Field</hi> and <hi>Garriſon,</hi> as vigorouſly as any, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the late war; and were inſtrumental in that, which enabled others to proſecute him to death: Theſe had no other, but the very ſame <hi>Security,</hi> which the <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> and the reſt afore-mentioned, had for money lent, lands bought, and <hi>ſervices</hi> done by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of that <hi>Repreſentative</hi> of this Nation, and which to make good the ſaid <hi>Securities,</hi> was by a peculiar <hi>poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Law,</hi> to have been continued as aforeſaid, to that purpoſe, till they were diſſolved by an <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> with their own conſent. The loſs of which Power, whether occaſioned by their own default, or other mens, or by GOD's immediate juſtice upon them, is no bar in equity, to the <hi>Purchaſes</hi> claimed, <hi>Securities</hi> or <hi>Debts</hi> aforeſaid; in regard the <hi>Nation</hi> in whoſe name they were made and contracted, to whoſe uſe the ſaid money was raiſed, by the ſaid Sales, Loans, and Condeſcentions; (and upon whoſe credit alſo they were granted by their own Acts, perſonated by their <hi>Truſtees)</hi> is the ſame <hi>Nation</hi> by whom all this was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, and to whom the injuſtice and dishonour of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thoſe <hi>Securities</hi> will be imputed: And if the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44454:7"/>
               <hi>Repreſentative</hi> thereof now in being, or ſome other hereafter impowered, provide not an <hi>expedient</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſoblige it from the ſaid Securities, it will be a blot upon it (yea worſe) whileſt it is a Nation. For, it will be liable to the Judgements which are due to ſuch a failing, in what ought to be performed. Alſo, if thoſe <hi>Securities</hi> be rendred void, (for whoſe confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſuch extraordinary proviſion was made) nothing will hereafter be reputed a good Security, which can be thereby given: For, in probability, States and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will ſo loſe their credit, that they will not only be reputed the greateſt cheaters in the world; and the moſt cruel and moſt fooliſh deſtroyers of their own honour and relations; but alſo, in whatſoever neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity they ſhall be, will never more be confided in, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their ſpecious pretences, plauſible Speeches, Declarations, Proteſtations, and Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and then their Magiſterial ſlighting, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and condemning, juſt and reaſonable Propoſals, Cautions, and humble requeſts of <hi>oppreſſed Supplicants,</hi> will have evil Conſequents, though they may ſerve their ends for a while. The <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> fears this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult,</hi> and that there are ſome endeavouring to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid the ſaid <hi>Securities,</hi> together with the <hi>Kings</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious condeſcentions, if it be poſſible, both to the <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> and others, who can hardly walk the ſtreets without abuſive affronts and provocations; in which conſiderations it is preſumed he is allowed by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> (and ſhall be permitted by your <hi>humanity)</hi> to plead and inſinuate in a peaceable manner, ſuch Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as reaſonably tend to their timely relief; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when they are made almoſt careleſs of their lives by being totally deprived of that, whereupon life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth, through their neglect of Juſtice to whom they conſcientiouſly adhered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:44454:7"/>
But much more weight may be laid upon the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn from that tender reſpect, that ought to be had to the honour of the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Parliament,</hi> which this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> cannot chuſe but frequently touch upon, as being of very high concernment. A Gentleman of the loweſt rank, who hath any ſenſe of his true honour, is no leſs careful to keep his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>promiſe,</hi> then to perform what he is obliged unto by an Inſtrument confirmed with <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>ſeal;</hi> yea more, becauſe he to whom he ſtands engaged by the latter, confided leſs in him, and hath a <hi>legal ſecurity,</hi> whereby he may probably be ſaved harmleſs, howſoever he be inclined to make performance, who gave him credit. And it ought to be remembred, that by his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Declaration</hi> from <hi>Breda,</hi> concerning <hi>Sales;</hi> by a <hi>Declaration</hi> made in this <hi>Parliament</hi> the 8. of <hi>May</hi> laſt; by his <hi>Majeſties Proclamation</hi> the 6. of <hi>June</hi> laſt; by an <hi>Order</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi> laſt <hi>Auguſt,</hi> reſtraining <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> from granting Leaſes of any of the ſaid lands by them claimed; by his <hi>Majeſties Speech</hi> at the end of the firſt Seſſion of this <hi>Parliament;</hi> and by the L. <hi>Chancellours Speech</hi> ſeconding the ſame; (which gave hope that ſom good proceed ſhould be made toward the relief promiſed, before the Members of this <hi>Parliament</hi> were arrived at their <hi>Countrey-Houſes.)</hi> It ſeemed to be the intent both of the <hi>King,</hi> and of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Purchaſes</hi> ſhould, and ought, to have been confirmed to the late <hi>Purchaſers;</hi> and that in the mean time, their poſſeſsions ſhould be quieted, and their <hi>Rents</hi> and <hi>Arrears</hi> paid unto them by their Tenants: Nevertheleſs, to the diſhonour both of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> the <hi>Prelates</hi> not only ſlight the <hi>Orders</hi> and <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Commons</hi> alone, and the <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> joyntly, with that which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44454:8"/>
by the <hi>King,</hi> as aforeſaid; but, do many other wayes, act ſo violently and arbitrarily repugnant to theſe condeſcentions, as if they would make the <hi>People</hi> believe, that they knew the <hi>King</hi> and this <hi>Parliament</hi> intended not what they declared, except only in things relating to the benefit of them the ſaid <hi>Prelates:</hi> For, the firſt <hi>Votes</hi> of this <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> for reſtoring them to their <hi>Manſion-Houſes,</hi> and the <hi>Votes</hi> of the <hi>Grand Committee,</hi> excluding perſons, under ſeveral <hi>Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> (not excepted in the <hi>Act of Oblivion)</hi> from the benefit of the intended <hi>Act for confirmation of Sales,</hi> they obſerve, and impoſe as <hi>Laws</hi> upon the <hi>People;</hi> but, on the contrary, the <hi>Votes</hi> of the ſame <hi>Houſe,</hi> for prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting them the ſaid <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> to grant any Leaſes, until the intended <hi>Act of Sales</hi> was paſſed; as alſo, for the <hi>Augmentation of Vicaredges,</hi> and the <hi>Votes</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Grand Committee,</hi> for ſatisfying the <hi>Purchaſers</hi> their <hi>money and Intereſt,</hi> before they did part with their <hi>poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions,</hi> they reject as of no force, the Parliament being diſſolved; and regard the ſaid <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the <hi>Lords and Commons,</hi> and the ſaid <hi>Acts and Orders</hi> of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> alone, much leſs. Moreover, if in any thing his Majeſties Commiſſioners encline to give the leaſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to any <hi>Purchaſer,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> cry out againſt it as an <hi>Arbitrary Prerogative Commiſsion;</hi> though in caſes relating to their advantage, they cry up the <hi>Prerogative</hi> againſt the <hi>Laws.</hi> Alſo upon Petitions of ſome of the <hi>Purchaſers</hi> (as the <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> is informed) <hi>Orders</hi> are made, ſeeming to enable them to receive all <hi>Arrears</hi> due before the 24. of <hi>June</hi> laſt; when it is well known (perhaps to themſelves) that by the <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> Arrears to that day are generally pardoned, and that the Tenants who ought to have paid them, lay hold on that <hi>Act,</hi> and diſobey thoſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44454:8"/>
               <hi>Orders;</hi> by which means, <hi>Officers</hi> are only benefited, and the <hi>ſuiters</hi> more damnified by expences, inſtead of getting relief; So that, whereas <hi>Purchaſers</hi> are invited to bring in their <hi>deeds</hi> to be cancelled, upon promiſing that they ſhould receive all Rents due at and before <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelmas</hi> laſt, it would be plainer dealing to tell them, they ſhould have a <hi>Quarters Rent,</hi> to relinquiſh their <hi>purchaſes;</hi> for in truth it amounts to no more, from <hi>June</hi> 24 to <hi>Michaelmas</hi> next following. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, there being nothing promiſed by King or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as aforeſaid, in their Declarations, in relation to the <hi>Old Tenants</hi> of <hi>Prelates Lands,</hi> (the ſaid <hi>Tenants</hi> having had <hi>pre-emption</hi> before all other, when the ſaid Lands were ſold; enjoying alſo their full term without interruption, during their reſpective Leaſes; and being no otherwiſe diſplaced, then they uſually were formerly when the ſaid <hi>Prelates</hi> pleaſed by <hi>Concurrent Leaſes</hi> or otherwiſe, to take theſe <hi>Farms</hi> into their own hands, or for the benefit of their <hi>children</hi> and <hi>relations,</hi> at the expiration of their Terms) it had been more candid uſage, to have abſolutely ſignified to the <hi>Purchaſers,</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Old Tenants</hi> ſhould be preferred before them, rather then to permit the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers</hi> (de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by a vain hope) to conſume money and time in ſeeking for a <hi>Compoſition,</hi> and to ſuffer the ſaid <hi>Prelates</hi> in the mean time, to receive their whole Rents, to eject the <hi>Purchaſers</hi> by force, when they had paid all Taxes, with other duties, not without great expence beſtowed in fencing, ſoyling, plowing and ſowing the ſaid Lands; and alſo to grant Leaſes, as they have done, to the vacating of all the coſt and labour of the ſaid <hi>Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,</hi> in purſuing what ſeemed graciouſly intended both by King and Parliament on their behalf. Theſe and many other paſſages, which this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44454:9"/>
makes it appear unto him, that there is not that care yet taken to preſerve the honour of the <hi>King</hi> and of this <hi>Parliament,</hi> in giving ſatisfaction to <hi>Purchaſers,</hi> as might be wiſhed; and that there is not that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had to <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>good Conſcience,</hi> in ſatisfying them, as hath been heretofore vouchſafed by <hi>Princes, States,</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> in the like <hi>Caſes.</hi>

            <p>In true <hi>Reaſon,</hi> (which diſtinguiſheth <hi>Men</hi> from <hi>Beaſts,</hi> as <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> differences them from <hi>Devils)</hi> this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> conceives, that the whole <hi>matter</hi> in <hi>Fact</hi> and <hi>Judgement,</hi> concerning the ſaid <hi>Sales</hi> and <hi>Securities,</hi> muſt unavoidably be brought to this <hi>Dilemma;</hi> (to wit) either the <hi>Long Parliament</hi> had Power to make ſuch <hi>Sales,</hi> and grant ſuch <hi>Securities</hi> as aforeſaid, or elſe they had not: If they had ſuch a <hi>Power,</hi> then their <hi>Sales</hi> and <hi>Securities</hi> muſt be allowed and confirmed; or, at leaſt, (if in Law or Equity, reſtitution of what was by them ſold, ought to be made to the former poſſeſſors) then recompence muſt be given another way; elſe injuſtice is commited, GOD, and the <hi>Nation</hi> are diſhonoured, and many thouſand Families and innocent perſons will be unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully expoſed to ruine; and that <hi>ſeverity</hi> and want of <hi>compaſsion,</hi> for which they were viſited in wrath, who laſt abuſed their Power, will be more then doubled.

in them; that <hi>Parliaments</hi> ſucceſſors ought then in Juſtice, to award ſatisfaction out of their eſtates, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated ſuch an unwarrantable Power, as far as they will extend, if they can be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe among them, who were guiltleſs: And if that <hi>diſtinction</hi> cannot be made, or, the damages exceed their abilities; then, condign ſatisfaction ſhould be made out of their <hi>Common purſe,</hi> who intruſted thoſe with the <hi>Publick-Faith:</hi> For, the greateſt part of the <hi>People</hi> have often been too careleſs upon whom they impoſe that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and perhaps, will be more wary, when they have well paid for it, what perſons they chuſe; and be ſo wiſe, as to conſider, that they who have not wit enough to govern their private eſtates, or they who conſume many thouſands of pounds, in Ale houſes, Inns and Taverns, (whoſe reckonings, as this <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant</hi> hears, are not yet paid) to procure themſelves to be Elected by Feaſtings and Drunkenneſs, had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably ſome worſe ends in being ſo prodigal, then a ſincere intention, to ſerve GOD, the King, and their Countrey.</p>
            <p>Yet, neither this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> nor as he believeth, many of the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders,</hi> do expect ſatisfaction ſhould be made them at full for all their damages, (though in juſtice it ought ſo to be) but conſidering the <hi>Publick wants,</hi> and other private mens neceſſities, as well as their own; with how much it may tend at this time to the ſettlement of Peace and Amity, that every man ſhould enjoy a comfortable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, they would reſt contented with ſo much only toward a repair, as might diſcharge them from their engagements occaſioned by the ſaid Loans and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſes, to the redeeming the loſs of their liberties, and to preſerve a competency proportionable to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

degrees, and the condition of their neareſt <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> which might be raiſed without overburthening any, if ſuch <hi>Expedients</hi> might be ſpeedily taken into conſideration, and vigorouſly proſecuted, as may be hereafter propoſed; whereas the courſe which is yet purſued, will neither be a means of relieving many, nor of ſo reconciling diſagreeing Parties, but that the Breaches will daily grow wider, and encreaſe Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities till they become irreconcileable; and kindle ſuch an univerſal flame by private fewds and vexatious ſuits, that it will never perhaps be quenched, whileſt ought is left unconſumed, or whileſt any conſiderable number of them, or of their Poſterities, are living, who were unhappily engaged againſt each other in the late war: And for prevention whereof, there will be no poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in nature, but by a general <hi>Forgiveneſs</hi> on all ſides, mediated by a moderate courſe, to preſerve in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different meaſure, that Intereſt by which each man may be comfortably maintained: For, until that be ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeavoured, proſecuting the rigour of the Laws, by impriſoning, ſuing, hanging, beheading and quartering will terriſie few of thoſe who have neither eſtates to loſe, nor an outward condition of life worth preſerve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Nor in ſuch caſes will preaching the principles of <hi>morality,</hi> or <hi>Evangelical Precepts</hi> prevail much, but with men, naturally meek, (or perhaps cowardly) or ſuch as are of ſo true a Chriſtian and ſanctified a temper, that, according to the doctrine and example of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they can freely forgive their enemies, and ſubmit to any thing, wherewith it ſhall pleaſe GOD to permit the <hi>Supream Power</hi> to exerciſe their Faith and Patience; which number is ſo ſmall in reſpect of the reſt of thoſe who are at this time exaſperated, in relation to their Eſtates, Credits and Conſciences, (as

they will pretend at leaſt) that the Publick charge, which the preſent Government may be conſtrained yearly to continue, will amount to more, then that which would ſuffice to calm their ſpirits, by a repair of their deſtructive damages: And yet their ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by violence, may paradventure alſo, be prolonged, until ſome advantage be gotten by the changeableneſs of humane affairs, to let their fury break forth in ſuch a time as may deſtroy or endanger that <hi>peace,</hi> which they deſire to preſerve: For, an Army is a ſecurity which hath in it, neither certainty nor ſafety. It being therefore this <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> principle, not only to ſeek the preſervation of that <hi>viſible Power</hi> whereto God ſubjects him, out of prudence and moral gratitude, becauſe it protects him; but even for conſcience ſake alſo, (though it ſhould oppreſs him, as the laſt did) he thinks it his duty to give a <hi>Caveat,</hi> whereby they whom it ſhall concern, may take it into conſideration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both <hi>Parties</hi> which have oppoſed each other, are not in ſome reſpect ſo equally guilty of the ſins occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the <hi>Judgements</hi> under which they have lain toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or by turns; and whether it will not be their next and ſafeſt way to a <hi>general peace,</hi> to divide the burthen which now lies deſtructively upon many, to be born by the whole <hi>Nation,</hi> and to make it as eaſie, as Juſtice and Prudence will permit, by an impartial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the intereſt of all Parties concerned: To which end, ſomewhat ſhall be propoſed before the concluſion of this <hi>Remonſtrance;</hi> not Magiſterially, to be ſtrictly ſo or ſo proſecuted; but rather, to be a hint of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that purpoſe, to be deliberately determined by wiſer men.</p>
            <p>It will be pertinent to <hi>common peace,</hi> to take notice how many hundred thouſands are at this time exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,

by being nigh totally deſtroy'd or much impoveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by the loſs of their livelihoods &amp; liberties, with little hope of remedy: Some, by impriſonment upon mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſuggeſtions only, without any cauſe of offence given; ſome by being deprived of their monies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, lent or contributed upon the <hi>Publick Faith,</hi> to that Power whereto they heretofore ſubmitted conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly, or by compulſion; ſome by being ejected forcibly out of Lands, Offices, or other Eſtates by them Purchaſed, and formerly belonging to the King, Queen, Prince, Prelates, and ſuch as were then reputed De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents; ſome by taking up, on valuable conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, thoſe Lands or Offices from the firſt or ſecond Purchaſers and Poſſeſſors, in ſatisfaction, or in relation to debts, jointures, childrens portions, or other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral Contracts, Securities, or Engagements; and ſome by great ſumms expended in buildings or other improvements, borrowed from many who are quite undone by their diſability to repay it; occaſioning ſuits and quarrels no leſs deſtructive to them, then to the original <hi>Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders.</hi> And not a few thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands are as much diſcontented upon other civil and conſcientious accounts, whom to provoke altogether, may be of dangerous conſequence, though the Kings <hi>Indulgence</hi> hath much qualified and ſettled the minds and eſtates of ſome: For little advantaged will they be by a <hi>pardon</hi> for <hi>life,</hi> who needed it, or for ought elſe criminal, who are put into a worſe condition by <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi> then to be executed ten times by the hang-man. The natural temper of this Nation, is for theſe reſpects much to be regarded, and they are accordingly to be dealt withall; as it was prudently counſelled by King <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, upon his death-bed to his Son, whoſe words I will here inſert as not impertinent. <hi>I charge thee</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:44454:11"/>
(ſaid he) <hi>before God, to miniſter the Law indifferently to all, to eaſe the oppreſſed, to beware of flatterers, not to deferr</hi> Juſtice, <hi>nor yet to be ſparing of mercy; puniſh the oppreſſors of thy people, ſo ſhalt thou obtain favour of God, and love and fear of thy</hi> Subjects, <hi>who whileſt they have</hi> wealth, <hi>ſo long ſhalt thou have their obedience; but, made poor by oppreſsions, will be ready to make Inſurrections; Rejoyce not ſo much in the glory of thy</hi> Crown, <hi>as meditate on the burthenous care which accompanies it.

            <p>This <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> conceives, he might have procured many thouſand hands ſubſcribed to atteſt the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of this <hi>Caution,</hi> and of what elſe is in this <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> expreſſed or deſired; but he endeavoured it not, becauſe, he thinks it will be needleſs to wiſe men, who very well know, that common cheat ſignifies little or nothing, as hands are uſually procured. When <hi>Reaſon</hi> prevails not more then <hi>Voices,</hi> there is ſmall hope of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> And, as it was ſaid to <hi>Dives, They who will not believe</hi> Moſes <hi>and the</hi> Prophets, <hi>will not believe one ſent from the dead.</hi> So, may this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> ſay, <hi>They, who will not be moved to do conſcionable and righteous things, for the ſake of Juſtice and Mercy, will little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard Remonſtrances or Petitions, ſubſcribed with many thouſand hands, till they feel them about their ears; or, until the vengeance of GOD ſeizes on them, as it lately did on thoſe who neglected good Cautions, until they had not power to put them in execution.</hi> Miſconſter not this, as a ſecret threat to any in <hi>Authority;</hi> for it is humbly and ſoberly intended, to be only a <hi>Memorandum,</hi> uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at this time, wherein all have not the patience of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44454:12"/>
               <hi>Saints,</hi> who are grieved or oppreſſed. That, <hi>which hath been,</hi> may be again <hi>hereafter;</hi> and there be among thoſe who are now depreſſed, ſome of thoſe <hi>Anointed-ones</hi> of the LORD, whom he will not permit to be harmful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touched without <hi>Vengeance:</hi> For, he hath other <hi>Anointed-ones</hi> beſide <hi>Kings,</hi> whom he often reproves for their ſakes; and verily he will not forget the poor for ever, though to humble them for their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he hideth his face from them for a ſeaſon; at leaſt, his <hi>Everlaſting Mercies,</hi> he will not take from them. God preſerve us from ſeditious and mutinous repinings; and give us all grace, from the loweſt to the higheſt, joyntly and ſeverally, to endeavour that which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents deſperate <hi>Activities,</hi> and take away every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of temptations thereunto: For, though meek and conſcientious men, will, as they ought to do, wait pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently upon GOD in all their ſufferings; yet meer natural men, (of which ſort, the greateſt number of thoſe many thouſands conſiſt, who are made almoſt deſperately careleſs of their lives) will not eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to <hi>Evangelical</hi> principles, (as is before implyed) but, perhaps, when their perſonal wants are aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the importunings and upbraidings of Creditors, the neglects of friends, and the ſcorn of enemies, the jears of neighbours, and the cries of periſhing wives and children, it may ſo provoke them, that in ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, they will have as a little regard to <hi>Reaſon, Religion</hi> and <hi>Civil duties,</hi> as they had to their ſad <hi>Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> from whom they expected Juſtice or Compaſſion; and then like provoked <hi>Engliſh Maſtives,</hi> (the true <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> of <hi>Engliſh mens</hi> temper) fly upon Bulls, Bears or Lyons, without fear of their inequality in ſtrength and number, or into any dangerous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. Take it not therefore offenſively, that you are
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44454:12"/>
in this extraordinary manner forewarned thereof. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things have been this year permitted by way of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi> more then at other times. The <hi>Waters,</hi> which are the Peoples Hieroglyphick, have had ſeveral prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous <hi>motions;</hi> the <hi>Air,</hi> not a few portentuous impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; yea, the <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> alſo; and many other of GOD's creatures have contributed <hi>ſymptoms</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to our inſtruction, which ought to be well heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and are no ſuch <hi>Non ſignificants,</hi> as they would ſeem to think them, who do what they can to becloud them.</p>
            <p>It may be, the late <hi>Inſurrection</hi> of thoſe few, called <hi>Fifth-Monarchy-men,</hi> hath ſomewhat in it which tends to <hi>premonition:</hi> For, GOD and Nature never act or permit any thing in vain (no not the falling of a ſparrow to the ground, or the numbring of hairs) and, this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant,</hi> therefore, conceiving himſelf obliged to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his ſenſe thereupon, will make bold here to inſert it, that it may not be altogether fruitleſs. He truly profeſſeth he knew not one of thoſe perſons, ſo much as by <hi>name,</hi> and is as far from juſtifying that, or any ſuch attempt, as they who either <hi>martially</hi> or <hi>legally</hi> proſecuted them to their deſtruction in the fleſh. For, though <hi>Moſes</hi> ſlew the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> which oppreſſed an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> being then but a private perſon, <hi>Rahab</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federated with forraign ſpies, to the deſtruction of her native City; <hi>Jael</hi> infringed both a <hi>League</hi> and the <hi>Law of Hoſpitality,</hi> in killing <hi>Siſera;</hi> and <hi>Ehud,</hi> under colour of preſenting a <hi>Gift,</hi> and of being a <hi>Meſſenger</hi> from GOD, ſlew King <hi>Eglon,</hi> to whom he was a tributary <hi>Subject;</hi> and theſe had no doubt, ſecret warrants from GOD for thoſe <hi>irregular Actings,</hi> by a divine impulſe upon their ſpirits, making them content to hazard the deſtruction of their bodies to a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44454:13"/>
temporal condemnation in thoſe ſervices; but no ſuch <hi>ſecret</hi> ever entred into the ſoul of this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> nor doth he find his heart enclinable to act any thing not warrantable by the revealed will of GOD; becauſe, he finds, as well by what hath within his own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence befaln to ſome, as by the example of <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> that, men may be ſo deluded, by their own fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and corruptions, as to think the moſt barbarous cruelties are acts of <hi>Juſtice.</hi> Therefore he leaves the judgement of thoſe <hi>perſons,</hi> and of ſuch <hi>attempts,</hi> to thoſe unto whom they appertain, and to God, who only knows their hearts, their purpoſes and warrants, if they had any; and whoſe <hi>Mercies</hi> being infinite, and his <hi>Judgements</hi> paſt ſearching out, doth ſometime permit <hi>external Judgements</hi> to ſeize upon a <hi>few,</hi> to make way for <hi>many</hi> to eſcape them; and otherwhile expoſeth men to temporal cruelties, without mercy here, that an everlaſting <hi>mercy</hi> may be enjoyed hereafter. But, whatever thoſe <hi>perſons</hi> were in themſelves; or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever that <hi>attempt</hi> was in its own nature; this <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrant</hi> is very certain that it was a <hi>Providential permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> for their ſins and ours, hinting unto this <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> things very pertinent thereto; and foreſhewing ſomewhat to come, (if not prevented by Repentance and Amendment) which it will concern us to ſearch after, with as much diligence as we can. What it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly points at, he hath a dark view by a <hi>contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative Viſion,</hi> like an imperfect <hi>Apparition in the Air,</hi> which is not viſible enough to be aſcertained in words to other men; yet ſufficient he thereby diſcovereth to make it evident to himſelf, that ſuch previous conſiderations as theſe that follow, will be very needfull.</p>
            <p>Firſt, foraſmuch (as aforeſaid) GOD and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44454:13"/>
act or permit nothing in vain; It is to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the ſuddain riſing and deſperate attempt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-mentioned, tends to more then ſuch a vanity ſeems to be in it ſelf; and that the <hi>Circumſtances</hi> of the <hi>Fact,</hi> and the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of the <hi>perſons,</hi> may have much in them tending to the diſquiſition of what <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> intended.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It is to be conſidered, That if Moral and Religious men, being left to themſelves, may be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into ſuch dangerous extravagancies, what they may poſſibly be hurried into, who have neither honeſty nor Religion to reſtrain them, if GOD ſhould be then provoaked, to give way to their corruptions, when they are tempted by their <hi>Luſts,</hi> or exaſperated by <hi>Sufferings,</hi> which they conceive injuriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If upon a miſtaken <hi>Principle,</hi> a few perſons, ſeduced to take up <hi>carnal weapons</hi> to proſecute a <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual warfare,</hi> might be ſo encouraged, and elevated in their ſpirits, as to out-dare the whole Power of one of the greateſt and moſt populous Cities in the world; even when her Citizens were in Arms, in readineſs upon their <hi>guards,</hi> and the <hi>Militia</hi> of the whole Kingdom without her walls, in a defenſive and an offenſive poſture, to aſſiſt if need were: It is very conſiderable, what the effect thereof might be, if the whole Body of GOD's <hi>Elect</hi> in theſe Nations, ſpirited by an unqueſtionable belief, grounded upon his promiſes, ſhould engage all together as one man in his <hi>Cauſe,</hi> armed with all the ſpiritual weapons offenſive and defenſive.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is obſervable, that thoſe <hi>Impulſes</hi> which are termed <hi>Phanaticall,</hi> and thoſe <hi>perſons</hi> who are agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by them, are neither to be ſlighted, nor incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately treated withall: Becauſe, if they be moved
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44454:14"/>
by <hi>divine Inſtinct,</hi> (which may be diſcernable) as <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his Armour-bearer were, two of them will be able to rout a whole <hi>Garriſon,</hi> ten to chaſe an hundred, and an hundred to put a thouſand to flight. If they be ſtirred up, but by a meer <hi>Phanatique deluſion,</hi> they may accidentally, be ſufficiently ſpirited, thereby to vanquiſh a Power, much ſuperiour to themſelves in ſtrength and number, as it hath often happened, <hi>when unequal Armies have joyned battle,</hi> and the <hi>ſuperſtitious vulgar</hi> were prepoſſeſſed by ſome ominous conceit or preſage divulged among them: As for inſtance, at the battle of <hi>Agencourt,</hi> (if the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> remembrance fails him not) when the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> over-powered by their numerous Adverſaries, ten (nay twenty to one) as ſome writers affirm, (when their ſtrength was ſpent, by ſickneſs and wearineſs, and they quite ſurrounded, and ſeeming without hope of eſcaping an utter defeat) a <hi>prediction</hi> being divulged among them, which had long before preſaged, that the <hi>ſtones of the field</hi> ſhould riſe up for them againſt the <hi>French:</hi> GOD, who is the giver of <hi>Victories,</hi> permitted that deſpicable means, to be inſtrumental thereto; for, <hi>weapons failing,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> thereby encouraged, took up <hi>ſtones,</hi> and obtained the moſt <hi>ſignal Victory,</hi> that ever was gotten in theſe parts of the world. And the moſt famous <hi>Captains</hi> among the Antients, made uſe of <hi>Auguries, Predictions,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>mediums,</hi> to ſtir in their <hi>ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery</hi> ſuch <hi>impulſes,</hi> as we call <hi>Phanatique,</hi> and very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thereby prevailed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If a handful of men (as it were) upon a conſcientious account only, built upon a falſe ground, without being moved with reſpect to their <hi>perſonal damages or intereſts,</hi> could be ſo deſperately and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately reſolved: It is conſiderable, what the deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44454:14"/>
of ſo many hundred thouſands may amount unto; who are or may be exaſperated through unſufferable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencies and oppreſſions, making them careleſs of their lives, by defect of all things pertinent to a comfortable life; they having therewith no ſenſe of <hi>Morality, Piety,</hi> or <hi>Conſcience</hi> to reſtrain them, propoſed nothing but <hi>vengeance;</hi> and GOD ſhould then alſo, therewith let looſe the fury of others, whoſe malevolence and diſcontents are not yet much heeded, to make them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental for the deliverance of thoſe from <hi>Oppreſsion,</hi> have meekly ſubmitted their Cauſe to him only. For know, that they who are eminent for nothing ſo much, as for their prodigality, whoreing, roaring, drinking or ſwearing; and valiant only in Baudy-houſes and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, will run away like ſheep before reſolute aſſayl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, made deſperate as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Know alſo, that the <hi>LORD of Hoſts,</hi> who is the GOD of <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as of <hi>Grace,</hi> is General of a two-fold <hi>Militia,</hi> furniſhed with diſtinct weapons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſeveral ſervices whereby they are to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie him; the one <hi>Natural,</hi> and the other <hi>Spiritual;</hi> and that he makes uſe of both to correct his <hi>Children,</hi> and deſtroy the <hi>Enemies</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as occaſion is given. The firſt he employeth in ſhedding the blood of his <hi>malicious oppoſers,</hi> or of <hi>incorrigible ſervants,</hi> ſometime, with hazzard or loſs of their own; and the other, (if need be) he engageth in <hi>ſufferings,</hi> and by contributing their own blood alſo in his <hi>Cauſe;</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging to that end, thoſe offenſive and defenſive <hi>wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons</hi> only, which are proper to a <hi>ſpiritual warfare.</hi> Theſe laſt, are thoſe followers of the <hi>Lamb</hi> whither ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goeth, who are <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Souldiers,</hi> in the moſt ſuper-eminent degree; to whom the other uſually make way by the violence of natural Faculties and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44454:15"/>
to thoſe <hi>Conqueſts</hi> over <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,</hi> which muſt be compleated by <hi>Patience, Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Love, conſtancy in Faith</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> And many of the former may be <hi>Saints</hi> alſo, who when their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural corruptions</hi> have been ſoaked in their own <hi>blood,</hi> or <hi>ſufferings,</hi> and the ſtains waſhed out, by being rinſed in the blood of the <hi>Lamb,</hi> ſhall have a ſhare both in his <hi>Victories</hi> and <hi>Triumphs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Permit, I pray you, this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> with patience and candor, to purſue this plain-dealing a little further, and to add ſomewhat for vindication of himſelf, from thoſe miſ-interpretations which may be made of his honeſt and peaceable intentions, in theſe <hi>free expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:</hi> For, when he calls to mind, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were charged with <hi>ſedition,</hi> for innocently Preaching the peaceable glad-tidings of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> for their ſafety to whom they preached them; and that ſome of the <hi>Prophets</hi> were impriſoned and perſecuted as ſeditious perſons, when they declared GOD's <hi>Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and what ought to have been performed for preſervation of their <hi>Common ſafety;</hi> he thinks it not unlikely, in this froward <hi>Generation,</hi> that ſome <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> of that kind may be made againſt him, by their Pride, Malice, or Ignorance, who proſecute their ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ends; And he being neither inſenſible, nor totally careleſs of thoſe diſadvantages which may befall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, nor ignorant how eaſie it is to find wherewith to beat a dog; will now (leſt he may be reſtrained from that liberty hereafter) preoccupate as much as he can, whileſt he may, to prevent <hi>prejudicacy</hi> (if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) by giving reaſons for his Remonſtrating to the purpoſes afore-mentioned, and in this unuſual mode.</p>
            <p>He knows how far the juſt bounds of a <hi>free expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:44454:15"/>
extends by the Laws of <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Nature;</hi> and though his <hi>body</hi> may be enſlaved, and kept from the exerciſe thereof by the cruelty of others, his <hi>mind</hi> cannot be inthralled, but by his own baſeneſs or puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanity; and if he muſt periſh, he is reſolved to periſh like a <hi>man,</hi> not like a <hi>beaſt,</hi> or like one who cuts his own throat for fear of death. He will not whine like a <hi>cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog,</hi> or ſnarl at him, when he is beaten or kickt by his <hi>Maſter;</hi> nor cry like a <hi>Swine,</hi> when he is to be ſlain by the Butcher, or ringed for his rooting; nor doth he think himſelf obliged at this time, to be as dumb before his ſhearers, as CHRIST was; nor until a time comes (as it did to him) wherein <hi>words</hi> will either be wholly in vain, or may tend to prevent that <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> whereunto he ſhall believe he was pre-ordained by <hi>Providence,</hi> for his <hi>Maſters</hi> glory, or for the welfare of other men; and then he will leave <hi>ſcribling,</hi> and bear his <hi>Croſs</hi> in ſilence. But it is yet, ſeaſonable for him to write and ſpeak, and if he now do it not, he may for ever hereafter hold his Peace; for it will be to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. He writes and ſpeaks, with the more boldneſs, becauſe it is not for his own <hi>Intereſt;</hi> but as it lies wrapt up with the <hi>Publick Honour, Peace,</hi> and <hi>Welfare,</hi> and is preſervable, without injury to other <hi>private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi> He acknowledgeth himſelf ſubject to the natural deſires, fears, frailties and infirmities of the weakeſt men; yet, GOD, by his <hi>Grace,</hi> hath (as he hopeth) ſo habituated him to the <hi>Principles,</hi> which will preſerve him in a warrantable <hi>ſobriety,</hi> that he ſhall dread no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but GOD and <hi>himſelf;</hi> or leſt by ignorance he may offend againſt his own <hi>Conſcience;</hi> in which caſe he is one of the verieſt <hi>Cowards</hi> in the world. He nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth nor can willingly intend hereby the juſt offence of any: For he hates nothing, that GOD
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44454:16"/>
hath made, <hi>loves</hi> him above all things; his <hi>neighbour</hi> as <hi>himſelf;</hi> and his <hi>Countrey</hi> (if his heart deceive him not) much better. He honours the <hi>King,</hi> and is, and will be, as faithful unto him, as he was to thoſe who lately exerciſed <hi>Supream Authority;</hi> to whom, he was conſcientiouſly faithful to the laſt hour, wherein GOD permitted them to retain it; never diſſembling, jugling, or halting between two <hi>Parties;</hi> yea, though he was neglected and oppreſſed by thoſe to whom he was obedient. He that hath no <hi>ſelf-love,</hi> is as blameable, as he which hath too much, becauſe he wants that rule whereby he ought to regulate a Love to his <hi>neighbour;</hi> and he who to his power, provides not for his <hi>Family,</hi> is worſe then an <hi>Infidel.</hi> Therefore, no malevolent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining or diſcontent, but a Chriſtian regard to his duty, and to thoſe many who are oppreſſed (which is enough to make a dumb man ſpeak) hath extracted this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance,</hi> quickned with a little more Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury, then uſual, that (if he ſhould live ſo long) he might not ſolicit in vain for Juſtice twenty years longer, but have a ſpeedy diſpatch one way or other. For, <hi>Qui rogat timidè, docet negare,</hi> he, who ſneakingly demands <hi>Juſtice,</hi> as if he were begging an <hi>Alms,</hi> encourages his oppreſſors the more impudently to oppreſs him. And yet, perhaps, he had not adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to expreſs himſelf in this mode, if an unreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impulſe had not made impreſſions on his heart, more for the ſakes of others, then for his own.</p>
            <p>For, though this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> hath had many provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations thereunto, by the loſs of his moſt precious time, with the ruine of his eſtate and credit; thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands perhaps, have ſuffered as much as he that way, whom patience, fear, or ſtupidity have kept ſilent; and it would be a ſhame to him not to ſuffer as mutely as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44454:16"/>
other men; alſo he is reduced to a ſubſiſtence by <hi>Charity;</hi> but, that hath brought with it ſuch experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental evidences, of Gods merciful ſupplying a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency from day to day hitherto, that the damage is not only made thereby ſupportable, but comfortable alſo: and in this kind, he hath ſuffered no more then the King, and many perſons of honour have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed withal. This <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> hath likewiſe been made the ſcorn and deriſion of his enemies, neighbours and acquaintance, and is frequently perſecuted with uncivil upbraidings; but, he can paſs them over with as little regard, as the barkings of dogs, when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders what <hi>Shimeies</hi> they are, who ſet them on, why, and to what purpoſe: That, which above all this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts him, are the ſufferings which have ſuddenly befaln to ſome of his needy <hi>Creditors,</hi> and moſt near and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved <hi>Relations;</hi> who, not accuſtomed to the want of food, rayment, and ſuch other neceſſaries or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies as they formerly enjoyed, look otherwhile ſo ſadly upon him, that it makes his bowels yern: Yet, it may be, neither had that been moving enough to embol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den him hereunto: But, when to all theſe inducements, there ſeemed to be added, in his apprehenſion, a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood of multiplying thoſe Confuſions, Oppreſſions, and Innovations, which will be a diſhonour to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>King,</hi> and theſe <hi>Nations;</hi> (and as well hazzardous to the <hi>Common peace,</hi> as deſtructive to him and others in their private capacities) this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> thought it better to adventure the tranquility of one man, then to let ſo many be in danger of periſhing, by continuing ſheepiſhly ſilent: And he confeſſes there is ſomewhat of <hi>ſelfneſs,</hi> even in that alſo; becauſe, he is afraid his own Conſcience would accuſe him for neglect of his duty, and bring greater diſtempers upon him, for his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44454:17"/>
being ſilent at ſuch a time, then thoſe evils which he might hope thereby to eſcape: For, GOD having carried him, a long time through many viciſſitudes and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, giving him frequent experiments what the events of his own and other mens tranſactions were, and will be, (with an ability in ſome meaſure more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, to illuſtrate to vulgar capacities, thoſe things which are conſiderable) he dares not preſume to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe and inrage his Conſcience, to avoid the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of men, whatſoever outward diſadvantages may happen. Theſe things conſidered, with thoſe <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> which are due by the Law of <hi>Nature,</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives neither any <hi>digreſsion</hi> or <hi>expreſsion</hi> herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained is needleſs, or can be juſtly queſtionable; and that, he is not obliged (his preſent condition being weighed) to make anſwer unto ought objected, which may tend to the accuſing of himſelf, though he were as blameable as he is innocent. For, he intends nothing to the iniury of <hi>Publick</hi> or <hi>private Intereſts;</hi> nor ſeeks for ought but his own according to Juſtice, that he may do <hi>Juſtice</hi> to his <hi>Creditors</hi> and <hi>Relations.</hi>

            <p>They who live at eaſe in plenty; becauſe, they ſee ſome appearances of a progreſs toward the relief of this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> and other <hi>ſufferers,</hi> do condemn them as over haſty, and more importunate then they need to be: Yea, are pleaſed to ſay, that much more is done for them already, then they deſerve; and that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall be done for them, they will never be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which <hi>Aſſeverations</hi> are better evidences of their diſ-affection to the <hi>ſufferers,</hi> and of their want of true <hi>Charity,</hi> then of the truth of that which they affirm: And, it is the very ſame which was imputed to this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant,</hi> at ſeveral times, during his almoſt twenty years ſolicitation, by ſome who were formerly in Power,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44454:17"/>
when he Petitioned to be relieved for his ſufferings in their <hi>ſervice;</hi> and how juſtly they did it, may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the <hi>literal ſenſe,</hi> of this <hi>metaphorical il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration</hi> thereof: He complained of a <hi>conſuming fire,</hi> whereinto they permitted him to be thrown by their <hi>neglects;</hi> and after he had long complained, they for a remedy, toſt him into a <hi>boyling Caldron;</hi> that, not contenting him, they threw him into a <hi>Frying-pan;</hi> therewith he being no more eaſed, renewed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and then, they laid him upon a <hi>Gridiron;</hi> that being as painful, they turned him upon his <hi>other ſide;</hi> that, proving as uneaſie, he Petitioned again, and was only baſted with a few <hi>Oylie words,</hi> or had Orders pin'd on him, like papers to keep roaſt-beef from burning; he then once again, made an humble addreſs for more effectual means of relief; whereto ſome of them angrily replyed, <hi>Nothing will ſatisfie this fellow:</hi> and ſeeing none of the former <hi>condeſcentions,</hi> would give ſatisfaction, they at laſt caſt him into a <hi>freezing Lake,</hi> wherein he yet remains; and, but that the <hi>Charity</hi> of others, did otherwhile a little <hi>thaw</hi> him, he ere this time had been frozen to death, and laid where ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances</hi> as theſe are needleſs. Theſe are the <hi>Favours</hi> which this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> obtained, from thoſe whom he ſerved faithfully and conſcientiouſly heretofore, though he were perſonally known well near to all of them, and though moſt of them were his <hi>familiar acquaintance,</hi> and ſome of them his <hi>profeſſed friends:</hi> Which when he ſeriouſly conſiders, and how he hath nevertheleſs been from time to time, ſo many years together, neglected and abuſed; he can hardly diſcern whether hath been more injurious unto him, <hi>neighbours,</hi> or <hi>ſtrangers; hypocrites,</hi> or <hi>prophane perſons; ſeeming friends,</hi> or <hi>open enemies;</hi> his <hi>Countrey-men,</hi> or ſome of his <hi>own kindred.</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:44454:18"/>
But, now he hopes better; for, worſe they cannot uſe him, whom he oppoſed for their ſakes, when they were in <hi>Power.</hi> And, if that obedience which he now profeſſeth unfeignedly to his <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> ſhall procure ſo much reſpect to his preſent condition, as to allow out of what he thought his own, wherewith to diſ-engage him from his <hi>Creditors,</hi> and redeem his <hi>Family</hi> from that poverty, which now oppreſſeth it, he ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be therewith contented, but thankfully acknowledge alſo, to the honour of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> that he finds them, whom he had made his enemies, to be much more juſt and merciful unto him, then his profeſſed friends, of whom he had beſt deſerved: And it may be poſſible, that their <hi>Generoſitie,</hi> whatſoever he hath heretofore done (or here, or elſewhere expreſſed) will make them as confident of his <hi>Allegiance,</hi> as they are of the moſt faithful of thoſe, who profeſs obedience and conformity to the Government, and in the moſt uſual mode.</p>
            <p>Let it not ſeem unſavoury to any <hi>Reader,</hi> that this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> inſiſts ſo much upon his perſonal ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and <hi>grievances:</hi> For, by them he became ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of other mens Oppreſſions: By the reality of his own <hi>wrongs,</hi> he perceived what juſt cauſe others might have to complain: Alſo, without particularizing his <hi>ſufferings,</hi> they could not probably be redreſſed; and no reaſonable or conſcientious man, will grudge him the liberty of inſerting a leaf or two into that <hi>diſcourſe,</hi> which was for the relief of many, together with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; compoſed ſolely at his coſt and labour, without the leaſt contribution thereunto vouchſafed, either by them or any other: For he may ſay on his own behalf, as <hi>Uliſſes</hi> did, when he pleaded for the armour of <hi>Achilles</hi> before the <hi>Grecians.</hi>

            <p>But, the means hitherto provided for the relief of this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> and other <hi>Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders,</hi> doth not yet appear likely to have that gracious effect, which was by them expected, and intended by his Majeſty. Therefore, he prayes it may not be offenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken, if he declares plainly, what the effects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hitherto are, and may probably be hereafter, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his underſtanding: For, his purpoſe being to expreſs nothing but in order to the preſervation of himſelf and others from deſtruction, (nor to be more bold in language, then the heedleſneſs of this <hi>Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> ſhall conſtrain) it cannot be juſtly conceived that he would wilfully inſert any word or clauſe, which might by giving juſt offence, deprive him of that benefit which he deſireth to attain; unleſs it be thought his <hi>Oppreſsions</hi> have made him <hi>mad;</hi> (as many wiſer men have been, who ſuffered leſs) and if ſo, he is rather an Object of <hi>pitty,</hi> then of <hi>diſpleaſure.</hi> He is thankful to his <hi>Majeſtie,</hi> for not taking thoſe advantages at large, which were <hi>providentially</hi> put into his hands; and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acknowledgeth the <hi>Indulgence</hi> vouchſafed to <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers</hi> by his <hi>Commiſsion,</hi> for mediating on their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, manifeſt his <hi>compaſsion</hi> to be more then their own <hi>Truſtees</hi> have expreſſed; eſpecially his often haſtening the <hi>Act of General pardon,</hi> and deſiring the <hi>Parliament</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:44454:19"/>
to make the <hi>Plaiſter</hi> as large as the <hi>ſoares;</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> drawn up to thoſe purpoſes, ſeems not to have paſſed through their hands, who are ſo ſenſible of his Peoples Grievances, as he himſelf was, nor is it poſſible that he can in ſo ſhort a time have that full cognizance, which he may have hereafter, of the true ſtate of thoſe many <hi>differing Cauſes,</hi> which are to come under conſideration, in relation to <hi>Purchaſers;</hi> and therefore the means by him intended may be ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective without his default, that many will be more damnified, then relieved thereby. This is found and felt by experience already. The work impoſed is too heavy for ſo few <hi>work-men,</hi> in regard the <hi>Commiſsion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> are perſons of honour, who have other weighty affairs which will divert them, and take up ſo much time, that not a few being already quite ruined by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay; many more will be deſtroyed before their <hi>Cauſes</hi> can be heard and determined. Some of them have ſo little whereby to ſubſiſt, that they cannot ſpare out of it, ſo much as the charge of Solicitation will require. And it is feared, moſt of thoſe who are yet able, will be wheeled round in ſuch <hi>perpetual motions,</hi> as they were at <hi>Worceſter</hi> and <hi>Drury-houſes,</hi> to their impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing alſo, by the long conteſts which will ariſe from ſeveral interfering <hi>Securities, Intereſts,</hi> and <hi>Claims,</hi> ſtill multiplying debates and expences; when ſo many thouſands as are engaged by <hi>Original Purchaſes</hi> and <hi>Subcontracts,</hi> ſhall from all parts betwixt Saint <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaels-mount</hi> and <hi>Barwick</hi> (ſome of them two or three hundred miles from their habitations) flock together, with witneſſes, Counſel and Sollicitours, to their great coſt here, and neglect of their buſineſſes at home. Such a multitude cannot but ſo obſtruct each others proceedings, that many who are beſt able to bear the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:44454:19"/>
burthen, may be ſore ſtraitened and depreſſed, by loſſes in one place, and expences in another; by ſeeing <hi>Officers</hi> and making <hi>Friends,</hi> for that which will amount to little or nothing at the laſt: For, of much of thoſe Lands which were Purchaſed, as aforeſaid, the <hi>Prelates</hi> have not power to make Leaſes for longer term, then during their own lives; and there being no Rule ſetled by <hi>Parliament,</hi> whereby final Agreements may be made (in that, and ſome other Caſes, without diſpute) the <hi>Purchaſers</hi> will have as queſtionable <hi>Titles</hi> hereafter, as they have now; and be perhaps all dead or beggared, before any ſatisfaction ſhall be enjoyed.</p>
            <p>As for the Lands claimed by the <hi>Prelates,</hi> there is little hope the late <hi>Purchaſers</hi> will have any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able redreſs in lieu of them, if the ſaid <hi>Prelates</hi> be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to proceed as they begin; for (except two or three of them only, as this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> hath heard, who perhaps deſire the <hi>Epiſcopal Function</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the Priſtine Conſtitution) ſo ambitious are they of Preheminence, and ſo greedily hunt after immoderate Riches in their old age, that regarding neither the tears of the oppreſſed, nor Orders of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> nor the <hi>Kings</hi> gracious condeſcentions publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed on the behalf of <hi>Purchaſers;</hi> they following the dictates of their own Avarice, take up the whole Rents, make forcible Entries, grant Leaſes to them who will give moſt, and Arbitrarily ſeize the eſtates of the <hi>Purchaſers,</hi> before the times limited are expired, or the <hi>Kings Commiſsioners</hi> can have time to take their Cauſes into conſideration; and before many can have means to preſent them, or be in a capacity to treat. This <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> in particular, having now loſt about eight years 300. <hi>l. per an.</hi> in a Purchaſe of their Lands who were hererofore called <hi>Delinquents,</hi> which Lands coſt

Alſo 1681. <hi>l.</hi> 15. <hi>s.</hi> 8. <hi>d.</hi> charged by <hi>Ordinance</hi> upon the Exciſe in Courſe, which, with the Intereſt thereof, hath been eighteen years almoſt, unpaid. And now he is in danger to loſe totally between five and ſix hundred pounds <hi>per. an.</hi> more, in <hi>Prelates Lands,</hi> in Poſſeſſion and Reverſion; part whereof coming into poſſeſſion the laſt year, being unſtockt, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſable, by reaſon the Title is diſparaged, hath coſt him in Taxes, with other duties and neceſſary disburſments therein diſpended, more then twice ſo much as he could raiſe out of them, by occaſion of the ſaid <hi>Prelates</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Intruſions: The remainder of this <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> ſtock and goods, were by Attachments out of the ſaid <hi>Prelates</hi> own <hi>Court,</hi> (without arreſt, or any cauſe formerly made known, according to equity, or the <hi>Common-Law</hi> of this Land) illegally (and ſome of them, as he thinks, feloniouſly) taken in the night, and carried away, by the ſaid <hi>Prelates</hi> Officers or Agents, being ſtrangers, without any known <hi>lawful Officer.</hi> And, the ſaid <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> neither being at home, nor having the liberty of his perſon, or any other means left to defend himſelf againſt ſuch outrages, or to maintain his family, but by charity, is by this uſage, and that which hath been thereby occaſioned, deprived of as much of his eſtate, as being ſold to the value, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably diſtributed, might have ſatisfied moſt of his perſonal debts, had it not been ſo torn from him by ſome unconſcionable <hi>Creditors,</hi> and the ſaid Officers maliciouſly confederating together, to the taking away, at the third part of the value, the remainder of his houſhold-ſtuff, wearing apparrel, victuals, and the beds whereon his wife, children, and ſervants lay; as alſo the wood in his yard, without any other Authority, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:44454:20"/>
               <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> for the uſe of the Prelates now <hi>Tenant,</hi> who being reputed (perhaps becauſe a Papiſt) a true Son of the Church, is now ſeated upon that Farm, which he hath forcibly ſeized; ſome of his ſaid <hi>Agents</hi> being ſo ſhameleſs, as to make anſwer, when the illegality of their proceedings was objected, that this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> ſhould not be left able to proſecute his remedy at Law, or words to that effect, which they have made good: Inſomuch, that this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> is compelled in his old age, to ſhut up himſelf in a lone room, without a ſervant, night and day, both in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and health; his wife neceſſitated, above fifty miles diſtant, to keep poſſeſſion, with her maide in a naked houſe, ſtanding far from neighbours, (and much farther from honeſt men) and his children and ſervants being ſcattered, to ſeek harbour and livelihood where they can get it. This, and much worſe, is the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> preſent outward condition; by delay of the Relief hoped for, and by his being thereby diſabled to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute means of redreſſing his grievances any further: In the like condition (as he believeth) many thouſands are at this day among the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers, Lenders,</hi> and ſuch as fall under them, by the ruine of thoſe who are impoveriſhed by their wants.</p>
            <p>For, the hopes which they had eight or nine Moneths paſt, of a timely <hi>ſettlement,</hi> hath had ſo ſlow a progreſs, that many who had fair expectations, and beſt means to improve them, begin to be afraid, it may ſucceed at laſt, as in an old Tale, it is ſaid, befell to him, who brought a large piece of cloth to his Taylor, to make him ſuch garments as it would extend unto; who at firſt, told him, it would make a very good ſute, cloak, and coat; but after it had been in his cuſtody awhile, he ſaid to his cuſtomer, it would make but a ſute and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44454:21"/>
a cloak; after that, it would make but a cloak; being kept a little longer, he could make but a ſute of it; after a few dayes more, but a ſhort coat only; and at laſt, no more but a very fair <hi>Cloth-button:</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, with ſuch a Reſult ſome of the <hi>Purchaſers</hi> may button up their baggs of Papers and Evidences (if the <hi>King</hi> take not their Cauſes into his ſpecial Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) and go home three times more damnified, then by loſing all at firſt, without more coſt and trouble: For, when they have ſummed up the money, paid for their <hi>Purchaſes</hi> at firſt; for paſſing their <hi>Conveyances</hi> and Concomitant charges; <hi>Intereſt</hi> and Brockage for money borrowed; expences in ſuites at <hi>Common Law</hi> and <hi>Chancery</hi> thereby occaſioned; as alſo in Conteſts many years before <hi>Committees</hi> and <hi>Commiſsioners for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Obſtructions;</hi> and thereto added what it will coſt now, before there will be a final ſettlement, it may poſſibly amount to ſo much, that the recompence will be leſs worthy of thanks, then a peremptory denyal would have been at the beginning; as this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> hath found by experience; who verily believeth, that after his <hi>Demands</hi> and <hi>Receipts</hi> had been ſtated by the <hi>Committee of Accounts for the Kingdom,</hi> examined again by <hi>the Committee of the Navy;</hi> Re-examined by a <hi>ſelect Committee of Parliament,</hi> and upon that three-fold Examination, had 3950. <hi>l.</hi> reported to be due unto him, and payment then ordered; if he had totally quitted the ſaid debt, and hoped no more for it, he had been at leaſt 5000. <hi>l.</hi> richer, then he is at this day: For, if delayes occaſioning expences with the loſs of eighteen years time, and the money miſpent, and ſo long forborn, had been avoided, and other wayes employed, he might in that ſpace have turned it to more conſiderable profit. The Proverb ſaith, <hi>He that</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:44454:21"/>
               <hi>gives quickly, gives twice.</hi> A benefit vouchſafed ſpeedily, and ſeaſonably, may be doubled, yea tripled thereby, (as Opportunities may occur) whereas, by being long delayed, <hi>Suites, Forfeitures, Intereſt,</hi> or ſuch like, may ſo augment damages, that twice ſo much afterward, will not be ſo beneficial, as a quarter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of might have been at the firſt; and to deſtroy men under a colour of doing <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and ſhewing <hi>Mercy,</hi> is like the <hi>Cats</hi> playing with the <hi>Mouſe,</hi> (a making ſport at other mens miſeries) and one of the greateſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the world. In brief, by what is afore-expreſſed, this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> hath neither the liberty of his perſon to attend the <hi>Commiſsioners,</hi> nor wherewith, but by Charity, to ſubſiſt, much leſs to bear the charge of proſecution, ſo long as his cauſe may poſſibly be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined; yea, it will be little better then putting him all that while upon the Rack, yet peradventure be no more available at laſt, then meat ſet before a dead man.</p>
            <p>But, all this Remonſtrating is to little purpoſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſomewhat may be propoſed, out of which an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient</hi> ſhall be raiſed, whereby the <hi>Publick-Faith</hi> may be redeemed, and the <hi>Grants</hi> and <hi>Securities</hi> afore-mentioned be made good, or elſe a ſatisfaction given in ſuch manner, that particular Animoſities may be allay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without overburthening, or enſeebling the whole <hi>Body-Politick;</hi> which this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> thinking poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, will contribute his conceptions thereunto, though perhaps he may have little or no thanks, (but a jear) for his labour. And, though he be ſo broken in his eſtate, and overcharged with muſings in his mind, that he can hardly compoſe himſelf for ſuch a ſerious <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivement,</hi> yet he may ſtammer out ſuch <hi>notions,</hi> that wiſer men leſs diſturbed, may either make more practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44454:22"/>
or at leaſt, thereby take hints to diſcover and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute a better <hi>Expedient</hi> of their own: For, the moſt <hi>prudent men</hi> ſometimes overſee, what a <hi>Fool</hi> takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of. The only way to ſettle an univerſal Peace and Concord, is to ſatisfie all <hi>Intereſts,</hi> as much as may be; eſpecially in things neceſſary to a competent ſubſiſtence, even to the anſwering of their expectations, who are moſt carnal, ſo far forth as they are juſt; in regard they are likely to be moſt troubleſom. <hi>Venter non habet aures,</hi> and there are now ſo many laying claim to that Intereſt, as will make it dangerous, to exaſperate them all at once; and will be injuſtice to leave any of them unſatisfied, as touching reaſonable demands. They whoſe <hi>Grievances</hi> are moſt conſiderable, are ſuch as have <hi>Lent</hi> or <hi>Contributed</hi> upon the <hi>Publick-Faith; Souldiers,</hi> who adventured their lives in the ſervice of the <hi>Parliament; Purchaſers</hi> of Lands or eſtates belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>King, Queen, Prince, Prelates,</hi> or thoſe who heretofore adhered to the <hi>King</hi> againſt the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and ſuch as had either Grants of Eſtates, or <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Securities,</hi> for payment of debts declared to be due unto them. It cannot be now expected, that the Lands of the <hi>King, Queen, Prince,</hi> or ſuch as were heretofore reputed <hi>Delinquents,</hi> ſhould be enjoyed by the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers,</hi> except ſo far forth only, as in conſideration of Improvements, the former <hi>Owners</hi> will freely, of their own nobleneſs, give way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, if we look for a perfect concord on their part. And then, how the <hi>Purchaſers</hi> of thoſe Lands, and the <hi>Parliaments</hi> other <hi>Creditors</hi> may be ſatisfied, a courſe muſt be other wayes provided; which will be the more eaſily effected, and the leſs burthenſom, if the <hi>Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi> of <hi>Prelates eſtates,</hi> may have ſatisfaction out of the ſame Lands; as this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> conceives, in equity
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44454:22"/>

            <p>Thoſe <hi>Temporalities</hi> which they claim as <hi>Prelates,</hi> belonged not to them by <hi>divine right</hi> as <hi>Biſhops:</hi> but, were conferred in time of <hi>Popery,</hi> to ſupport them as <hi>Barons,</hi> when they were authorized to ſit in <hi>Parliament:</hi> which Priviledge, being taken away by <hi>Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> aſſented unto by the late <hi>King,</hi> that work is at an end: and <hi>work</hi> and <hi>wages</hi> being <hi>Relatives,</hi> ceaſe both together. <hi>Temporal</hi> and <hi>Spiritual Lords</hi> in a <hi>Parliament,</hi> reſemble plowing with Oxen and Aſſes in one teeme, and by weaving (as it were) Linnen and Wollen together, may make that <hi>Linſey-woolſey,</hi> both in Civil and Spiritual things, as will be pleaſing neither to GOD nor men. The <hi>ſervices</hi> whereto the <hi>Biſhops</hi> were chiefly ordained, may be beſt performed, (and with leaſt obſtruction to civil tranſactions) in <hi>Synods,</hi> or <hi>National Councils</hi> and <hi>Conventions,</hi> where no Lordly titles or uſurpations are to be claimed or allowed: nor any <hi>Precedencies,</hi> but for <hi>Orders ſake</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, leſt <hi>Precedencies,</hi> and <hi>temporal Dignities,</hi> may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awe their <hi>fellow-members,</hi> and diſadvantage the <hi>Truth.

And ſuch a Portion, being ſettled on them, and their ſucceſſors, by <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> as the <hi>Donations</hi> of <hi>Nurſing Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> (and not derived from heatheniſh or other ſuperſtitious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings diſhonourable to God, and ſcandalous to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) would redound more to their honour, then their <hi>Baronies</hi> and <hi>Lordſhips;</hi> be more comfortable to their Conſciences, when they muſt reſign their <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks;</hi> make their <hi>Miniſtry</hi> more effectual to their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Flocks, and to the preſerving of Unity in <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi> between thoſe <hi>Congregations</hi> which are of differing judgements; render their <hi>poſterities</hi> more proſperous, and their <hi>perſons</hi> more beloved both of GOD and men.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44454:23"/>
even to thoſe <hi>Prelates,</hi> who do but pretend to be the <hi>Biſhops of Chriſt,</hi> is, that they truly were ſo; and that they had humility enough to accept of ſuch an offer, on condition he wholly left his hope of repoſſeſſing his ſaid <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> though he thinks it more poſſible for him to be reſtored thereto, then for them long to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that wherewith they ſeem abſolutely inveſted. Let this be well conſidered; for though the <hi>Prelates</hi> and their <hi>Favourers,</hi> term him <hi>a Scribling Fool;</hi> The tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings of <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Fools,</hi> are ſometimes to be liſtned unto by wiſe and grave men, who know they often ſpeak <hi>Truth,</hi> when others either will not, or dare not.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>King</hi> ſhall by experience know, how uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the <hi>Prelacy</hi> is, both to him, and to the Church of GOD; and how ſerviceable ſuch as are called <hi>Biſhops</hi> may be, when reduced to the Canon of the <hi>Word,</hi> it is hoped, he may perſwade them to ſubmit thereto, and that ſome of them, will be ſo convinced in Conſcience, as to perceive it will be more honour to GOD and them, then diſparagement to their perſons, to evidence the power of Truth upon themſelves in an humble con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, and reſtrain them from unmercifully ſeeking to enrich themſelves by the deſtruction of ſo many Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies as are now in danger of periſhing by their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate Avarice. As for the reſt of the <hi>Hierarchie,</hi> this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> cannot imagine to what good end they may be continued, which will be equivalent to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the thouſandth part of that miſchief, which will enſue the diſpoſſeſſing of thoſe who have Purchaſed their eſtates. <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> with their <hi>Append<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants,</hi> are a <hi>Whimſey</hi> of a late invention, as now conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, which the <hi>Primitive Ages</hi> neither knew, nor perhaps thought of: A <hi>Plant</hi> which our <hi>Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

Moſt of thoſe vaſt <hi>Revenues</hi> which they claim as ſacred, (if not all) are no more worthy to be reputed <hi>Holy things</hi> then the price of dogs, or wages of <hi>Strumpets,</hi> as I have elſewhere ſaid, in regard much of them were obtained by merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing for the ſouls of men, and were Sacrifices to the <hi>Devil,</hi> worſe then <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> given (or exacted) by their cunning <hi>Brokers,</hi> in derogation from <hi>Chriſts</hi> me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious <hi>Paſsion,</hi> for expiating of Adulteries, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and other hainous crimes: Which if they could make evident to be <hi>ſacred Offerings,</hi> and accepted of God as truly ſuch, they might hope ere long to make men believe, that their houſes of Office, their very <hi>dunghills,</hi> yea, their <hi>ſins,</hi> or any thing they pleaſed ſo to term, were alſo ſacred. But, what reaſonable man can imagine, why ſuch an impertinency ſhould be preſerved, when the State is ſo neceſſitated, though it were ſome way uſeful, and when ſo many thouſands of ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and innocent perſons may be deſtroyed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admiſſion thereof? Whereto are they neceſſary? If you ſuppoſe it be to elect <hi>Biſhops,</hi> when they ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to what they Originally were and ought to be; that <hi>Conſtitution,</hi> will admit of no ſuch <hi>Election:</hi> Such as now are, may be as well choſen by the King himſelf, as by vertue of his Letters directed to the <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters;</hi> or more properly, by his <hi>Conge deſlere</hi> to the <hi>Paſtors</hi> of the reſpective <hi>Dioceſſes;</hi> which <hi>Presbyters</hi> may likewiſe officiate, (if need be) at their <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals</hi> by turns (having proviſion made for them at ſuch times) more to the edifying of the People then here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore: And their <hi>Cathedrals</hi> which, (to ſpeak truth)
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44454:24"/>
are more pertinent to the Civil honour and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the <hi>Nation,</hi> then eſſential to the Worſhip of GOD; (and being built, ought rather to be upheld, for decency and conveniency, then wholly neglected) and may ſo be, without any great burthen to the <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers,</hi> by contributing toward their Repair a yearly Rent to that purpoſe, if the old Fabrick Lands be not ſufficient, and unſold: Theſe may alſo, be of uſe for pious exerciſes and devout meetings, more to the glory of GOD, and the edifying of his People, then at preſent they are, by thoſe irreverent perſons, who ſerve their own ſelves only, under a pretence of ſerving GOD, with <hi>empty ounds, Tautologies, vain Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,</hi> and <hi>loud vociferations,</hi> mingled with abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prophaneneſs: For, this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> heard it late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credibly averred, that one of thoſe, who is to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee and direct thoſe who ſing in the <hi>Quire,</hi> hearing a diſcord in their Muſick, was ſo ſerious in his <hi>Muſicall Devotion,</hi> that moved to indignation, he paſſionately ſwore aloud in theſe words, <hi>By God, a ſnarle:</hi> And that another, angrily calling upon the <hi>Boyes</hi> to raiſe their Voices higher, curſed them with four ſeveral great Curſes within a little ſpace, whileſt they were chanting out their <hi>Divine Service,</hi> (as they call it) becauſe they anſwered not his expectation. Oh! <hi>abominable zeal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, ſhould it be granted, that GOD required their <hi>Will-Worſhip,</hi> that, they were conſcientiouſly devout therein; that, their <hi>Prelaticall Conſtitution,</hi> at leaſt were not ſcandalous, &amp; that their large poſſeſſions were the real charitable Donatives of truely devout Benefactors, irrevocably ſet apart from common uſe (not one of which particulars can be proved) yet, little or nothing conſiderable, is or ever was performed, to ſuch pious

uſes as are pretended, or were intended. For, by their own <hi>Canons</hi> (or, by ſuch as they approve of, and will be conformable unto, when it may be for their perſonal advantages) there is but a third part of their yearly Profits due to them. One third is by thoſe <hi>Canons</hi> to be employed in maintaining their <hi>Cathedral-Churches</hi> and <hi>dwelling-Houſes,</hi> with the ſervices and neceſſaries to them belonging: Another third, is to be for relief of the <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Strangers;</hi> and a charitable Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> (as the <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> remembers) was ſo far from the mind of our <hi>Prelates</hi> in theſe dayes, that to relieve the Poor in a time of Famine, he ſold away moſt part of the Utenſils and Ornaments of the Churches in his Dioceſs. A third part only, of the Revenues of the <hi>Cathedrals</hi> and <hi>Prelates,</hi> was to have been made uſe of for themſelves and their Families, which hath nigh quite ſwallowed up the other two parts: For, it is well enough remembred, how ruinous many of their <hi>Edifices</hi> were, before the beginning of the late war, and how ſlovenly kept in ſome places: It is alſo well known, that the <hi>Poor</hi> were uſually relieved with little more then the ſcraps of their ſuperfluities; and that the <hi>Strangers</hi> by them entertained, during the dayes of their <hi>Reſidency,</hi> were but their fellow <hi>Prebends,</hi> their <hi>kindred,</hi> their <hi>familiars,</hi> and now and then <hi>a bold Gueſt,</hi> who had no need of their <hi>Hoſpitality;</hi> and why ſhould many honeſt men, more ſerviceable then they, be ſtarved or beggared, by being deprived of what they bought of the <hi>Nations Repreſentative;</hi> that ſuch large Revenues might be ſhared by a few, and conſumed to ſo little purpoſe? With what confuſion of face, will theſe pretenders to <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Hoſpitality</hi> appear, when <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> perſonated in this life by their <hi>Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> or, when he ſhall hereafter in his own perſon,

            <p>This <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> is not ſo cruel to Beaſts nouriſhed out of curioſity, and for mens pleaſures only, as to ſtarve them when they are bred; much leſs that men unprofitably employed at the Publick coſt, ſhould be left deſtitute of a competent ſubſiſtence, when that abuſe is reformed; nor ought ſuch in his judgement to enjoy more then a juſt competency, much leſs ten times more then better deſerving perſons. All the whole <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> (as this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> is informed) doth not conſiſt of a much greater number, then thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> of whom <hi>Jezebel</hi> fed four hundred every day from her table; if ſo many of thoſe now in being, ſhall enjoy a <hi>plurality</hi> of <hi>Prebendaries, Parſonages, Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges</hi> and <hi>Spiritual promotions,</hi> as did heretofore: For, ſome had two or three <hi>Dignitaries,</hi> ſome more; and it the <hi>Hexameter</hi> of this well known Diſtich be a true me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial of it, one of them had five beſide his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by Uſury; (For the <hi>Pentameter</hi> concerned him not.)</p>

The <hi>Impropriations</hi> only, formerly belonging to the <hi>Prelates,</hi> (which are all nigh out of Leaſe) are worth yearly (as this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> is credibly informed) an hundred forty and two thouſand pounds.

Therefore, this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> hopes, that you whom it concerns, will conſider how imprudent an Act it will be thought by <hi>unbyaſſed</hi> men, in this and future generations, needleſly to hazzard the confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, deſpairations, exaſperations, and deſtruction of ſo many thouſands of Families as may be impoveriſhed, to the impoveriſhing of as many thouſands more by their poverty, if the ſale of Cathedral Lands ſhould be made void to the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers,</hi> for the ſuperfluous enriching of an inconſiderable number of uſeleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;

and for the pleaſing of a few, whoſe Claim and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt dies with their perſons, to the diſcontent of many whoſe right will never die, but ſtill revive, and continue for ever in their heirs; yea, and to do it contrary to Laws and Preſidents, for confirmation of the like ſales, judged agreeable to Juſtice and Equity, by Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Parliaments, and other grave Councils, upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation: And it is hoped alſo, if (as report goes) the <hi>Prelates</hi> intend out of their vaſt <hi>Fines</hi> and <hi>Rents,</hi> to raiſe and maintain two Regiments of Horſe in the Kings ſervice, to be continued by his favour in that which they repoſſeſs; it will be perceived, that they would but ſtick him down a <hi>feather,</hi> in lieu of the <hi>Gooſe</hi> which they have gotten: For, the <hi>Incomes</hi> of two of their <hi>Cathedral Revenues,</hi> will yearly defray that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and leave thoſe <hi>Proprietors</hi> of them, more then ever they heretofore poſſeſſed: And perhaps the King will take notice alſo, that (if it tend not to the beginning of another <hi>Prelatical war)</hi> it is at beſt offered but to make ſuch a <hi>diverſion</hi> for the preſent, as antiently ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, when to prevent the intention that former <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments</hi> had to take away their large Poſſeſſions for <hi>Publick Uſe;</hi> they then offered to their Kings a contribution, toward the recovering their right in <hi>France,</hi> or toward regaining of the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> (as they called it) which tended only to their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, though reſpect to them was thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> could alleadge much more, which is of Publick concernment, both in reference to what is laſt mentioned, and to the <hi>Publick-Faith;</hi> but, the times will not bear it: much <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as well as much <hi>Learning,</hi> would make ſome to grow <hi>mad;</hi> and it were imprudence to expreſs more then can be born, to the

rendring of that leſs effectual which is expreſſed. He had lived 36. years, when the laſt great Peſtilence broke in, whereof he was a <hi>Remembrance</hi> to this <hi>Nation;</hi> and having ſurvived ſince that time 36. years more, hath ſeen enough to give him cauſe to fear, that a worſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is beginning; which if GOD's extraordinary mercy prevents it not (by ſhortning thoſe dayes for his <hi>Elects</hi> ſake) may continue at leaſt 36. years together; even a <hi>Spiritual Peſtilence,</hi> intermixed with many na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Plagues and Diſtempers: For, ſome have begun to make way for it, by endeavouring how they may divert us, from heeding the <hi>True Antichriſt,</hi> and to draw this <hi>Generation,</hi> to look after a <hi>new Antichriſt,</hi> by ridiculouſly confining <hi>him,</hi> and the two <hi>witneſſes,</hi> to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, fraternities</hi> and <hi>places,</hi> which neither conſiſt with thoſe <hi>Terms, Qualifications, Tranſactions, Powers, civil Death</hi> and <hi>Reviving,</hi> which do manifeſt them, according to what is revealed in <hi>GOD's Word;</hi> nor with that <hi>univerſal Relation</hi> which they have to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and to the overthrow of the enemies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as will appear when that impudence is more evident; and when to ſee her deluſions, and to hate and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the WHORE, GOD ſhall put it into the heart of that King, with whom the <hi>tenth part</hi> of the myſterious <hi>Babylon</hi> ſhall fall from her.</p>
            <p>As for that <hi>ſcare-crow</hi> of a pretended <hi>Sacriledge,</hi> wherewith fools only are affrighted, and with which the <hi>Prelates</hi> ignorantly (if not impudently) charged as well many preceding <hi>Kings, Parliamenes,</hi> and perſons of Honour and Integrity, as the late Purchaſers of Cathedral Lands, it will ſhortly appear ſo ridiculous a <hi>Bug-bear,</hi> that the Publiſhers of that fancy, will be aſhamed (if they have any ſhame) to hope they ſhall be able to perſwade his Majeſty, and this Nation, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:44454:27"/>
alienating of their Prelatical poſſeſſions from the <hi>Church</hi> (as they call their <hi>Corporations)</hi> is the ſin of <hi>Sacriledge.</hi> For, this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> is ſo confident on his part, of the contrary, that if the <hi>Prelate</hi> who claims that which he hath Purchaſed, will thereupon hazzard but half the value in other lands, and allow him but as competent and wiſe Judges in the Caſe, as the <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> were in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> dayes (when the like Sales were queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned) the ſaid <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> if judgement paſs againſt him, will reſign all that he hath Purchaſed of the ſaid Lands for a farthing: Or if that all the <hi>Prelates</hi> be able to prove his ſaid Purchaſe <hi>Sacriledge;</hi> or if he be not able to prove that many <hi>Prelates</hi> who now or heretofore poſſeſſed ſuch Lands, as aforeſaid, by colour of a <hi>divine Right,</hi> did not more ſacrilegiouſly get them, enjoy them, and diſpoſe of them, then the late <hi>Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,</hi> (to wit) when they alienated them for 99. years, to bribe themſelves into a <hi>Deanary</hi> or <hi>Biſhoprick,</hi> or when they conferred them in Fee, or by Leaſe to their <hi>Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, Minions</hi> or <hi>Concubines.</hi> Much more might be added to evidence theſe things, and to vindicate thoſe from aſperſion, who have bought the ſaid <hi>Prelates</hi> Lands, or alienated them by Publick Authority; but ſince I had written that which precedes, I had view of a Printed ſheet, compoſed by a learned and judicious Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and entituled, <hi>An Apology for Purchaſers of Lands, late of Biſhops, Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters,</hi> wherein ſo much is alleadged to juſtifie the alienation of Sales, and Purchaſes of Lands belonging to Eccleſiaſtical perſons, and that eſtates granted by Parliament, as aforeſaid, ought by <hi>Reaſon, Law</hi> and <hi>Preſidents</hi> to be made valid: that I might have ſpared this <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> if I had not known by long experience, that men who are ſleepy,

            </p>
            <p>It appears then by the <hi>Premiſes,</hi> that the Purchaſers of Lands belonging heretofore to the Prelates, may have a ſatisfactory proportion of the ſaid Lands, and yet leave enough to be an honourable maintenance for Biſhops, regulated according to their Primitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and that they who had debts ſecured by Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances or Orders of Parliament upon the <hi>Publick-Faith,</hi> and ſuch as Purchaſed the eſtates of the King, Queen, Prince, or of them whoſe eſtates were ſold to pay Publick debts, for adhering to the King, muſt be ſatisfied by ſome other Expedient, to prevent thoſe miſchiefs which may elſe befall to the diſturbance of Common Peace, by diſcontenting the one Party or the other: For indeed, till there be a mutual forgiveneſs, as aforeſaid, and ſuch a contrivement, that every man may poſſeſs his own, we in vain ſhall otherwiſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, for a ſettled peace.</p>
            <p>Now, to compleat the ſatisfaction deſired, there are many hundred thouſand Acres in this Kingdom, in <hi>Forreſts, Chaſes,</hi> and other waſte grounds, which being divided betwixt <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Tenants,</hi> reſerving a portion out of their proportions, would amount (with a little contribution out of their eſtates, who have no Intereſt in thoſe Lands, that all might help to bear the burthen) not only ſufficiently to diſcharge all Publick debts afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, and to give a competent allowance to the remaining <hi>Purchaſers;</hi> but advance ſuch an improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment alſo, in corn, graſs, cattle, wood, and timber, for fireing, building of Ships, and houſes, in time to come, (as proviſion may be made in Parliament) that might yearly feed a million more of people, encreaſe <hi>Trade,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:44454:28"/>
ſupply other defects, produce many conveniencies, and prevent not a few miſchiefs: For, that Land which is not worth ſix-pence by the acre yearly, would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to five ſhillings <hi>per annum,</hi> that of five ſhillings to ten, that of ten to twenty, and ſome to much more; and, by that means, likewiſe, one of thoſe <hi>previous ſigns</hi> of that <hi>righteous Government,</hi> ſpecified in the <hi>Remonſtrants BRITAINS-GENIUS</hi> long ſince publiſhed, might perhaps be thereby eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fulfilled (to wit) that,</p>

            <p>This <hi>Expedient</hi> would be juſtly offenſive to none (as our caſe now ſtands) but, to men of corrupt <hi>principles,</hi> and ſuch as neither know nor underſtand the true <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi> which <hi>Publick</hi> or <hi>private perſons</hi> have in ſuch lands; or, who are not willing to loſe thoſe <hi>opportunities,</hi> which they have by the near ſcituation of their dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to take wholly to their own uſe, what belongs in a larger meaſure to other men, living at a farther di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: Or, it may be ſome poor people unlawfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding upon thoſe waſtes, having erected Cottages upon them, to the wrong of their neighbours, will complain thereof: But, it will be without juſt cauſe, ſince they may be better provided for by ſuch a diviſion, both for their own and the Publick wellfare, out of thoſe Lands. For, the moſt part of thoſe poor people who have ſo intrenched upon the right of other men, to the impoveriſhing of many Pariſhes, are very wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and diſſolute perſons, living upon pillfering and ſtealing, or keeping unlicenſed Ale-houſes in blind corners, wherein is more idleneſs, drunkenneſs, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:44454:29"/>
prophaneneſs, by night and by day, (eſpecially on the Lords day) then can be imagined by thoſe who have not ſeen it. Alſo, a ſmall ſtarvling breed of Jades, and of other unſerviceable and improveable cattle, eats up yearly many large Commons, without any advantage comparatively conſiderable, with that which might be raiſed by their improvement. The making of Barren Lands fruitful is a <hi>temporal bleſsing,</hi> which may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory for a <hi>Spiritual Mercy,</hi> and a cure of that Curſe which is impoſed, by making a fruitful Land bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, for the ſins of the people that dwell therein. The <hi>Forreſts</hi> and <hi>Chaſes,</hi> (though many have now almoſt forgotten it) were heretofore one of the greateſt Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions in this Kingdom; and being ſettled, either by Laws, or by Cuſtoms equivalent to Law, may quickly be revived. Beaſts and Beaſtlike men (ſuch as profeſſed Hunters, Falkners and Keepers have been for the moſt part) had well near the ſole benefit of thoſe Forreſts and Chaſes, which were repleniſhed with game. The King received no profit by them, and not much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure for which he paid not yearly, more then it was worth; and his Subjects were ſo miſuſed and tyrannized over by his Officers, that many Gentlemen and others were inforced to forſake their habitations in and about thoſe <hi>Forreſts</hi> and <hi>Chaſes,</hi> to prevent undoing, or avoid their unſufferable inſolencies: And it would be a double <hi>mercy,</hi> if by now ſacrificing them to <hi>Juſtice,</hi> oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the like tyrannie for the future might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the Publick-Faith vindicated from ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall and violation, by ſatisfying for the remainder of lands ſold as aforeſaid, &amp; for thoſe debts whereunto this <hi>Nation</hi> is liable both in Juſtice and Conſcience.

               <hi>In the year of</hi> Rome, 720. <hi>and in the</hi> 43. <hi>year of the age of</hi> Marcus Aurelius, <hi>upon the twentieth day of</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, <hi>about Sun-ſet, at</hi> Palermo <hi>a Sea-Port in the Iſle of</hi> Sicily, <hi>there chanced a thing perilous to them who then ſaw it, and no leſs dreadful to thoſe who heard of it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Whileſt they of</hi> Palermo <hi>were celebrating a great Feaſt with much joy, for the great ſpoyls which they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at Sea from the</hi> Numidians, <hi>&amp; which the Pirates pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to divide among them, they were partly prevented by the Magiſtrates and partly by the ſaid accident: For, when the people were returned to their houſes, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the City a dreadful monſter in this form; he ſeemed to be of the length of three cubits, his head was bald, ſo that his skull did appear; he had no ears, but two holes in his neck, whereby it was ſuppoſed, he heard; he had two wreathen horns like a Goat, his right arm was longer then his left, and his hands were like the hoofs of horſes, his ſhoulders and his head were both of one height, his ſhoulders ſhined like the ſcales of a fiſh, his breaſt was hairie, his face in all things like unto a man, ſave that he had but one eye in the midſt of his fore-head, and but one noſtril; From the middle downward, nothing could be ſeen, becauſe he ſate in a Chariot which concealed it; the</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:44454:30"/>
               <hi>Chariot was in faſhion like other Chariots then uſed, and drawn with four beaſts; two Lions before, and two Bears behinde. Within the Chariot ſtood a great Caldron with ears, wherein this monſter ſate: It wandred a great ſpace through the City, from one gate to another, caſting out ſparks of fire; which cauſed ſo great a fear throughout the City, that women with child miſcarried, and ſome died out-right with fear: Men and women, great and ſmall, ran to the Temples of</hi> Jupiter, Mars, <hi>and</hi> Februa, <hi>make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing importunate prayers, with ſad cries. At the ſame time the</hi> Pirates <hi>were in the Governours Palace, whoſe name was</hi> Solyno, <hi>born at</hi> Copua, <hi>and in that Palace the ſpoyls being kept, thither the Monſter came, after it had wandred through the City, and cutting off one of the Lyons ears, wrote with the blood thereof, upon the Palace gate, theſe Letters,</hi> R. A. S. V. P. I. P. P. <hi>Theſe</hi> Letters <hi>were diverſly interpreted, ſo that the Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were more then the</hi> Letters. <hi>But in the end, a</hi> Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs <hi>greatly eſteemed for her ſcience, opened the true mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Letters, ſaying,</hi> R. <hi>ſignifieth</hi> Reddite, A. aliena, S. ſi, V. vultis, P. propria, I. in, P. pace, P. poſſidere, <hi>which words altogether, make up this ſenſe,</hi> Reddite aliena ſi vultis propria poſſidere in pace Render to other men that which belongs to them, if you will poſſeſs in peace that which is your own. <hi>The Pirates were wonderfully afraid of this command, and the woman highly commended for her expoſition (but the injunction was not obeyed.) The Monſter went the ſame night out of the City, unto an high hill named</hi> Jamicia, <hi>and there continued three dayes within ſight of the City, the Lions and Bears terribly roaring, and the Monſter caſting forth flames; during all which time, there was neither bird ſeen in the air, nor beaſt in the field near that place, and the people offered great ſacrifices to the gods,</hi>

               <hi>yea their own blood, to appeaſe their wrath. Three dayes being paſſed, there appeared in the Element a marvellous dark cloud, ſeeming to darken the whole earth, and then it began to thunder and lighten ſo terribly, that many men died, and divers houſes fell to the ground; and at laſt there came ſuch a flame of fire from the</hi> Monſter, <hi>that it burnt both the Palace where the Pirates were, and all that was therein, conſuming the very ſtones thereof; yea the tempeſt was ſo great, that there fell above two thouſand houſes, and more then ten thouſand perſons died in the Tempeſt. In that place where the Monſter ſtood upon the ſaid hill, the Emperour built a ſumptuous Temple to</hi> Jupiter <hi>in memorial thereof, of which Temple</hi> Alexander <hi>the Emperour made afterward a ſtrong Caſtle. This is taken out of the Epiſtles of</hi> Marcus Aurelius <hi>the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi>

            <p>Thus you have an evidence of two witneſſes, one of divine credit, and the other recorded by one of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt fame among heathen Philoſophers and Emperours, to ſhew how dangerous it is to neglect Juſtice, and not to render unto every man his own, when God requires it to be done.</p>
            <p>Alſo, how honourable it is for Kings and States to do righteous things, and how neceſſary and warrantable it is, both for men oppreſſed, and others thereto conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly moved, in ſuch times and caſes as many are in at this preſent, to ſpeak truth plainly and boldly, even to the higheſt Powers on earth, this that follows may illuſtrate.

            <p>Now, out of many approved preſidents juſtifying, by the acceptation they had, the juſt freedom which men oppreſſed may challenge, in plainly and boldly declaring their grievances and oppreſſions to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Potentates of the world, I have choſen two, the firſt of a <hi>Jew,</hi> and the other of a <hi>German,</hi> both which came to <hi>Rome,</hi> to complain unto the Senate there, on the behalf of themſelves and Country-men, oppreſſed by the <hi>Romans.</hi> Their ſpeeches being long, I will here Epitomize; and firſt, that of the <hi>Jew,</hi> ſpoken to the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate, the third year after <hi>Pompey</hi> ſacked <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and whileſt <hi>Valerius Gracchus</hi> governed <hi>Judea.</hi>

            <p>Fathers Conſcript, <hi>Your good fortune permitting it, or to ſay better, we for ſaking God,</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>which was Lady of all the Cities in</hi> Aſia, <hi>and Mother of all the</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews <hi>in</hi> Paleſtine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Great were thoſe Armies whereby</hi> Pompey <hi>vanquiſhed us, but greater have our offences been, for which we were forſaken of GOD. I would have you to hear by words, but rather to know it by experience, that we have a merciful God, who can do</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:44454:32"/>
               <hi>more alone, then all your Gods together, and who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth compaſsion, though among fifty thouſand there be but ten good men: They are our great offences only, which have made you to be Lords over us; and not your</hi> Power <hi>or</hi> Vertues. <hi>For, whileſt we agreed in the Unity of Faith in one only God, he proſpered us; and ſo long as the wrath of God is upon us for our ſins, ſo long ſhall you be Lords over us, and no longer. Then ſhall we recover what we have loſt, and ye ſhall loſe what you have won: And as we are now Commanded, ſo ſhall we be then Obeyed; but at preſent, and whileſt we are ſwayed one way, and ye ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither can you encline me to the worſhip of your Gods, neither ſhall I be able to draw you to believe only in in that one God, the Creator of all things, to whom I refer the diſpoſing of all things. Touching that which I have chiefly to ſay, Know you, that in times paſt,</hi> Rome <hi>had peace with</hi> Judea, <hi>and</hi> Judea <hi>with</hi> Rome; <hi>and being friends, preſerved each other in peace; but now it is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and whileſt we ſigh for peace, we ſee, you make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for war; whereas, if you would expell thoſe who bear us evil will, and we could know and take heed of them who provoke us to rebell, neither ſhould</hi> Rome <hi>ſo much oppreſs</hi> Judea, <hi>nor</hi> Judea <hi>hate</hi> Rome. <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is loſt, not ſo much for the intereſt of the one or other, as by their indiſcretion who pretend to be</hi> Mediators; <hi>for if they who take upon them that office, be greater enemies then thoſe between whom a war is begun, they do but caſt wood into that fire, which they ſhould quench with water. Since the baniſhment of</hi> Archelaus <hi>from</hi> Judea, <hi>in whoſe place you ſent unto us,</hi> Pomponius, Marcus, Rufus, <hi>and</hi> Valerius, <hi>we have had</hi> four Plagues, <hi>the leaſt wherof was ſufficient to poyſon all</hi> Rome. <hi>What greater calamity could happen unto us, then to have</hi> Judges <hi>ſent from</hi> Rome, <hi>who took up all the evil, cuſtoms of wicked men,</hi>
               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:44454:33"/>
               <hi>and were themſelves Inventors of new Vices? And when they, who ought to puniſh the lightneſs of youth, are the Ringleaders of Levity? It is openly ſaid in</hi> Aſia, <hi>that the Thieves of</hi> Rome, <hi>do hang the Thieves of</hi> Jewry: <hi>and I muſt plainly tell you, we fear not the Thieves which rob us in the woods, ſo much as thoſe</hi> Judges <hi>who spoyl us in our houſes. We dread not Robbers on the high-way, nor thoſe who make open war upon us, nor the Plague of Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence half ſo much, as your</hi> corrupt Judges. <hi>To that, which is here heard in the</hi> Senate, <hi>and not ſeen with us, you give more credit, though reported by one who hath been but three Moneths in the</hi> Province, <hi>then to that which is reported by many who have governed thirty years. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider ye</hi> Senators, <hi>that if ye were advanced to this dignity becauſe you were the wiſeſt, the moſt honeſt, and moderate among the people, it would appear in your being ſo juſt and vertuous, as not to believe all you hear ſince you have to do with many of divers</hi> Nations, <hi>whoſe ends and intentions are variable. I speak the truth unto you, your</hi> Judges <hi>have done ſo much injuſtice, and ſhown ſuch ill examples, that they have taught the youth of</hi> Judea, <hi>thoſe vices which our Fathers never heard of, nor we ever ſaw or read of before: And ye being mighty, and reputed noble, diſdain to take counſel of men that be poor, as if to</hi> know much, <hi>and to</hi> have little wealth <hi>or eſteem, were never found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. As ye have given counſel to us, ſo be pleaſed to take counſel from us, and know, that though your</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains <hi>have won many Realms by ſhedding blood, the way to keep them, is by clemency and mildneſs, without blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; and therefore pray and adviſe your</hi> Judges, <hi>whom ye ſend to govern ſtrange</hi> Provinces, <hi>that they be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to preſerve the</hi> Common peace, <hi>then to employ themſelves in taking</hi> Fines <hi>and</hi> Forfeitures, <hi>leſt elſe, they ſlander you who ſend them, and deſtroy thoſe whom they</hi>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:44454:33"/>
               <hi>ſhould govern and protect: for the reaſon, why they are not juſtly obeyed, is, becauſe they command unjuſt things: Righteous impoſitions and juſt commands make men hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and obedient, whereas unrighteous commands, make meek and humble men obſtinate and froward; and the more evil things are commanded, the leſs good things are obeyed, when ſuch perſons enjoyn them. Believe this, Oh ye</hi> Romans, <hi>that from the levity of thoſe in</hi> Authority, <hi>ſprings the ſhameleſneſs and diſobedience of the</hi> People. <hi>The</hi> Prince, <hi>who impoſeth Government upon thoſe whom he knoweth not to be qualified for ſuch a truſt, intendeth not ſo much that they ſhould do Juſtice to his People, as that they ſhould increaſe his treaſure and ſerve his luſts; but let him be well aſſured, that when he leaſt thinketh of it, his honour and credit will be turned into infamy, his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure conſumed, and ſome notable vengeance fall upon him or his poſterity. I having other matters to ſpeak of in ſecret, will here conclude, with this advice, that ye keep us and our Countrey in ſafety; (for which you have hazzarded your ſelves) and that ye do Juſtice impartial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for then we ſhall reverence your commands. Be</hi> merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>and we ſhall be meek; be not cruel in puniſhing our weakneſs, and we ſhall willingly obey your juſt commands; Command not with proud ſeverity, and you ſhall find in us the Love which Fathers may expect from children, and not that treaſon, which</hi> oppreſſive Lords <hi>uſually find in their ſervants.</hi>

who came to ask Juſtice of the ſaid <hi>Senate,</hi> againſt a <hi>Cenſor</hi> who ſorely oppreſſed the <hi>Germans:</hi> This Ruſtick was in outward appearance, in ſome reſpects, more contemptible then this <hi>Remonſtrant:</hi> For, he is deſcribed to have been a man who had a ſmall face, great lips, hollow eyes, of a Sun-burnt complexion, having curled hair on his head, and a long thick beard; his rayment and coat was of beaſts skins, his ſhooes of Porcupine-leather, his girdle of Bull-ruſhes, his head bare, and a club in his hand: In this equippage he entred the <hi>Senate,</hi> whereon though many perſons were there attending to have their affairs diſpatched, this poor man was admitted before all others, and ſpake in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Oh</hi> Fathers conſcript, <hi>I</hi> Mileno <hi>a</hi> Plow-man, <hi>dwelling near the River</hi> Danubius, <hi>ſalute you worthy Senators of</hi> Rome, <hi>beſeeching the immortal Gods ſo to govern my tongue this day, that I may speak that which may be for the welfare of my</hi> Countrey, <hi>and encline you to do that which may be for the Publick honour of this Empire, for without the help of GOD, we can neither obtain that which is good, nor avoid what is evil. By divine permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and our wrathful GOD's forſaking us, ſuch was our evil, and your good hap, that your proud Captains of</hi> Rome, <hi>took our Countrey of</hi> Germany <hi>by force of Arms; of which ye had been prevented, if we had timely appeaſed the wrath of God. Great is the glory you have atchieved by your</hi> Conqueſts; <hi>but greater will be your Infamy, by the Cruelties which you have committed: For you ſhall know, (if you know it not) that when the wicked</hi> Victors <hi>went before the triumphant Chariots crying,</hi> Live, Live, invincible Rome; <hi>the poor</hi> Captives <hi>walked after, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their hearts,</hi> Juſtice, Juſtice. <hi>Give me leave to speak plainly, your covetouſneſs, Oh ye</hi> Romans, <hi>in taking</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:44454:34"/>
               <hi>away other mens goods, hath been ſo extream, and your commands in ſtrange Countries have been ſo extravagant, that neither the depths of the Seas can ſuffice you, nor the wideneſs of the earth ſecure us; and there is no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation left us in our troubles, but our hope that the Gods who are juſt, will execute Juſtice on thoſe who are unjuſt; which aſſurance being wanting, we ſhould with our own hands deſtroy our ſelves, to avoid the inhumanity of our enemies: But, I hope in the juſt Gods, that you, who without juſt cauſe, have caſt us out of our houſes and poſſeſſions, ſhall by them be caſt out, both of</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Rome. <hi>In my Country, we take it for an infallible Rule, That he who taketh from another man his right, ought in reaſon to loſe his own; and I truſt, that what we have for a</hi> Proverb <hi>in</hi> Germany, <hi>you ſhall have here by experience. By my blunt language, and by the homely apparrel that I wear, you may well imagine me ſome rude and barbarous Groom: Yet, I want not reaſon to know who is righteous in keeping his own, and who a tyrant in poſſeſsing what is another mans: For though we plain</hi> Country-men <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak eloquently, we are not ignorant of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between good and evil, or that the Gods will take away in one hour, what Tyrants have been gathering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, and reſtore in one minute, that which good men have loſt many years. Believe me, Ob</hi> Romans, <hi>Goods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully gotten by the</hi> Fathers, <hi>are the undoing of their</hi> Children; <hi>and it is impoſsible, that a wiſe man ſhould find any contentment, in that which is gained unlawfully, and with an ill conſcience. I wonder how he that keepeth another mans goods, can ſleep or reſt one hour, knowing he hath done injury to the Gods, ſcandalized his neighbour, pleaſed his enemies, loſt his friends, and put his perſon in peril, by endamaging thoſe whom he hath robbed. He that taketh away my goods unjuſtly, will the ſame day take away</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:44454:35"/>
               <hi>my life if he can. I ſay and affirm (not caring whether he be</hi> Greek, Barbarian, Roman, <hi>preſent or abſent, who ſhall be offended thereat) that he is and ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed of the Gods, and hated of men; who will turn a good fame to an infamy, Juſtice into Wrong, Rule into Tyrannie, Truth into Lyes, certainties into things doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and deſtory his own happineſs, by depriving other men of their contentment. You</hi> Romans <hi>are naturally proud, and your pride blinds you, or elſe you would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that being Lords of great</hi> Provinces, <hi>you are ſlaves to your own</hi> Riches; <hi>and that they both deprive you of your honour, contentment and reſt. Hearken to what I ſhall ſay, and I beſeech the Gods to make you ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, that I loſe not my labour. I hear all the world exclaim againſt</hi> Pride, <hi>and yet none embrace</hi> Humility; <hi>every man condemns</hi> Adultery, <hi>yet I ſee few who live</hi> Chaſtly; <hi>moſt men curſe</hi> Exceſs, <hi>yet I perceive not any who is</hi> Temprate; <hi>all men praiſe</hi> Patience, <hi>yet none will</hi> patiently <hi>ſuffer; They blame</hi> ſloth, <hi>yet ſpend their time in</hi> idleneſs; <hi>All exclaim againſt</hi> Avarice, <hi>nevertheleſs every one robbeth his neighbour; and I ſpeak it here open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the</hi> Senate, <hi>not without grief, every mans tongue extolleth</hi> Vertue, <hi>yet they enſlave all their members to</hi> Vice; <hi>and this I object not againſt thoſe</hi> Romans <hi>which are in</hi> Iliria <hi>alone, but againſt thoſe alſo which I ſee here in this</hi> Senate. <hi>In your</hi> Houſes, <hi>and about your</hi> Arms, <hi>you have this</hi> Motto, Romanorum eſt debellare ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bos, &amp; parcere ſubjectis; <hi>but, you might more truly have written,</hi> Romanorum eſt ſpoliare Innocentes, &amp; reddere ſubjectos.</p>

               <hi>What juſt occaſion brought you from the banks of</hi> Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <hi>to invade us who lived peaceably nigh the River of</hi> Danuby? <hi>Were we friends to your foes, or enemies to you? Did we go to conquer other Counrites, or were diſobedient</hi>

               <hi>to our own Lords? Did we either deſpiſe your friendſhip, or defy you as Adverſaries?

Have we deſtroyed your Armies, waſted your Fields, ſpoyled your People, or done any outrage or injury, which might provoke you to revenge? Of a truth, none of theſe, or of any ſuch occurences have happened, as uſually give occaſion of controverſies betwixt neighbours; but meer</hi> Covetouſneſs <hi>and</hi> Ambition <hi>were ſole cauſes of your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſions: For, in</hi> Germany, <hi>we felt your Tyrannie, as ſoon as we heard of your Fame. If you be offended with what I have ſaid; be pleaſed with what I will ſay; which is this, that the Name of</hi> Romans, <hi>and the Cruelties of</hi> Tyrants, <hi>arrived together in one day upon our People. They who have</hi> much, <hi>do oppreſs them who have</hi> little; Covetouſneſs <hi>produceth</hi> Malice, <hi>and</hi> Malice <hi>makes way to open</hi> Robbery. <hi>I conjure you</hi> Romans, <hi>by the immortal Gods, to heed what I</hi> ſay, <hi>and conſider what you have</hi> done: <hi>For either the words of the Gods are not true, or elſe men with their oppreſſions, and the world, muſt come to an end:</hi> Fortune <hi>muſt fix a Pin in her</hi> wheel, <hi>or elſe that which you have gotten in eight years, will poſsibly be loſt in eight dayes; ſince nothing is more juſt, then that the Gods ſhould make you</hi> ſlaves, <hi>who have made your ſelves</hi> Tyrants. <hi>Do not think, though you have ſubdued</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, <hi>and are</hi> Lords <hi>thereof, that it was by your war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like proweſs: For, you are no more warlike, nor more couragious, nor more able to endure hardſhip, then we</hi> Germans: <hi>But, we, as is aforeſaid, provoked the Gods to wrath, and they to puniſh our ſins, have ordained that you ſhould be a ſcourge to our</hi> perſons. <hi>You are not ſo ſtrong, nor we ſo weak, that you had enjoyed the ſpoyl of our Country, if the Gods had favoured us as much as they</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:44454:36"/>
               <hi>did you: Therefore you obtained not the Victories by the</hi> weapons <hi>which you brought from</hi> Rome, <hi>but by the</hi> Vices <hi>you found in</hi> Germany: <hi>We were not over-run for being</hi> cowards, <hi>but for being</hi> wicked; <hi>and when your Vices are at full, and the Gods as angry with you, as they are now with us, things will ſucceed better on our behalf. Think not to be the more proſperous or victorious by your great</hi> Armies <hi>or vaſt</hi> Treaſures, <hi>or for that you have more</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Gods <hi>to aſsiſt you, or becauſe you build greater</hi> Temples, <hi>or offer larger</hi> Sacrifices: <hi>For know, if you know it not, that none are more favoured of the Gods, then they who execute</hi> Juſtice <hi>and ſhew</hi> Mercy. <hi>The triumphs of</hi> Conquerours <hi>are not atchieved by politick</hi> Generals, <hi>experienced</hi> Captains, <hi>valiant</hi> Souldiers, <hi>and</hi> numerous Armies: <hi>For we have found by experience, that with all theſe concurring, they can but begin a</hi> battle, <hi>and that then, the Gods themſelves diſpoſe of the</hi> Victory: <hi>And if I am not deceived, the wrath of the Gods towards us, is ſo much appeaſed ſince our</hi> ſufferings, <hi>and ſo incenſed againſt you for your</hi> cruelties to us, <hi>and your</hi> unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to them; <hi>that, you who now eſteem us to be your</hi> ſlaves, <hi>may poſsibly hereafter acknowledge us to be your</hi> Lords.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In my travails hither, I have ſeen high Mountains, large Provinces, ſeveral Nations, and barbarous People; and finding</hi> Rome <hi>to be ſo many miles diſtant from</hi> Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, <hi>I wonder what fond toy came into your heads, to ſend to conquer it. If it were for deſire of Treaſure, I believe, ye ſpent more in ſubduing it, then the Revenue of all our Country will amount to in many years, and yet may perhaps alſo loſe it, before you re-imburſe what it coſt. If it were glory, that you aimed at, great is your vanity; for, little honour is it to have Forts and Towns, where you have not the hearts of the People. If you did it to enlarge</hi>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:44454:36"/>
               <hi>your</hi> bounds; <hi>it became neither wiſe nor valiant men, to enlarge their</hi> dominions, <hi>and diminiſh their honour. If you ſay, it was done, that we ſhould not be barbarous, but civilized according to your mode, I ſhould be therewith well contented: But, how can you give good Laws to</hi> ſtrangers, <hi>who neglect and break the beſt Laws made by your own</hi> Predeceſſors? <hi>With what credit can they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect others, who deſerve as much correction? How can the blind lead the Lame? Why ſhould the proud</hi> Romans <hi>ſubdue the innocent</hi> Germans? <hi>And ſince every man is ſo corrupt, and ſo alienated from the love of God and Goodneſs, that each taketh what he can, and killeth whom he liſteth, what remedy is like to ſucceed, when neither they who govern will endeavour it, nor they who are oppreſſed dare complain? Rulers are ſo hard to be entreated, and ſo little regard poor mens grievances, that it is not more grievous to endure their oppreſsions at home, then to come and exhibit their complaints here; becauſe, in their own Country, they have but one Perſecutor, and in this place very many; they being rich, and the Complainants poor.</hi> Rome, <hi>if ſhe be the</hi> Miſtreſs <hi>of</hi> Germany, <hi>ought in equity to preſerve us in peace by her Juſtice; Whereas they who go from hence thither, deſpoyl us of our eſtates there, and they who are here, rob us of our</hi> Good name, <hi>ſaying, we are a People without</hi> laws, <hi>without</hi> Reaſon, <hi>without a</hi> King, <hi>and may as</hi> Barbarians <hi>be made your</hi> ſlaves: <hi>But, in theſe ſlanders you are injurious, ſince we being as we are, and as the Gods created us, remain peaceably in our own Countries, without deſiring to invade others, might more juſtly and rationally ſay, that you are men without Law or Reaſon, in that not being contented with the ſweetneſs and fertility of</hi> Italy, <hi>you ſeek to conquer all the</hi> world <hi>by bloodſhed. If you ſay, we deſerve to be</hi> ſlaves, <hi>becauſe we have no</hi> Prince <hi>to command us, nor</hi> Senate <hi>to govern</hi>

               <hi>us, nor</hi> Army <hi>to defend us; I thereto anſwer, that having no</hi> Enemies, <hi>we need no</hi> Armies; <hi>that, being contented with our</hi> Lots, <hi>we wanted not a proud</hi> Senate <hi>to govern us; and being all equals, had no neceſſity to be ſubjected to the humours of a</hi> Prince, <hi>whoſe office duly executed, being to ſuppreſs Tyrants, and maintain the People in Peace, we wanted not a perſon to be kept among us to either of theſe ends; and, if you therefore ſay, we have in our Country no</hi> Common-wealth <hi>nor</hi> Politie, <hi>but live as brute beaſts in the Mountains; therein alſo you ſlander as: For, in our Country, we ſuffer no</hi> Liers, <hi>nor</hi> Rebels, <hi>nor</hi> Thieves, <hi>nor</hi> ſeditious perſons, <hi>nor men who bring us fantaſtical apparrel, or ſtrange Cuſtoms from other</hi> Clymates: <hi>But, are modeſt in our</hi> Rayment, <hi>temperate in our meats and feeding, and needed no better</hi> behaviour <hi>then our own. Though we have not the Merchandizes of</hi> Carthage, <hi>nor Oyls of</hi> Mauritania, <hi>nor wares of</hi> Tire, <hi>nor ſteel of</hi> Calabria, <hi>nor Odours of</hi> Aſia, <hi>nor the Gold of</hi> Spain, <hi>nor the ſilver of Britan, Amber of</hi> Sydonia, <hi>ſilk of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>corn of</hi> Sicilia, <hi>wine of</hi> Candy, <hi>or purple of</hi> Arabia: <hi>Yet, we have a</hi> Common-wealth, <hi>and are not brutiſh: For, theſe, and ſuch like things, yield more provocations to</hi> vice, <hi>then helps toward a</hi> vertuous life. <hi>Bleſſed is that</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth <hi>and</hi> Nation, <hi>not where riches abound, but where</hi> Vertues <hi>are commanded, practiſed, and improved; not where light, proud, and froward perſons inhabit and domineer, but where ſober, ſerious, prudent, and meek men reſide; and therefore you may have cauſe to envy our Poverty, and we to pity your condition in being Rich. Would God, you were as well contented with your wealth, as we could have been with our Poverty before your invaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for then you had not robbed our Country, nor had we been forced hither to complain, where our tears and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are not ſo much regarded, as to effect a diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

               <hi>either of your pleaſures, or of our grievances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>You may think perhaps, I have no more to ſay; but it is not ſo; there yet remains that to be spoken, which may aſtoniſh you; and I will not be afraid to ſpeak it, though you have not been aſhamed to do it; for, open offences, merit not ſecret reproofs. I marvail,</hi> Romans, <hi>what ye mean, to ſend over unto us ſuch ignorant</hi> Governours, <hi>who (I ſwear by the immortal Gods) neither ſeem to know your Laws, nor to underſtand ours! Ye ſend not thoſe who are beſt able to defend us by executing</hi> Juſtice, <hi>but, thoſe who are beſt befriended in</hi> Rome; <hi>as perhaps, you give to thoſe of the</hi> Senate <hi>the office of</hi> Cenſors, <hi>more for favour or importunity, then for deſert. I can ſay little here, in reſpect of what they do with us. What you autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize them to do, I know not, but what they do, is too well known unto me. All bribes that are brought unto them, they take openly, and ſhare and poll us all in ſecret, to the utmoſt of their power. They puniſh the faults of</hi> poor men, <hi>and connive at</hi> rich mens <hi>tranſgreſsions, that they may take occaſion and encouragement to commit greater; and whereas they ſhould uſe means to diminiſh reproach and ſlanders, they encreaſe them. To demand Juſtice without a bribe, is the certain courſe not to obtain it. Will your Tyrannie and Avarice never have an end? Though you wrong us in words, oppreſs us not alſo in deeds. Our bodies are able to bear thoſe irons with which you load us; but the Tributes and Taxes which you impoſe, are greater then we can ſuſtain. If nothing will content you, but all that we have in</hi> Germany, <hi>go thither and take it, for we affect not, as you do, to live poorly, that we may die rich, and to deprive our ſelves of contentment during life, that others may ſquander away our ſuperfluities when we are dead. If our ſervice content you not, ſtrike off our heads: for your ſwords are not ſo dreadful to our eyes, as your</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:44454:38"/>
               <hi>tyrannies are abominable to our hearts. Do ye know, Oh</hi> Romans, <hi>what you have done? if not, I will tell you: Verily, you have cauſed many of us to ſwear, that we will forbear to cohabit with our wives, and ſlay our children as ſoon as born, rather then leave them in the hands of ſuch wicked and inhumane Tyrants as ye are: Yea, we determine as deſperate men, to reſiſt the natural motions of the fleſh all our life time, rather then get our wives with child: thinking it better to reſtrain our luſting twenty or thirty years, then to leave our poſterity to be your perpetual ſlaves. But, to what end is this complaining? Perhaps you will ſometimes hear us, as now you hear me; but when you have heard us, you will be ſtill ſlow in relieving. I will tell you ſome of thoſe things which I have obſerved, that you may reform them. If a poor man come to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and demand Juſtice, if he hath no money to give, nor Wine or Oyl to promiſe, nor a Revenue to maintain his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences nor Friends to mediate for him; then after he hath declared his grievances; you, for awhile, give him fair words, ſeem to pity his ſufferings, and promiſe him ſpeedy relief. But in the mean time make him totally ſpend that little which he had, and waſt the beſt part of his life in vain hopes and tedious proſecutions, without any effect at all to his profit: Yea, on the contrary, they who at firſt promiſed him favours, do at laſt joyn hands with his oppreſſors, and quite undo him. Moſt ſay in the beginning, his cauſe is good, yet though upon his tryal they find it ſo proved, they give ſentence againſt him at the laſt; ſo that he who came at firſt hither to complain againſt one, returns home com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining againſt many, yea againſt all, and crying out to the immortal Gods for vengeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I will declare unto you my life, Oh</hi> Romans, <hi>that ye may underſtand, how we now live and ſubſiſt in my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: I get my livelihood by gathering Acorns in the</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:44454:38"/>
               <hi>Winter, by Fruits in the Summer, and reaping Corn: Sometimes I fiſh, both for pleaſure, and to ſupply neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſpending moſt part of my time alone in Woods, Fields and Mountains, becauſe I would not behold the outrages which are perpetrated by your</hi> Officers <hi>in our Country; whoſe oppreſſions, if I could fully declare them, would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo many and ſo hainous, that either they would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their</hi> Employments, <hi>or my puniſhment would certainly enſue. But what good ſucceſs can I hope for? When I conſider the things which I have ſeen within theſe fifteen dayes now paſſed away ſince my arrival in</hi> Rome; <hi>where ſuch things have been committed, that if they had been done in</hi> Germany, <hi>the Gallows and Gibbets had wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily hung as thick with malefactors, as Vines with cluſters of Grapes? For, I have obſerved, (beſide other things obſervable) ſuch immodeſty in</hi> apparrel, <hi>ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance in your feeding, and ſuch diſorder in your lives and affairs, that having beheld as much as I deſired: and my heart being at reſt, by ſpitting out that poyſon which was in it, I am ready to make recompence for it with my head, if I have offended,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This, and ſomewhat more, which for brevity ſake I omitted, was ſpoken in this bold manner, by a perſon as contemptible as this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> (to a greater and a more abſolute Power then we live under) on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of himſelf and Country-men, who were thereby op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and, who, though reputed the greateſt Tyrants of the world, were not ſo Tyrannous, as to be enraged by his upbraidings &amp; bold expreſſions, whom oppreſſion had exaſperated: For, we find it atteſted by that famous <hi>Emperour,</hi> who occaſionally related this Speech, that it was highly approved, both by the whole <hi>Senate</hi> and by him, as well becoming the Speaker, in ſuch a caſe; yea, notwithſtanding the tartneſs thereof.

after he had ſaid much in praiſe of this Oration, to thoſe unto whom he declared it, was delivered in words to this effect: <hi>By the faith of a good man</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>I ſaw this</hi> German <hi>ſtand boldly on his feet, and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed a whole hour, whileſt all we in the Senate ſate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the earth with ſhame, not able to anſwer him one word; becauſe indeed he had aſtoniſhed us, to ſee the little regard he had of his life. But, the Senate agreed altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>the next day to ſend new Governours and Judges into</hi> Germany; <hi>commanded him to deliver unto us in writing all that he had ſaid, to be regiſtred among the good ſayings of ſtrangers; made him a Free-man of</hi> Rome; <hi>choſe him to be a Senator, and appointed him a maintenance out of the common Treaſury.</hi> By this, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that there is a way, whereby a prudent <hi>Senate,</hi> or <hi>Supream Authority,</hi> may advance their honour, if they pleaſe, by hearing with patience and good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, thoſe bold and free ſpeakings, tending to the execution of Juſtice, which Fools miſ-interpret as ſcandalous, and tending to their diſhonour or diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And the <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> hath made uſe of theſe <hi>Ethnick</hi> precedents and teſtimonies, that they who profeſs <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> may be the more aſhamed, to hear that <hi>Heathens</hi> and meer natural men ſhould ſurpaſs them in generouſneſs, in zeal to Juſtice, and in compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately permitting grieved Supplicants boldly, plainly and openly, to ſignifie their grievances, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larize their <hi>Oppreſſors,</hi> if need be, not only without blame, but alſo, with Approbation, Remedy and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
            <p>Here, this <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> purpoſed to conclude: But, as many times, he knows neither when he ſhall begin to write, nor what he ſhall write untill he hath <hi>begun:</hi> So, be knows not ſometimes when he ſhall make an <hi>end,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

To anſwer thy expectation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what news is now here, I ſhall not be ſo able as I could have been, if thou hadſt deſired to be informed, Whether any thing that was good and old, is yet remaining here amongst us in</hi> Rome <hi>or</hi> Italy: <hi>For, by our evil deſtiny, all that was</hi> good and old <hi>is ended, and</hi> new things <hi>which are evil, do now begin to abound. The</hi> Emperour, <hi>the</hi> Conſuls, <hi>the</hi> Tribunes, <hi>the</hi> Senators, <hi>the</hi> Aediles, <hi>the</hi> Flamins, <hi>the</hi> Praetors, <hi>the</hi> Centurions, <hi>and almoſt all things are new ſave the</hi> Vertues, <hi>which are grown obſolet. We paſs the time in making new</hi> Officers, <hi>in deviſing new</hi> Projects <hi>and</hi> Counſels, <hi>in raiſing new</hi> Taxes, <hi>with ſuch like; and there have been more</hi> novelties <hi>within four years, then in four hundred heretofore. We now aſſemble three hundred to counſel in the</hi> Capitol, <hi>and there we brag and boaſt, ſwear and promiſe, that we will extoll the</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, <hi>ſubdue the</hi> Vitious, <hi>favour the</hi> Right, <hi>not wink at</hi> wrongs, <hi>puniſh the</hi> evil, <hi>reward the</hi> good, <hi>repair the</hi> old, <hi>edifie</hi> new, <hi>pluck</hi> Vices <hi>up by the roots, plant</hi> Vertues,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44454:40"/>
               <hi>follow that which is</hi> good, <hi>reprove</hi> Tyrants, <hi>and relieve the poor and oppreſſed: But, when we are gone from thence, they who ſpeak the beſt words, commit the worſt deeds. The</hi> Senators <hi>paſs away their time in ſaying,</hi> We will do, We will do; <hi>but, every man ſeeks his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and forgets both private mens injuries, and the</hi> Weal-Publick. <hi>I often hear in the</hi> Senate, <hi>much eloquence in words, fair ſhews of zeal to</hi> Juſtice, <hi>and much ſpoken by many in juſtification of themſelves; and when I come abroad, am aſhamed to ſee their evil works, with their cruel extortions, and find it to be very frequent for them who commit the greateſt crimes, to be moſt ſevere in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſentence againſt others for the ſame offences. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold our own faults in mirrours which make them ſeem leſs, and other mens in multiplying-glaſſes, making them appear greater. Oh! how many have I ſeen condemned by the</hi> Senate <hi>for one fault committed but once in all their life-time, when they themſelves commit the ſame fault, or worſe, every hour! I read, that in the time of</hi> Alexander <hi>the great, there was a famous</hi> Pirate <hi>called</hi> Dionides, <hi>who robbing all Ships he could meet withall,</hi> Alexander <hi>ſet forth a great Navy to apprehend him, which having taken him, and preſented him to</hi> Alexander, <hi>that King ſaid unto him,</hi> Why <hi>Dionides,</hi> doſt thou ſpoyl ſo on the Seas, that no Ship can ſale in ſafety for thee? <hi>The</hi> Pirate <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> If I ſpoyl by Sea, why doſt thou ſpoyl both by Sea and Land? Oh <hi>Alexander,</hi> becauſe I fight with one ſingle Ship at Sea, I am called a <hi>Pirate,</hi> and becauſe thou robbeſt with two hundred Ships at Sea, and troubleſt all the world with two hundred thouſand men by Land, thou art called an <hi>Emperour.</hi> I ſwear unto thee <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> if the Gods were ſo favourable to me, as they are to thee, and ſo adverſe to thee, as now they are to me, and would give me thine Empire, and beſtow on
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44454:40"/>
thee my little Ship, peradventure I ſhould be a better <hi>Emperour</hi> then thou art, and thou wouldſt be a worſe <hi>Pirate</hi> then I. <hi>This bold ſpeech pleaſed</hi> Alexander <hi>ſo well, that he made him General of a great Army; and he became more vertuous by Land, then he was vicious by Sea. Now, in</hi> Italy, <hi>they who rob openly, are called</hi> LORDS, <hi>and they who rob privately, are called Thieves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I read in the</hi> Annals <hi>of</hi> Livy, <hi>that there came an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador from</hi> Spain <hi>to</hi> Rome, <hi>to treat of a Peace with the</hi> Romans, <hi>which Embaſſador proved before the</hi> Senate, <hi>that he had been robbed ten times of his goods, whileſt he was at</hi> Rome, <hi>and that he had ſeen one of thoſe who rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed him, hang another who defended him; and that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo wicked a deed, he took a coal, and wrote upon the Gibbet theſe words.</hi> Oh Gibbet, thou art planted among thieves, art made by thieves, and hanged full of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents. <hi>The whole hiſtory wherein theſe words are found, was written with black ink, and theſe words in Vermilion Letters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I cannot tell what other news to ſend thee; but every thing here is ſo new and tender, and joyned with ſuch ill Cement, that I fear all will ſhortly fall ſuddenly in pieces. Some, are ſo haſtily and ſo highly promoted, that I dare aſſure thee rather of their Fall, then of their lives and firm ſtanding. We have already ſeen many, at whoſe riſing we wondered, and as much marvelled at their ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fall. We have ſeen</hi> Cincius Fulvius, <hi>in one year made</hi> Conſul, <hi>his children</hi> Tribunes, <hi>his wife</hi> Matron <hi>to the</hi> Virgins, <hi>as alſo Keepreſs of the</hi> Capitol, <hi>and after that, not in one year, but the ſame day, ſaw</hi> Cincius <hi>beheaded in the place, his children drowned in</hi> Tiber, <hi>his wife baniſhed, his houſe raſed to the ground, and all his goods confiſcate to the Common Treaſury; and this rigorous example we</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:44454:41"/>
               <hi>have not read of in a Book, but ſeen with our eyes, that we might the better mind it. Sith I have begun, and thou art in a ſtrange Country, I will write all the news which is here. This year, the</hi> 25. <hi>of</hi> May, <hi>an Embaſſador came out of</hi> Aſia, <hi>who conſidering it would be dangerous ſayling home in Winter; and ſeeing after long ſtay his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was not diſpatched, (being a man of a good courage, and zealous of his Countries affairs) coming one day to the</hi> Senate, <hi>and ſeeing the</hi> Senators <hi>enter the</hi> Capitol <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, as the cuſtom is, laying aſide their</hi> Arms, <hi>he spake thus, in preſence of all the</hi> Senators. <hi>FATHERS CONSCRIPT,</hi> I am come to <hi>Rome</hi> from a far Country, &amp; have found <hi>Rome</hi> without <hi>Rome.</hi> The fame of the place brought me not hither, but the renown of them who govern it. I came not to ſee that <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer</hi> wherein the wealth of all Realms is treaſured up, but the <hi>Sacred Senate,</hi> out of which ſhould iſſue coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel for all men: I came not to ſee you, becauſe you were Conquerors of other Nations, but, becauſe I thought you were more vertuous then all other. But, I dare ſay, except the Gods have made me blind, or taken away my underſtanding, either you are not <hi>Romans</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> or this is not <hi>Rome</hi> of the <hi>Romans</hi> your predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. We have heard that the Kingdoms conquered by their valour, were conſerved by the wiſdom of this <hi>Senate;</hi> but methinks you are more likely to loſe, then to keep what your Fathers got; For their exerciſe was in realities, and you conſume your time in comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and vain ceremonies: I have almoſt killed my ſelf with laughing at you, to ſee with what punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alities you leave off thoſe Arms at the <hi>Senate</hi> gate, with which your Anceſtors defended the Empire. What pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is it to your Suppliants, that you lay off thoſe Arms which may hurt one, and put on thoſe which deſtroy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:44454:41"/>
all the world? What avails it us, that you enter the Senate without ſword or dagger, whileſt you are armed with malice in your hearts? Know, ye Romans, we dread you not, as <hi>armed Captains,</hi> but, as <hi>malitious Senators;</hi> we fear not your <hi>ſwords and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ggers,</hi> but <hi>your hearts and tongues.</hi> It were leſs injury, if going armed into the <hi>Senate,</hi> you took away our lives, then to ſuffer Innocents to be deſtroyed, by not diſpatching their affairs. I neither underſtand what ye intend, nor can ſuffer with patience what I ſee you do. In my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try we diſarm Fools: Now, whether your Arms be taken from you as <hi>Fools or Mad-men,</hi> I know not: If it be done becauſe ye are Fools; ſurely it is not the Law of the Gods, that three hundred Fools ſhould govern three hundred thouſand wiſe men. I have tarried here for my anſwer a long ſeaſon, and by your delayes, I am further from a diſpatch, then I was the firſt day. We bring you hither, Hony, Oyl, Saffron, Wood, Salt, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and you ſend us away to ſeek Juſtice elſewhere. You have one Law whereby to gather your Tributes, and another whereby to determine Juſtice: For, we muſt pay our Tributes in one day, but you will not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our Arrands in a whole year. Either take away our lives, that our buſineſſes may have an end, or hear our complaints, that we may live to ſerve you. If you think my words extravagant, and find them offenſive, ſo you will do Juſtice to my Country, take my life; and ſo I make an end.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe were his words,</hi> Catullus, <hi>which I got in writing, and may now ſay, that the ſame boldneſs and high ſpirit, which</hi> Romans <hi>exerciſed heretofore in other Countries,</hi> Strangers <hi>now dare to expreſs in</hi> Rome. <hi>For this Speech ſome would have had him puniſhed; but God forbid that any man ſhould ſuffer for ſaying Truth in my preſence;</hi>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:44454:42"/>
               <hi>ſeeing that is more then enough which men ſuffer, though we then perſecute them not, when they boldly inform us of their grievances. The ſheep cannot be preſerved from wolves, if the Shepherds dogs bark not; and there is no Law of Gods or mans which awardeth puniſhment for</hi> Liars, <hi>that will permit any one ſhould be puniſhed for ſpeaking Truth: Yet now, men are chaſtiſed more for murmuring againſt one</hi> Senator, <hi>then for blaſpheming all the</hi> Gods <hi>at once. We need not ſeek to the</hi> Gods <hi>in our</hi> Temples: <hi>For, the</hi> Senators <hi>take upon them to be</hi> Gods; <hi>but there is great difference betwixt them: For, the</hi> Gods <hi>do nothing that is evil, and the</hi> Senators <hi>nothing that is good: The</hi> Gods <hi>never lie, and the</hi> Senators <hi>never speak truth: The</hi> Gods <hi>pardon often, and they never forgive: The</hi> Gods <hi>are content to be honoured five times in a year, and the</hi> Senators <hi>would be honoured ten times in a day: The</hi> Gods <hi>are conſtant in every thing, and fail in nothing, the</hi> Senators <hi>are ſtedfaſt in nothing, and fail in all things; and when they intend not to amend their faults, they cannot endure their</hi> Suppliants <hi>ſhould inform them of the Truth. But, be it as it may be; this I am ſure of, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to be juſt, or ſincerely to apply themſelves to any vertue, who withdraw their ears from liſtning to the</hi> Truth: <hi>And no mortal man, be he</hi> Orator, <hi>or</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul, <hi>or</hi> Cenſor, <hi>or</hi> Emperour, <hi>how well ſoever he takes heed to his wayes, and orders his deſires, but he ſhall other while have need of ſome Reproof and Counſel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now I have written concerning others, I will inform thee of ſomewhat concerning my ſelf, becauſe thou deſireſt it. Know that in the</hi> Kalends of January, <hi>I was made</hi> Cenſor <hi>in the</hi> Senate, <hi>which I neither deſired nor deſerve. No wiſe man will ſpontaneouſly take upon himſelf the burthen and charge of looking to other mens affairs; for it is an hard task to pleaſe every man in ſuch an office; and</hi>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:44454:42"/>
               <hi>he who undertakes it, muſt often make ſhew in counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, of that which is not in his heart. Good men only ought to be put into office, and in the eighth Table of our anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Laws, it is enjoyned, That charge of Juſtice be never given to him who ſeeks or deſires it, but that men be choſen to ſuch places with great deliberation, becauſe few men are ſo vertuous and loving to their Country, as to take offices upon themſelves, ſo much for the benefit of other men, as for their own utility. Unhappy is</hi> Rome, <hi>if I be one of thoſe who beſt deſerveth ſuch an office. I had no need of it, but accepted thereof to fulfill the command of</hi> Antonius <hi>my Grandfather, and to be obedient to the</hi> Senate, <hi>who had thereto elected me of their own accord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> leaves it to your grave wiſdoms, who are in <hi>Authoriry,</hi> and to all other prudent Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to make that <hi>Uſe</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding <hi>Fragments</hi> of Antiquity, as they ſhall find cauſe; and to conſider whether theſe be not <hi>Exemplary Precedents,</hi> which may excuſe at leaſt (if not juſtifie) thoſe plain and free expreſſions, which both his <hi>private neceſſities,</hi> and the conſtitution of <hi>Publick Affairs</hi> do require at this preſent, in relation to the <hi>Common Peace,</hi> to the preſervation of Publick <hi>Honour,</hi> and to <hi>himſelf.</hi> Howſoever, he will now conclude, adding only an <hi>humble Prayer</hi> to all you who are in <hi>Power,</hi> and one <hi>reaſonable requeſt</hi> to them, on whoſe behalf he was chiefly induced and emboldened, to draw up this <hi>Pleading.</hi> His <hi>Prayer</hi> to you in Authority, is, that by your mediation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in your ſeveral capacities, means may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, whereby, to the honour of GOD, thoſe <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, Contracts</hi> and <hi>Securities,</hi> made and granted by this <hi>Nations Repreſentative,</hi> may be preſerved without infringement, according to the Tenour of his <hi>Divine Law;</hi> That the Honour and Priviledges of the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi>

               <hi>Nature,</hi> may be duely tendred, by acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Law of Reaſon;</hi> and that the credit of the <hi>Engliſh Nation</hi> may be kept from being violated and diſparaged, by making good what their elected <hi>Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative</hi> engaged to perform, either in <hi>Specie,</hi> or, by a <hi>Recompence</hi> nobly and generouſly vouchſafed; and not by that irrational way of <hi>Diſcount,</hi> which is by ſome propoſed: For it is not only impoſſible, after ſo many years, and ſo many tranſactions, of which no memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials were kept, in expectation of a future <hi>accompt;</hi> but it will be very injurious alſo, unleſs the ſaid <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders</hi> may be allowed to demand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſatisfaction upon <hi>Account</hi> and <hi>Diſcount,</hi> for all their loſſes, their hindrances by expences in time, and their ſuits, ſolicitations, and forbearances occaſioned (without their default) by thoſe engagements which neceſſitated them to be <hi>Purchaſers</hi> or <hi>Lenders;</hi> as alſo, for all <hi>improvements,</hi> by them made at their proper coſt, together with the charges of proſecuting a <hi>Compoſition</hi> before the <hi>Commiſsioners</hi> lately authoriſed to mediate the ſame; and for dammages ſuſtained by Intereſt of money, and loſs of the profits of thoſe Lands, which are intruded upon, and left unoccupied the mean while. Theſe particulars being omitted, it will be as unconſcionable a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> as it would be to <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-Adventurers,</hi> (who muſt ballance their loſſes at one time, with what they gain at another) to compell them to make ſale of their <hi>Wares,</hi> brought home at their laſt Voyage, according to the Disburſments only at that <hi>Return,</hi> without any reſpect had, to what they loſt formerly, or may poſſibly loſe hereafter. Nay, it is far more unconſcionable, in regard that whereas <hi>Merchants</hi> do uſually gain ſufficiently, at one time or other, to make them both ſavers and gainers, toward
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:44454:43"/>
the advance of their eſtates; many of the ſaid <hi>Purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders,</hi> have been by caſualities, by having that which was due unto them detained many years, and otherwiſe by groſs injuſtice, very great loſers, (without their own default) in every Purchaſe, Loan and Contract, made to and with them, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with <hi>Publick Concernments,</hi> and exerciſed the <hi>Supream Power,</hi> without contradiction; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, being conſcientiouſly obedient, they ought in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have their obedience rewarded, as it was ſaid, their Piety and Charity ſhould be, who adminiſtred to his neceſſities as a Diſciple of <hi>Chriſts,</hi> who came in the name of his Diſciple, though peradventure he was an <hi>Impoſtor.</hi> And it is more then probable, that many of the ſaid <hi>Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders,</hi> if they have gotten ought, or been ſavers by the ſaid <hi>Parliaments</hi> Grants in one particular, have loſt more then the whole Intereſt and Principal of their Disburſments in the reſt of their Contracts, Expences and Debts, pretended to have been ſecured unto them by the ſaid <hi>Parliament,</hi> as it hath happened unto this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> in his own particular.</p>
            <p>His <hi>ſingle requeſt,</hi> before-mentioned, to his <hi>Fellow-Purchaſers</hi> and <hi>Lenders,</hi> ſhall be but this, that, they would be more juſt and reſpective unto him, then ſome of them have been (as he hears) in their Cenſures paſſed upon this <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> when it was peruſed in private: For, though it were voluntarily by him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, with as much regard unto their good, as unto his own oppreſſive ſufferings, without putting them to any coſt or pains, (though alſo, none or few of them had more juſt cauſe to complain; though he is more certain of the reality of his own oppreſſions, then of all theirs, and though the <hi>Common Grievances</hi> may
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:44454:44"/>
thereby be more illuſtrated, then by many of their <hi>ſufferings.)</hi> They, nevertheleſs, not conſidering (as uſually they do in their own caſes) that <hi>Egomet mihi proximus,</hi> do grudge this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> the mentioning his <hi>perſonal wrongs;</hi> and (as if they who ſuffered moſt, had leaſt right to complain) miſconſter his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting upon his own Oppreſſions, as not comely in their judgement, or elſe, as likely to make his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the leſs effectual on their behalf; which want of Prudence, Juſtice and Charity, he cannot well approve of; and therefore deſires them to be more thankful to their friends, leſt they diſcourage every man from Apologizing for them, when they cannot, or dare not ſpeak for themſelves. Though this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends well to all, he hath no ſuch ill meaning to <hi>himſelf,</hi> as in the proſecution of the <hi>Common Intereſt,</hi> ſottiſhly to neglect his own <hi>well being,</hi> when it is therewith involved. He might have inſerted much more in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion both to the <hi>Puhlick Intereſt,</hi> and to his <hi>own,</hi> but he confeſſeth he hath omitted in prudence, not a few Arguments of more ſtrength then any yet alleadged; becauſe, he knows they may at this time, be more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to him, then available to that <hi>Cauſe</hi> for which he pleadeth; and that it would have been ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther madneſs then diſcretion, to produce them out of ſeaſon. That, which he hath offered to conſideration, is expreſſed with a good Conſcience toward <hi>GOD,</hi> his <hi>Prince,</hi> his <hi>Countrey,</hi> and to each individual perſon therein: and he deſires no otherwiſe to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper in this world, then as he is an enemy to no mans perſon, whatſoever his <hi>judgement</hi> be, but only to his <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Vices;</hi> and as he unfeignedly deſires ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their <hi>converſion,</hi> then their impoveriſhment, ſhame and confuſion.

            <p>THis <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> being deſirous that the Honour and well-being both of the King and People, may be preſerved by a timely ſupply of all their neceſſities; and hearing ſince the concluſion of this <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance,</hi> that his Majeſtie hath preſent uſe of a very great ſumm of Money, an <hi>Expedient,</hi> came ſuddenly into thought, whereby in his judgement, he may not only be ſupplyed, but thereby prevent alſo a great miſchief which is already felt, and whereof we ſhall every day grow more and more ſenſible, by that dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which is now practiſed to draw a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Kingdoms Treaſure into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate hands.</p>
            <p>For, the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks,</hi> by being repoſſeſſed of about an hundred forty and two thouſand pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> (as this Remonſtraant is credibly informed) by <hi>Impropriations,</hi> now well near all out of Leaſe, beſides Parſonages and Vicaridges, with other vaſt Revenues lately ſo

the Kings Favour; and who, being (for the moſt part) old men, with one foot and a half in the Grave (and ſome of them childleſs) ſhall not only have more left then is neceſſary; yea, much more (though nothing be left them but their yearly Rents) then either their <hi>Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> had, or then they will deſerve, as now they are conſtituted: But, by this means alſo, much money which is, or which probably would elſe be Hoorded up, to the Publick dammage, will be diſperſed to the advance of <hi>Trading,</hi> and to the employing of many thouſands, who now want bread for their Families, becauſe there is not wherewith to ſet them on work: Or elſe, (which will be a far better <hi>Expedient,</hi> if the King were ſo pleaſed) he may be ſupplyed more to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by the Purchaſers of the ſaid <hi>Prelates</hi> Lands, if by his favour they were thereto en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, as they might juſtly be: For, this <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrant</hi> is perſwaded, if they might have their <hi>Bargains</hi> and <hi>Sales</hi> confirmed by Parliament, with his Royal aſſent, they would contribute a more bountiful ſupply then the <hi>Prelates;</hi> and would be Poſſeſſors and Occupiers of thoſe eſtates for the future, more to the glory of God, more for his, with the Publick honour and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and more for the lawful benefit and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of private Perſons: And, this <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> can not forbear openly to profeſs, that he thinks
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44454:46"/>
in his conſcience, the <hi>Prelates</hi> are neither conſiſtent with an Orthodox <hi>Chriſtian Diſcipline,</hi> nor with the lawful Intereſts of <hi>King</hi> or <hi>People:</hi> And, that he wonders at the madneſs of this Generation, ſeeing ſo many thouſands within their knowledge undone by truſting to the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains, Sales and Securities of their <hi>Parliaments,</hi> which were thought the beſt <hi>Security</hi> in the world; that, they will now adventure their money upon ſo ſlender a ſecurity, as the hand and ſeal only, of old doting men, who are Tenants but for life, (perhaps, but during pleaſure) without a <hi>general warranty,</hi> by ſome good Collateral Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. But, let thoſe adventrous Contractors do as they pleaſe; The <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> having played the Fool himſelf in truſting to ſuch <hi>Securities,</hi> hath no reaſon to grudge other men the liberty to buy wit with their own money; and though in charity, he would prevent their dammage, yet, knowing he ſhall never be able to make ſuch men wiſer by examples or counſel, until they have as well paid for it as he hath done, he will ſcrible no more to that purpoſe; but conclude all with this prayer, GOD BLESS THE KING and PEOPLE, and encline thoſe who can better vindicate the <hi>Publick Faith</hi> of this <hi>Nation,</hi> to contribute their endeavours in due ſeaſon.</p>
