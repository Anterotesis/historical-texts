            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>As, 1. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> deſired to live

dead cannot praiſe thee;</hi> intimating,
that if he had been then taken off

God no more ſervice; he was loth
to be cut down, till he had borne
more fruit. Beſides, had he then
died in the infancy of Reformation,
the adverſaries of God would have

at his Funeral.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:115983:19"/>
2. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was unwilling to dye
at that time, becauſe he wanted iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.
God had promiſ'd to <hi>David,
1 King. 8. 25.</hi> That thoſe of his
line which were godly, ſhould not
want ſome of their ſeed to ſucceed
them in the Throne; now in this
reſpect it was a great diſcomfort to
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> to dye childleſſe; for he
might have thought himſelf no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than an hypocrite, inaſmuch as
God had promiſed iſſue to the Kings
of <hi>Davids</hi> line that feared him.
Upon theſe, and other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Hezekiah</hi> might pray againſt
death at that juncture of time.</p>
            <p>And whereas it may be ſaid that
many of Gods children are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to dye. I anſwer, a Chriſtian is
a compounded creature, <hi>fleſh and
ſpirit,</hi> and from this compoſition
there may be a conflict between the
fear of death and the deſire of
death, but at laſt the ſpiritual part
prevails; and as faith grows ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115983:20"/>
fears grow weaker; thus it
was with <hi>Paul, having</hi> a deſire to
depart</p>
            <p>So much for the firſt branch of
the doctrine, that it is the deſire of

            <p n="2">2. I proceed now to the ſecond

in <hi>departing,</hi> if the Apoſtle had
not put in this word, <hi>to be with

change to a believer; 'tis but
croſſing the <hi>mare mortuum,</hi> the
<hi>dead Sea,</hi> and he ſhall be with
Chriſt. Death to a childe of God
is like the Whirl-wind to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

but carried the Prophet up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
So death is a boiſterous wind
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115983:20"/>
which blowes off the mantle
fo the fleſh, (for the body

in) but it carries the ſoul up to
Chriſt; the day of a believers diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,
is the day of his coronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Though death be a <hi>bitter
cup,</hi> here is ſugar at the bottome,
it tranſlates the ſoul of a believer
to Chriſt; though the fleſh calls
death <hi>the laſt enemy,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> yet faith

vertue of it, whereupon his fathers

Ring I may compare faith, there is
a counterfeit faith in the world, but
if we can finde this Ring of faith

purgative and operative, this is the
true faith which doth intereſt us
