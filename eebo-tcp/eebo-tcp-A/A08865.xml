            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

mekely for them vnto our lorde that
he suffred them nat to be tempted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
their power. The contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue
man also must be discrete in his
prayers / and be well ordred in hys
laudes and praysynges of god / for if
he haue suffycient to lyue with / with
out labour or busynesse he must ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke
the lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger praiers. And if he be we<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
and temptacyon ryse in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
 / he may labour with his handes
some honest and profytable werke / eyther
for hym selfe / if he haue nede

man haue nat suffycyent to
lyue withal but through his labour
than may he make the shorter pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for his necessari labour / and that
<pb facs="tcp:8847:10"/>
labour shall be the perfection and en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creasynge
of his praier / and if he can
nat labour nor may nat / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> let him
nat be a shamed / ne thinke it nat gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uous
to begge / but rather that he be
ioyous for it / for tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he foloweth me
the sonne of god / that made my selfe

ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> distrybuteth temporall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
for god so the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatyue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
must dystribute his spiritual goodꝭ.
Moreouer if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatyue man
wyll haue almyghtye god inwardly
in his herte / let him be ware to saye
thus as many do. It suffyseth to me
if I can saue myne owne soule / for if
I can do so / what haue I to do with
the dedꝭ of other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / or if I be good
my selfe / what is it to me how other

lyue. O my doughter / they that say
or thynke so / if they sawe their fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
dyshonested and troubled / they
shulde renne with all their power to
the deth / that theyr frende myght be
delyuered out of his trouble / so shal
the contemplatyue man do / he must
sorowe that almighty god is offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded
that his brother which is hys neigh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boure
hath occasion to offende. And
if any fall in to synne / the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tyue
man shal endeuour him al that
he can to helpe hym out of his synne
with al dyscretyon. And if he haue
trouble or persecution for it / set him
leue that place and seke another pla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ce
that is more quyet. For I my self
that am very god / sayd to my discy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
thus. If they ꝑsecute you i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oue

seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d is clothyng to clothe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> naked.
The thirde is meate to fede the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grye.
The fourthe is fyer to warme
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be colde. The fyfth is medi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>syns
for them that be sycke / that is
to say good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fortable wordes with

the cuyl ghestes be al tho thinges
that trouble his hert / that is to say / wrath / heuynesse / couetyse / pryde / and
many other lyke. Therfore all
tho vyces whan the come / they shall

as they that be at rest. For
as an host receyueth euyll ghestes &amp;

in no wyse to consente to vyces / nat
to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that seme leest / ne to dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te

of grace / to remoue them clerely out

remoue them / he muste suffre theym
pacyently agaynste his wyll as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myes
<pb facs="tcp:8847:11"/>
 / and neuer to assente to theym
knowynge certaynly that they shall
profyte him to the greatter rewarde

the contemplatyue man muste

is to say mekenesse / both inwar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de

And if the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatyue man
be dyspysed of the worlde / lette hym
thynke how I the god almyghty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge
contempned and dyspysed suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred
pacyently / and whan I was iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
I helde my peace / and whan I
was scourged &amp; crowned with thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
I murmured nat. The contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platyue
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> also must take hede that
he shewe nat to them that reproue hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
or rebuke hym any sygnes of angre
or impacye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce / but that he blesse them
that persecute him / that they that se
it may blesse god whom the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platyue

god shall gyue blessynges

<pb facs="tcp:8847:12"/>
he do nat speke euyll of them nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke

is dampnable to bacbyte other and
wylfully to here them that do bachy<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te

y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatyue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may haue ꝑ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fytely

clothyng of the contemplatyue man
must be compassyon / for if he se his

the contemplatyue man be suche one
that he is nat herde with pri<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces / and
that it profyteth nat that he go oute

that he shall either be delyuered out

Thirdly the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platyue man must

bedes / and a forgetfulnesse of thingꝭ
to come. And whan he thinketh his
good dedes gret / and forgetteth his
euyl dedes. Agaynst al such ghestes
it is necessarye for the contemplaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
man to haue good counsayle / and
nat to dyssemble as though he were
a slepe / but that he armed strongely
with trewe faithe / answere to suche
ghestes / sayenge thus. I woll haue
nothinge of themporall goodes / but
barcly for the sustaynynge of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily

and helthe of my soule / for I wolde
nat lyue one hour but to the honour
of god. Suche a wyll is meate and
drike for the ghestes that come / and
that answere extincteth and putteth
away all inordinate delytes and ple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sures
of the worlde and of the flessh.</p>
            <p>Fourthly the contemplatyue man
must haue fyre to warm hys ghestes
and to gyue them lyght / this fyre is
the hete of the holy ghoste / it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possyble
any man to leaue his owne
wyll / or to forsake the carnall loue
of his frendes or the loue of rychesse
but through the instynte and here of
the holy ghost. Also the coutempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue

nor contynue in good lyf with

Therfore that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templatyue ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
may set a lyght before hys ghestes / Fyrst
let him thinke thus: Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye
god hath created me / that I shul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de
honoure hym aboue all thynges / And
in honourynge him / that I shul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de

borne of a vyrgyn / to teache me the

that way in all mekenesse. And
with his deth he opened the yates of
heuen / that I shulde wyth great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syre

al his dedes / all his thoughtꝭ and
all his affectyons / that is to say how
he hath offended god / and howe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyently

the contemplatyue man / be in maner
but as they were a slepe / but they be
illumynate with the fyre of the holy
ghost: the whiche fyre than cometh
in to the hert / whan the contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyue

is to serue god / and whan he thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
that he had leuer suffre all pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wyttyngly to prouoke god to

is create and made / and is also rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

also the herte hath here of this heue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

wyth drede of god. Therfore
that this fyre may be gotten / &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
it is gotten that it may be safely kep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>te.
The contemplatyue man must ley
to drie stickes / that is to say he must
dilygently take hede of the motyons
of the flesshe / that it rebell nat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
the spirite. And he must put
to all his dilygence that the workes
of pytie and good prayers may be de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uoutly
encreased / wherwith the holy

specyally knowe and consyder that

that hath no auoydaunce / anone the

he getteth spirituall children to god
but the contemplatyue man must ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke

if the contemplatyue man maye nat

many places / and where he fyndeth
the softest place and most apte for hi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
there he maketh a denne to rest hym

assay with wordes / with examples / and
with good praiers / the hertes of
many people / and where he fyndeth
the hertes most apte to here the wor<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des

more pleasure to god that he do hys

And it is to vnderstand / that the con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>templatyue

<pb facs="tcp:8847:21"/>
that whan Martha prayde
for her brother Lazar that was deed
she came fyrst to me / but her brother
was nat raysed forthwith vpon her
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>myng / but afterward Mary was
called / and whan she came / tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the
prayer of them both togyther / theyr
brother was raysed fro dethe. So it
is spyrytually / for he that desyreth
perfytely to come to the lyfe contem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>platyue / must
fyrst exercise him selfe
well in the actyue lyfe / labouring all
that he may to the honoure of god in
good bodily labours. And lerne first
to resyst all fleshly desyres / &amp; to with
stande myghtely the fendes tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions / and
than he maye afterwarde

and of an vnconstaunt mynde / and
therfore it is but as it were deed

And than euery good dede of man or
woman is plesau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to god. Therfore
I sayde in my gospell / that Marye
had chosen the better parte. The

he laboureth all that he maye that
his neyghbours may do well &amp; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuer

all that he doth for the loue of god.
But the parte of the contemplatyue

whan the mynde is fulfylled w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good
