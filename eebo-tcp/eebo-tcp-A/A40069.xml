            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

buſineſſe ſeemes to be wrapt up in one Bare vote, <hi>viz.</hi> [that all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernumerary forces ſhall be disbanded.]</p>
            <p>As to which matter of disbanding ſupernumeraries (ſo it bee with reaſonable ſatisfaction in point of Arreares,) we are ſo farre from oppoſing, or obſtructing it, that (for the ſpeedy eaſing of the Kingdomes burthens by it) wee ſhall readily give all furtherance and aſſiſtance to it, and ſhall (by and by) offer that incouragement thereto, as will demonſtrate the ſame, and on ſuch tearmes wee ſhould our ſelves moſt gladly bee of thoſe ſupernumeraries that ſhould come firſt to disbanding.</p>
            <p>But, as to the thought of preſent disbanding all ſupernumeraries (according to the Vote) firſt we cannot but wiſh it be conſidered, whether with any reſpect at all to the ſervice, and reliefe of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Parliament can well disband them all, unto which ſervice (as there might have beene a great advancement of aſſiſtance long ſince, but for the prevalence of Faction and deſigne to breake that force that might have afforded it, as wee have formerly remonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) ſo we have more lately contributed our parts, in the offer and deſignation of a very conſiderable force thereunto, and there hath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wanted nothing but reſolution and money, with expedition to ſend them over, which was not within our power.</p>
            <p>But if (with reſpect to that ſervice and the ſafety of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) the Parliament can yet leſſen their forces ſo much, as to bring them neere the compaſſe of ſixty thouſand pounds a moneths pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, yet, wee wiſh it be withall, conſidered how many thoſe ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeraries are, that muſt ſo come to bee preſently disbanded (which, to bring the reſidue within that compaſſe, would bee little leſſe then twenty thouſand of one ſort or other) and (if ſo) how great a ſumme it would require, to give any reaſonable ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſo many in point of Arreares in hand; And (by the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of getting ſo much money as to piece up the moneths pay to the Army) wee have much reaſon to doubt how long the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be in raiſing ſuch a ſumme together, or where they will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuddenly find money, to give competent ſatisfaction to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but of a Regiment or two upon a preſent disbanding, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they be provided with preſent money, to give reaſonable ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction

            <p>Now, for the advantage and benefit of the things here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, they will appeare as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi> Whereas upon the former ſuppoſition (that the putting off the Soldiery that are to be continued into a way of conſtant pay, do depend only upon the disbanding of all ſupernumeraries, whom the preſent Tax will not extend to pay) Its moſt evident (as before demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) that none can be put into preſent pay, but all muſt goe on upon free quarter, ſo long as untill every one of the ſaid ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeraries be disbanded (which what ever may be imagined) though no other difficulties or obſtructions ſhould happen then what are now viſible, as before mentioned, would not be effected, nor (we doubt) provided for in three or foure moneths time, wee wiſh it prove ſo ſoon: but we much feare interruptions, or delayes, will happen to make it much longer, and all that while (free quarter continuing as before) the burthen thereof (beſides the anoyances) though it fall more lightly upon ſome parts and heavier upon others, yet in the whole it damnifies the Kingdom as much as the ſaid increaſed contributions come to.

            <p n="1">1. That ſuch of the ſaid forces as ſhall come to be disbanded as ſupernumeraries, ſhall (out of the moneys to be raiſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſecurity for Arreares) have the full moity of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reares firſt made good to them, as moneyes come in hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before thoſe which fall out to be continued ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any part of theirs, and after that (when thoſe that continue, ſhall have received the like proportion of theirs then) theſe that ſhal be disbanded to receive the other moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or full remainder of their Arreares, before theſe that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue any more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That thoſe of them which ſhall disband, ſhall (as moneyes come in upon the ſaid ſecurity) receive their proportions of Arreares in the ſame order and courſe as they disband, (of which order and courſe a remembrance to bee entered and kept in the afore-ſaid Regeſtry of theſe accompts) the perſons of the Regiment, Troope, or Company firſt disban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſo the reſt in courſe, to receive firſt what was due to them at disbanding (to make up their firſt moity) by two equall portions, and likewiſe to receive their ſecond moity at twice, by equall portions, in the ſame courſe as they disband.</p>
            <p>Now for our deſire in the firſt propoſition afore-going, (to have the increaſe of Contribution extended to the proportion of ten thouſand pounds a moneth (by eſtimate) over &amp; above

fore-caſt in the Diſtributions and Aſſignments, to leavye the taxes of ſome Counties, (and that as many as may be) to come intirely into the common Treaſury for the reliefe of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> without aſſaying any of the Forces in <hi>England</hi> to bee paid out of them.</p>
            <p>And for that power deſired for making ſuch Diſtributions and Aſſignments, the advantages and benefits of that way of Reparticion (as to the more ſure and ready payment of Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers) are ſufficiently knowne and tryed: and it is moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident, that without it, (if no Souldiers be paid before the moneyes be firſt Collected in the ſeverall Counties, and then ſent into the Common Treaſury for all the Kingdome, and then ſent to the Head Quarters, or thence diſtributed to the ſeverall Forces within the Kingdome, it is in vaine to think that the Souldiers can be ſupplyed with money afore-hand, or timely enough to make him pay Quarters, and 'tis as good (almoſt) not at all, as not in time.</p>
            <p>Wee have thus propounded a way whereby all the Souldie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Kingdome may bee inſtantly put in a condition of conſtant pay (while continued) and thereby bee kept in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and diſcipline, all free quarter (with the abuſes, exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, annoyances, and unequall preſſures that accompany it) immediately taken off, no further debt of Arreares incurred upon the Kingdome, and that which is already incurred, put in a way to bee recovered and overcome in time, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſupernumerary forces may ſhortly be disbanded by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees (as the Parliament can finde money to doe it) and will bee ſatisfiable to disband, with leſſe money in hand, without danger of diſ-obligation therein, and whereby alſo the additionall charge (now propounded) with other bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens of the Kingdome may by the ſame degrees be leſſened and eaſed with ſafety and ſatisfaction, untill all can bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off.</p>
            <p>And as it is evident, that if ſuch a courſe as this had been
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59117:11"/>
taken ſooner, and the Parliament (as they found the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall parts of the Kingdome cleared from the enemy, and eaſed of the oppreſſions they ſuffered under them) had by degrees extended an equall contribution over all parts in a proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſufficient to have payed all their forces (while they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued them) the Kingdome had been eaſed of free quarter, and no further debt of arreares to the Soldiery incurred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, for (at leaſt) a yeare and halfe agoe, thoſe that have been disbanded had not been put off with ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obligation (as ſome have been) nor had their claimes and endleſſe demands ſince brought ſuch troubles upon, or drawne ſuch vaſt arrears from the Parliament and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and thoſe that now remaine to be disbanded had been much eaſier ſatisfyable and more readily disbanded; So if ſuch a courſe (as is here propounded) be not ſpeedily taken, but the putting off the Soldiery into a way of pay be left to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend only, upon the disbanding of all ſupernumeraries (and that ſo unprovided for) or ſo uncertainly and ſlowly provided for, and proceeded in (as without this courſe) it is like to be) it is moſt evident (beſides unforeſeen dangers of diſcontent both in the Soldiery and Country of difficulties to disband, or interruptions and diſſatisfactions in it) that the non-disband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome will ſo long occaſion the non-payment of all, and continue free quarter, with the inconveniences thereof upon all, and the non-payment of all may hinder the disbandin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſcharged our ſelves in this point, ſo as we ſhall (we hope) ſtand acquitted before God and men from whatever evils enſue upon any further neglect there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; We muſt now declare, That we find the juſt expectations of the Army herein (eſpecially ſince the Generalls late Eengage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or undertakings at the Randezvouz) are ſo great and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, the clamours &amp; outcryes to us from other forces, &amp; Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

of the Kingdome ingaged with the Army (for their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame neceſſity, and our apprehended neglect of equall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them) are ſo ſad and preſſing, the diſcontents of the Country (from the oppreſſions of free quarter) are ſo full and yet growing, and almoſt deſperate, and the diſtempers diſtractions, and dangers threatened by all theſe are ſo vaſt and emminent, as wee can no longer ſtand and under the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or blame of them.

that unleſſe it be thought fit, that the whole Kingdome ſhould groane ſtill under the oppreſſions of free quarter, and theſe adjacent Counties be undone chiefely while thoſe of the City (that occaſional) ſit free from any taſt of it, there may be no longer ſtop to the drawing in of the Army, or a conſiderable part of it to quarter upon them in the City (who had not paid before the ſaid let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, untill they ſhal have paid both the Arrears and ful penalties; And though our tenderneſs of that Cities ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty &amp; welfare, and our clearneſs from the leaſt thought of evil towards it, or any baſe deſigne to make the leaſt advantage to our ſelves, or the army by it hath ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared, as in al our former demeanments, ſo in our cariage of the buſineſs upon our late advance towards it (notwithſtanding the juſt occaſions, &amp; great provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions thence ſo newly given) as alſo in our innocent march through it, and quiet and patient waiting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it for thoſe long-due Arreares, without quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering any Souldiers in it; Yet now, in Juſtice, we cannot but deſire that, (beſides the levying of the Arreares at laſt (for which wee have been put to ſtay ſo long) there may now likewiſe ſome reparation be thought on from the City to the parts adjacent for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove one hundred thouſand pounds dammage ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned through the Armies attendance here on the Cities defaults and delayes; which reparation, we (if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated thereto, or called upon by the Countrey) muſt in their behalfe demand from the City to the full; and now alſo (the rather in order to that) we muſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire that the proceedings againſt thoſe Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens and others lately impeacht may be haſtned, and out of their fines or confiſcations, ſome part of repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be made to the Countries adjacent for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid dammages which the crimes of thoſe perſons and others in the City did firſt bring upon them; And indeed, without ſomething done againſt thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, for example to others, before the Armies with drawing, wee doe not ſee (when it ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:59117:13"/>
with what ſafety or freedome the Parliament can ſit longer at Weſtminſter, eſpecially when wee finde the Common Councell (through the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Armies lenity) to take the boldneſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready (in the face of both) to intercede for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe and acquitall (or rather juſtification) of thoſe impeached perſons, (who indeed are but fellow-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lionuents (wee doubt) to moſt of that Councell) as if that ſo actuall, immediate, and horrid a force upon both and the whole Houſes of Parliament, and the levying of Warre in abettment and proſecution thereof, and of that concurrent Treaſonable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, were already forgotten by them to have beene any crime; the conſideration whereof, and of the renewed confidence of Maſter <hi>Gewen</hi> and ſome other Members of Parliament, (knowne to have beene partakers, if not principals in the ſame things) who yet preſume, and are ſuffered to appeare againe in the Houſe (as if in thoſe things there had not been ſo much fault, as to render them leſſe worthy of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in that higheſt truſt) makes us begin to fear, that, while ſo much of the ſame leaven (through le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and moderation) is left behinde, it may ſhortly ſpread, til even the worſt of the eleven Members (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their doubled crimes) be again called for in, unleſſe the Houſe (by ſome excluſive reſolutions and proceedings) do timely prevent the ſame; Wee hope therefore the Parl. will weigh theſe things, and ſpeedily (ere it be too late) conſult (at leaſt) their own ſafety and the Kindoms, if not ours and the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, their poore ſervants, and ſomething concerned with them (eſpecially) in that affaire.</p>
            <p>Next, we again more importunately deſire, that thoſe other ſo neare concernments of the Souldiery (expreſt in the Generalls late Remonſtrance at the Rendezvouz) may be ſpeedily conſidered, and fully &amp; effectually provided for; In order to which wee ſhall here more particularly propound as followeth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:59117:13"/>Firſt, as to the ſecurity for Arrears, whereas (in the late Votes or Propoſition intended for that purpoſe) the two thirds of the Lands or Compoſitions of certain Delinquents aſſigned towards the ſaid Security, is onely of the Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents within the three firſt Qualifications of the 16th Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; We deſire that may be altered ſo, as to be two Thirds of the Lands or Compoſitions of all the Delinquents that have not yet compounded. And next we muſt deſire, that Deans and Chapters Lands may be added (with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo for reaſonable ſatisfaction or maintenance to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as, having a preſent lawfull Intereſt in any the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues thereunto belonging, have not forfeited the ſame by Delinquencie). Theſe Additions are deſired, becauſe the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity as yet Voted is juſtly eſtimated not to be ſufficient, and ſince all that is propounded is but for Security, if the Security prove to exceed the Arrears really due, the ſurplu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage will be free for any other publick uſe, ſo as the State will not be damnified by theſe Additions to the Security. Laſtly, (as to this buſineſſe) we deſire, that the matters of Security (being reſolved on as deſired) may be paſt into Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and thereby put into a ſpeedie and effectually way of raiſing Moneys thereupon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, for matter of Indemnity, that if no Indemnity more abſolute can be provided, (to free the Souldiery from all queſtion for things done in the War) but that they muſt (in caſe of queſtion at Law) flie to ſome Committee or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for relief; It may be provided for the eaſe of all, that (either under the Grand Committee for Indemnity, or otherwiſe by the immediate appointment of Parliament) there may be Commiſſioners in each County impowered to give relief in ſuch Caſes, as the Grand Committee now are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thoſe Commiſſioners to be ſuch as ordinarily reſide in the reſpective Counties, and mixt of ſuch as have been Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Officers to the Parliament, together with ſuch Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants as have appeared active and faithfull for the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the late War; for which purpoſe we ſhall (if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) offer names; and that there may be a ſevere Penalty
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:59117:14"/>
layed upon Judges, or other Officers of Juſtice, in caſe they ſhall proceed againſt any contrary to the Ordinance for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that ſufficient Proviſion be made in a certain, and no diſhonourable way, for the relief and ſupport of maimed Souldiers, and the Widows and Orphans of men that dyed in the Service, to continue during the lives of the maimed, and widows, and during the minority of their O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans; And that the ſame Commiſſioners (to be appointed in each County for Indemnity as aforeſaid) or others in like manner mixt, may be impowered for this purpoſe alſo; And in caſe of the death of any ſuch Commiſſioner, or their departure out of their reſpective Counties, thoſe that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, or remain, may chooſe new ones to fill up the number.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thus for the Juſt freedom of Apprentices, who have ſerved the Parliament, there may be a ſufficient penalty laid upon Maſters refuſing or delaying to give the ſame, when their times are out, accounting the time they have ſerved in the war as part. And that the Apprentiſe may have his Action at law for that penalty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For freedom from impreſting, that (as no free-man of <hi>England,</hi> may be impreſted for any forraign ſervice, or other then for the immediate defence of it, ſo) no ſouldier that hath voluntarily ſerved the Parliament in the late Warre, for the liberties of the Kingdom, may be liable to be preſt, for any Military ſervice at all: and that it may be promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that a Certificate of his ſaid ſervice as a Voluntier, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the hand and ſeale of his Collonel, or other Field Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, under whom he hath ſerved, may be a ſufficient Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and diſcharge to him, from any ſuch impreſting.</p>
            <p>Having thus diſcharged our ſelves, in thoſe matters which are our moſt proper, and immediate buſineſſe (the concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Souldiery) and for which we redouble our deſires, that the two firſt (concerning the putting them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to conſtant pay while continued, and Proviſion for their Arreares) may be firſt conſidered, and immediately ſettled before any other buſineſſe, and then that the reſt of them
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:59117:14"/>
may alſo be provided for, aſſoon as may be. Now though the two firſt of theſe, want not their equall concernments to the Kingdom, (in the preſent taking of the oppreſſion of free-quarter, preventing the increaſe of Arrears, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or preparing for the more eaſie and ſatisfactory diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banding of ſupernumeraries, and thereby the better eaſing of the Kingdoms burthens by degrees) Yet we cannot in any of our addreſſes of this kind, ſo far forget thoſe things we have formerly declared concerning (more purely) the publick intereſt of the Kingdom and our ſelves, as members of it, but we muſt herewith renew our humble and earneſt deſires, that no time may be loſt by the Parliament for the juſt conſideration and diſpatch of theſe things, both for the redreſſe of Common greivances, releife of the oppreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the liberty, ſecurity, quiet and ſome ſafe ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Kingdome; and more eſpecially, that theſe things of this nature, expreſt in the late Remonſtrance at the Rendezvous, may in ſuch ſettlement be fully and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually provided for, (and that) with as much expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as may be. And it is our hearts deſire and hope, that herein the proceedings and reſolutions of the Parliament may be ſuch, and ſo timous, as that we may not need any more to remind the Parliament in any of thoſe things which (as far as with truth or any ſafety to that moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging intereſt of the publique, and to thoſe that have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for it, we may forbeare) we are moſt unwilling and take no pleaſure to meddle in.</p>
