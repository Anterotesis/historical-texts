            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>Paſt out againſt me? muſt I needs to Rome?</l>
            <l>And why? it is contrary to the Lawes</l>
            <l>To judge th' offendor e're they heare the cauſe.</l>
            <l>Why come you arm'd againſt me? what may be</l>
            <l>The cauſe of difference 'twixt you and me?</l>
            <l>Have I tranſgreſt the Law? or did I ever</l>
            <l>Our gracious Soveraigne from his people ſever?</l>
            <l>Did I to a factious covenant ſubſcribe,</l>
            <l>Or turne a <hi>Iack</hi> on both ſides for a bribe?</l>
            <l>Rebells have long our wiſht for bliſſe defer'd,</l>
            <l>All roſe in armes, but yet I never ſtir'd.</l>
            <l>When ſuch a <hi>Prick-eare</hi> troope upon me gaz'd,</l>
            <l>Crying (no <hi>Croſſe</hi>) good faith I ſtood amaz'd:</l>
            <l>I was ſtroke dumb with wonder, and which worſe,</l>
            <l>Becauſe I'de gold about me, fear'd my purſe.</l>
            <l>This zealous rable came not to adore me,</l>
            <l>Yet (thanks to th' Butchers) ſome fel down before me</l>
            <l>Others ran quite away, the reſt diſputed,</l>
            <l>Miſuſing Scripture phraſes, but confuted.</l>
            <l>Wiſdome they cal'd Apocriphall, threw durt on</l>
            <l>All Fathers faces, but Saint <hi>Prin</hi> and <hi>Burton.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Was God ith' middle of this congregation?</l>
            <l>Or were they led by inſtinct or revelation?</l>
            <l>Kings doft their Crowns, and Cardinals their copes,</l>
            <l>All muſt be bare unto a crew of Crops.</l>
            <l>But do's Religion ſuch a hatred bring,</l>
            <l>To hate the very picture of a King?</l>
            <l>Brethren what would you have? or what d'ye fear?</l>
            <l>I draw no ſword, nor do I wear long hair.</l>
            <l>Ile do no wrong (though arm'd with pikes about)</l>
            <l>Would you know why? T'was to keep Roundheads out,</l>
            <l>Who have not ſworn, but tane a proteſtation</l>
            <l>To leave no golden Croſſe to bleſſe our Nation.</l>
            <l>They will divide my coat, my fleſh, my bones,</l>
            <l>They'le ſhare the gold, and give their wives the ſtones.</l>
            <l>They ſay they'le pluck the Tower of Babel down,</l>
            <l>All things go right when there's no Croſſe ith' Town.</l>
            <l>But who can live without them? Croſſes are</l>
            <l>The good mans bleſſings, and his certain ſhare.</l>
            <l>He that would win an everlaſting Crowne,</l>
            <l>Muſt elevate his Croſſe, not throw it down.</l>
            <l>They'le have no Common Prayer, but doe abhor</l>

            <l>You thinke 'tis juſtice that your factious crew</l>

            <l>You will have fleſh for fleſh, It's very dear</l>
            <l>That <hi>Peters</hi> noſe ſhould pay for <hi>Malchus</hi> ear.</l>
            <l>If he ſhould ſnuffle now, that were a jeſt,</l>
            <l>That very thing would make him full bleſt:</l>
            <l>Youl run to heare him, and cry's doctrine ſtrong,</l>
            <l>Though non-ſenſe, in regard he ſtands ſo long.</l>
            <l>Put out his eyes next time, and you may find</l>
            <l>A ſecond like the firſt, and doctrine blinde.</l>
            <l>Some call me Popiſh, and report they ſee</l>
            <l>Divers adore me, what's all that to me.</l>
            <l>Becauſe they worſhip me ſhal I fall down</l>

            <l>Before Ile bow, Ile fly to ſome new Land.</l>
