            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cauſes of the Diſeaſes and Diſtempers

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen a learned and well experienced Phyſitian, hath
eitherby the Pulſe, Vrin, or other Symptomes,
found out the cauſe of the dangerous diſeaſe of his
Patient, he will know or conjecture what is Cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
or paſt Cure: And as it is with the Body of
Man, ſo in the Body Politique of the Kingdome, if
the cauſes of our diſtempers and diſtractions would or could be
knowne, they might with wiſedome and judgement be removed
and taken away, and then (by conſequence) the Effects would
ceaſe. And though moſt men are either <hi>Fooles</hi> or <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> (or
<note n="a" place="margin">Some men are all theſe, ſome both of theſe, ſome one of theſe, and ſome nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> both) yet few or none hath either found or ſhewed the cauſes or
reaſons of theſe cauſeleſſe and unreaſonable diſturbances. Amongſt
the many Thouſands of oppreſſed ſufferers in this our afflicted <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
my ſelfe (though no <hi>Phiſitian,</hi> yet the Son of a <hi>Chirurgian</hi>)
am one, that hath had a long time of many tryalls and experiments
of <hi>Waters,</hi> and <hi>Water</hi>-Caſting, and I have lately uſed my poor skill
in Caſting the Kingdomes <hi>Water,</hi> and though <hi>Phiſitians</hi> may often
faile in their conjectures, yet<note n="b" place="margin">Fooles and Children will tell truth.</note> 
               <hi>Fooles</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> will many
times tell the Truth by chance.</p>
            <p>I have Caſt the Waters of <hi>Thames, Iſis, Seaverue, Wye, Avon,
Trent, Humber, Owſe, Tweed, Forth, Tay, Spey, Annan,</hi> &amp;c. and (as
I gueſſe) I have found out the true cauſe and cauſes, the needleſſe
why, the impertinent wherefore, and the accurſed unknowne for
what, this former flouriſhing Kingdom is thus Rebelliouſly infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And if I could as well Cure, as diſcover the diſeaſes, my gratious
Soveraigne and all his Loyall Subjects and Servants, ſhould quickly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:113258:2"/>
have their owne againe in Peace. But becauſe <hi>England</hi> doth not
know well what ſhe ayles, (though I cannot cure her) yet I will
tell her how it is.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Members</hi> of this great <hi>Body</hi> do complaine of the <hi>Head,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
that from thence their griefe began; the <hi>Head</hi> is troubled with
too much Akeing, Cares, with extreame overwatchfullneſſe for
the preſervation of the <hi>miſguiding Members,</hi> and the <hi>miſguided Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;</hi>
The <hi>Members</hi> pretend the defence and maintenance of the
knowne Lawes of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The King, (according to thoſe eſtabliſhed knowne Lawes) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to Rule, and alſo requires the lawfull obedience due to His
Majeſty by thoſe Lawes, and no otherwiſe. And thoſe at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
cannot but acknowledge, but that they are all Traytors that
doe refuſe to live in obedience to the King and thoſe knowne
Lawes. But the <hi>Weſtminſterians</hi> doe call all the Proteſtants, and all
others that are obedient to thoſe knowne Lawes, <hi>Malignants,</hi> and
<hi>Popiſhly-affected;</hi> And without Law, (and againſt thoſe Lawes)
they Kill, Impriſon, and Sequeſter all their Lands, Offices, and
Eſtates. And thoſe lawleſſe men doe not only commit this outrage
againſt particulars, but even againſt the whole Body of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
for they have Rob'd it (violently) of the maine Pillar,
prop, and ſupport of their Lives, Livelihoods and Fortunes, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
away from them their Elections of their Knights, Citizens,
and Burgeſſes; for they have turn'd all ſuch out of the Houſe of
Commons, as would not joyne with them in this horrid Rebellion,
<note n="c" place="margin">The Subject is rob'd of his Right, and brought into ſlavery, when the Knights and Burgeſſes (whom they have elected, according to the Lawes) are expulſt out of the Houſe of Commons, contrary to the Law.</note> when as (they being rightly elected and return'd) by the Law
they cannot put out any, but for ſome legall Cauſe, as being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawed
after Rebellion, or for being a Felon, Murtherer or Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</p>
            <p>But theſe Traytors at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> are ſo lawleſſely impudent
and inſolent, that as they dare not (themſelves) be tried by the
knowne Lawes, ſo they will not permit thoſe whom they falſely
accuſe to be Malignants, to be tried by thoſe Lawes, but have kept
ſome in Priſon more then theſe three yeares, becauſe they would
not commit whoredome with the Beaſt at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Tuſh, theſe
are triviall matters, above the reach of a Scullers<note n="d" place="margin">Nor would I have you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that I wrote this Pamphlet, but I doe know my ſelfe able to ſcann all your Neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes; if you have occaſion to uſe me.</note> Capacity, 'tis

deſiring ſome Ginne or Mouſetrappe to catch <hi>Puritans,</hi> and that is
one of your <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> preſidents. By as good reaſon, becauſe
ſome <hi>Theeves</hi> and <hi>Robbers</hi> have not been hang'd, therefore all may
lawfully ſteale and none be hang'd by that preſident; or becauſe one

            </p>
            <p>I doe heartily deſire, I might be permitted to joyne Iſſue with

We are all bound in Loyalty to His Majeſtie, by the Law of

ſhould ſo quickly caſt out the Presbytery, and that the ſaid <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall</hi>

ſtrange it appears to me, that in all other Reformed places, there
is not that warmth, or fire of zeale, to be found any where but in
<hi>Scotland</hi> only, that will kill and ſlay all the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to make them
obey their Kirke (or rather Querke) Government, which is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend

and Peace. I will not meddle or ſpeake of Reformed Churches,
God keep them in unity and Tranquillity; But becauſe I have been
in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and have ſeen ſomewhat, but have heard and Read
much more, of their Querk and their Eccleſiaſticall government,
I will ſay this, that I cannot find any great difference between the
Ieſuit and them. The Jeſuit would have the <hi>Pope</hi> only, to have
all the Spirituall and Temporall powers of the World in him; And
the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> would be every one a ſeverall Pope. And this I
will ſay, (and my opinion hath thouſands to agree with it,) that
it is more milde and tolerable, to live under the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
then under their Presbyterian Querke Authority and Tyranny,
which (in a word) hatches Rebellion, ſeems and ſeeks ſway and
domination over their King, with all his Loyall Subjects Lands
and Riches, <hi>and this is truly, verily, and ſincerely their only zeale.</hi>

            <p>They may remember, that the Raigne of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and
hir Royall favour, with the Ayde of the Engliſh Nation, ſhould
not ingratefully be forgotten; it is not many yeares ſince that they
fear'd that the <hi>French</hi> made Warre in <hi>Scotland</hi> to ſettle the <hi>Romiſh</hi>
Religion there; (which they then thought to be an unreaſonable
proceeding by Strangers) at which time they had recourſe to the
Crowne of <hi>England</hi> for their preſervation, (which then relieved
them,) and I have read in their Service-Book of their Church of
Prayers, Thanks, and Vowes, that they would never be againſt the
Engliſh Crowne, but ſpend their lives for the ſervice thereof.
And now behold the Perfidious and moſt abhorr'd ingratitude of
theſe Monſters, their thankfulneſſe is expreſt in Killing and Rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

let you know, we are not Ignorant of your craft and ſubtilty,
in ſeeming to make thoſe few Members at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to be the
Parliament, becauſe you and they have Covenanted to divide the
Spoyle and Government of this Kingdom amongſt you. For, firſt
you know when you were on your Mattch with your Army, there
were three times the number of Lords, wrote unto you from <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>

               </note> 
               <hi>Tub-Orators</hi> and <hi>Pamphletteers,</hi> to inform
the People that the King makes Warre againſt His Parliament,
when (in truth) if they mean the Parliament, by the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113258:4"/>
of the Lords and Commons, the Parliament (in that ſenſe) are
either with the King or for the King.</p>
            <p>But the Authors and purſuers of this accurſed Warre, are eaſily
perceived and known. The King (as I told you) requires the
Maintenance of the true Proteſtant Religion, and of the known
Lawes and Liberties of his Subjects, and for theſe things He is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
(which is flat Treaſon) His life ſought, and His Subjects
and Kingdoms ſpoyled. But you doe make this Warre becauſe you
would inforce the King to aboliſh Biſhops, and take away all
Deans and Chapters, and their Lands to be divided between you
and your Covenanted <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Brethren; And for your better ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
you to ſwaye and Domineere over the King and His People,
you will and muſt have the power of the <hi>Militia,</hi> or elſe you will
kill the King, and all his faithfull Subjects that ſhall defend Him.
I have read the Chronicles of <hi>England,</hi> wherein I find Commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and Rebellions to cauſe the King to keep His Lawes, but this
is the firſt Rebellion that I ever heard of, that will not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the King to breake His Coronation Oath made to His People,
but will either kill Him, or compell Him to breake His Lawes
likewiſe; ſo that if the King would have been perjur'd for their
pleaſure, they would never have Rebelled againſt him, and indeed
if they were not Perjur'd in breaking their Oathes of Allegiance,
and infringing all the known Lawes, we had never been thus miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheivouſly
perplexed.</p>
            <p>And if it be true, that the People doe make Kings, (as your A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<note n="q" place="margin">The firſt Apoſtle, that ever left his Eares twice for Libelling.</note> 
               <hi>Prinne</hi> ſaies) therefore they may unmake them if they
pleaſe: then by the ſame Rule may we not ſay, we will have no
more <hi>Knights, Cittizens,</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> for doe not the People
make them? yes Verily-truly, and Truly-verily.</p>
            <p>Therefore adviſe well of your buſineſſe, that you are ſo madly
troubleſome about, if you begin to pull down Kings, I will aſſure
you, we will have no Lords or Gentlemen amongſt us; And in that
(I am ſure) we have the advantage (in number of People) there
being more Poore then Rich to take our parts; and we ſhall have
as much Law, and more Reaſon for our juſtification, then you have
for this <hi>Horrid Rebellion.</hi> I would faine preſerve the wilfull, the
obſtinate, the miſlead, and ſeduced <hi>Londoners,</hi> or (as I may truly
ſay) my <hi>Goatham, quondam</hi> friends, I will not yet call you <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lams</hi>)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:113258:5"/>
I hope you may yet recover your crooked and crazed Witts,
before all be ſpent and loſt, the which I heartily wiſh. I know
ſome of you are Learned, I pray you recollect your Readings, and
tell me (if you can) if you ever found <hi>Lawes</hi> or <hi>Government</hi> ſetled
by the Sword (that ſo continued) or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> or <hi>Right,</hi> ſuppreſt
long without being reſtored; And therefore if you doe ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
your disburſements in maintaining this <hi>Rebellion,</hi> you will
have the curſe of all <hi>England,</hi> as your being the cauſers of all our
miſeries, and conſequently of your own undoing; for we all know,
that if you doe lock up your Purſes, that we and you ſhall have
Peace laid at our doores,<note n="r" place="margin">I deſire the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be no more couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of their Eſtates and Lives.</note> By which means, we might have a free
Parliament to ſtop all our Breaches, and build up the Ruines which
this unnaturall <hi>Warre</hi> hath made, without which, we can expect
no other but totall confuſion and deſolation.</p>
            <p>The Lawes are the Touch, the Teſt, the rule and guide of all our
lives and actions, the Lawes are terrible to none but Theeves, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers,
Traytors, and Rebels, every honeſt man and true Subject
dares look the Law in the face boldly without feare; we dare you
to be judged and ttyed by the<note n="ſ" place="margin">If the lawes might decide the Quarrell, wee ſhould quickly have a Cloſe-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Heads ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the top of the two Houſes.</note> Lawes, (as we dare.) Let no Sword,
but the Sword of Iuſtice, decide the Quarrell, and cut off the
offenders.</p>
            <p>There are but two ſorts of Enemies that are the Cauſers, and
continuers of our Calamities, theſe only are the hinderers and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers
of our Peace. The one Cauſe is our ſinnes, and the other
the Rebels; they are the accurſed <hi>Amalekites,</hi> that diſturbes and
ſtops us from our enjoying our happy reſt. If we would reforme
the one, we ſhould quickly tame the other; Therefore let all ſuch
as are averſe to Peace, and delight in Theft and ſlaughter, know,
that though the plundering <hi>Achan</hi> can filch a Wedge of Gold, yet
there are ſtones to beat out the Braines of ſuch a Theeviſh knave;
Let the wiſe <hi>Achittofooles,</hi> (or accurſed Councellors to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion
ſet their Houſes in order and goe hang themſelves. The
King is ſtill the King, and (maugre all the malice of Hell and Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds)
he is wall'd about with divine providence and protection;
His gratious <hi>God,</hi> in whom he only truſts, will defend him, <hi>and
ariſe and ſcatter his Enemies;</hi> though you have Rob'd our Royall
<hi>David</hi> of His <hi>Militia</hi> and Militarie defences, yet there is a Sling
in ſtore, that with a peble can make the greateſt <hi>Goliahes</hi> Grovell

amongſt you. <hi>Shamgar,</hi> ſhall not want a <hi>Goade, Gedion</hi> a <hi>Pitcher,</hi>
and every Loyall Souldier of the Kings, will be a <hi>Sampſon,</hi> to beat
your Braines out with your owne Rebellious jaw-bones, that her
bloudy Iſſue (or Inundation) may be ſtopt by Calme and gentle
Peace.</p>
            <p>But if this afflicted Land hath ſuch an unexpected and undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
happineſſe ſtored up in the eternall Treaſurie of gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
then happy and bleſſed are thoſe men that are ordain'd

Temporall and Eternall be upon them and their Poſteritie<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

no more of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> but endeavour to embrace his <hi>Spirit,</hi> who
pronounced the <hi>Peace-makers</hi> bleſſed; and ſaid whoſe Children

the <hi>Peace-breakers</hi> are accurſed of God, and alſo may juſtly be

a <hi>Cauſe</hi> as this unfellowed <hi>Rebellion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you will run further on, and fill up the meaſure of your
Iniquities, with boaſting of the ſucceſſe of your execrable <hi>Deſignes,</hi>
in the end you ſhall find, that to boaſt of wickedneſſe is a degree
beyond wickedneſſe, and to be Oſtentatious in ungodly actions,
is the road way to double damnation.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude, I muſt propound a <hi>Querie,</hi> or ask you a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
You have promis'd, that if His Majeſty would come and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with you, that then you will make Him, a more Great, Rich,
and glorious King then any of His Predeceſſors ever were. Now
we would fain know, and we doe all deſire you to let us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
how, which way, and by what meanes this Greatneſſe,
Wealth and Glory may be by you conferr'd upon the King? if you
will doe us the favour as to ſend us your mind in writing, we will
pay the bearer, and if we can perceive any probabiliti<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you
can performe what you promiſed, we will be humble ſuppliants
to His Majeſty, to accept your kind offer: in the mean time, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
you make Him ſo Great and Rich as you talk of) I think it a
very goodſtep, to that Greatneſſe and State, if you will be pleaſed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:113258:6"/>
to give him his own againe, which you have proditoriouſly and
perfidiouſly taken, and doe ſtill detain from Him.</p>
            <p>Thus have I truly ſhewed the Cauſes of the Kingdomes griefes,
to be at firſt a Melancholy madneſſe, then it was hydropically pult
up (in many places) with Ambition, Malice, Revenge, Avarice,
Sects, Schiſmes, and Fantaſticall Sathanicall Innovations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations.
I ſuppoſe that nothing can cure her but the Law well
applyed; to which I leave you and our ſelves, and ſhut up all
with a diſtick.</p>
