            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>ATtend my Masters, and listen well</l>
                  <l>Unto this my Ditty, which briefly doth tell</l>
                  <l>Of a fine merry Iest which in <hi>Norfolke</hi> befell:</l>
                  <l>A braue lusty Cooper in that Countie did dwell,</l>
                  <l>And there he cry'd Worke for a Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Maids ha'ye any worke for a Cooper?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This Cooper he had a faire creature to's wife,</l>
                  <l>Which a Brewer i'th Towne lou'd as deare as his life,</l>
                  <l>And she had a tricke, which in some wiues is rife:</l>
                  <l>She still kept a sheath for another mans knife,</l>
                  <l>And often cornuted the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>While he cry'd, More worke for a Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>It hapned one morning the Cooper out went,</l>
                  <l>To worke for his liuing it was his intent:</l>
                  <l>He trusted his house to his wiues gouernment,</l>
                  <l>And left her in bed to her owne hearts content,</l>
                  <l>While he cry'd, What worke for a Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Maids ha'ye any worke for a Cooper?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And as the Cooper was passing along,</l>
                  <l>Still crying and calling his old wonted song,</l>
                  <l>The Brewer, his riuall, both lustie and yong,</l>
                  <l>Did thinke now or neuer to doe him some wrong,</l>
                  <l>And lie with the wife of the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Who better lov'd him than the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So calling the Cooper, hée to him did say,</l>
                  <l>Goe home to my house, and make no delay,</l>
                  <l>I haue so much worke as thou canst doe to day:</l>
                  <l>What euer thou earnest, Ile bountifully pay.</l>
                  <l>These tidings well pleased the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Oh, this was brave newes for the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Away went the Cooper to th'house of the Brewer,</l>
                  <l>Who séeing him safe at his worke to indure:</l>
                  <l>Thought he, now for this day the Cooper is sure,</l>
                  <l>Ile goe to his wife, her gréen-sicknesse to cure:</l>
                  <l>Take heed of your forehead, good Cooper,</l>
                  <l>For now I must worke for the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So straightwaies he went to the Coopers dwelling,</l>
                  <l>The goodwife to giue entertainment was willing,</l>
                  <l>The Brewer &amp; she like two pigeons were billing:</l>
                  <l>And what they did else they haue bound mee from telling:</l>
                  <l>He pleased the wife of the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Who better lov'd him than the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But marke how it happened now at the last,</l>
                  <l>The sun-shine of pleasure was soone ouer-past;</l>
                  <l>The Cooper did lacke one of's <unclear>Tooles</unclear>, and in haste</l>
                  <l>He came home to fetch it, and found the doore fast:</l>
                  <l>Wife, open the doore, quoth the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>And let in thy husband the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now when the goodwife and the Brewer did heare</l>
                  <l>The Cooper at doore, affrighted they were:</l>
                  <l>The Brewer was in such a bodily feare,</l>
                  <l>That for to hide himselfe he knew not where,</l>
                  <l>To shun the fierce rage of the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>He thought he should die by the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The good wife perceiuing his wofull estate,</l>
                  <l>She hauing a subtill and politicke pate,</l>
                  <l>She suddenly whelm'd downe a great brewing Fat,</l>
                  <l>And closely she couer'd the Brewer with that.</l>
                  <l>Then after shee let in the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>What's under this Tub? quoth the Cooper.</l>

                  <l>And make restitution for this my foule play:</l>
                  <l>O prethee forgive me, Iohn Cooper,</l>
                  <l>And Ile be a friend to Iohn Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If from this offence thou wilt set me cléere,</l>
                  <l>My bounty and loue to thée shall appeare:</l>
                  <l>Ile freely allow thée and thine all the yeare,</l>
                  <l>As much as yée'l drink, either strong Ale or Béere:</l>
                  <l>Then prethee forgive me, Iohn Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Accept of my proffer, Iohn Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Oh no, quoth the Cooper, I'de haue thee to thinke,</l>
                  <l>That I with my labour can buy my selfe <unclear>drinke.</unclear>
                  </l>
                  <l>Ile geld thee, or lame thee, ere fram me thou shrink.</l>
                  <l>These words made the Brewer with feare for to stink;</l>
                  <l>He feared the rage of the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Yet still he intreated the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Cooper by no meanes would let goe his hold,</l>
                  <l>The Brewer cry'd out to the Cooper, and told</l>
                  <l>Him, there was the key of his siluer and gold</l>
                  <l>And gaue him free leaue to fetch what he would:</l>
                  <l>O then he contented the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>These tidings well pleased the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>If thou, quoth the Cooper, wilt sweare with an oath,</l>
                  <l>To doe all thou tell'st me, although I am loath,</l>
                  <l>I will be contented to pardon you both:</l>
                  <l>Content, quoth the Brewer, I will, by my troth,</l>
                  <l>Here take thou my key, Iohn Cooper.</l>
                  <l>Yea, with a good will, quoth the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>On this condition they both went their way,</l>
                  <l>Both <hi>Iohn</hi> and the Brewer, but <hi>Iohn</hi> kept the key,</l>
                  <l>Which open'd the Coffer where more money lay,</l>
                  <l>Than <hi>Iohn</hi> the Cooper had seene many a day:</l>
                  <l>This is a brave sight, thought the Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Ile furnish my selfe, thought the Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> was so farre in affection with that,</l>
                  <l>That he tooke vp handfuls and filled his Hat:</l>
                  <l>I will haue my bargaine, quoth <hi>Iohn,</hi> that is flat,</l>
                  <l>The Brewer shall pay well for vsing my Fat:</l>
                  <l>Ile cry no more worke for a Cooper,</l>
                  <l>Farewell to the trade of a Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Thus money can pacifie the greatest strife:</l>
                  <l>For <hi>Iohn</hi> neuer after found fault with his wife.</l>
                  <l>Hée left off his Adz his Saw and his Knife,</l>
                  <l>And after liu'd richly all daies of his life;</l>
                  <l>Hee cry'd no more worke for a Cooper:</l>
                  <l>Oh he left off the trade of a Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And in his merry mood, oft he would say,</l>
                  <l>If that I had hoop't twenty tubs in one day,</l>
                  <l>I should not haue got so much wealth, by my fay:</l>
                  <l>Gramercie kind wife, for thy wit found the way</l>
                  <l>To make a rich man of Iohn Cooper:</l>
                  <l>Oh what a good wife has Iohn Cooper.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Let no marry'd couple that heare this tale told,</l>
                  <l>Be of the opinion this couple did hold,</l>
                  <l>To sell reputation for siluer or gold:</l>
                  <l>For credit and honesty should not be sold.</l>
                  <l>Thus ended the song of the Cooper.</l>
                  <l>That cry'd, Ha'ye any worke for a Cooper.</l>
