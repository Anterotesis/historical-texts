            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Those that are not maried are different from them that are: wherefore they weare theyr heare curled vppon their forehead, &amp; weare on theyr head certain high coyues, &amp; rounde, made of small stickes very fine, and wrought vppon with blacke silke.

Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they go forth of their houses, they are caried in chayres with courtines compassed about, with seruants and familier friends that do carie them, and that do accompanie them, in suche sorte that none are seene by the streetes, but people of low and base degree.

And if they be men of trade and merchaunts that are traders, they do place them in such Townes where their busines &amp; trade lieth. They doo not suffer within the Cities, that any common women should inhabite, but in the suburbes where is appointed vntoo them publike streetes for their habitation. All these for the moste parte are slaues bought from the powre of their moothers when they were children, for bycause it is permitted by law vntoo widowes that doe remayne poore, when they haue not where withal to sustein them to sel their children for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe: being oppressed with necessities, they go to riche mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts

The which merchauntes moued with couetousnes do teache these yong maides too play of the Uirginalles and Git<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torns and other such instrumentes: and after growing to ripe yeeres, they put them intoo the streetes too reise a gaine of their whoredomes.

When they are olde they make them looke young again, with ointments oyles, waters, and with collours, and when they are olde and of no more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, they remaine free without any longer bondage vnto their maisters, or any else, mainteyning themselues of that which they haue gotten in their youth, with their naughty trade. And the boyes do serue al kind of seruice in theyr houses, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they be of yeeres to marry, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their maisters are bound to seeke then wiues, and to prouide them houses, and to giue them trade or order how they may get their liuing, and these seruauntes must geue their maisters euery yeere so much in knowledge of their bondage, but the children of these slaues remaine free. They doo celebrate all their holy dayes in the night, and principally at the tyme of the newe Mones, as people that walke in darkenes, with great shewes and many inuentions, and with much Musike. And specially they doo solemnise the first day of the yeere, which is amongst them at the tyme of the newe Moone of Marche: and therfore they trim and decke vp their houses and doores with many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets and clothes of silke, and of diuers kinds of roses and flowres planting in all the streets trees most high with their bowes cut off, wherevppon they hang many lights, and also of the triumphant Arches which in these dayes they decke with bowes, paint them, and hang them with clothes of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maske, &amp; other diuers silkes.

Rounde about the tables they put many little baskets very curious decked with flowres with diuers diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent fruites, and in the middest the meate very orderly, and prepared as wel of fleshe as fishe, brothes of diuers sorts ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

Women do helpe to serue in the meate and drinke, and too wayte at theyr tables: and when the tabels are serued the saide women do the office of iesters too make them merry and ioyful. They haue musitions in all these bankets and players vpon diuers Instrumentes, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and representers of comedies, wherewith they bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created as people without care, and without light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of heauen, not directing too any other ende but too the contentment and felicitie of this world, whereof they enioy the ful.

They vse great courtesies, and good behauiour one with thother in their quaffing and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king making much one of an other. And they are so ielowse, that they suffer not their wyues to eate with them in these feastes and assemblies: but they agree and eate togither in some other place apart from them: and there goeth no man into the place where they are but certaine blind men that are musicions to make them merry. They vse a certain courtesie at their meeting very strange, they shut theyr lefte hand and couer it with the right, and hold them vp many tymes vpon theyr brest, in token that they haue them fast shut vp in their hartes, and to this mouinge of handes they adde vnto words of courtesie. And amongst the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> people that which they commonly speake when they meete any strange friends, that haue not seene one the other many daies before is, that they doo aske them, if they haue eaten? and if they doo answere, they haue not, they carie them to the vittailling houses, and

make them great cheare, and doo banquet them at their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: For as I haue saide, in all places and streetes, as well within the citie as without, there are a great number of vittailing houses, where they sell meate and drinke aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntly of many sortes of meates: and if they saye that they haue eaten, they carry them to other houses, where only they are serued with Conserua and fruites and shellfish, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry sortes of wynes, wherewithal they banquet and recreate themselues. And if there come any guests, newly forth of any other place to theyr houses, if they finde them not with theyr best apparel that they vse to weare at a festiual tyme, they speake not vntoo them, nor make any reckening of them, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they come in the most rich apparell they haue, and in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareling themselues so, they receiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with great myrth &amp; gladnes, &amp; great courtesie.

There are more shoemakers then of any other science, bicause it is a thing that is much vsed and spent. In the Cytie of <hi>Canton</hi> there are twoo greate streetes of them without any other person of any other occupation that dwel amongst them, but there are many scatered abroade in other places of the Citie. In one of these streetes are solde riche stuffe, wherewith they make bootes and shoes that are couered without with silke of coullours with riche stringes, which is made very gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly.

In al other artes, there are a greate number of craftes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men very curious and of all thinges greate abundance. And they are so giuen too theyr owne profit, that of dogges bones and of other beastes, they serue themselues therewith in steede of Iuory, and of olde ragges and rindes of trees, and of canes they make paper and of small peeces of silke: of this they serue themselues too wryte vppon, and the rest for too rolle peeces of Damaske and Taffetas and other silkes in. They buy the dung of the houses for theyr grownd in the fieldes and especially for theyr garden hearbes. They bring vpp byrdes too singe, and they teache them too make visages; they apparel themselues of diuers fashions. They make all these inuentions and many other too get mony, wherewithall too passe theyr life.

Of the fruites that the people of the <hi>China</hi> do gather and the merchandise which they trade, in they paie too the King a tribute very easie.

<pb facs="tcp:1836:34"/>
as of al other successes, with ordinarie postes that the Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours do dispatch to him for this effect. The same order of the poste is as we haue among vs. <hi>Barros</hi> doth write, that they runne with collers of Belles, and others that haue beene in that Countrey say, they vse to blowe with a horne to aske hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and to giue knowledge to Barkes to passe Riuers. The Embassadours of Princes beeing his friendes or enemies, are receiued with greate veneration: they lodge them, and prouide them of all things needful with great liberalitie: and when they come where the king is, al the Lords and knights of the Court go forth to receiue them, &amp; they giue them great gifts and presents, and honor them with the title of Lawiers. Some kings being farre of from him, as the king of <hi>Aua, Siam, Melitij, Bacham, Chabam, Varagu,</hi> which fell to the north partes of <hi>Pegu,</hi> and do acknowledge him obedience, in remembrance that in olde time they were his subiectes, they send him ordinarily their Embassadors with some present, &amp; for the great iourney they haue to this kings Court, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes send with the embassage foure or fiue persons, euerie one with like authoritie, that if it happe some of them to die in the way, or vntill they be dispatched from thence: and if they die not of anie disease, they alwayes poyson one or two of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in some banket, vnto whom they make verie sumptuous Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres, with Epitaphs conteining what they were, and the cause of their comming, and by what prince they were sent: and this is for to continue the memorie and greatnesse of the renowne of his Realme. The Embassadors of the rest of the Princes are so priueleged in such sort, that those of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile hauing condemned too death one <hi>Bartholomew Perez,</hi> and all the rest of his companie that was sent to this cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, by the gouernour of the <hi>India</hi> as Embassadour of the king <hi>Don Emanuel</hi> of <hi>Portingal,</hi> surmising that their embassage was false, and that they were spies, by reason of a certaine relation giuen against them by the embassadors of the king of <hi>Malaca,</hi> and the king himself vnderstanding of the matter, did commaund, that their Embassage being false or true, it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1836:34"/>
was sufficient that there should be no hurt done to their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones, seeing they were entred within the realme with the title of Embassadors. Other there are that come for some common weales, which are Lordes that do owe obedience to him: they make no enterteynment to such, but vse them with a strange kind of Ceremonie. When they say to them that they shall go to see the king, they appoint them the day and houre, and they cause them to goe on foote, or on horsebacke, with bridles of strawe for humilitie. And in comming too a great place that is before the kings house, they stay vntill there come vnto them an Officer of the kings, who doth the office of the maister of Ceremonies, and doe commaunde them to passe forwarde. And at a certaine place they kneele downe, &amp; hold vp both theyr hands togither, as though they prayed to God, &amp; they beholde one quarter part of the houses of the kings palace, where they tel them that the king is, &amp; at times in equall space, they make other fiue times their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and without turning their shoulders, they returne backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde with the like Ceremonies: and this being done, they send them away. This say they, is to go to see the king. If they giue them licence to say what they will, they remaine in the last prayers on their knees, vntill there come to them an other officer which is the Secretarie that writeth downe all that they aske, and with saying to them that they will consult of it with the Lord of the world, they are sent away for that time, vntill they bee dispatched with the determination and opinion of his chiefe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile.</p>

And al the penalties thereof, the ordinary charges being taken away, he sendeth to the court, and with the relation of al the newes that doeth happen eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moneth. His aurtoritie and maiestie is so great, that he is not resident where the rest of the Lawyers are, bicause hee wil not be visited and frequented of them. The second in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie is the <hi>Ponchasi,</hi> which is asmuch too say, as the chiefe gatherer of the kings rents, and President of the Counsel of the kings reuenues. This office executeth he without the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sel of any Lawyers. There are many other officers that doo serue to recouer the kings rentes with the which they come to the <hi>Tutan</hi> as afore saide, and it is at his charge too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde too pay al mens wages, ordinary and extraordinary charges, &amp; to take accompt of them, as head Gouerner of al inferiour Officers. The thirde in dignitie is the <hi>Anchasi,</hi> which is the President of the ciuil and criminal Iustice who doth see and determine withal his hearers and Officers all wightes and buzines, which goe in degree of appellation to his tribunal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the rest of the ordinary <hi>Iudges</hi> of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uince,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1836:35"/>
&amp; all other thinges which are conuenient for the good gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; expedition of iustice. The fourth is the <hi>Aytao,</hi> who is the purueiour general, and President of the Counsell of warres, too whome doth aperteine the liuing of men and prouiding of shippes, vittailes, and munitions for the ships of warre, that goe to the Sea, and for armes by lande and for ordinary garisons of the cities and frontier Townes, and to know what straungers do come, and from whence they come and what they wil. The fifth is the <hi>Luytisi,</hi> which is the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine general that doth put in execution that which is ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the <hi>Aytao</hi> and those of his councel. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is giuen occasion of any warres of importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce with any migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Prince, then goeth this President in person too rule or gouerne in them. Al these Officers are of great auctoritie, and such as are officers vnder them, are wel taken &amp; of great estimation. Euery one of them, excepte the <hi>Luytisi,</hi> haue ten hearers or Iudges in his councell, which doo assist him, ordinarily for the dispatching of his buzines, which are men of great auctoritie and estimation: and when they be in cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, fiue of them doo sit of the right side of the President, and fiue of the left. Those that sit on the right side be of more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence then the other fiue, in that they weare girdelles of golde, and yellow hattes: and they of the lefte side, do weare gyrdelles of siluer, and theyr hattes are blewe. And it is not permitted that any other Iudges of the Lawe weare these gyrdelles of golde and siluer and hattes of these collours, vnlesse they bee such as are Capteynes or other officers of the men of warre. And if by chaunce the Preside<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t dye, there doth succeede in his place the most auncient Iudge next too him. And when there is any need to go to visit the Prouince, there goeth one of them with the auctoritie that euery one of them haue too put order in the thing that is conuenient to be reformed. These Presidents and the other Iudges do bring in theyr shoulders and brestes the kings armes, and they are a certain kind of serpents woeuen with threed of gold. They haue many other inferiour officers: and although they be but
<pb facs="tcp:1836:36"/>
Lawyers they alwaies speake too them kneeling on theyr knees, except onely the head keeper of the prisons which is an office amongst them of much estimation. This ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> when he commeth in kneeleth down, &amp; ryseth vp again whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And when these Iudges come newlie too the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces, there go forth to receiue them al the men of the warre with many banners and other souldierlyke shewes, and all the rest of the Lawyears and officers with great myrth and ioy. They haue on these dayes al the streetes very much dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked with diuers sortes of silkes, and with bowes &amp; branches and with dyuers sortes of flowres of most sweete smel, and they accompany them vntoo the streetes where they muste lodge with much musike and diuers sortes of instrumentes, Lykewise the king doth commande to prouide with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of al his counsell al the rest of the ordinarie Officers of the Cities and Townes of his Realme, with consideration that they bee not of the saide Countrie whether they shal go to minister Iustice, that they bee not moued by affection too doo what they ought not, nor behaue themselues with inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, nor yet that they bee not made mightie, with the auc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toritie in commaunding, in suche sorte that they may cause some insurrection and alteration. This Lawyers nor the rest of the officers that are appointed too them, of these supreme offices, do make any maner of preparation when they depart from the Court too the place of theyr gouermentes, but onely of apparel and a fewe seruauntes that serueth them, for in al places where they shal passe through, the King hath at his cost, houses appointed and officers, that shal lodge and serue them with al thinges necessarie, and doo prouide for them Horses, and barkes if they haue neede of them. And for theyr meate it is appointed what shal be giuen to euery one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, according to his degree and office. And this liberality they vse with al the rest of the Lawyers, generally although they go not prouided of offices. At such tyme as they come, they aske them if they will haue theyr stipende that is appointed for them, in meate or mony: if they wil haue it in meate, they
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1836:36"/>
serue them very daintily, as too men that haue auctoritie to commaunde too whippe those Officers if they doo not theyr dueties. And when they wil lodge in the house of some of their acquaintance or friendes bicause they wil be at more liberty too bee merrie, then they giue them that portion as is apoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too them in mony. Al these houses are very wel prouided for, by such as haue the charge of them: it toucheth the <hi>Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chasi</hi> of the Prouince, for that hee must take accompte of such as are officers, of the expences that is made of all these vittailing &amp; lodging houses. In al these houses they lodge al the ordinarie officers that they may exercyse theyr Offices, as Notaries, serieants, porters, euen vnto the executours of Iustice, vnto whome the king doth giue meat &amp; wages suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently and are payde euery Moneth, bicause they should not carrie nor take any bribes of any person. And for this they haue an order that none of these Lawyers can prouide or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde any thing in Iustice, but that it must passe before al these officers, and in publike audience which is done in this maner. The Iudge is set downe in his tribunal, and at the entery in of the hal stande the porters which declare with loude voice the persons name that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth in to aske iustice, and what hee demaundeth: who falleth downe on his knees a good way fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Iudge, &amp; doth propou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with a lowde voice his cause, or telleth them by wryting what hee woulde haue. And this petition one of the Notaries doeth take and reade with alowd voice: and being seene and heard, hee doeth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide and commaunde Iustice to be done therevpon, and doth signe it with his owne hand with red Inke, and if he doo not so, then hee doth remit too an other inferiour Iudge that he may do it. This maner of order is kept so precisly that by no meanes they can bee brybed, vnles the officers shoulde vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande it, and as they shal bee by them absolued or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in their residences they feare them, all these are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry presise too execute that which they are commaunded as wel Notaries as Serieantes and the rest. And if any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do make any fault in theyr office, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the very howre there
<pb facs="tcp:1836:37"/>
is put in their hands a littel banner, and so doo holde it in theyr handes kneeling vntil all buzines at that audience bee dispatched and concluded. And foorthwith the Lawyer doth commaund the executioner that he giue him as many whips as too him seemeth good, which are such as heereafter shall bee declared: in such sorce that all those Officers go alwayes for the most parte with plaisters and markes, and this is so ordinary among them, that they take it for no shame too go in that sort: When one of these Iudges doo walke in the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, he goeth accompanied with these ministers. Officers, &amp; other people among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there goeth before him eight Officers by both sides of the streetes: the twoo foremost goe with maces of siluer made as oures are, put into certain long staues, and they signifie that these Iudges and Lawyers are in theyr office in place of the King: the other twoo that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, doo carry twoo long canes in theyr handes on high; which do represent the trewe and rightful iustice they ought too doo: and thother twoo that followe after these doo carrie other twoo canes, haling them vppon the grounde, and knit to them certaine long red gyrdles, and in the point of them certaine tasselles which are the instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes of iustice where with al they whippe. And the twoo porters go with certain tables listed vpp after the fashion and making of a target: wherein is written the name of the Iustice, and the charge and Office that he hath: and those that go before these do bid with a lowde voice, that they giue place, bycause it is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that any man of what degree soeuer hee bee shoulde passe a thwart the street nor walke, as long as these Iudges passe, vppon payne too bee whipped without remission that shoulde doo against it. This Prince hath so great care, that his Iudges &amp; Officers as wel the Gouerners as Presidents &amp; al the rest should vse theyr offices wel, as they ought to do, that although he do send from three yeeres, to three yeeres of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers which are called <hi>Chaenes</hi> to take acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt of the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet besides that, from vi. Monethes to vi. Monethes, or from yeere too yeere, hee doth dispatche with all secret other
<pb facs="tcp:1836:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
extraordinary Iudges which are called <hi>Leachis,</hi> &amp; are men that he hath great trust in, and those that are very familier with him, that they may visit those Prouinces with so great iurisdiction and autoritie, that without returning too him, they may chasten al maner of offices be they neuer so great, and put out of office al Iudges &amp; Officers at theyr wil. And bycause they shoulde execut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> this with more Iustice, there is taken of them an othe of theyr faithfulnesse and secresie, giuing them to drinke three tymes of the wyne, they vse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to drinke of, which is the maner of theyr othe. And bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee may goe with more secrecie, the Secretaries doo make the letters pattents without any name of him that shal goe, nor whether hee shal goe more then to shewe in the letters patents that in what place soeuer that Lawyer shall come and present those letters patents, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And so hee depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnknowen without knowing vnto any other whether he shal go. And in comming too the place hee seeth, and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth al things that are vsed there, and no man knoweth what hee is, nor what hee pretendeth, and in what sorce all officers do minister Iustice. And this not geuing knowledge of any thing what his comming is, hee staieth vntill a day that the Presidents doo ioyne togither with the <hi>Tutam,</hi> too make a general consultation which is once euery Moneth. Then he goeth in to present his letters patentes, &amp; presently they aryse euery one of them and goe aside with greate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie to heare iudgement against themselues, and foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with they are executed. And if there bee any suspencion, then he doth prouide in theyr places other newe officers: and if hee finde that they haue serued wel, hee doth honor the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much &amp; doth remoue them to better places &amp; of more trust. These are woont too visit the Schooles &amp; examine the Studentes: and such as doo not learne, hee commaundeth them too bee whipt and too bee put in prison, and the vnprofitable are put out of theyr places, &amp; such as are vertuous hee offereth them

fauour and promiseth them hope of exhibition. There is an other office or dignitie aboue all these, which is that of the <hi>Quinchai,</hi> and is asmuch to say the sell of gold. This man goeth not out of the court, but when any great matter doeth concerne the king, &amp; of the good gouernment, and quietnes of the whole realme. In all causes as wel ciuil as criminal, the Iudges doo proceede orderly in theyr causes, and doo make theyr actes and doo examine the witnesses in publike before theyr officers and ministers, bicause there shall be no falsehod nor deceipt vsed in the as king of that which they know, nor in wryting therof. They examine euery witnesse by himselfe, and if they doo agree in theyr declarations and depositions they put them aside, and doo aske thone and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, vntil they come to differ among themselues, bicause by reason that thone and thother doo alledge they may come to declare the trueth the better. And when they can not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the certaintie, they whippe them, and giue them tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in such sort, that by one way or other, they may declare the trueth effectually. They haue great respect in these cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses too men of estimation of whome they presume that they are not persons that wil lye. In causes of great importaunce and that doeth touche graue personnes, the Iudges doo not trust theyr Notaries too wryte the informations, but they with theyr hands do set down al the acts. Of such as are prisoners for debt, there is a tyme appointed wherein they shal pay them, and if they performe not, they commaund that there bee giuen too them many whippes, and they turne and commaunde a newe. Another tyme, and if they pay not, they returne too whippe them againe: and in this sorte they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with them vntil they dye with strypes, if their kinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folkes doo not pay for them. When any dweller wil passe to another habitation in some other street then where he dwelt before, or go too some other Towne, they haue a custome too ring vppon an emptie Bason by all the neighbours with a common crier which shal say that such a person doth remoue, and too what place, that if he owe any thing, that they come
<pb facs="tcp:1836:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to demaunde it before bee depart, bycause no person shoulde loose any thing dewe too them: if this person doo absent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe without making this diligence, the Iustices do compel al his neighbours too pay al the debtes that he owe, bicause they were so negligent and did not aduise the Iustice of his remouing. Those which are Prisoners for thefte or murder, are kept perpetually in the prisons, vntil they dye by whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, or by hunger or cold. For although they be condemned too death, they doo execute the Iudgement with such delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that many yeeres after they come to die for necessitie, as before is declared, or of theyr natural death. And for this cause there are a great number of prisoners in euery Cytie and Towne. And it is affirmed that only in the Cytie of <hi>Canton</hi> are accustomed too be more then 15. thousand. And by reason there are many people, and there is littel almes giuen, the poore people doo giue themselues to steale. There is in this Cytie and in all the reste which are of the <hi>Metra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan</hi> xiii. Prisons, and in euery one of them a wall of a great circuit very heigh, &amp; so large, that they haue within the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lodges for the head keeper, and his officers, and for the soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers of the watche, and ordinarily there are gardens, and streetes and courtes within, where the prisoners doo walke by day, and there are many vittayling houses, where they dresse meate, and doo hire beddes, and Taylers shoppes; and other artes, that the prisoners doo vse, too sustaine and maintaine themselues. Of these thirtiene prisons there are alwaies occupyed six of them with men, which are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned too death, and in euery one of them are a hundreth soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and more with theyr Captaine, too keepe the saide pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Euery offender doth bring hanging at his neck a borde which commeth too his knees and a spanne broade, wherein is written the facte wherefore hee was condemned, they go with fetters, but in the day tyme they are taken of, by reason they may woorke too get wherewithal to sustaine them, ouer &amp; aboue that which the king dooth giue them, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine measure of Rice euery day, vnto such as are conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned

too dye, they shut them vppe in the night in certaine lodges, which are neere too the courts, and they make them ly vpon theyr backes, and vppon them doo runne certaine Iron chaynes past through certaine collers that are betwene pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and prison: wherewith they are so fast made, that they can not escape. And they laye vpon them certaine couerings made of timber, that there remayneth to them no more space but theyr length and breadth which is a most painfull impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment. They neuer execute the Iudgement that is giuen vppon them, that are condemned too dye, but when the <hi>Chaenes</hi> and <hi>Leuchis</hi> doo go too take residence &amp; doo make a secret visitation. Then these Iudges do aske for the roules of them that are condemned &amp; the causes. And although that theyr sentences are confirmed by the king and of those of his chiefe Councell, they returne too see againe theyr factes, with the rest of the Lawyers that doo gouerne: and beeing seene, they chose among vi. or viii. of those that doo seeme too them too bee most culpable. And they commaund the head keeper of the prisons, that hee giue order too carry them too suffer execution. And this beeing done they turne too see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine anewe the factes, that by any meanes or waies they may suspend the execution of some of them. And if they finde any not so woorthie of death as the rest, they commaund that hee bee put aside from the reste, and that there bee shotte of iii<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peeces of ordinaunce which is a signe or token that they take out of the prison such as shal dye.

For they haue no manner of knowledge of the true God, more than they imagine that al things which are created, doth depende from aboue, from whence doe come the conseruation and gouernment of them all, without knowing particularly who is the author, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing it to the heauen it selfe, which they holde for the greatest of their Gods, and so they signifie it with the first fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of their <hi>ABC.</hi> They worship the Moone, the Sunne, and Starres, and all other Images which they make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out respect, and some figures or shapes of Lawyers, and of the priestes of their Idolles which they were most affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to, in some principal seruice they had done. And likewise they worship any maner of stones that they sette vpon theyr Aultars, where they doe make their Sacrifices, and also the Diuell which they paint after the same shape and manner as we doe among vs. The common sort of people doe say that they worship him, for bycause the good people, hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Diuels, and the euill people he conuerteth into Kine, and other kind of beastes. The men of most knowledge and that be most pollitique, they say they worship him &amp; regarde him, bycause he should do the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no hurt. They haue in al cities and places of habitation, and also in the fieldes, a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1836:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of sumptuous Temples, and of goodly buildings, which are of great Maiestie. There are two sortes of Priestes, and they are contrarie the one to the other in maners: the one sort goeth all shauen, and appareled in white, and with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine high cappes made of felt somewhat piked before. These sort liue in common togither, and haue their cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and lodgings after the maner of our Friers. The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe weare their haire long, and deuided in the higest parte of their head with a strike verie curiously varnished with blacke, after the fashion of a haud closed togither. They apparell themselues with silke or blacke Serge as all the rest of them do vse: they dwell euery one of them by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: they assist in the seruice of the Temples, and in the festiuall dayes and burying. The one and the other are not maried, but they are euill liuers, and therefore they are not esteemed among the people, and they are punished with stripes amongst the Iudges for a small occasion. These peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do offer in the Mornings and Euenings in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Incense, <hi>Beniamin,</hi> the wood of the Eagle, and other things of different and sweet smels. And the place of praier which they vse in their house, is generally at the entrie in of their gates, where their Idolles stande. When they lanche their shippes into the Sea at the first making, the Priestes goe aparelled with long garments, being verie rich of silke to make their Sacrifices in the poopes of them, where the place of praier is, and they offer painted figures, and they cut and burne them before their Idolles with certaine ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that they make, &amp; sing songes with an vnorderly tune, sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding certaine little belles. And they worship the Diuel, where they haue him painted in the fore part of the Shippe, bicause as they say, he should doe no hurt to the Shippes. In all this discourse they are eating and drinking at discretion. When they pretende to go vpon any iourney eyther by Sea or lande, or begin anie buzinesse that seeme difficult or hard, they vse lottes, and cast them before their Idolles. These are made of two stickes, after the fashion of two halfe nuts,
<pb facs="tcp:1836:42"/>
rounde at the one side, and the other side plaine. And before they be cast, they returne to theyr Idols with fayre wordes, beseeching them to giue good chaunce, and fortune: for by them they thinke doeth come good successe, or euill to them. And if it happe as they desire, then they will make too them great offeringes: and with this they are cast, and if they fall with the plaine side vpwarde, or the one side rounde, and the other plaine, they haue it for an euill signe: and they returne against the Idolles, and they speake to them shamefull and dishonest wordes, calling them dishonest dogges. And when they be weary of calling them so any longer, then they turne againe with faire and sweete wordes, and aske them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of that which they haue sayde, and desire them too giue them good fortune, promising them more then before they had offered them: wherevpon they turne to cast anewe, and by this order they proceede praysing them, and setting naught by them. And when they tarrie long, and if it bee a matter of importaunce, they runne to them, and take them, and cast them into the Sea, and sometimes into the fire, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them to burne a little, and they whippe them, and spurne at them with their feete, vntill it happe to them as they desire, that is, the rounde partes of these stickes to fall vpward. And then they worship and prayse them with much Musicke and songs, and cary to them offerings, of Hennes, Duckes, and Rice, all drest, and a Pigges heade sodden, which they much esteeme, and a great iarre of Wine, and of all this they set some part of it vpon the Altar in a Platter wherein is the toppes or poyntes of the Pigges eares and snout, and the nayles of Duckes and Hennes, and a fewe granes of the Rice, and some droppes of wine, and all the rest they themselues eate before the Idols, with much mirth and ioy. When there dieth any maried man that hath a wife and children and familie, immediately after he is dead they apparell him with the best apparell he had, and they set him on a Chaire, and there commeth to him his wife, and doth put herselfe vpon her knees before him, to take her leaue of him
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1836:42"/>
with many teares, and pitiful words she speaketh, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently his children and kinssolkes after the like order, and and all the rest of his householde following. And this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie beeing done, they put him in to a coffin made of the wood of <hi>Canfora,</hi> which is conseruatiue and of sweete smel, well made fast in all poynts, bycause hee shoulde not smell. After this they put him into a Chamber, which is hanged with white hangings of linnen cloth vpon two bankes, and do couer him with a cloth euen to the ground, where in is sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and formed the dead man, very naturally made. And in another place of the house without, or in the gate house com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in, they doo put for ceremonie a Table with candles lighted therevpon, all full of bread, and of sundrie sortes of fruites. And in this sort they keepe him xv. dayes, in the which time there do come at the night season Priestes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to offer vp their sacrifices, and to pray theyr owne inuentions after the maner of Gentiles. They bring many Papers painted, and with certaine ceremonies they make, they burne some of them there, and the rest they hang vp in cordes athwart for this cause, and they cast them togither, making noyse that they sende the deade men to heauen. All their superstitions done, they take the coffi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In all these dayes there are in the house the Tabels set with manie kinde of meates, that the priestes may eate and drinke, and their friendes and acquaintaunce that do visite them.</p>
            <p>The mourning apparell which they vse, is most sharpe, bycause they bring their clothes made of most course wooll, nearest to the fleshe, girte with hard coards, and on theyr heades certaine nightcappes of the sayde cloth, with edges like to hattes, which falleth downe vppon their eares.

And first they shal pronosticate the tyme and chaunce that is too come, and it shall be prooued and seene to fall out true, that hee may preuent any thing that is to come. In eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Citie and Prouince, there are garrisons of men of warre, they goe wel apparelled: they are as whyte as we are, and weare there beards long. The wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are very faire, although that all of them haue little eyes, they weare their coates and gownes so long that they touche the grounde, and they make their heare red with collours, and it is saide that they painte theyr faces. They say this king is of so great powre, that hee doeth bring into the fielde three hundreth thousande
<pb facs="tcp:1836:45"/>
men, and twoo hundreth thousande of them horsemen. In thinges that are painted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I haue seene brought from thence wherein are painted on horsebacke armed men with harnesse and salets and lances. The countrie is so good and so well furnished with vittaile, that it is thought to be the best &amp; most fertile soyle of the world: The <hi>Moores</hi> that I haue spoken withall doo affirme that they bee not so warrelike as wee are.</p>
            <p>They haue Mouldes and haue printed bookes tyme out of mynde. If it please your Maiestie, that this Country bee seene with the sight of the eyes: I doo offer my self therevnto, geuing mee twoo Shippes of two hundreth and fiftie to<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes a peece, little more or lesse, and 40. Souldiers in euery shippe and the Artillarie, Munition, and Uittaile, sufficient and necessarie, with Gods healpe carying some order of Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadge to the Lorde of the Countrie to enter in with my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and too returne all along the coast by the newe <hi>Spayne.</hi> And too see the order they haue as well for the trade with in the lande as for all the reste if that will please your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie.</p>
            <p>And in that which this Captaine saith that the king doth bring three hundreth thousande men intoo the fielde, besides the garrisons that he hath ordinarily in the Cities, &amp; townes that doo border neerest other Princes in this my opinion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth verefied. And although they be not so warrelyke as wee are, as the <hi>Moores</hi> haue declared, I knowe not what powre were sufficient for so great a number of horsmen, and against people so wel armed, the Artillarie being so common to them as it is to vs. And seeing there is required that there shoulde passe thither, so greate a nauigation, and seeing this great Countrie doth fal within the compas of the conquest of our Catholike king, it wil be a thing of importaunce that his Maiestie doo commaunde too ordeine this Embassadge with the good will of his holynes, whereby this Prince may reduce it to the gouernment of the holy Catholike Churche, whereof may growe greate effectes in the increasing of the
<pb facs="tcp:1836:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Christian Religion. And this is very easie to be done, seeing that our <hi>Spayniardes</hi> are become so neere neighbors to that realme and the Nauigation soo neere and certaine as here in it is declared. There is in the new <hi>Spayne</hi> in the South part thereof twoo portes or hauens: the one is called <hi>Acapulco,</hi> which standeth in xvii. degrees, &amp; a half of heigth which wil holde many shippes although they bee greate, and thother is called the <hi>Puerto de Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

From these portes do goe foorth the shippes that doo sayle too the <hi>Philippinas,</hi> and they goe too put themselues in the heighth that the course of the Iland is in, for the tyme when they goo foorth vpon this Nauigation which is in the ende of October the windes are alwaies Northerly in that coast vntil the end of April: Wherewithal they goe with the winde in theyr poope running west, and from the ende of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril vntil the ende of October they turne too blowe at West Southwest, which serueth them too returne, rising vpp intoo a higher degree that they lack no height. They met at their going with the Ilands called <hi>Barbudos,</hi> for they were so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, for bicause such as do inhabite there, do let their beards grow long. These people are apparelled with mattes made of the bowes of date trees very fine, and they haue no wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons nor warre with any Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, and theyr vittaile are <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cos,</hi> and rottes and fishe, &amp; they haue hennes lyke to those of <hi>Spaine,</hi> more towards the west. They turne &amp; meete with the Ilands which they cal of the theeues which be xiii. and they lye in length North and South, the greatest may bee little greater then fourtie leages.
