            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS Againſt Eſtabliſhing an Eaſt-India Company, With a Joynt-Stock excluſive to all others.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> SUch a Company would be a great Monopoly, which hath always been juſtly Odious in the Eyes of the Law; for there would be in ſuch a Caſe but one Buyer of all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Manufactures ſent to <hi>India,</hi> and but one Seller of the Commodities from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This will give ſuch a Company opportunity to buy the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodities cheap, and to ſell the Forreign imported Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities dear, both which are to the Detriment of <hi>England.</hi> But on the contrary, the more Buyers there are of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commodities, and the more Sellers of Forreign, the firſt will be ſold the dearer, and the latter the cheaper: And to have Forreign Commodities cheap, and our own dear, will by all Men be allowed to be our Advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If all were admitted to Trade thither, the Trade would be much enlarged, the Induſtry of particular Perſons would find our more Places of Trade, (when themſelves ſhall reap the benefit of their own Acquiſitions) which a Company with a Joynt-Stock will not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to do, becauſe they can get as much by a ſmall Trade as by a greater.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It ſeems againſt Common Juſtices, and the Birth-right of <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> to exclude any of them from ſo great a part of the Trade of the Nation, and that <hi>Briſtol, Exeter, Plymouth, Hull, Yarmouth,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould not Trade to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> from their own Ports as well as from <hi>London,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Dutch</hi> do indeed Trade with a Joynt-Stock, but they give Liberty to their own Subjects to Import all ſorts of <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods into their Countrey from <hi>England,</hi> or any other parts, except <hi>India:</hi> Whereas by the Act of Navigation, no <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods may be brought into this Kingdom but directly from thence. So that it will be in ſuch a Companys Power to make us pay what they pleaſe for their Imported Commodities, without any Remedy againſt it, which makes it plain that the Subjects of <hi>England</hi> will then be in a far worſe Condition than thoſe of <hi>Holland</hi> are under their Company.</p>
