            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving committed these Epistles to the
<hi>Press,</hi> I was horribly put to't for a
Patron—I thought of some great
Lord, or some Angelique Lady; but then again
consider'd I should never be able to adorn my
Dedication with benign Beams, coruscant Rayes,
and the Devil and all of Influence. At last I
heard my good Friend Mr. <hi>Fairbeard</hi> was
come to Town—nay then—all's well enough.
To you therefore I offer this English <hi>Ovid,</hi>
to whom you may not be unaptly compar'd in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parcels of your Life and Conversation; only
with this exception, That you have nothing of his
<hi>Tristibus</hi> about you.</p>

'Tis you who Burlesque all the Foppery and
conceited Gravity of the Age. I remember you
once told a grave affected Advocate, That he
Burlesqu'd Gods Image, for God had made him
after his own Likeness, but he made himself look
like an Ass.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter I am very well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd
in my Choice of you for my Judge; if you
speak well of the Book, 'tis all I desire, and the
<hi>Bookseller</hi> will have reason to rejoyce: tho'
by your approbation you may draw upon your self
a grand Inconvenience; for perhaps you may too
often have Songs, Sonnets, Madrigals, and an
innumerable Army of Stanza's obtruded upon
you by</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.
Occasioned by the
PREFACE
To a late Book call'd,
The WITS Paraphras'd.</head>
            <p>BEfore I shall give you any Account of our Old
Friend <hi>Ovid,</hi> or of his <hi>Life,</hi> I am to inform
you, that his <hi>Epistles</hi> have been ingeniously
and correctly translated by several Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and withall, that he was of a good Family, and
a brave Fellow was he. Now, since the unhappy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
of his Death, his Ghost hath been lately at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to be rais'd by an unlucky <hi>Pretender</hi> to
<hi>Poetry,</hi> who indeed hath not skill enough to disturb
his Manes: He calls his Book, <hi>The Wits Paraphras'd,</hi>
or, <hi>Paraphrase upon Paraphrase,</hi> that is, <hi>Throw
Pelion upon Ossa, Ossa upon Pelion, and away
with it.</hi> This Book he has dedicated to his Patron
<hi>Julian,</hi> Secretary to the <hi>Muses,</hi> in hopes that he may
get an Vnder-Writer's Place somewhere about <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nassus:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65089:4"/>
but alas! how can he ever hope for Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
when he has blasphem'd the best <hi>Poet</hi> of our
Age, by mistaking <hi>Innocence</hi> for <hi>Ignorance:</hi> I wish
to God the last may not rise up in Judgment against
him. He (good Soul) is (as appears in his Epistle to
his Patron) for none of your High Flights; but, like
an humble Sinner in a strict Diet, makes all his <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile's</hi>
of <hi>Close Stools</hi> with <hi>Velvet-Seats,</hi> and <hi>Pans</hi>
that receive the Excrement. God save us: What
are we when we are left to our selves!</p>
            <p>Now for his <hi>Preface,</hi> he would imitate that inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
one of Mr. <hi>Dryden</hi>'s to <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Epistles,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
with <hi>Ovid</hi>'s <hi>Life,</hi> which hath been wrot by
as many Men as there are <hi>Lives</hi> in <hi>Plutarch.</hi> And
again, Our <hi>Paraphraser</hi> saies, That <hi>Ovid</hi> was as good
a Wit as Himself or any other Translator; and, to
prove that, he saies, <hi>Nescivit quod bene cessit,</hi> &amp;c.
He might as aptly have said,</p>
            <q>The Man in the Moon drinks Claret.</q>
            <p>Then he saies, That he could find no such thing as
<hi>Clubbing</hi> with <hi>Ovid</hi> in all the Catalogue of <hi>Virgil,
Catullus, Propertius,</hi> or <hi>Tibullus:</hi> very truly said:
for I suppose he knows nothing farther of those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
than the Catalogue.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Oh Tempora! Oh Mores!</l>
               <l>The more the merrier!</l>
            </q>
            <p>He wonders, that so many Workmen should put their
Shreds and Thrums together to dress <hi>Ovid</hi> iv a <hi>Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon</hi>'s
Coat! why a silly <hi>Quaker,</hi> in plain <hi>Taunton</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:65089:4"/>
Serge, thinks a <hi>Scarlet Coat embroider'd</hi> to be <hi>the
Old Serpent!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He questions not but that there are more Fools in
the World of his Opinion. (The true Question is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he is not single?)</p>
            <p>Then he affirms, that, in his own simple naked shape,
he comes nearer the Original, than the best of 'em;
when in <hi>Sapho</hi> to <hi>Phaon</hi> he begins at the sixth Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stich,
<hi>Arva Phaon celebrat,</hi> &amp;c. and goes back to the
fifth, <hi>Uror ut indomitis,</hi> &amp;c. leaving out the eight
Verses preceding; by which you may easily guess that
he had no other Authority for his <hi>Paraphrase</hi> (as he
calls it) then the Translation: 'Tis something strange,
that neither <hi>Ovid</hi> himself, nor Nineteen Judicious
Translators, can give this Gentlemna the least hint or
light into <hi>Publius Ovidius Naso</hi>'s meaning,</p>
            <q>Quo te môri pedes?—</q>
            <p>Now on a sudden he's started from Poetry, and is
possest with the Spirit of sublunary Wealth, and wishes
with all his heart that he were as rich as a <hi>M.</hi> or
a <hi>C.</hi> then would he quit all his title to <hi>Pernassus,</hi>
and engage never to write: oh, never to write any
more, that is to say, he'd be so unconscionable as to
have a good Estate for nothing:</p>
            <q>God prosper long our Noble King—</q>
            <p>Now, as he saies, the late Translators have already
clipp'd the Original, and why should not he clip too:
whereas my fear is, he hath clipp'd <hi>Ovid</hi> so close that
it will hardly go:</p>
            <q>When first King <hi>Henry,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:65089:5"/>
I believe no Book hath had severer usage than our
<hi>Paraphrasers;</hi> for, saies he, it was hurry'd into the
Press before it cou'd make any defence for it self:
Now the meaning on't is, if it had met with impartial
Iudges, it had never been Printed.</p>
            <q>The Glories of our Birth and State, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>But to conclude; Having wonderfully shew'd his
Reading in his <hi>Preface</hi> to his aforesaid <hi>Wits Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phras'd;</hi>
in Scraps of old <hi>Latin;</hi> and at last, to his
eternal Glory, one bit of false <hi>Greek;</hi> he is so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd,
that he gives any man a Challenge in <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,
Arabick,</hi> and <hi>Syriack,</hi> though he confesses he
knows nothing of the matter: But, to try him, I'll
leave him with this <hi>Syriack</hi> Hexameter,</p>
            <q>Erytit ut aelutap snabucer bus enimget igaf.</q>
            <p>And to let you know that this last Verse, though
something rough, is not the effect of Indignation, I part
friendly; onely with this Advice, That our <hi>Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser</hi>
would consider, and follow any other Employment,
more agreeable with his <hi>Genius</hi> (if he have any) then
that of <hi>Poetry.</hi>

            <l>My Voice is crack't, and now I only houl,</l>

            <l>My Ballads lye neglected on a Shelf,</l>

            <argument>
               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Demophoon</hi> was born in <hi>Holland,</hi> who took after his
Father Theseus pretending to the Art of Pyracy;
he was cast upon <hi>Newcastle-Shore</hi> by adverse
Winds (as the <hi>Dutch</hi> Commentators say) but we
are inform'd he came hither by his own choice.
No sooner arriv'd, but he heard that one <hi>Phillis,</hi>
a single Woman, kept an Inn in the Town; There
he took up his Quarters: <hi>Phillis</hi> observ'd him as
a lusty Younker, and though his outward Habili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were not very tempting; yet his Person per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
her so far, that she Married him, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
him with all. After some time, he told
his Wife that his Occasions call'd him into <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
to see his Father, who he said, was a Man
of mighty Substance; He promised to Return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a Month, but hath not been heard of since. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
she writes to him this Letter; but whether it
came to his hands or no, hath been a question to this
day.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>YOur Absence does discover your Disdain,</l>
            <l>You 've done enough to make a Stone com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain;</l>

You told me you wou'd stay a Month,—no more;</l>
            <l>But by my Nature, I do find 'tis four.</l>
            <l>I, who am Woman, and a Lover too,</l>
            <l>Observe the changes of Moons, much more than you:</l>
            <l>Indisposition in the Head, or Back,</l>
            <l>Informs our Sex beyond an Almanack.</l>
            <l>Sometimes I hop'd—but soon that Hope did sink;</l>
            <l>Sometimes I thought—I knew not what to think.</l>
            <l>I made my—self a Liar—notwithstanding</l>
            <l>There was no Ship—I swore I saw you Landing.</l>
            <l>Some Curses on your Father I bestow,</l>
            <l>That old <hi>Dutch</hi> Rogue, think I, won't let him go:</l>
            <l>But then again, that cannot likely seem,</l>
            <l>The Maggot bites—you're gone away from him;</l>
            <l>What if you should be wrack't when hither bound?</l>
            <l>No,—you're too great a Villain to be drown'd.</l>
            <l>Whom shall I blame? whom but thy self—fond <hi>Philly?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who hast liv'd now Thirty years, and art so silly.</l>

When first you did within my Doors set footing,</l>
            <l>I fell in Love—forsooth—A Pox of rutting;</l>
            <l>The Devil sure will have that Doctor <hi>Hymen,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Who told me, that his Business was to try—men:</l>
            <l>He did believe—you'd prove an honest Man,</l>
            <l>Marry 'm—said he, with all the speed you can;</l>
            <l>The Good old Man his Substance to increase,</l>
            <l>Would match a Helhound to a Saint for Fees:</l>
            <l>You swore such dreadful Oaths as ne'r was heard,</l>
            <l>By th' <hi>Belgick</hi> Lion, and the Prince's Beard;</l>
            <l>By <hi>Opdam</hi>'s Ghost, and by the Dragon's Tail,</l>
            <l>B' your Father's Head, and Mother's Farthingale;</l>
            <l>By the great Cannons, and the Bloody Flag,</l>
            <l>And by the <hi>Hogan Mogans</hi> of the <hi>Hague;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Your Execrations put m' in such a fright,</l>
            <l>That all the Hair about me stood upright:</l>
            <l>If on your Head these Curses fall you've nam'd,</l>
            <l>I must conclude, that certainly y'are damn'd;</l>

Hearing such bloody Oaths, you would not stay,</l>
            <l>I made all haste I cou'd to get y' away;</l>
            <l>I furnish'd you with all I cou'd afford,</l>
            <l>Bisket and Powder'd Beef I put aboard;</l>
            <l>A Flask of Brandy to your Girdle hung,</l>
            <l>Better I'm sure, was never tipt o're Tongue:</l>
            <l>And when I patch'd your Sails with antient Smock,</l>
            <l>I thought they wou'd have brought me home good luck;</l>
            <l>But stead of that—such was my fatal Hap,</l>
            <l>I prov'd the Instrument of your Escape:</l>
            <l>When you came hither in a low Condition,</l>
            <l>Did I not stuff your Guts with good Provision:</l>
            <l>The Suit y' had on—was destitute of stitches,</l>
            <l>I gave you then my Brother's Coat and Breeches;</l>
            <l>But as for that—Pox on't—I'll ne'r repent it,</l>
            <l>What you had wanted, I had then presented;</l>
            <l>If you had never paid—here's none would stop ye;</l>

I wish to God that very day we met,</l>
            <l>That into Gaol I had been thrown for Debt;</l>

            <head>HYPERMNESTRA to LINUS.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>There was lately a Gang of <hi>English</hi> Highway-men, all
of 'em having Wives or Whores in <hi>London.</hi> Now
the only means to detect 'em, was by bribing their
Women. In order to which, the Keeper of <hi>Newgate</hi>
went to 'em all, promising them very fairly, and with
all, using Arguments how serviceable they would be
to their Country, in Discovering them; which they
might easily do, when they came home to Bed.
The Women were easily perswaded, And one Night,
order'd the Keeper to be there at such a time, who
seized them all; but <hi>Linus</hi> was praeadmonished by
his Wife <hi>Hypermnestra,</hi> so he escaped away in her
Cloaths; She bore the brunt in his Apparel, and
was Taken (supposed to be a Man) and Committed
to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and put into Irons. The rest of the
Thieves were Hang'd, her Trial was respited, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not known who she was. <hi>Hypermnestra</hi> sends
him this Letter.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>TO thee poor <hi>Hypermnestra</hi> now complains,</l>
            <l>Such is the Torture of my Iron Chains:</l>
            <l>Shall it be call'd in Law, a Crime so heinous,</l>
            <l>For being just to my own Husband <hi>Linus?</hi>

Let 'em torment me on, I do not care,</l>
            <l>I'll not tell who I am, nor where you are;</l>
            <l>If they should Hang me up in stead of you,</l>
            <l>To the last Gasp, I swear I will be true:</l>
            <l>I long to be reveng'd on those curs'd Wives,</l>
            <l>That did betray their Friends and Husbands Lives</l>
            <l>Such Men were not in <hi>England</hi> to be found,</l>
            <l>They'd bid the Devil stand, on any ground;</l>
            <l>And all the Prizes that they got, they spent</l>
            <l>Upon those Whores; yet they were not content.</l>
            <l>Think on that Night we did together Sup,</l>
            <l>When all the Company were Cock-a-hoop;</l>
            <l>That fatal Night you all came from the Pad,</l>
            <l>Your Booty very large, your hearts were glad:</l>
            <l>Though in my sad Condition, 'tis not proper;</l>
            <l>Yet, I can well remember all the Supper:</l>
            <l>A stately Loin of Veal began the Feast,</l>
            <l>I help'd you half the Kidney at the least;</l>

Four Turkey Poulets came next, you wish'd they'd been</l>
            <l>Four <hi>Turky</hi> Merchants upon <hi>Mile-End-Green;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Roasted young Ducks, and Chickens fricazeed;</l>
            <l>There was more Meat than we cou'd eat indeed:</l>
            <l>Wine in abundance—I drank none but Sack,</l>
            <l>But all you Men did ply it with Pontack:</l>
            <l>To th' top you fill'd a Glass, and drank to th' best—</l>
            <l>The Health as you began it, seem'd a Jest;</l>
            <l>I took't in Earnest to my self, and knew</l>
            <l>That I should prove the best of Wives to you.</l>
            <l>By Two a Clock you Men were almost Drunk,</l>
            <l>Then each to Bed went to his Spouse, or Punk;</l>
            <l>If they were all as kind as you to me,</l>
            <l>Never was such a Night of Lechery:</l>
            <l>At last you slept securely without warning</l>
            <l>Of the strange Alterations in the Morning:</l>
            <l>I knew betimes the Keepers wou'd be there,</l>

At last I rose, and 'bout the Room I walk'd,</l>
            <l>And thus at Random to my self I talk'd;</l>
            <l>Have I not sworn a Thousand Oaths at lest,</l>
            <l>That I'd betray my Husband with the rest?</l>
            <l>What must I do? 'Tis true, I am his Wife,</l>

            <l>'Hang all the Oaths in Christendom, said I;</l>
            <l>He is my Husband, and he must not die.</l>
            <l>With that I drew your Breeches on in hast,</l>
            <l>The Codpiece was so big, I was amaz'd;</l>
            <l>I walk'd into your Coat, hanging on Peg,</l>
            <l>I lost my head within your Perewig:</l>

Rise <hi>Linus,</hi> Rise, said I, be very quick;</l>

            <argument>
               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hermione</hi> was the Daughter of Menelaus and <hi>Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</hi>
Her Mother ran away with a young Fellow,
one <hi>Paris,</hi> they went together beyond the Seas. Her
Husband who lov'd her well, persu'd 'em, and after
many years, found his Wife and rescu'd her from
her Gallant, and without any resentment of the
Injury, took her again. During their absence,
their Daughter (who had an Estate left her by her
Vnkle) was committed to the Custody of her Grand-father,
who Married her to a School-fellow and
Cozen German of hers, by Name Orestes. Her
Father brought home with him one <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> a wild
young Fellow, to whom he Marry'd her again, taking
no notice of the first match. She silly harmless
Girl, wonders at the design, and to her Husband
<hi>Orestes</hi> writes this innocent Letter.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>TO thee I write, my dear and only Cuz;</l>
            <l>Nor will I be afraid to call the Spouse:</l>
            <l>Though here's a Fellow come resolv'd to swear</l>
            <l>I am his Wife, and he will make't appear:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:65089:17"/>
He looks sometimes, as if he long'd to eat me,</l>
            <l>Sometimes he looks so gruff, as if he'd beat me:</l>
            <l>He says he is <hi>Achilles</hi> Son and Heir,</l>
            <l>And bids me disobey him, if I dare;</l>
            <l>He kisses me so hard, the strangest Man,</l>
            <l>He gets a top of me do what I can;</l>
            <l>With all my strength my Legs together join,</l>
            <l>But with one Knee, hee'l open both of mine.</l>
            <l>I call him Rogue and Rascal, filthy Sot,</l>
            <l>And all the beastly Names I can get out:</l>
            <l>I'm Marry'd, Sirrah, therefore don't mistake it,</l>
            <l>I have a Husband that will thwack your Jacket;</l>
            <l>Yet that's all one, he cares not what is said;</l>
            <l>But by the Hair he drags me into bed:</l>
            <l>They talk of Girls, forc'd by unruly men,</l>
            <l>They can't be forc'd so much as I have been:</l>
            <l>Yet all this while <hi>Orestes</hi> comes not near me,</l>
            <l>I am afraid you do not love your <hi>Hermey;</hi>

            <l>Lord! There was such a noise, and such a—yelling,</l>
            <l>He rais'd up all the People in our Lane,</l>
            <l>And ne'r was quiet, 'till she came again.</l>
            <l>I wou'd not have you make a noise for me,</l>
            <l>But come and kill this fellow quietly;</l>
            <l>Give him a good sound blow, and never fear man,</l>
            <l>It is for me, your Wife and Cozin German.</l>
            <l>You know my Guardian marry'd me to you</l>
            <l>When we were both so young, we could not do—</l>
            <l>Now from beyond Sea comes my Father huffing,</l>
            <l>And will needs marry me to this same Ruffian,</l>
            <l>He vapours here about his Country Blood,</l>
            <l>I guess your <hi>English</hi> Familie's as good:</l>

            <l>'Tis something strange, we're of a Generation</l>
            <l>Where Ravishing has been a mighty fashion:</l>

            <l>A little Couzin by another man;</l>
            <l>My Mother has been ravish'd once or twice,</l>
            <l>And I am ravish'd now by her advice.</l>
            <l>Must I with such a Rogue as this be match'd?</l>
            <l>A more unlucky Girl was never hatch'd.</l>
            <l>My Mother left me here a little Wench,</l>
            <l>Just big enough to clamber on a Bench;</l>
            <l>She was stark mad for that young fellow—<hi>Paris,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And after him she danc'd the new Fagaries:</l>
            <l>My Father for his life cou'd not forbear,</l>
            <l>But ran a—catter-wawling after her;</l>
            <l>Now they're come home, but with such alt'red looks,</l>

            <l>Ever to see me more's beyond all Hope,</l>
            <l>One hand a Pen, the other Holds a Rope:</l>
            <l>My blustring Father's troubled with a Whim,</l>
            <l>And I must hang my self to humour him.</l>
            <l>But when he sees my Carcase on the floor,</l>
            <l>Surely he'll cease to call me Bitch or Whore:</l>
            <l>His puffing and his blowing will be vain,</l>
            <l>He cannot puffe me into life again:</l>
            <l>His Mind is swell'd much bigger then his Face,</l>
            <l>I am (he saies) his Family's Disgrace:</l>
            <l>All his great Friends and Kindred are provok't;</l>
            <l>What are his Friends to me when I am choak'd?</l>
            <l>

I with that we had stifled one another</l>
            <l>That night I clung so closely to you, Brother:</l>
            <l>Why did you love me more then did become ye?</l>
            <l>It had been happy, if y'ad kick'd me from ye:</l>
            <l>When first, with pleasure, I lay under you,</l>
            <l>Would y'ad been lighter by a Stone or two.</l>
            <l>At first I wondred what should be the matter,</l>
            <l>I look'd like Death, and was as weak as Water:</l>
            <l>For several days I loath'd the sight of Meat,</l>
            <l>And every Night I chew'd the upper Sheet:</l>
            <l>I'd such Obstructions, I was almost moap'd,</l>
            <l>My Breath came short, my—were stop'd.</l>
            <l>I call'd old Nurse, and told her how it was;</l>
            <l>She, an experienc'd Baw'd, soon groap'd the Cause:</l>
            <l>Quoth she, for this Disease, take what you can,</l>
            <l>You'll ne'er be well, till you have taken Man:</l>
            <l>When I was young, I thought I was bewitch'd,</l>
            <l>I scrach't my Belly, for it alwaies itch'd.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:65089:21"/>
The Truth I will no longer hide, said I,</l>
            <l>I must enjoy my Brother, or I dy:</l>
            <l>She tickl'd me, and told me 'twas no Sin;</l>
            <l>Nearer of Blood, said she, the deeper in:</l>
            <l>Both you and I approv'd what Nurse had said,</l>
            <l>So, without more a-do, we went to Bed:</l>
            <l>You in my belly rummag'd all about,</l>
            <l>To find this wonderful distemper out:</l>
            <l>Too soon 'twould be discovered, was my Fear,</l>
            <l>I could have let you search'd for ever there:</l>
            <l>But Nurse can tell how I did sigh and sob</l>
            <l>When we perceiv'd that you had done the Jobb.</l>
            <l>I made th' old Bedlam foot it up and down</l>
            <l>To every Quack and Mountebank in Town,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>For</hi> Dendelion, <hi>and</hi> Camelions-thighs,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Spirit of Saffron</hi> mixt with <hi>Vulters-eys:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I would have given all I had been worth,</l>
            <l>T' have kill'd the Child, before it had come forth:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:65089:22"/>
But the strong Rogue lay fencing in my Womb,</l>
            <l>And did those pois'nous Potions overcome:</l>
            <l>Oh! when I saw the ninth Moon in the Wane,</l>
            <l>Then I was in the Full—of grief and Pain;</l>
            <l>Then, then my Throws came on me thick and thick;</l>
            <l>I groan'd, but for my Life I durst not schreik</l>
            <l>Until my Tortures came to such a growth</l>
            <l>That Nurse with both her Hands did stop my Mouth:</l>
            <l>I should have cry'd so loud, that every Neighbour</l>
            <l>Would have discover'd I had been in Labour:</l>
            <l>No Woman yet that ever wore a Navel,</l>
            <l>Endur'd so hard and so severe a Travel.</l>
            <l>I curs'd your Sex, and wish'd Rot a might come</l>
            <l>On all the Stallions throughout Christendome.</l>
            <l>At last you came; I knew you by your tread;</l>
            <l>I peep'd at you, though I was almost dead:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:65089:22"/>
T' ward me you seem'd to have some kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse</l>
            <l>But look'd, as if you would have eaten Nurse.</l>
            <l>You held my Back-parts, you could do no more;</l>
            <l>Would you had never felt the Parts before.</l>
            <l>Sister, said you, you shall not dy this bout,</l>
            <l>We're both unlucky, but, we'll rub it out.</l>
            <l>To see what words from those we love can doe,</l>
            <l>(Surely the Child Within me heard you too,)</l>
            <l>For streight he sprang forth from me, and did seem</l>
            <l>To make his passage in a flowing Stream:</l>
            <l>'Twas hard enough: but now's a harder Case,</l>
            <l>To hide the Business from my Father's face;</l>
            <l>We did consult how to devise a way</l>
            <l>Thorough the Hall our Bastard to conveigh.</l>
            <l>My Father in Wind-Musick still delighted,</l>
            <l>And all the Gang that night he had envited:</l>
            <l>Fellows that play on Bag-pipes, and the Fife;</l>
            <l>The old man always lov'd a noisefull Life:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:65089:23"/>
They all did sound together after Supper,</l>

            <l>Nurse, in her Apron, took the little Brat,</l>

            <l>Quite through the Hall she went her usual pace,</l>

            <l>When the unlucky Wretch began to screme:</l>
            <l>His little Organ made a shriller noise</l>
            <l>Then all the Fluits, Recorders, or Ho-boies:</l>
            <l>The old man prick'd his ears up, like a Hare,</l>
            <l>And after Nurse ran nimbly, as the Air:</l>
            <l>Whither so fast, said he, old Mother Trundle?</l>
            <l>Pray, let us see, What have you in your Bundle:</l>
            <l>Quoth Nurse,—'Tis Mistress <hi>Canny</hi>'s dirty Smock</l>
            <l>Men into Womens secrets should not look.</l>
            <l>He puff'd away the Rushes from her Lap.</l>
            <l>And there appear'd the little sprauling Ape:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:65089:23"/>
'Zounds, saies my Father, What is here? A Kid!</l>
            <l>My Daughter <hi>Canny</hi>'s finely brought to bed!</l>
            <l>He rais'd so great a Tempest in the House,</l>
            <l>I thought that Hell it self was broken loose;</l>
            <l>He rag'd so loud, the Bed shook under me;</l>
            <l>Methought I was in some great Storm at Sea:</l>
            <l>He rush'd into the Room, and did discover</l>
            <l>The bloody Sypmtoms of a Child-bed Lover:</l>
            <l>Our Sexes Stains by him were here discry'd</l>
            <l>Which Women from their own dear Husbands hide:</l>
            <l>With his own hands he did design to wound me,</l>
            <l>But that he saw something like Murther round me:</l>
            <l>The Bastard in the Sreets he did expose,</l>
            <l>And what will be his destiny, God knows:</l>
            <l>The little Knave, with Tears, did seem to answer,</l>
            <l>As who should say, I beg your Pardon Grandsir.</l>
            <l>Out went old <hi>Trump;</hi> I by his Looks could find</l>
            <l>There was some mischief hatching in his mind,</l>

               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65089:24"/>
In came a Fellow of the <hi>Bag-Pipe</hi> Gang</l>
            <l>Whose very Whiskers seem'd to say, Go hang;</l>

            <l>If I don't hang my self, the Devil-sink-me.</l>
            <l>Since Whoring does produce such strange effects</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Theseus,</hi> an English Gentleman, and one who for his
diversion admir'd Travelling, <hi>especially on Foot,</hi>
having safely arriv'd at <hi>Calais,</hi> walk'd on easily
from thence to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had not long been,
but he receiv'd an unmannerly Justle from a Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
of <hi>France: Theseus,</hi> whose great Soul could
not brook the least Affront, resented this so highly,
that he challeng'd him, fought him, and, after a long
and skilful Dispute between 'em, fairly kill'd him:
<hi>Thesus</hi> was imprison'd in the <hi>Bastile;</hi> During his
Restraint he held a League with <hi>Ariadne,</hi> the
Keeper's daughter: And, though the Prison was as
difficult as a Labyrinth, (such is the power of Love,)
she soon contriv'd a way for his Escape by night: and
he, accompany'd with Mistress <hi>Ariadne,</hi> footed it
back to <hi>Calais;</hi> where, both lodging together at
the <hi>Red-Hart,</hi> he very unkindly took the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of her Snoaring, and stole from her early in the
morning; and went off with the Pacquet-boat to
<hi>Dover;</hi> from whence he gently walk'd to <hi>London.
Ariadne</hi> sends him These.</p>

            <l>D'ye think you don't deserve ten thousand Curses,</l>
            <l>For leaving me in Pawn at Monseur <hi>Forces?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I wonder what the Tavern-people think!</l>
            <l>For here I sit, and dare not call for Drink</l>
            <l>While by your side I innocently lay,</l>
            <l>You might have taken leave, a civil way.</l>

Thinking t' have hugg'd you in my Arms so close</l>
            <l>One of the Bed-staffs almost broke my Nose:</l>

               <hi>Thes. Thes.</hi> said I, I hope you are not gone;</l>

            <l>What will become of me? What shall I doe?</l>
            <l>I op'd the Casement as the Morning dawn'd;</l>
            <l>And I could plainly see that I was pawn'd,</l>
            <l>With calling you I tore my Throat to pieces,</l>

Sometimes they talk, that Ships are safe at home:</l>

            <argument>
               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leander</hi> an Vsher of a School, and chief Poet of
<hi>Richmond,</hi> having contracted a more then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Acquaintance with Mistress <hi>Hero,</hi> of <hi>Twitnam,</hi>
a Governess or Tutress to young Ladies; such a
reverential esteem had they procur'd to themselves
at each place, that they could not conveniently
meet without great scandal; therefore the Vsher
frequently swam over to his Mistress by night, but
at this time the <hi>Thames</hi> was so rough, that he was
constrained to convey his mind to <hi>Hero</hi> by a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terman
in these Poetical Lines, wherein Love and
Learning strive to outvie each other.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>YOur faithful Lover sends this Bille' dou'x.</l>
            <l>Stuff'd full of Love, but not a word of news.</l>
            <l>Believe not, I think much of any Labour,</l>
            <l>Cou'd I have come my self, I'd ne're sent Paper;</l>
            <l>The <hi>Thames</hi> is rough, the Winds so hard do blow,</l>
            <l>I scarcely got a Waterman to goe.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:65089:29"/>
And if I wou'd have given a thousand pound,</l>
            <l>This was the only Fellow to be found.</l>
            <l>I stood upon the Shoar, while he went off,</l>
            <l>The Boat once gone, I thought 'twas well enough</l>
            <l>I must be careful whom I send by Water,</l>
            <l>Our Family begins to smoak the matter:</l>
            <l>Just as the Letter went, I had a fancy</l>
            <l>Came in my head, I cou'd have made a Stanza:</l>
            <l>Go Paper, go, and kiss a whiter hand,</l>
            <l>That oft hath put <hi>Leander</hi> to a stand.</l>
            <l>Methinks, the Nymph perfumes it with her Breath,</l>
            <l>And bites the wax off with her Ivory Teeth:</l>
            <l>Her Shepherd would be glad to be so bit,</l>
            <l>Until th' aforesaid Teeth together met.</l>
            <l>But then think I, these whimseys shee'll condemn.</l>
            <l>The hand that writes, should rather make me swim;</l>
            <l>Bold strokes in Poetry she hardly blames,</l>
            <l>But such bold strokes shou'd be upon the Thames<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:65089:29"/>
Methinks it is an Age since I swam o're,</l>
            <l>I long until each Arm, does prove an Oar.</l>
            <l>Fully resolv'd I came to'th water side,</l>
            <l>And thought the space between us but a stride.</l>
            <l>I saw your house, and wish'd that I cou'd clamber</l>
            <l>To your watch—light in the supremest Chamber:</l>
            <l>I pull'd off Coat and doublet twice or thrice,</l>
            <l>But then I thought,—be merry and be wise.</l>
            <l>Thus I in Verse spake to the mighty <hi>Boreas,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Thou blustring youth—pray tell me why so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious;</l>
            <l>Tho' amongst Winds thou art a great Commander,</l>
            <l>Blow gently for the sake of poor <hi>Leander.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>I cross no Sea (Here <hi>Thames</hi> is call'd the Sea,</l>
            <l>Because it doth with lofty Verse agree.)</l>
            <l>I cross no Sea to <hi>Asia</hi> or to <hi>Afrique,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Upon the Account of Sublunary Traffique:</l>
            <l>Ingots of Gold! alass! I do not seek 'em,</l>
            <l>Give me my Heroes Love, them <hi>omnia mecum.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:65089:30"/>
               <hi>Boreas</hi> himself does sometimes leave off roaring</l>
            <l>And goes a—woing, I'll not say a—whoring.</l>
            <l>For several uses you, your breath may spare,</l>
            <l>Do not so fiercely move our <hi>Richmond</hi> Air.</l>
            <l>But all was vain, <hi>Boreas</hi> was still unkind,</l>
            <l>I did repeat my Verses to the wind.</l>
            <l>Had I but wings, I'd soar above the People</l>
            <l>And place my self just now on <hi>Twitnam</hi> Steeple.</l>
            <l>I well remember that first night I swam,</l>
            <l>That happy night I first to <hi>Twitnam</hi> came;</l>
            <l>I put off all my cloaths, with them my fears,</l>
            <l>And dous'd into the <hi>Thames</hi> o're head and ears.</l>
            <l>The Moon took—care <hi>Leander</hi> should not sink,</l>
            <l>And stole before me like a lighted Link:</l>
            <l>I thank'd her for her Love, and thus did greet her,</l>
            <l>As far as my poor Talent went—in meeter.</l>
            <l>Ah gentle Moon, because thou'rt kind to me,</l>
            <l>I wish <hi>Endymion</hi> may be so to thee:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:65089:30"/>
And as with him thou hold'st a private League</l>
            <l>With thy broad Eye, so wink at my Intrigue.</l>
            <l>Under correction to your Heavenly sence,</l>
            <l>Your case and mine have little difference.</l>
            <l>A Goddess you love one of human Birth,</l>
            <l>My Mistress is a Goddess upon Earth:</l>
            <l>Such sort of Beauty as she wears, is given</l>
            <l>Only to such as do belong to Heaven.</l>
            <l>And if you are not of the self same mind,</l>
            <l>Begging your Pardon, <hi>Cynthia,</hi> you're blind.</l>
            <l>With such like words I got near <hi>Twitnam</hi> sands,</l>
            <l>And nothing all the way saw I but Swans.</l>
            <l>At last I spy'd your Candle on the top,</l>
            <l>Aye! now all's well, thought I, there is some hope.</l>
            <l>But when you put your head out from the Caze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</l>
            <l>Then was <hi>Leander</hi> struck into amazement;</l>
            <l>For two Lights more did from the Window seem,</l>
            <l>Which made the artificial one look dim.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65089:31"/>
Your Eyes the Moon, and Candle made just four</l>
            <l>I, like some Prince was lighted to the shoar.</l>
            <l>But you're to blame, when you perceiv'd me come,</l>
            <l>Nurse sayes, she cou'd not keep you in the room,</l>
            <l>But in your shift you wou'd be running down;</l>
            <l>You'l get some violent cold, and then you're gone</l>
            <l>But to say truth, thou art a loving Tit,</l>
            <l>Thou hug'st me in thy arms all dripping wet:</l>
            <l>I can but think how strangely I did look,</l>
            <l>When you put o're my head a Holland Smock;</l>
            <l>And hand in hand thus walking from the <hi>Thames</hi>
            </l>
            <l>We seem'd the Ghosts of two distressed Dames.</l>
            <l>But when we came to Bed, we understood,</l>
            <l>We were no Ghost, but real Flesh and Blood:</l>
            <l>We did repeat more pleasures in one hour,</l>
            <l>Than some dull Lovers do in forty score;</l>
            <l>Because we knew our time was very short,</l>

            <l>I with an Apron rub'd you up and down,</l>
            <l>And dry'd you from the toe unto the crown;</l>
            <l>Then presently we hugg'd with such a force,</l>
            <l>I shook the Bed, and wak'd, and startled Nurse;</l>
            <l>And finding it to be a Dream—no more,</l>
            <l>I grew as melancholy as before.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:65089:34"/>
If in a dream such tickling Joyes appear,</l>
            <l>Much pleasanter 'twou'd be, if you were here;</l>
            <l>I don't know what to think: you us'd to say,</l>
            <l>Ten thousand Devils should not stop your way:</l>
            <l>Why should the danger at this time be more?</l>
            <l>The Wind blows hard, and so it did before;</l>
            <l>But now I see which way 'tis like to drive,</l>
            <l>A <hi>Richmond</hi> Wench as sure as I'm alive;</l>
            <l>Au! say ye so? why then it is for her</l>
            <l>This Storm is rais'd, <hi>Leander</hi> cannot stir.</l>
            <l>But hang't that cannot be, I'm turn'd a fool,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Leander</hi> was and is an honest Soul:</l>
            <l>As soon as I had said these words of you,</l>
            <l>The Candle burn't not as it us'd to doe;</l>
            <l>Sayes Nurse, there is a Stranger in the Light,</l>
            <l>Master <hi>Leander</hi> will be here to Night;</l>
            <l>With that she took the Brandy bottle up,</l>
            <l>And pull'd from thence a very hearty sup;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:65089:35"/>
Sayes she—if what I say should prove untrue,</l>
            <l>I wish this blessed draught may ne're go through;</l>
            <l>Therefore let's see you here to Night dear <hi>Nandy,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or else poor Nurse must never more drink Brandy.</l>
            <l>Perhaps you fancy you take double pains,</l>
            <l>And make too great a trespass on your Reins,</l>
            <l>To swim so far as you have us'd to do,</l>
            <l>And after that to please a Mistress too;</l>
            <l>Half of one half I'd ease you if I cou'd,</l>
            <l>And meet you in the middle of the flood;</l>
            <l>But from the latter service never flinch,</l>
            <l>I should be loath to bate you half an inch;</l>
            <l>But after all excusing what I'ave said,</l>
            <l>Pray do not cross the River hand o're head;</l>
            <l>I dream't last night, I hope 'tis no ill Luck,</l>
            <l>A Spaniel Dog was hunting of a Duck,</l>
            <l>There were some reeds which under water grew,</l>
            <l>And more, perhaps, than the poor Spaniel knew.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:65089:35"/>
He was entangled there, and there was found,</l>
            <l>I came to help him, but the Curr was drown'd.</l>
            <l>I do not tell this Dream to make you tardy,</l>
            <l>But as a Caution not to be fool-hardy.</l>
            <l>The Wind will soon be laid, the <hi>Thames</hi> be clear,</l>
            <l>Then you may cross it, without wit or fear;</l>
            <l>Make much of This, for if you fail me, then</l>
            <l>By all the Gods I'll never write agen.</l>

               <p>In the War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> one <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesilaus,</hi>
an <hi>English</hi> Lieutenant of a Fifth Rate
Frigat, being Wind-bound upon the <hi>Downs;</hi> his
Wife <hi>Laodamia,</hi> hearing he was not gone off, sent
him this Letter; and, like a fond Wife, gives him
strict Caution to avoid Fighting.</p>

            <l>A Health to your Prosperity goes round,</l>
            <l>And to your safe Return before you're drown'd:</l>
            <l>My Neighbour <hi>Iackson</hi>'s Wife began it to me;</l>

We drink, and fansie to our selves in vain,</l>
            <l>That the good Winds will blow you back again.</l>
            <l>I hate the Noise of a tumultuous Sea,</l>
            <l>Give me a Tempest rais'd by you and me;</l>
            <l>A Storm in which all Parts about us shake,</l>
            <l>When we can hear the Bed beneath us crack.</l>
            <l>At <hi>Gravesend,</hi> when we took our last Adieu,</l>
            <l>The Parting Kiss, remember, I gave you:</l>
            <l>I, like a shitten Girle, began to cry;</l>
            <l>I had no mind, methoughts, to say, God b'w'y:</l>
            <l>I heard Tarpaulins roar out, Hoise up Sail;</l>
            <l>On Board, on Board; here comes a merry Gale:</l>
            <l>In such brisk Gales poor Women don't delight,</l>
            <l>They blow away the Pleasures of the night:</l>
            <l>As you went off, I could not bear the Loss,</l>
            <l>A Qualm came o'er my Stomach quite-a-cross:</l>
            <l>Old Mother <hi>Crump,</hi> a very subtle <hi>Croan,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Saw by my Looks that I was almost gon:</l>

A Pint of Brandy presently she brought,</l>
            <l>And made me drink a very hearty draught;</l>
            <l>She shew'd her Love, but what great good has't done?</l>
            <l>How can I live with comfort now you're gone?</l>
            <l>I wake, and find no Husband by my side;</l>
            <l>I often think 'twere better I had dy'd:</l>
            <l>Till you return, I'll ne'er be drest agen;</l>
            <l>I have not comb'd my Head the Lord knows when:</l>
            <l>A Glass of Wine sometimes my heart does cherish;</l>
            <l>Wer't not for that, I fansie I shou'd perish:</l>
            <l>Because I go so taudry, like a Punk,</l>
            <l>Some, that don't know me, think that I am drunk:</l>
            <l>My Neighbours often tell me, Mistress <hi>Protes</hi>—,</l>

            <l>These Plaguy <hi>Dutch;</hi> that they should break the Peace,</l>

               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> was the Son of <hi>Priam</hi> a Wealthy Old Citizen
and Alderman of <hi>London.</hi> When <hi>Hecuba</hi> his
Mother was big with Child of him, she dream't a
foolish conceited Dream, which occasion'd Old
<hi>Priam</hi> to consult <hi>Lilly,</hi> who told him, That <hi>Paris</hi>
in process of time would occasion his house to be
burnt down. Therefore the credulous Alderman
sends him into the Countrey far <hi>North</hi> to be
dispos'd of as a By-blow. When be grew fit for
Service, he was entertain'd in a Gentleman's
House, where he contracted a Bosom-acquaintance
with <hi>Oenone</hi> a Young Wench and fellow Servant
with him in the same house. His Father began
to come to himself, and hearing where he was, sent
for him, and own'd him as his Son; but before that,
he had disengaged himself from Service, and ran
away with one <hi>Hellen,</hi> who was Wife to <hi>Menelaus.
Oenone</hi> being inform'd of All these proceedings,
writes to him this Letter.</p>

            <l>That none but such a fool as I would own'e'e;</l>

            <l>What mighty mischief have I done, I wonder;</l>

            <l>Come! come! these things wou'd make a body speak.</l>
            <l>You were not then so Uppish—when you said,</l>
            <l>A Dutchess was a T—t' a Servant Maid;</l>
            <l>You were a Groom your self, you know 'tis truth,</l>

If you were able to keep house you swore</l>

            <l>Both in the Stable, on a Truss of Hay;</l>
            <l>You can't forget some pretty pastimes there,</l>

            <l>Prick'd up her Ears, and thought you were in Jest:</l>
            <l>But I did prove the verrier Beast oth' two,</l>
            <l>For like an Ass I thought that all was true;</l>

            <l>To undertake it you seem'd very loath,</l>

            <l>There's no man but must have his first beginning,</l>
            <l>Who learnt you then to fold your Table Linnen?</l>
            <l>Did you not often when the Cloath was spred,</l>

You have been threatned oft to lose your place,</l>

            <l>I was your dearest Honey—all that while</l>

            <l>You carv'd my name upon the Trencher-Plates,</l>

To you they came when you were in the Close,</l>

Lately translated out of

Now BURLESQU'D</head>

               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>There hapning a Rebellion in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in that Army
which went under the Command of the Duke;
<hi>Ulysses</hi> went Voluntier. The Rebels being quell'd,
the Army return'd home; but <hi>Ulysses</hi> lay loitring
at some Inn on the Road; which when his Care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Wife <hi>Penelope</hi> understood, she sent him this
Epistle; giving him an Account how Affairs stood
at home.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>YOur poor <hi>Penelope</hi> admires that you</l>
            <l>Should ever use a Woman as you do!</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:65089:45"/>
Now every Souldier's at his own aboad,</l>
            <l>You, like a Sot, ly tipling on the Road:</l>
            <l>You are not left behind 'em as a Spy,</l>
            <l>T' inform, in case of second Mutiny:</l>
            <l>The Devil of Hell will have that Fellow surely,</l>
            <l>Who first began this plaguy Hurly-burly.</l>
            <l>Had it not been for this unlucky Fight,</l>
            <l>Y'ad stuck to work all day:—to me at night.</l>
            <l>Poor I must drudge at home all sorts of wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</l>
            <l>And knit,—as Heaven and Earth would come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;</l>
            <l>Twirling a Wheel, I sit at home—hum—drum,</l>
            <l>And spit away my Nature on my Thumb:</l>
            <l>Thus, while I spin, you, like a careful Spouse,</l>
            <l>Go reeling up and down from house to house.</l>
            <l>Being you stay'd so long, I did conjecture,</l>
            <l>You had been maul'd by <hi>Sauny,</hi> the <hi>Scotch</hi> Hector:</l>
            <l>Old <hi>Nestor</hi>'s Son, that Fool, stood just by you,</l>

And, when he dropt, for all you are so stout,</l>
            <l>You wish'd your self at home, in shitten clout.</l>
            <l>Yet, after all, <hi>Vlysses,</hi> I am glad</l>
            <l>You are alive, though you're a scurvy Lad.</l>
            <l>Our Neighbours here all day do tittle tattle,</l>
            <l>And talk of nothing else but Bloud and Battle;</l>
            <l>Were you at home, you could not chuse but laugh</l>
            <l>To hear 'em crack and bounce, now they are safe:</l>
            <l>Perhaps when three or four of them are met,</l>
            <l>And round about a Kitchin-Table set,</l>
            <l>There's such a Noise, a Clutter, and a Din,</l>
            <l>The Rebel <hi>Scots</hi> are routed o're agen.</l>

            <l>Then laugh'd, and turn'd aside, and ruin'd all:</l>
            <l>Tho' 'tis no laughing matter, for I own</l>
            <l>I love the very Ground thou tread'st upon.</l>
            <l>I'll tell thee, <hi>Poll,</hi> and mark me what I say,</l>
            <l>If Love thou Sullenly dost disobey,</l>

'Hath sworn, (tho' to your Father I am wed,)</l>

            <l>'Tis true, your strength is great, his only Art,</l>

            <l>What need I use these words? dear <hi>Polly</hi>—come</l>
            <l>Let us embrace, your Father's not at home.</l>
            <l>You know my Reputation's very great,</l>
            <l>Whoo'd guess that You and I shou'd do the feat.</l>
            <l>Oh how I'm stung, I have as little Ease,</l>

Or who can call't a Sin when we have done,</l>

            <l>Nay—if his Lady too should give consent,</l>

            <l>She shall my Mistress be, and I'll be yours.</l>
            <l>Under a hedge I'll squat down like a Hare,</l>

Sometimes upon a Horse I'll get astride,</l>

            <l>For all our Generation have been so,</l>

            <l>She went away with <hi>Iupiter</hi> at Random.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Pasiphae</hi> my Mother was so full</l>
            <l>Of strange Vagaries, that she suck'd a Bull.</l>
            <l>My Husband with my Sister lay—or rather</l>
            <l>I should have told you that it was your Father.</l>
            <l>Poor <hi>Adne</hi> was stark mad for him, and now</l>
            <l>I am (God knows) as mad in Love with you.</l>
            <l>So that between the Father and the Son,</l>
            <l>There are two Sisters like to be undone.</l>
            <l>I never shall forget with what a Grace</l>
            <l>You drest your self in order for the chase;</l>
            <l>Your Visage not too red, but only tan'd,</l>
            <l>Of the same colour with your brawny hand.</l>

An ancient Bever on your head you put,</l>
            <l>Like a three—Pegeon Pye, in corners cut.</l>
            <l>A little Jacket made of blewish green,</l>
            <l>Which had the Death of many a Badger seen.</l>
            <l>Your hair your own, which shew'd you not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd,</l>
            <l>Not nicely trim'd, for here and there 'twas notch'd.</l>
            <l>I hate your Fellows with your powder'd Wigs,</l>
            <l>As m' Husband us'd to say, they look like Prigs.</l>
            <l>You'd lasting Breeches made of Buckskin Leather,</l>
            <l>To keep the fundamental parts from weather.</l>
            <l>But when you reach'd your hanger from the Bed,</l>
            <l>Another Weapon came into my head.</l>
            <l>Not all your dayes can give you such delight,</l>
            <l>Or half the Sport I'll shew you in a Night.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Delia</hi>'s your Joy, <hi>Delia</hi> does you bewitch;</l>
            <l>Can you neglect a Christian, for a Bitch?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Cephalus</hi> your Companion and old Crony,</l>

            <l>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:65089:51"/>
Hee'd get upon a Horse, though half asleep,</l>
            <l>Ready to hunt before the Day did peep;</l>
            <l>But when h'ad once tasted <hi>Aurora</hi>'s sweets,</l>
            <l>He found out better Game between the sheets;</l>
            <l>For then unless she pleas'd, he durst not say,</l>
            <l>(Nor did he wish) that it would e're be day.</l>
            <l>Why should not we consent to try our skill?</l>
            <l>I'm certain you and I can do as well.</l>
            <l>Therefore dear <hi>Poll,</hi> I offer very fair,</l>
            <l>Under <hi>Barn-Elmes</hi> I'll meet you if you dare;</l>
            <l>Since none but Countrey Sports can humour you,</l>
            <l>I'll wrastle wi' you there a fall or two;</l>
            <l>Though o' my Conscience I believe you'l throw me,</l>
            <l>But if you shou'd, perhaps it won't undo me;</l>
            <l>And when you have me down among the Trees,</l>
            <l>You wanton Rogue, you may do what you please.</l>
            <l>Wee'd no such opportunity before:</l>
            <l>Your Father is at <hi>London</hi> with his Whore.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:65089:52"/>
Therefore I think 'tis but a just design,</l>
            <l>To cuckold him, and pay him in his coin.</l>
            <l>Besides, he ne're was marry'd to your Mother,</l>
            <l>He first whor'd her, and then he took another,</l>
            <l>What kindness or respect ought we to have</l>
            <l>For such a Villain and perfidious Knave?</l>
            <l>This should not trouble, but provoke us rather</l>
            <l>With all the speed we can to lye together.</l>
            <l>I am no kin to you, nor you to me,</l>
            <l>They call it Incest but to terrifie.</l>
            <l>Lovers Embraces are Lascivious Tricks,</l>
            <l>'Mongst musty Puritans and Schismaticks.</l>
            <l>Did not our Master <hi>Iove</hi> chuse him a Mistress,</l>
            <l>Who should it be, but one of his own Sisters?</l>
            <l>There's no engendring can be truly good,</l>
            <l>But when we fancy that we 're of a blood.</l>
            <l>Under the names of Mother and of Son,</l>

All they will say, because I'm kind to thee,</l>

            <l>That you came wet and dripping from the chase.</l>
            <l>And I'd a mind to give you my warm place.</l>
            <l>I did not think to 've said so much in hast,</l>
            <l>But Love like Murther must come out at last:</l>
            <l>The Fort lyes open, therefore scorn it not,</l>
            <l>But come with speed, and enter on the spot;</l>
            <l>Let us imagine now the worst can happen;</l>
            <l>Suppose that you and I were taken napping;</l>
            <l>And <hi>Theseus</hi> sayes, Begone you filthy Whore;</l>
            <l>Away you Rogue, and so he shuts the door.</l>
            <l>

What if he does, why then for <hi>France</hi> with speed,</l>
            <l>We shall be there supply'd with all we need.</l>
            <l>My Father dwells at <hi>Paris</hi> in good credit,</l>
            <l>And well to pass is he, though I have said it;</l>
            <l>There he's well known as Beggar knows his dish,</l>
            <l>We'll live as bravely then as Heart can wish:</l>
            <l>Therefore make haste, dream not of any harms,</l>
            <l>Thou'lt be secure enough within my arms.</l>
            <l>When you go out, may you be sure of Game;</l>

               <p>
                  <hi>Paris</hi> had liv'd a great while in Obscurity, at last
being own'd by Alderman <hi>Priam</hi> a Rich Old Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen,
and receiv'd as his Son—he set up for a
Gentleman; but very well knowing he could not be
rightly accomplish'd without a Mistress, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Fame speak <hi>viva voce</hi> in the praise of one
<hi>Hellen,</hi> who liv'd somewhere in the <hi>North.</hi> He was
at her house receiv'd, and during the absence of
<hi>Menelaus</hi> her Husband, he endeavour'd to break
his Mind to her; but being not through-pac'd in
Gentility, his Modesty got the upper hand of his
inclination, therefore he presently had recourse to
his Pen, and writes her this conceited Lettter.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>FReely and from my heart without compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</l>
            <l>I wish all health and happiness to <hi>Hellen:</hi>
            </l>
            <l>For if you're Sick, I'm sure to suffer pain;</l>

I need not tell you that I'm off oth' hooks,</l>

            <l>May see I'm overgrown in the Green-sickness;</l>
            <l>So that upon the whole and perfect Matter,</l>
            <l>I am your Servant, but I seem your Daughter.</l>
            <l>I cou'd eat walls as well as white bread crum,</l>
            <l>But fear to eat you out of house and home.</l>
            <l>For this distemper I've read many Cures,</l>
            <l>But the sole power of healing must be Yours.</l>
            <l>Your Holiness (I cannot call you less,</l>
            <l>That doth on Earth perform such Miracles,)</l>
            <l>Your holiness I say within few Weeks,</l>
            <l>May fetch a lively colour in my Cheeks.</l>
            <l>But if we are too long e're we begin,</l>
            <l>I'm apt to fear it may corrupt within.</l>

            <l>She knoweth best what's good for you and me,</l>
            <l>She does command our Fates and Powers d'ye see.</l>

She did consent I should ascend my horse,</l>

            <l>Your Fame hath much out-sounded the Report.</l>

You're mine, what desperate mortal dares gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say't?</l>
            <l>Sure I may take my Planet's word for that.</l>

They told me they'd be judg'd alone by me,</l>
            <l>Which was the most deserving of the Three;</l>
            <l>The first would bribe me with a Purse of Gold;</l>
            <l>My Judgment's neither to be bought nor sold:</l>
            <l>The second offer'd me a Tilting Sword,</l>
            <l>Knowing I ne're would take an angry word:</l>
            <l>But sayes the third, and in my face she giggled,</l>
            <l>With such poor toyes you're not to be inveigled,</l>
            <l>But if you value me above the rest,</l>
            <l>Then know young—man, you are for ever blest.</l>

            <l>The Prize is yours, said I, you ought to take't,</l>
            <l>I kiss'd her lower Parts, and so I wak'd.</l>
            <l>My Dream is out, for thus I do explain it,</l>

            <l>They've Petticoats with Lace above their knees</l>
            <l>Of Gold and Silver, or of Point <hi>Veni-ce;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Cornets and lofty Tow'rs upon the head,</l>
            <l>And wondrous shapes of which you never read.</l>
            <l>How ill a Pinner with a narrow Lace,</l>
            <l>Becomes the Beauty of so bright a Face?</l>
            <l>A fairer Face no Mortal e're laid Lips to,</l>
            <l>And I believe there are not whiter Hips too.</l>
            <l>Too white to mingle with a Husband's thighes,</l>
            <l>When I but think of that, my flesh does rise.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="115" facs="tcp:65089:63"/>
When toward me sometimes a Glance does pass,</l>
            <l>Your poor Adorer looketh like an Ass.</l>
            <l>For if I should return you Look for Look,</l>
            <l>I fear your Husband would begin to smoak;</l>
            <l>And I'll behang'd, if ever <hi>Menelaus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>By any am'rous Look of mine, betray us;</l>
            <l>Were it not at your Table I'd abuse him,</l>
            <l>For thrusting his great Paw into your Bosom:</l>
            <l>That Warty Fist between your Breasts does seem</l>
            <l>Like a brown <hi>George</hi> dropt in a Bowl of Cream.</l>
            <l>I'm mad to see him draw his Chair so close,</l>
            <l>And kiss, and hugg you underneath my Nose.</l>
            <l>Then I go out, pretending to make Water,</l>
            <l>Seeming to take no notice of the Matter:</l>
            <l>To all true Hearts I drink a Cup of Wine,</l>
            <l>A Health' that does imply both yours and mine;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:65089:64"/>
Then seeming drunk, I tell some strange Romance,</l>
            <l>And lay the Scene in <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>France;</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Of some bright Lady, and her brisk—Gall—ant;</l>
            <l>By which two Lovers, you and I are meant.</l>
            <l>But, Madam, to write more of this were non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,</l>
            <l>My Planet h'as contriv'd the Bus'ness long-since;</l>
            <l>By curious search I something can discover,</l>
            <l>'Tis in your Blood—you're born to be a Lover.</l>

            <l>H'as she not been as good as ever struck?</l>
            <l>When s'had a lusty Youth between her thighs,</l>
            <l>What d'ee think? would <hi>Laeda</hi> cry to rise?</l>
            <l>Your Parents being as right as ever pist,</l>

But if you must be constant to one Man,</l>
            <l>With me to <hi>London</hi> make what hast you can.</l>
            <l>There wee'll provide a little Winter House,</l>
            <l>And you shall pass for my renowned Spouse.</l>
            <l>By what I see your Husband does approve,</l>
            <l>That in your Absence here I should make Love.</l>
            <l>Or wou'd he else have gone,—under pretence,</l>
            <l>To buy a Horse—a hundred miles from hence?</l>
            <l>The Bus'ness seems to me, as plain a case,</l>
            <l>As is the Nose upon your beauteous face.</l>
            <l>To let you know that I should be no clog,</l>
            <l>Did he not say, Love me and Love my Dog?</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Nelly,</hi> said he, be kind unto my Guest,</l>
            <l>And let his entertainment be the <hi>Best.</hi>

            <l>I presently his meaning understood,</l>

            <l>You see your Husband orders our affairs.</l>

            <head>HELLEN's Answer to PARIS.</head>
            <argument>
               <head>The ARGUMENT.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hellen</hi> having receiv'd his Letter, at first seems
wonderfully displeas'd at his Impudence, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting
a Lady of her unspotted fame; who was
bred and born in the Town where she liv'd, and was
never call'd Whore. At length the Storm's over,
and she Tacks about, giving him an assurance of
her readiness to comply, but doubts her Gallant
wo' not be constant. In plain English She's as wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
as He.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>YOur Letter's wrot in such a filthy stile,</l>
            <l>I did not think an answer worth my while,</l>
            <l>Till I consider'd you might offer vi'lence,</l>
            <l>And take advantage of a Woman's silence.</l>
            <l>I'm sure you have not wanted drink or food,</l>
            <l>I wonder in my heart you'll be so rude.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:65089:66"/>
'Tis sine y'saith—because you come from <hi>London,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>You think a Country Body must be run down.</l>
            <l>You of your Entertainment here may brag,</l>
            <l>You were not us'd as if you'd had the Plague.</l>
            <l>My Husband did receive you as a <hi>Friend,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>And wou'd you to his Wife now prove a <hi>Fiend?</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Perhaps you'll say of me, when you are gone,</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hellen!</hi> a Lady!—<hi>Hellen</hi>'s but a clown.</l>
            <l>I'll own the name, since you can say no more,</l>
            <l>I'd rather be a Clown, then call'd a Whore:</l>
            <l>Yet for all that, though I keep Cows and Daries,</l>
            <l>I can behave my self as well as <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Tho' I don't fleer like a young wanton Girle,</l>
            <l>Yet you shall seldom see me frown or snarle.</l>
            <l>Tho' you such breeding, and such manners own,</l>
            <l>Let me deal plainly w'ye—I think you've none.</l>
            <l>Or could you else believe me so untrue,</l>
            <l>To leave my Spouse, and run away with you?</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="121" facs="tcp:65089:66"/>
Because a Fellow once did pick me up,</l>
            <l>You think I'm to be stoln by every Fop.</l>
            <l>He knew not whether I was Man or Woman,</l>
            <l>But you conclude from thence that I am common.</l>
            <l>When he perceiv'd <hi>that I was none of those,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He very fairly brought me to my house.</l>
            <l>And since I'm gotten quit of Master <hi>Theseus,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Our <hi>Paris</hi> wou'd be nibbling too, God bless us!—</l>
            <l>Though by my Troth I cannot blame your Love<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </l>
            <l>If I were sure that you wou'd constant prove.</l>
            <l>Dy'e think I shou'd not be in dainty pickle.</l>
            <l>If I shou'd run away with one that's fickle?</l>
            <l>You urg'd to me th'example of my Mother,</l>
            <l>As if the Daughter shou'd be such another.</l>
            <l>You don't consider <hi>Laeda</hi> was betray'd,</l>
            <l>By one that courted her in Masquerade.</l>
            <l>She thought sh'ad met a harmless plume of feather,</l>
            <l>But at <hi>long-run</hi> he prov'd a Stallion rather.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:65089:67"/>
His Family's the best in all the County,</l>
            <l>All that you live by's, but a Trades-man's bounty.</l>
            <l>But that's all one, where ever Love prevails,</l>
            <l>Money's no more than paring of my Nails.</l>
            <l>Sometimes I think you love me when you look</l>
            <l>With Eyes unmov'd, just like a Pig that's stuck;</l>
            <l>And dabble with your fingers in my Palm,</l>
            <l>And use to call the moisture of it,—Balm.</l>
            <l>If in the Glass I leave a little drop,</l>
            <l>You'd say I'll drink your snuffs—and suck it up.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Hellen</hi> you carv'd with Penknife on the Gate,</l>
            <l>And I wrot <hi>Paris just a-top</hi> of that.</l>
            <l>These are shrewd signs of Love, and without doubt,</l>
            <l>You'd give a Leg or Arm to have a Bout.</l>
            <l>Tho' you are not the first Man by a hundred,</l>
            <l>That has seen me, and lov'd and gaz'd and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</l>
            <l>If you at first had come into our Town,</l>
            <l>And courted <hi>Hellen</hi> in a Grogram Gown,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:65089:67"/>
When I was but a silly Soul, God knows,</l>
            <l>You might have made a Bridge of <hi>Menel</hi>'s Nose.</l>
            <l>Now he commands in chief, your Suit is vain,</l>
            <l>To all true Lovers Marriage is a Bane.</l>
            <l>But why should <hi>Paris</hi> for a Mistress long,</l>
            <l>Since in your Sleep your Fancy is so strong?</l>
            <l>You can see three stark naked at a time,</l>
            <l>And take your choice of Beauty's in a dream:</l>
            <l>Yet you left Honour, Wealth, and God knows what.</l>
            <l>And all for me—a pretty fancy that.</l>
            <l>I know 'tis wheedle,—but if all were true,</l>
            <l>It is no more than I would do for you.</l>
            <l>You guess my want of Skill, by being so plain,</l>
            <l>For I'am not us'd to write to any Man,</l>
            <l>Except t' a Millener, (my Husband's Cozen)</l>
            <l>Who sends me Gloves,—and Ribbands by the dozen.</l>
            <l>Well—since it must be so—let's be discreet,</l>
            <l>Let not our Town take notice that we meet;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:65089:68"/>
For they suspect already you're a Wencher,</l>
            <l>There is not such a place on Earth for Censure.</l>
            <l>Yet I can't see, why we should be so nice,</l>
            <l>I like you—by my Husband's own advice.</l>
            <l>I cou'd not chuse but laugh to hear him say,</l>
            <l>Pray Love your Guest when I am gone away:</l>
            <l>And all the while that <hi>Menelaus</hi> tarries,</l>
            <l>You are committed to the charge of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The charge! Let us examine well the word,</l>
            <l>Whether he meant your charge at Bed and Board;</l>
            <l>Why should he not mean both as well as one?</l>
            <l>He knows—how much I hate to lye alone.</l>
            <l>In my weak Judgment, 'tis an easie Case,</l>
            <l>You are in all things to supply his place.</l>
            <l>But for the Mastership you're like to tug</l>
            <l>Before you have me at the closest hug.</l>
            <l>'Twill seem to me, if you some force do use,</l>
            <l>As if I had a Maidenhead to lose.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:65089:68"/>
Lord! how I write; if I were to be damn'd,</l>
            <l>I cou'd not say't—I should be so asham'd.</l>
            <l>If I consent I'll hold you any money,</l>
            <l>You'll serve me as you did you'r dear <hi>Oenone.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>She hop'd she should be wedded in the Church,</l>
            <l>Instead of that, you left her in the Lurch.</l>
            <l>But if we now were toward <hi>London</hi> jogging,</l>
            <l>'Tis ten to one some Puppy would be dogging,</l>
            <l>Or else some Neighbour on the Road wou'd stay us,</l>
            <l>And ask me after Mr. <hi>Menelaus.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Or we shall hear the Country-people say,</l>
            <l>Would you believe that she should run-away?</l>
            <l>Marry not hansome Wives by this Example,</l>
            <l>Since pritty Mistress <hi>Hellen's</hi> on the Ramble.</l>
            <l>I'm strangely afraid of seeing Mr. <hi>Priam,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>How I shall tremble when he asks whom I—am.</l>
            <l>Tho' for my Life I shall not hold from Laughter,</l>
            <l>If <hi>Hecuba</hi> should say—Your Servant Daughter.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="126" facs="tcp:65089:69"/>
But above All 'tis <hi>Hector</hi> that I dread,</l>
            <l>That <hi>Hector</hi> certainly will break my Head.</l>
            <l>Who'd think you two from the same Mother came,</l>
            <l>Hee's like a Lyon, you are like a Lamb.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Hector</hi> prosper with his senseless hussing,</l>
            <l>'Tis <hi>knowing nothing now</hi> that makes a Russian.</l>
            <l>While <hi>Paris</hi> shall be skill'd in Lovers Arts,</l>
            <l>And dive into our Sexes secret Parts;</l>
            <l>Now you begin to think 'tis ten to one,</l>
            <l>Your Suit is granted, and the Bus'ness done.</l>
            <l>But not so fast,—consult my Friend <hi>Clymene,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>No doubt—you'l make the Bus'ness up between ye.</l>
            <l>I'm loath to say't my self, she knows my mind,</l>
            <l>And she can tell you how I am enclin'd.</l>
            <l>When she informs you what must be transacted,</l>
