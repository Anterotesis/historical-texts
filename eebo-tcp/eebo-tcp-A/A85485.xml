            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It was an eſpecial evidence of Gods good providence,

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:113218:6"/>
two ſorts of people, impious and pious. The impious were
openly prophane, and impenitently obſtinate, or covertly
hypocriticall and deceitfull. The pious were righteous,
upright and humble. In which reſpect his prophecies
were of a mixed kinde.<note place="margin">Different ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</note> In regard of the former ſort, he
had ſuch a ſpirit as was given to <hi>Boanerges,</hi> ſonnes of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

in regard of the later, he had ſuch a ſpirit as was given to

Hereby the obſtinate were the more terrified and
kept down; the humble and penitent were ſupported.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of conſolation did ſweetly breathe forth in
this Chapter, out of which I have taken my text. It is full
of very comfortable promiſes.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of it,<note place="margin">The ſumme of the Chapter.</note> he pointeth at the inſultations of
enemies againſt the Church of God in their troubles: with
which weak ſpirits uſe much to be perplexed. The Lord
therefore to keep their ſpirits from fainting, by this his
Prophet maketh known before hand the good which he
intended unto them. Many particular promiſes are ſet
down, both before and after my text; but the ſumme of
them all is couched in theſe words, <hi>I will dot better unto you
then at your beginnings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> is ſo excellent in compounding words, as it
compriſeth the ten words of my text in two, which are
theſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> word for word, <hi>I will doe good
above your beginnings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt word compriſeth under it all the bleſſings
which God intended for his Church, not of Jews only,
but of Gentiles alſo, and that from time to time; even
from their return out of captivity, till the comming of
Chriſt; not in the fleſh only, but in glory alſo. The later
word noting out a compariſon between times and times,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:113218:7"/>
hath relation to all the former ages of the Church, even
unto thoſe very times of their great troubles.</p>
            <p>The main ſcope of all is,<note place="margin">The ſcope of the text.</note> to ſet out</p>

I will ſettle, and will doe;</hi> that is, <hi>and I will doe.</hi> In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
verſe the perſon intended is plainly expreſſed to be
the <hi>Lord God.</hi> And in the next clauſe after my text,
the <hi>Lord Jehovah</hi> is expreſſed. For where this word LORD
is ſet down in four Capitall letters, it ſets out <hi>Jehovah.</hi>

<hi>David</hi> ſpeaking to the Lord of his goodneſſe,<note place="margin">Pſalm 119. 68.</note> thus ſaith,

came down from the Lords Sanctuary, and increaſed

from middle-deep, to an impaſſible river. In this

            <p>Time will not ſuffer me diſtinctly and fully to handle
all theſe points; neither indeed is it needfull; for the laſt
compriſeth all the other under it: which will the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
if we do ſomewhat more largely expreſſe it, thus;
<hi>The Lord hath provided his better things for the later times of

<hi>the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The <hi>Act</hi> of goodnes flowing from him, in this word,

upon the laſt Doctrine. You heard it before, hear it again,
<hi>God hath provided his better things for the later times of his

            <p>The Teſtament given to the Chriſtian Church is a <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <note place="margin">1. Better Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Heb. 7. 22. Heb. 9. 15.</note> It is made by the Sonne of God, <hi>Immanuel,</hi>
God with us, and ratified by his death, wherein an <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall

            <p>1.<note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Heb. 9. 17.</note> A <hi>Covenant</hi> is an agreement between two: a <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

            <p>2. The two between whom a <hi>Covenant</hi> paſſeth muſt be
both living: a <hi>Testament</hi> receiveth force by the death of
him that made it.</p>
            <p>3. A <hi>Covenant</hi> is ratified by the mutuall conſent of both

            <p>4. A <hi>Covenant</hi> uſeth to be made upon conditions on
both parts: a <hi>Teſtament</hi> is made upon the meer favour and
grace of the teſtatour.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Covenant</hi> made with Chriſtians is better then
the two former <hi>Covenant:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two old Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants.</note> both called old, becauſe they
are both in ſuch reſpects nulled.</p>
            <p>The firſt was a <hi>Covenant</hi> of works made with man in
his entire eſtate: which by his fall he made impoſſible for
man to keep.<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> But this <hi>Covenant</hi> giveth ability to keep it
with much alacrity.</p>
            <p>2. There was a <hi>Covenant</hi> indeed of grace made with the
Church before Chriſt exhibited; but ſet out in ſuch ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure

of the <hi>Promiſes</hi> before Chriſt exhibited were of temporall

ſpirituall and heavenly good things, are more expreſſely,

wherein the Promiſes are better. Chriſtians may more

and heavenly bleſſings, then they that lived before Chriſt
could.</p>

Yet further, as if ordinary words and uſuall compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> day laſted from <hi>Noah</hi> to <hi>Abraham:</hi> wherein
the Church had that memorable type of Gods preſerving
it out of that common deluge which deſtroyed the whole
world beſides. This type was the <hi>Arke.</hi> This the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
calls, in relation to Baptiſme, <hi>a like figure.</hi> For it did
lively ſet forth to the Church ſuch a preſervation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:113218:12"/>
from ſinne and deſtruction, as Baptiſme doth.
In this reſpect a more expreſſe evidence of Gods goodnes
was given in this day, then in the former.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> day was from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>David,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3.</note> wherein
that precious and expreſſe promiſe of bleſſing all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, was made: wherein alſo <hi>Iſrael</hi> was
brought out of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> bondage, (a type of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption
of the Church from her ſpiritual bondage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſinne and Satan.) In this day the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> with
the many other types of Chriſt, his offices and benefits to
his Church were firſt ordained, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſetled in the
land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> a type of their heavenly reſt. Thus did
this third day farre exceed the former in glory.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> was from <hi>David</hi> to the carrying of <hi>Iſrael</hi> into
captivity.<note place="margin">4.</note> Herein a royall government was given to Gods
people (a type of Chriſts royall Kingdome.) Herein moſt
of the extraordinary Prophets (ſpeciall types of Chriſts
propheticall office) were raiſed up: and moſt cleare prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
made of the better things to come in the Chriſtian
Church. Herein alſo <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was built, and
ſundry new and more glorious types of Chriſt were made,
then in the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi> So much therefore as this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of <hi>Solomon</hi> excelled the Tabernacle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the
Cherubins, Tables, Altars, Pillars, and all manner of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
inſtruments in the Temple, ſurpaſſed them that were
in the Tabernacle: ſo much more did Gods goodneſſe in
this day exceed the goodneſſe of former dayes.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fifth</hi> day was from <hi>Iſraels</hi> going into captivity to
<hi>Chriſts</hi> aſcenſion into Heaven.<note place="margin">5.</note> This day, for the greateſt
part thereof, was indeed a diſmall day. Yet the delivering
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> captivity, was a more cleare
and full type of our redemption by Chriſt, then any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
deliverance:<note place="margin">Ier. 16. 14, 15.</note> whereupon it is ſaid, <hi>It ſhall no more be ſaid,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:113218:12"/>
The Lord liveth that brought the children of Iſrael up out of
the land of Egypt: but the Lord liveth that brought
up the children of Iſrael from the lands of the North,
and from all the land whither he had driven them.</hi>
The re-edifying of the Temple, was alſo a principall
type of Chriſts reſurrection: and of this Temple it is
ſaid,<note place="margin">Hag. 2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>The glory of this later houſe, ſhall be greater then of
the former:</hi> ſo as theſe added much to the glory of this day.
But in that the Lord Chriſt was in the evening of this day
actually exhibited: and the things accompliſhed, which
were perfigured by the legall types, and fore-told by the
ancient Prophets, the goodneſſe of God manifeſted in this
day, farre exceeded that which was in former dayes. In
this reſpect it is ſaid of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> who ſaw and made
known that promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and was the firſt that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
pointed him out,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1. 29, 36. Mat. 11. 11.</note> ſaying, <hi>Behold the Lambe of God:</hi>
Of him it is ſaid, <hi>among them that are borne of women, there
hath not riſen a greater.</hi> This was the ſurpaſſing glory of
the fifth day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſixth</hi> was from Chriſts aſcenſion into Heaven,<note place="margin">6.</note> to
his ſecond comming unto judgement. This is the day of
the cleare and full revelation of all the glorious myſteries
that were hidden from the beginning of the world till
then. This is the day wherein all the forementioned new
things, and better things were conferred upon the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church. In this day, as better things ſhall not be
given, ſo better things cannot be expected while the
world laſteth.<note place="margin">Pſal. 118. 24.</note> This is the day whereof we may ſay, <hi>This
is the day which the Lord hath made: we will rejoyce and be
glad in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus from this exemplification of the increaſe of Gods
goodneſſe in the ſeverall ages of the world, we may well
inferre, that <hi>God hath provided better things for the later
times.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:113218:13"/>
            <p>Queſtionleſſe, God thus ordereth his good providence
upon juſt and weighty reaſons:<note place="margin">Reaſons of Gods increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing goodneſſe.</note> and though his counſell
be unſearchable, and his waies paſt finding out, in regard
of the full latitude of them, yet hath he left ſome foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps;
wherein and whereby we may obſerve ſome grounds
of his wiſe proceedings therein. Among others, I ſuppoſe,
theſe may be ſome.</p>
            <p>1. That the extent of his goodneſſe may be more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly
conſidered,<note place="margin">1 Extent of goodneſſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſcerned.</note> more clearly diſcerned, and more
tranſcendently admired. Gods governing of his Church
in the world by his providence, is ordered in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
as his prudence in creating the world was manifeſted.</p>
            <p>In that <hi>first</hi> great work,<note place="margin">Gods works better &amp; better.</note> he ſtill put off the better things
to the later daies. He could, if it had pleaſed him, have
created all the things that he did create, at once. Had he
at once ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, firmament, waters, earth, all
manner of trees, and herbs bearing ſeed, Sunne, Moon and Stars,
fowls, fiſhes, beasts and man,</hi> they had inſtantly been all;
but voluntarily and purpoſely he took up ſix daies in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
them, and in each day made ſeverall and diſtinct
creatures, but ever the better, for the reaſon before ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.
This will evidently appear by an induction of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,
which follow in order.</p>
            <p>1. The <hi>light</hi> which he created in the <hi>firſt</hi> day,<note place="margin">The firſt daies work.</note> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a glorious creature. But either it was the element of
fire (for no where elſe we read of creating fire) or elſe it
was ſome other light, which was of uſe but for three daies:
for in the fourth day thoſe lights were made, which have
hitherto continued, and ſhall continue to the worlds end.
So as either this light was annihilated, when thoſe were
made, or elſe it was ſetled in the body of the Sun.</p>
            <p>2. In the <hi>ſecond</hi> day the <hi>firmament</hi> or air was made,<note place="margin">The ſecond daies work.</note> and
called heaven: then alſo were the ſeas and earth made. If

            <p>3. In the <hi>third</hi> day all the <hi>graſse</hi> and <hi>herb yeelding ſeed,</hi>
and the <hi>tree yeelding fruit</hi> after his kinde were made. Theſe
being vegitable creatures,<note place="margin">The third daies work.</note> by reaſon of that life which is in
them, excelled the former.</p>
            <p>4. In the <hi>fourth</hi> day the hoſt of heaven was made.<note place="margin">The fourth daies work.</note> This
daies work in the glory and immutability of it, and in the
conſtant perpetuall motion, running moſt ſwiftly round
about the world every day, without waſting or wearineſſe,
excelled all that went before.</p>
            <p>5. In the <hi>fift</hi> day all the fowl of heaven,<note place="margin">The fifth daies work.</note> and fiſh in the
ſea were created. Theſe having life and ſenſe in them,
and voluntarily moving from place to place, ſurpaſſed the

            <p>6. In the <hi>ſixth</hi> day,<note place="margin">The ſixth daies work.</note> beſides other creatures living on
the earth, <hi>Man</hi> was made: Man, in the image of God. This
was Gods maſter-piece, and reſerved unto the laſt work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
day. By this diſtinct encreaſe of Gods goodneſſe,
God comes the more to be admired, and his wiſdom,
power and other excellencies the better diſcerned. The
like courſe therefore God took in his providence.</p>
            <p>2. God provides better things for the later times,<note place="margin">2 Better things put off, to make them more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed. Mat. 13. 17.</note> to

It is ſaid, <hi>That many Prophets and righteous men deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to ſee and hear the things which were ſeen and heard in

               <hi>when
it teſtified before hand the ſufferings of Christ, and the glorie
that ſhould follow.</hi> Certainly the putting off the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the exhibition of Chriſt to the later times, made it
to be the more deſired, and the better eſteemed. When
he was exhibited, the Angel that brought the firſt tidings

the honour of his Son.</p>
            <p>Hitherto of the Doctrinall part of my Text.<note place="margin">Uſes of Gods encreaſing goodneſſe.</note> It is time
to come to the Application thereof. The Uſes of Gods
providence in reſerving better things to the later times, are
of manifold and ſingular Uſe. For,</p>
            <p>1. It affords a Demonſtration of the deteſtableneſſe of
the Romiſh religion,<note place="margin">1 Popery makes the laſt daies worſt.</note> which hath directly perverted the
fore-mentioned courſe of Gods providence to his Church.
For, where God provides better for the later times, they
make theſe later times to be farre the worſe. As they han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
the matter, their Church under the Goſpel is many
waies in a worſe caſe then the ſtate of the Church was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law. Among many other inſtances I will note on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
four.</p>
            <p>1. Their publike reading of Gods Word,<note place="margin">1 An unknown tongue leſſe underſtood than types. Bellarm. <hi>de ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Sacr. l. 2. c.</hi> 31.</note> adminiſtring
the Sacraments, praying and performing other divine
ſervices in an unknown tongue, make the myſteries of the
Goſpel leſſe intelligible, more obſcure, and every way
leſſe edifying then all the rites, types and ſhadows under
the Law did.<note place="margin">Rhem. <hi>Annot.</hi> on 1 Cor. 14.</note> 
               <hi>Except ye utter by the tongue words eaſie to be
understood, how ſhall it be known what is ſpoken? for ye ſhall
ſpeak into the air,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And again, <hi>If I know
not the meaning of the voice, I ſhall be unto him that ſpeaketh
a Barbarian, and he that ſpeaketh ſhall be a Barbarian un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Their unbloudy Sacrifice (as they ſtile it) of a feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
tranſubſtantiated body,<note place="margin">2 Popiſh ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice worſe then legall.</note> is farre worſe then if they had
ſuch Sacrifices of beaſts and fowls, as were under the
Law. Thoſe ſacrifices, at that time, did ſet out the vertue
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:113218:15"/>
of Chriſts death, and nouriſh their faith and hope in the
benefits thereof.<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. Decret 10. c. 2. <hi>Bellarm.</hi> de Miſſ. l. 1. c. 5. &amp; 12. &amp; l. 2. c. 7.</note> But the fore-ſaid Popiſh ſacrifice would
take away the vertue and efficacy of Chriſts ſacrifice, if it
could be taken away. For I demand, whether the ſacrifice
that they pretend to offer up, be the very ſame, that
Chriſt himſelf offered upon the croſſe. If they ſay, the
ſame, what need is there that it ſhould be offered up
again?<note place="margin">Heb. 7. 27. and 9. 26, 28 and 10. 10. Heb. 7. 11, &amp;c.</note> Was not Chriſts once offering of it up ſufficient?
The Apoſtle doth aſſuredly intend as much by his frequent
mention of this word <hi>once,</hi> which is excluſively to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken:
once for all, and not to be reiterated. If it be another
ſacrifice, then the ſacrifice of Chriſt was not perfect. For
hereby the Apoſtle proveth the Prieſthood of the Law to
be unperfect; becauſe another was to ſucceed in the room
of it. Whereas ſome ſay, that their offering up of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Chriſt, is but by way of application; that ſeems to
contradict their own poſition; for they teach that the
fore-mentioned tranſubſtantiated body, offered up by a
Prieſt, is a <hi>true, reall, propitiatory ſacrifice for the quick and
dead.</hi> Beſides, the end of Chriſts interceſſion, and the
vertue thereof is made void by that which is avouched of
the applicatory vertue of their ſacrifice. For the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
application of Chriſts own ſacrifice, is the end of
Chriſts interceſſion. They think to evade all theſe abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities
by a diſtinction betwixt a bloody and unbloody ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,
ſaying, that the ſacrifice which Chriſt himſelf
offered up was a bloudy ſacrifice, but that which they offer
up, unbloody. To this diſtinction I anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. It's without any warrant or ground from Scripture.</p>
            <p>2. It being applied, according to their poſition, to one
and the ſame thing (for they ſay that the body of Chriſt,
which their Prieſt offereth up, is the very ſame that Chriſt
offered upon the croſſe) it implieth contradictory terms,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:113218:15"/>
namely, that the ſame thing ſhould be bloody and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloody.</p>
            <p>3. According to their own poſition, their ſacrifice can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be unbloody: for they hold that the wine is tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated
into blood, as well as the bread into a body,
and both make one ſacrifice. How can that be unbloody,
which conſiſts of bloud? Yea, of blood poured out, as
their wine is into the chalice, and out of the chalice into
the Prieſts mouth.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 22.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4. If it be unbloody,<note place="margin">3 Popiſh pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance more heavie then le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall.</note> it hath no vertue for the taking away
of ſin: For <hi>without ſhedding of blood is no remiſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. The third inſtance of their making the ſtate of the
Chriſtian Church worſe then of the Jewiſh,<note place="margin">Alij degentes in remotis &amp; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditu locis ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li ſingulas cellas veluti ſepulchro, inhabitant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Annonam totius bebdomadae Sabbato accipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt, ac omnimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de humanae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolationis exper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, <hi>&amp;c</hi> Alij an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tris, ſpeluncis, parietibus ſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludunt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Sune etiam qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſqualores ſolitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum requaru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, beſtiale feraru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> conſortium non pertimeſcunt, &amp;c. <hi>Otho.</hi> Friſinginſ. l 1. cap. 35.</note> is their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable
and inhumane penance (which oft they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn

courſes, whereunto they perſwademen upon pretence of
merit and perfection. They have in theſe caſes ſome
whom they ſtile <hi>Eremites,</hi> who live in remote places from
all ſociety, and feed upon ſuch fruit, roots, and other
things that the earth bringeth forth, lodging in Caves,
Dens or Cellars, digged out of the ground. Others they
call <hi>Anchorites,</hi> who live encloſed betwixt walls, and on
the Sabbath receive their ſuſtenance for the whole week.
Others they either enjoy, or perſwade to whip their naked
backs with ſcourges of cords, wyers, and ſharp rundals,
till the blood run down, and skin and fleſh be torn from
their backs. Others muſt lie in ſhirts of hair cloth. Others
go bare foot and bare legged to ſuch and ſuch ſhrines. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
undertake long pilgrimages to remote lands; nay, they
ſtick not to ſend a Queen to Tiburn upon penance. Did
the Law ever impoſe ſuch hard tasks upon any that were
under the pedagogy thereof?<note place="margin">4 Popiſh cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies more burdenſome then legall.</note>
            </p>
            <p>4. The laſt inſtance that I will give of putting an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier

and intolerable rites, which on meer humane inventions
are obtruded upon their people. Theſe muſt needs be
heavier burdens then the rites of the Law, in three reſpects
eſpecially.</p>
            <p>1. In that they lie as dead things on mens ſhoulders,
which make them the heavier. The life of rites in Gods
ſervice, conſiſteth in divine inſtitution, and warrantable
ſignification. But Popiſh rites are neither inſtituted of
God, nor have any warrantable ſignification, whereupon
he that uſeth them may reſt. The rites of the Law had
both their inſtitution and ſignification from God.</p>
            <p>2. There is no ſet ſtint of them. For mans inventions
are endleſſe. They have no ſet and certain rule to be order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and moderated by. But God ſet down a diſtinct num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of rites to the Jews, whereunto there was no need to
adde any other.</p>
            <p>3. When all is done that can be done about the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid
Popiſh rites, they can give no ſound ſatisfaction to
the conſcience. If the doers thereof ſhould plead them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
God, what other anſwer could they receive, but this,
<hi>Who hath required this at your hand?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 12. Mat. 15. 9.</note> Or thus, <hi>In vain they
worſhip me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid in manifeſting the wrong,
which in this kinde our Adverſaries doe to the Chriſtian
Church, and in manifeſting the blindeneſſe of thoſe, that
ſuffer themſelves to beled with ſuch blinde guides. Bleſſed

            <p>Of ſuch I demand, whether it be a good, uſefull, and

ſuch Governours, or no. Surely, me thinks neither of

are needfull and uſefull, and ſo good in their ſeverall
ſphears? And ſhall the beſt Society on earth, the militant
Church, be without Eccleſiaſticall Governours, proper
and peculiar to it? I ſuppoſe none will deny, but that the
Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had ſuch Governours: inſtance their

from the continuall encreaſe of Gods providence, in ſuch
ſad, doubtfull, dangerous daies, as theſe our daies are.
For we may with confidence expect better things. The
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:113218:19"/>
daies wherein the Prophet firſt uttered this prophecy were
worſe daies then ours are; and to comfort the faithfull
that then lived, and ſuch others as ſhould from age to age
live after them, he revealed this promiſe. There are more
particular promiſes concerning a future glory of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Church, ſet down by the Prophets in the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and by Chriſt and his Apoſtles in the new, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the book of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> then we have either
heard of, or ſeen in our daies to be accompliſhed. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
City deſcribed, <hi>Revel. 21. 10, &amp;c.</hi> is by many judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Divines taken for a type of a ſpirituall, glorious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
of the Church of Chriſt under the Goſpel yet to
come, and that before his laſt comming to judgement. I
paſſe by all conceits of our later <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> or <hi>Millenaries,</hi>
(whom in Engliſh we may call <hi>Thouſandaries</hi>) who ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
that Chriſt ſhall perſonally come down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
in that nature in which after his reſurrection he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
into heaven, and raign here a thouſand years with
his Saints. The certainty of this I leave to be proved by
them who are the broachers thereof. But this is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
that there are yet better things to come then have
been ſince the firſt calling of the Gentiles.<note place="margin">The Jews to be recalled.</note> Among
other better things to come, the <hi>recalling of the Jews</hi> is moſt
clearly and plentifully fore told by the Prophets. Many
apply ſundry prophecies that tend that way, to the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Jews from the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity; and others,
to the ſpirituall <hi>Iſrael,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Gentiles.</hi> But aſſuredly
ſuch prophecies as fore-tell the re-uniting of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim</hi>
together, have eſpeciall reference to the fore-ſaid
<hi>recalling of the Jews:</hi> as that Parable, whereof this our
Prophet maketh mention, about joyning two ſticks, on
the one whereof was written,<note place="margin">Ezek. 37. 16, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>For Judah, and for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael his companions:</hi> and on the other, <hi>For Joſeph
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:113218:20"/>
the ſtick of Ephraim, and for all the houſe of Iſrael his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</hi>
That Parable the Prophet thus applieth, <hi>I will make
them one Nation, and one King ſhall be King to them all,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if any ſhall queſtion this and other prophecies of the
ancient Prophets. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſo expreſly
fore-told a <hi>recalling of the Jews,</hi> and thereupon, <hi>a bringing in
a fullneſs of the Gentiles,</hi> as no queſtion can be made thereof:
and he doth after ſuch a manner expreſſe theſe, as appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
declareth a future glory of the Chriſtian Church.
Some particular expreſſions of his in the 11. to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
are theſe.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. Having propounded this Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Jews, <hi>Have they ſtumbled, that they ſhould fall?</hi>
(namely, totally and finally, never to be raiſed again.) He
gives this anſwer, <hi>God forbid.</hi> Whereby he implieth, that
aſſuredly they ſhall be raiſed again, that is, they ſhall be
made a viſible Church of Chriſt, and ſubmit themſelves
to his ordinances.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 12. This ſuppoſition, <hi>If the fall of them be rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
of the world, and the diminiſhing of them the riches of the
Gentiles: how much more their fullneſſe?</hi> By their fullneſſe,
he meaneth their bringing them in to the Church of
Chriſt, conſiſting of <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and thereby making that
Church full, when both <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> ſhall be joyned
together.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 15. This Queſtion (<hi>What ſhall the receiving of
them be but life from the dead?</hi>) doth take it for grant, that
they ſhall be received, and taken into the Church of Chriſt;
and that this reſtauration of theirs will be as a new glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
reſurrection.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 23. It is ſaid, <hi>They alſo ſhall be graffed in;</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
into the body of the Chriſtian Church; and a proof
thereof is taken from Gods omnipotency, <hi>For God is able to
graff them in again.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:113218:20"/>
            <p>5. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 24. This emphaticall Interrogation, <hi>How
much more ſhall theſe, which be the naturall branches, he graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
into their own Olive-tree?</hi> doth put it out of all queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that the Jews ſhall again be brought to be of the true
Church, which is the Olive-tree here intended.</p>
            <p>6. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 25. This reſtrictive particle, <hi>In part (blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in part is happened unto Iſrael</hi>) doth import, that they
ſhall not be <hi>finally</hi> blinded, but that at length they ſhall
come to have their eyes ſo opened, as they ſhall know and
believe in Jeſus Chriſt. This is further manifeſted by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the period of this limitation, thus, <hi>Vntill the
fulneſse of the Gentiles be come in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>7. <hi>Verſe</hi> 26. This generall phraſe; <hi>All Iſrael ſhall be
ſaved,</hi> ſheweth, that there is a time to come, when not
only two or three, or a few <hi>Jews</hi> here and there thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Chriſtian Church (as have been in all ages there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of)
but the whole Nation ſhall be called.</p>
            <p>8. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 31. This phraſe, <hi>Through your mercy they alſo
may obtain mercy;</hi> ſheweth, that God purpoſely ſuffered
them ſometime to abide in unbelief, that when they ſhould
be brought to believe, this grace and honour might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to ariſe from Gods meer mercy and free grace. The
words following in the next verſe doe ſhew as much:
They are theſe, <hi>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief,
that he might have mercy upon all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee that there is a calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> to come,
and that their calling ſhall be as a reſurrection from the
dead, as an inciſion of many more branches into a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
tree, that it ſhall be an univerſall, conſpicuous calling
of a whole Nation, wherein the freeneſſe and largeneſſe
of Gods grace and mercy ſhall be evidently manifeſted.
At which time there ſhall be alſo ſuch a number of <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi>
brought in, as may well be called the <hi>fulneſſe of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:113218:21"/>
Gentiles,</hi> verſ. 25. This certainly ſhall be a moſt glorious
condition of the Chriſtian Church, and this is yet to
come: therefore God will yet doe better things for us. In
expectation whereof we may comfort our ſelves, though
for a while thick clouds of troubles doe over-ſpread the
face of the Church, and ſomewhat eclipſe the glorious
brightneſſe thereof.</p>
            <p>Yea further,<note place="margin">The better things given to Jews.</note> we may expect better things then yet we
doe enjoy, upon the fore-mentioned progreſſe of Gods
good providence, before that glorious calling of the <hi>Jews</hi>
be accompliſhed. For the <hi>Jews,</hi> after this promiſe made,
before the firſt comming of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and calling of the
<hi>Gentiles,</hi> had conferred upon them many better things
then before. They were brought out of Captivity to their
own Land. A ſecond Temple was built. The Law was
reſtored unto them by <hi>Ezra,</hi> and many other bleſſings. So
after Chriſts firſt comming, the Goſpel was preached in
many Nations, multitudes of Churches were erected and
eſtabliſhed, the Goſpel confirmed by many undaunted
Martyrs. Yea, after much perſecution, the Church had
great reſt and liberty in <hi>Conſtantines,</hi> and other Chriſtian
<hi>Emperours</hi> times. And though that reſt and liberty were
in time exceedingly abuſed, by the ambition of Prelates,
which at length brought it to the height of Papacy, yet
God by a Reformation in theſe later times, ſhewed that he
was mindefull of this his promiſe, and did better things for
her then before.</p>
            <p>This may further be exemplified by Gods doing better
for us here in <hi>England</hi> then at our beginnings.<note place="margin">Better things to Chriſtians.</note> For as the
thick dark cloud of <hi>Antichriſtianiſme</hi> over-ſpread the skie
of the whole Chriſtian Church for many years together,
ſo did it clean keep away the bright ſhining of the Goſpel
from <hi>England.</hi> But it pleaſed God almoſt three hundred
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:113218:21"/>
years agoe,<note place="margin">Light held forth by <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff.</hi>
               </note> in the raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, to raiſe up
<hi>John Wickliff,</hi> a Profeſſour at <hi>Oxford,</hi> to hold out the light
of the Goſpel, ſo as many in thoſe daies were much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
thereby.</p>
            <p>Among other principles wherein he inſtructed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
theſe were ſome.</p>
            <p>1. The Euchariſt,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Wickliffs</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles.</note> after conſecration, is not the very bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of Chriſt, but figuratively.</p>
            <p>2. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not the head of all Churches,
more then any Church is. Nor hath <hi>Peter</hi> any more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
given of Chriſt, then any other Apoſtle hath.</p>
            <p>3. The <hi>Pope</hi> of <hi>rome</hi> hath no more in the keyes of
the Church, then any other within the order of Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>4. The Goſpel is a rule ſufficient of it ſelf to rule
the life of every Chriſtian man here, without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rule.</p>
            <p>5. All other rules, under whoſe obſervances divers
religious perſons be governed, doe adde no more perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the Goſpel, then doth the white colour to the
wall.</p>
            <p>Theſe and other like poſitions wrought ſo effectually
upon the hearts of noble and mean perſons, as this may be
accounted a good beginning, wherein many rejoyced; but
no publike reformation was wrought thereupon.</p>
            <p>About an hundred and fifty years after, the Lord did
better then at that beginning.<note place="margin">Popes ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie caſt down.</note> For he ſtirred up both <hi>King</hi>

King, by vertue thereof, ſent out injunctions for removing

images, reading the holy Scriptures, and performing all
divine Service in Engliſh: preaching Gods Word, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing

as the Goſpel began to ſhine forth ſomewhat brightly in
<hi>England.</hi> Only it was much obſcured by an other Act of

            </p>
            <p>3. About ſeven yeares after, that King being dead, and
his Sonne,<note place="margin">A better Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</note> King <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, a childe of nine yeares

be alſo added, ſurely I ſee not what <hi>England</hi> can

            <p>If any ſhall object,<note place="margin">Rubs which hinder the Progres of Providence.</note> that in many reſpects the ſtate of our
Church hath growne worſe and worſe. I anſwer, that by
reaſon of our ſluggiſhneſſe, want of zeal, and unworthy
walking of that light which. God graciouſly afforded,
clouds of errour and ſuperſtition gathered together: as by
the negligence and wickedneſſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites</hi>

impediments, and cauſe the light of his Goſpel more and
more brightly to ſhine forth.</p>
            <p>Why then may not we yet looke for better things then
at the beginning of our Reformation, and hope that as
then the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Goſpel was reſtored to the purity

Exhortation of worthy walking, that is, of carrying our

us to the enjoying of better things. This worthy
walking in generall is much preſſed in Scripture, <hi>We

you to his Kingdome and Glory.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 12.</note> 
               <hi>We ceaſe not to deſire that

you might walke worthy of the Lord unto all pleaſing.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Col. 1. 10. Epheſ. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>I beſeech

               </gap>, worthy, doth not intend any merit, but
a meer meetneſſe; no condignity, but a congruity and
correſpondency to that whereunto it is referred. This is
evident by that phraſe which the Baptiſt uſeth, where he
exhorteth to bring forth fruits <hi>worthy repentance,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 3. 8.</note> which

<hi>Fruits which deſerve repentance,</hi> that is, ſuch as are to be

For the end of thoſe things is death.</hi> A catalogue of them is

when mans inward diſpoſition, and outward converſation

i<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113218:24"/>
the name of Chriſt, and to ſeale up our holy profeſſion,

enough for us to be <hi>followers of them, who through faith and
patience inherit the promiſes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 6. 12.</note> but we muſt ſtrive to outſtrip
them. As we have more meanes of grace, ſo we muſt
more abound in the meaſure of all Chriſtian graces. The
forementioned <hi>worthy walking</hi> intends thus much.</p>
            <p>But may ſome ſay,<note place="margin">How Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Jewes.</note> Is this poſſible? Can the beſt of us

in knowledge, faith, parience and other like graces?</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt, that indeed ſome had the Spirit in ſuch
an extraordinary manner and meaſure beſtowed on them,
as they might excell ſuch as live under the Goſpel. But
the compariſon is not ſo much betwixt perſon and perſon,
as betwixt body and body. So as the point intended is,
that Gods people in theſe times ſhould excell his people in
thoſe times.</p>
            <p>Againe, though in ſome particular extraordinary gifts
and revelations, ſome of them excelled, yet in a full and
diſtinct knowledge of all the myſteries of the Goſpel,
and in other graces, we may and ought to excell
them.</p>
            <p>If you be perſwaded to the foreſaid <hi>worthy walking,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.</note> I

            <p>In generall it is this, that in every of the foreſaid dayes
of the great weeke of the world, you obſerve the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent

moſt excellent graces for which they are commended, and
thereby be ſtirred up to an holy emulation.</p>
            <p>This that ye may the better doe, I will endeavour to
ſet before you (as the Apoſtle doth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.) ſome of the

            <p>3. In the <hi>third</hi> day very many are ſet before us,<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 13.</note> as the

in Gods cauſe, <hi>Joſhua</hi> alſo with his houſhold would
ſerve the Lord,<note place="margin">Ruth 3. 16.</note> though none elſe did it. How carefull
were the <hi>Iudges</hi> to draw the people from idolatry, and to
keep them cloſe to God? <hi>Ruth,</hi> after ſhe had been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
in the true Religion, went from her own Countrey,
with a poore Mother in Law, to the true Church.</p>
            <p>4. In the <hi>fourth</hi> day we have excellent paterns of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Governours, as <hi>David, Solomon, Iehoſhaphat, Hezekiah,
Ioſiah</hi> and others, who made it their main end, and put forth
their utmoſt power to advance Gods glory, ſettle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore
true Religion and peace, and procure good to their
people. In that day alſo, there were multitudes of faithfull
<hi>Prophets,</hi> who held cloſe to Gods Word, and would not
falſifie it for fear or favour. Such were <hi>Elijah, Eliſha, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah,
Iſaiah, Ieremiah,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>5. In the <hi>fifth</hi> day there were worthy reſtorers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:113218:25"/>
of Religion, builders up of the houſe of God, and
redreſſers of grievances in State, and preſervers of Gods
people from pernitious plots of Adverſaries. Such were
<hi>Zerobabel, Iehoſhua, Ezra, Nehemiah, Mordecai, Eſther,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6. In the beginning of the <hi>ſixt</hi> day, there were painfull
and faithfull preachers of the Goſpel, zealous and pious
profeſſours of the true faith: mercifull and charitable bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
conſtant and couragious Martyrs.</p>
            <p>Theſe being reſerved to the beginning of the laſt day,

            <p>Should not we then who live in the later part of the laſt
