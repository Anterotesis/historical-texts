            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IF I thought it would any thing contribute to the ſucceſs of this Paper to ſet down particular Motives, by which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came perſwaded to write to you, I would not have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the pains, though it had coſt me a long, and diſtinct Paragraph. I hope it may be enough to ſay, that I am one of the meaneſt Clergy-men in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in whom there ſhould be always a Conſcience of its condition, and a zeal to do any office, that is but probable for its peace and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment; and moreover, that I think there is ſomething in the preſent guiſe of Affairs, that may call you at this time to heed any man, or any thing, that means no worſe, than to awaken you after many, to another conſideration.</p>
            <p>I have aſſigned my Paper to you of <hi>Kent,</hi> becauſe dwelling in the ſame County, I have been more capable to obſerve you in ſuch particulars, as are here conſidered, and not knowing but the diſſenters of other Connties may not be ſuch, as you, in all the Articles and practiſes of your diſſent from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I therefore ſhall leave them to others who have greater abilities, and better opportunities to deal with them. And though in <hi>London</hi> for an hundred good Reaſons, the Heads of all diſſenters may be preſum'd to reſide (for that is the Mount, from whence a long time you have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60886:3"/>
had your various Patterns) yet conſidering my own inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to manage any matter, and withal, that there are many in the ſame City of ſtrength, and warmth enough to take knowledge of, and reprove too, any thing contrary, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the eſtabilihed Religion in their ableſt Adverſaries, I betake my ſelf to the weaker Country, and leave them to convince and perſwade, at leaſt to mind thoſe Head-men of the City, in what Opinions and Practiſes they will continue to live.</p>
            <p>The beginning of my attempt on you ſhall be thus fair; as firſt to lay together thoſe grounds of diſſent, which either in Print or Diſcourſe I have found owned by ſuch among you, who think they can give Reaſons for their diſſent. Yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I do this, it is perhaps but very needful to interpoſe thus much, and to tell you (eſpecially thoſe among you who boaſt of number) that there are many practical Diſſenters from us, and appear moſtly at your Aſſemblies; who cannot be ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have any grounds, and indeed have none, or no other, but what are ſo apparently weak, that themſelves are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to confeſs them, notwithſtanding they are wholly managed by them; and, when they are conteſted with, are forc'd to ſay them (in another dreſs) or nothing. For there are many conducted to your Societies, and fill your Meeting-houſes, on no better ſcore than <hi>Curioſity, Diſcontent, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, Dependance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> In which enumeration, becauſe there is one good word or two (which you are wont to take preſently for good Arguments) give me leave to call them over again, and annex unto them a ſmall Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Curioſity.</hi> I know not, whether old deſcriptions of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or Vices will ſerve thoſe of the preſent Age, for 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited our Virtues are greater, but known (I am ſure) that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60886:3"/>
our Vices are not leſs, and even in this particular of <hi>Curioſity,</hi> which School-Divinity hath reckoned for a Vice: for, though more knowledge be the pretence, yet the appetite may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate, perverſe, and vitious, even after knowledge. And ſuch ſurely is That, which ſhall engage men to leave their immediate places, and duties to purſue an idle inſpection and acquaintance with the Practiſes and Opinions of others; and for love of this ſatisfaction only, ſhall addreſs themſelves to every Meeting-houſe and place of Conventicle, intending to make no more gain thereby, either to themſelves or others, than to be able to become pleaſant, and talkative about di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers manners, matters, and Perſons, over their Meat, Wine, and Coffee; of this ſort there are not a few among you, and of whom you are not all ignorant; for it needs no proof, they are not careful to conceal themſelves, nor apprehenſive of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny injury done to them, when they are cenſured, as curious: Not that I think you have all the curious ones among you; or that this ſort of <hi>Curioſity</hi> is all that is to be found among the Profeſſors of Religion; for indeed there is more, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by ſuch Queſtions, as are very familiar with us; which, though Faſhion and Cuſtome do now ſave from being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd commonly, yet nothing but <hi>Curioſity</hi> is in their birth and original. For not to go further, who can give any better account of this, or the like Queſt. How doth Mr. <hi>A. B.</hi> preach, or was it a good Sermon? Suppoſing there was nothing preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but the common and invariable truths of the Goſpel, as is for the moſt part ſuppoſed by ſuch Inquirers: for the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and the deſigne of them that ſo ask rarely refer to truth or falſhood, which are Queſtions only material in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing men to Salvation, and therefore theſe Queſtions are made to know, with what voice, face, geſture, or perhaps method 'tis preach'd, which are all idle <hi>Curioſities</hi> in ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60886:4"/>
weighty an affair, as the Doctrine of Eternal Life. But to ſay truth, You above all others do invite the Curious and do not often ſuffer them to loſe their labour in ſuch a miſerable queſt. For you are not contented with the general and plain Doctrines of Chriſtianity, either in preaching or hearing, but betake your ſelves to odd and uncouth Subjects, which do not concern the Subſtance of a Chriſtian's faith, or life; but are deviſed, and framed to the Hypotheſis of your pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Saintſhip. And when a Text containing wholeſom and neceſſary Doctrine falls into your hand, it is ſo ſhattered into niceties, or ſmothered by your Phraſes, that though the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious be gratified, the plain man is little edified.</p>
            <p>The Curious come not to you for truth, or pertinacie, but for that (whatever it be) they think they have not yet had any where elſe, and as long, as ſo much of your ſtudy is laid out to provide for them (as you have been often told) they will be your Cuſtomers. And as a man preſented with a freſh Noſegay, at firſt will handle it gently, and often ſcent it, though he is ſure 'twill quickly grow flat, and wither; ſo do the Curious with your Phraſes, till their very thinking on them makes them ſink in their eſteem, and ſo would deſert you as well as them, but that their Experiences make them hope, you will next time provide them more.</p>
            <p>How many ſoever they be, you procure to your ſelves by this trifling, and how bad ſoever they are in themſelves, yet they are not ſo diſtreſs'd as to want a piece of Scripture to help them, when by diſcourſe they are reduced to that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty as to be aſham'd of a naked and profane <hi>Curioſity;</hi> for then (as you have taught them) their <hi>Curioſity</hi> is Scriptural and holy; and the Text is 1 <hi>Theſ. 5. 21. Prove all things,</hi> &amp;c. As if a man was thereby obliged to peep into every corner, and forſaking his own ſtation to hunt after new matters to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60886:4"/>
try his skill about, and not to ſtay till they are offered to him, as matters concerning, and weighty (for every matter offered to us is not worth ſearching into) and by thoſe too, that we have ſome reaſon to think are affected with care and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for the good of our Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Diſcontent</hi> is another thing that hath added to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Diſſenters, which I might call (without taking extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary licence to my ſelf) ſpite and peeviſhneſs. For ſome, in whoſe thoughts it never entred to alter their Principles, or ſo much as to queſtion the uſages of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have yet made too open ſhew of deſerting the Church, by a bold frequenting your Meetings; when the only reaſon of ſo doing was ſome occaſional heat, they have lately had with their lawful Miniſters. For, if a Miniſter, either preſt by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of his duty, or by the neceſſity of his condition, do venture to take a meaſuring-caſt of the Tythes due to him from his Neighbours Farm, and would thereby adjuſt ſome miſtakes and ill cuſtoms to do himſelf juſtice, if there be no Arts left for the Owner to continue the fraud, he ſhall be ſure to find this woful revenge ready for him, <hi>viz.</hi> That his angry Neighbour will hear him no more. And to carry on this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and unwarrantable reſolution, he for a while perhaps keeps at home, afterwards hovers about ſome neighbour Pariſhes, and at laſt ſettles upon a Conventicle, where, whatever his Motives were for ſo doing, he is ſure to be welcome. And if you had leiſure, or did dare to ask ſuch a one his reaſons of departure from us, and joyning with you (which were but fair in ſuch a change) you would find the account very ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. For it is not his love and liking of you, but his deſpite, and revenge to his Miniſter, and he commends your Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes on no other reaſon, but to diſgrace his Sermons. I know ſome of you have ways not only to ſalve the man's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60886:5"/>
but even to ſanctifie the very occaſion of leaving us; but the great Topick, from whence your Methods are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, is Intereſt not Integrity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Deſigne</hi> hath helpt you much in this matter: There be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome who have ſuch deſires and Projects in their Heads, (diſtinct enough from Religion) which can never be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, but by your Succeſs and Proſperity. You well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (I ſuppoſe), when his Majeſty was reſtor'd to the Throne of his Anceſtors, there were many with him return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their own Eſtates, that had long been under the hands, and embezelments of men, that knew how to make a good Market of an unnatural War. Theſe men enjoy'd what they had thus baſely gotten, long enough to make them in love with what they poſſeſſed, and ſuch love they have thereto ſtill, that they will not be out of the Deſigne for another em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. For there are many pleaſant Meadows, large Woods, and goodly Houſes which yet hang in their eyes, though they do not ſtick in their fingers, but theſe can never be compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again by them without making a new Bead-roll of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents, repairing to Haberdaſhers-Hall, and extirpating E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacie, that is, by bringing all things again into War and confuſion. Or, if it be done peaceably, yet cannot be done without laying Biſhops aſide, and diſtributing their Lands. Now, how can any labouring with this deſigne of a re-inveſtiture to ſuch Lands, more properly beſtow himſelf and his ways, than in a diligent attendence on your Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, wherein Biſhops have been ſo often declar'd your utter Enemies, and the rooting them out both your aims and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers? There is little in ſuch Deſigners Conſciences, to byaſs them more to you than to <hi>Rome;</hi> but dreading that Church is not their friend in this particular, they continue with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but on worſe Principles, to cry out againſt her. It
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60886:5"/>
may perhaps be Objected, that all of you are not for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienation of Church-Land, but ſome are againſt it, and are ready (as ſome of your Brethren at firſt did) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt it. If this be true (of which there is ſome ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion) you may pleaſe to make it known at your next meeting, which will be well for us, but I doubt not for your ſelves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Dependance</hi> hath given you ſome advantage, which becauſe it is various, I will only inſtance in ſuch common connexions, as are every where obſervable to have a power to increaſe the bodies of any ſort of men that ſhall think fit to ſeparate themſelves for a diſtinct Society. The <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dances</hi> which I mean, are thoſe which have a ſtrong relation to food and raiment, ſuch as the Shop-keeper hath on the good Cuſtomer, and the Tenant on the hopeful Landlord, which though they are not intrinſecally evil, nor the arts of obliging one and the other to be condemned, as univerſally diſhoneſt; yet, if on ſuch conſiderations men ſhall ſort themſelves to a Sect, and diſtinguiſh out to themſelves a meet Religion, or Religious party, they are wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable. Neither will it help you to ſay, that there are the ſame preſumptions of ſuch among us, and though it were true (as in this 'tis probable) what you ſay. For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mens ſecret motives are in abiding with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they are beſides under a known Law for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and conformity to it, by which all men under the ſame Government are equally obliged, the Seller as well as the Buyer, the Tenant as well as the Landlord, which is a motive more extrinſecally honeſt than the other can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto. But to ſee men take a fair place in your meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not to ſee and hear beſt, but to be ſeen and noted beſt, to remove from thence timely to the door, and there
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60886:6"/>
to abide the train of the Company in their departure, and all this time to diſtribute glances, ſmiles, and cringes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the hopefulneſs of the perſon going out; and laſtly, to acknowledge to their private Friends, that their Trades and livelihoods engage them ſo to do, whatever profit it brings to them, can be no great comfort to you, unleſs you are wonderfully pleaſed with gang and multitude. I will acknowledge that 'tis not to be believed that you can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcriminate thoſe from others; or if you could, that you would exclude them; but yet I know this to be a truth, and is to be told only thoſe of you, who glory in your number and ſincerity. My intent is to ſpeak to ſuch that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and own the beſt appearing Grounds of Diſſent and Separation; and that I might ſo do, I thought it beſt firſt to ſet aſide thoſe perſons that have none.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Obedience</hi> hath done you no hurt in your Plot of Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though a little more Obedience in you or them (that have on this ſcore ſeparated) would have done the Church of <hi>England</hi> much good. They that are drawn and held to you by this Argument are Children and Servants, who cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are the moſt defenſible of all the Families that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to theſe Tribes; conſidering they do in ſome ſenſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert hereby what their Parents and Maſters do deny to the King, and the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Obedience. There are many conſiderations of great efficacie to binde theſe perſons to the very Sentiments, as well as Commandments of their domeſtic Superiours. 'Tis ſufficient, if there were only in the caſe a quiet life, Trade and Portion to be forfeited by their reluctancie, and this there is too often; to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of thoſe fearful curſes ſome are afraid to incur being pronounced on them by their dying friends, on condition
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60886:6"/>
of returning to the obedience to the Engliſh Antichriſtian and Idolatrous Church.</p>
            <p>I think the Servants are under the hardeſt terms, who for the moſt part have had other kind of Education, and come to their Maſters with Catechiſms, Principles and Practiſes according to the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore muſt unlearn ſomethings, and diſuſe more in the practice of their Religion before they can comply with yours. You know a little skill in Caſe-Divinity will help theſe young people to ſome eaſe, and the very Doctrine you often needleſly preſs of an indiſpenſable and prime ſubjection to God, will do them real good, and you know the ſubjection we owe to the Church, and the King for Gods-ſake, ſupercedes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience we owe to Parents and Maſters, if they once draw up to a competition. And 'truly 'tis pity, but theſe ſhould be relieved, not only in reſpect of the Church and the good of their Souls, but alſo of their bodies, eſpecially when they are galli'd often a whole day to hunger, to ſtrange Prayers, and ſtrange Propoſitions, whereof many of your underling Conventicles are very full, and is not unknown to your Chief Rabbies and Maſters.</p>
            <p>Let me then diſmiſs theſe as not bringing much credit to any Society, and leaſt of all to yours, whoſe pretended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality and eſſence is to outgo others in purity of heart and life.</p>
            <p>The ground of your Diſſent is next to be lookt into, which after the moſt diligent ſearch that I could make, ſeems fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally reſolved into this Principle, <hi>viz. That nothing may be lawfully done, or uſed in the Church of Chriſt without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Example for it in Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:60886:7"/>
For I ſuppoſe your chief diſlike of our Church is, becauſe in its uſages there are ſomethings inſcriptural, and ſo I may boldly ſay, will be while the world ſtands. But this is ſuch a Principle, that if you reſolve to ſtand by it, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to abide by the juſt Conſequences of the ſame, it will as well ſerve you againſt any Church, as ours, not only that of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Geneva;</hi> not only againſt the late magnified Platform of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but <hi>New England</hi> alſo.</p>
            <p>But to be ſhort, either you approve of this Principle, or you do not; if you do, why do you not obſerve it, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern your ſelves within your ſelves by it? If you do not, why would you obtrude it on the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and deſert her too for want of an impoſſible Conformity to it? For examine the next moſt Evangelical Aſſembling, and tell me, whether there be not ſome Circumſtances in the time, place, geſture, manner of Preaching and Praying, for which the beſt Textuary of you all can bring forth no plain, poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and particular Commands and Examples from the Holy Scripture: And theſe Circumſtances of yours ye are over-rul'd in, and ſuffer your ſelves to be obedient to on a Vaſſalage to ſome private man, and it may be, he no great Apoſtle; yet continuing to blame thoſe, that in as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and much more decent Ceremonies and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are obſervant of Authority, and were derived from thoſe men that were not aſhamed to live, nor afraid to die for the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Moreover, this being the great <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> of the Science of Non-conformity, and <hi>Novel</hi> Puritaniſm, may I be ſo bold as to ask you, whence you had it? Not from the Scriptures I am ſure, neither in word, nor ſenſe; not from Examples of Jewiſh or Chriſtian Church in the Scripture regiſtred, for they both uſed Ceremonies and Circumſtances in Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60886:7"/>
again took them up, and laid them down without the interpoſition of a particular Divine Command, and yet are guiltleſs.</p>
            <p>All that I can find of Scriptures that you are wont to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for this. Opinion, are ſome conceptions of your own on thoſe Texts that mention God's Holineſs and Jealouſie, That <hi>thou ſhalt not add nor diminiſh,</hi> &amp;c. which have been an hundred times anſwered to you; and had you been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous, the Anſwers had long before removed the dotage. You will not ſay ſure, that this is a Principle enforced on you by Spiritual Wiſdom, and prudential debates in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of every man that is poſſeſſed with a due fear of God; for this were to make your ſelves the only true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or to be found (if you venture to talk of prudence) in the ſame Oven wherein you ſeek to finde, or to put your Adverſaries. But the Church of <hi>England</hi> muſt be cautious in contending againſt this Principle; for ſcarce any of her Members do, but they are readily accuſed for diſparaging the fulneſs of Scripture, for ſpeaking un-Proteſtantlike of the perfection of that Sacred Volume; and laſtly, that Chriſt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was not faithful in his houſe.</p>
            <p>Which Accuſations were they true would ſignifie, but they are not true; inaſmuch as the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> have always willingly aſſerted, and learnedly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified the perfection of Holy Scriptures, as having in them a ſufficient and full Revelation of ſupernatural Truths, and the Subſtantials of God's Worſhip; and the advancing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and civil Duties to a more ſublime and ſpiritual height, by directing them to a more noble end, and exacting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them in a holy manner. Biſhop <hi>Sanderſon, Pref.</hi> to 20 <hi>Serm.</hi> But then 'tis added by that renowned Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that this the Proteſtants do aſſert without any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60886:8"/>
thereby to exclude belief of what is otherwiſe reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, or the practiſe of what is prudential. <hi>Idem i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the truth is, that Biſhop might ſay what he pleaſed; my meaning is, that his Exercitations on the Cauſe of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it ſtands in Controverſie with you are above your refuting: Elſe though Mr. <hi>Hookes</hi>'s be a longſome Book, why are not the Right Reverend <hi>Sander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s few Sermons, and two Prefaces taken into conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? For doth he not enervate your Principle, and eſtabliſh our Ceremonies with that freeneſs, as if he craved favour from no man's Reaſon or Learning? Therefore let it be thought no unreaſonable requeſt of mine to you who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this County to the way of diſſention from us, if I deſire you to peruſe that Author, and to proceed mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately (if you can) in your Inconformity, till you or yours have anſwered him.</p>
            <p>Neither can I think the denying of this your Principle will argue an Opinion in thoſe that oppoſe it, that Chriſt was leſs faithful than <hi>Moſes:</hi> For, if he hath made known unto us all things that he hath heard of his Father, <hi>John</hi> 15. 15. as to that Errand about which his Father ſent him, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did in reſpect of the promulgation of the Laws he received from God for the Inſtruction and Government of the Iſraelites, and yet left ſome circumſtances unmention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he is not unfaithful, nor his diſpenſation uncomplete; nor fail'd any more than St. <hi>Paul, to declare the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God,</hi> though he hath ſaid nothing of the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> Motion of the Earth, or World in the Moon; no, nor ſo much of God's Decrees, as ſome others have, and continue to do.</p>
            <p>What Ceremonies and Circumſtances are recorded in the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60886:8"/>
New Teſtament, as the iſſues of the Will of the Great Captain of our Salvation to be conſtantly and univerſally practiſed in his Church, let him be anathematized that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth to them either in Opinion or Practice; and let the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſtand charged of partiallity and falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, If any children of her Family will not ſay, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</p>
            <p>But if many Acts of Religion and Piety are commanded in their Subſtance only in Scripture, and men cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them without circumſtance, what ſhould be the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (not the pretence) why lawful Authority (which is judge of decencie, and always aims at a bleſſed Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in purſuance thereof injoyns nothing contrary to the leaſt <hi>Iota</hi> of the will of our Saviour) ſhould not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them? when <hi>de facto</hi> ſome circumſtances will (though variouſly) be uſed and determined by every private per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>But ſhould this very obnoxious Principle be allowed you, yet I make a Queſtion, whether you have not exceeded (in your modern cavil) the faireſt extenſion of it: For under pretence of preciſely ſtanding to Scripture, and therein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to words, ſounds, and ſyllables, you have rejected ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things that are Scriptural in ſenſe and ſignification, at leaſt in the judgment of thoſe that are as pious and learned as your ſelves, and infinitely beyond you in number, and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, yet ſtill within the acknowledged Church of Chriſt. For what a daring rudeneſs was it in you to damn Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie (ſuppoſing ſuch, as obtains in <hi>England)</hi> as Unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, if the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> thereof (which is equivalent to the obligation of Scripture) be ſo fairly pleadable by men, that are ever ready to go down with you into the Sand to defend it at any Weapon in the Spiritual Armory, and are no near
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60886:9"/>
at a loſs, or ſhort of you in Piety than Learning. For not to remember your former rage againſt this Government on the account of the former Principle, or none: I ask, whether ever any Society of men were unchurcht for being govern'd by Biſhops, but by you? For to reckon our Epiſcopacie An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian, is as much as to unchurch us. And though the Long-Parliament-Sermons call'd it Prelacie, yet thereby they meant nothing elſe but our Epiſcopacie both in ſenſe and execution. But the people muſt have the new word Prelacie (as then uſed by you) having ſomething yet left in them of the antient reverence to Epiſcopacie.</p>
            <p>But if the Divine right of Epiſcopacie be not demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as I believe it is) yet hath it not as fair pretence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as any of thoſe Hebrew, or Scotch Roots from whence your different Aſſociations are derived? For let it be ſhewn wherein it comes behind in evidence to your forming and predominant <hi>Theſes, viz.</hi> The Doctrine of Lay-Elders, and purity of Miniſters, The Doctrine of the Church-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and Independent-Paſtors. Or again, That the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel hath ſo reſtrained the Subject of Baptiſm, as to exclude Infants; And, that men may now expect the ſame degree of conduct and aſſiſtance from the Holy Ghoſt to guide them into all truth, and even to prevent ſtudy and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the Apoſtles had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as it is in Government, ſo I go on to demand of you in the point of worſhip, Who ever beſides your ſelves ran away from an explicite Communion with a Church for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a form of Prayer, for kneeling at the Lords-Supper, for the uſe of the Croſs after Baptiſm, and for the Surpliſe? when they were declared not eſſential to Religion, nor ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial in Worſhip, but recommended, and enjoyned out of Reverence to Antiquity, and zeal for Uniformity by thoſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60886:9"/>
who had Authority over us, yet never aſſerted any other Authority in ſuch matters, but for edification: Concerning which Ceremonies there is no man among you (who ſeems to have retained diſcretion, or a faculty of judging) but only hovers and makes ſlight reflections, but never prove them to be directly ſinful, unleſs by the former weak, and every where (even among your ſelves) contradicted Principle.</p>
            <p>The Doctrines of the Church of <hi>England</hi> contained in the 39 Articles have of late obtained to ſome better reſpect among you, and on a ſudden grow into favour with many Diſſenters, which one would think were a good pledge of their farther conformity, there being nothing (as I know) in our Government and Worſhip that is contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or abhorrent from thoſe Articles.</p>
            <p>But what the reaſon ſhould be of your approbation, or whether you be not real in it, I know not; but if you are then proceed to examine other matters, and your ſelves by them. I doubt, if you were urged to ſubſcribe to them, you would again, as heretofore have your exceptions, and only acknowledge for truth in them thoſe which be the great Commandments.</p>
            <p>However it were but fair, if you do own our Articles, to let the reſt of your Societies know from your own mouths, that there are ſome good things among us, that they may become more modeſt in their revilings, who ſeldome rate us below the Idolatrous, the Superſtitious, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, not only in one, but in all matters that pertain to us, as a Church.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you lay hold on our Articles now as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and to beat us (as you think) with our
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60886:10"/>
own Weapon; for there are great cries among you, as if many that live in conformity to the Church of <hi>England</hi> are departed in their Opinion from the Catholick ſoundneſs of the 30 Articles, by eſpouſing Socinianiſm, of which there is much ſuſpition, and dread expreſs'd in ſome late Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but then they charge ſuch perſons therewith, that are ſo clearly not guilty of it, as that they approve and uſe that Lyturgy, wherein there is a particular Creed againſt the farce of Socinianiſm, and are willing (for ought I hear) to give other aſſurance of their deteſtation of it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thoſe paſſages in ſome late Papers that they have with great confidence accuſed and condemned.</p>
            <p>But if the Doctrine of <hi>Socinus</hi> and his followers hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any credit among us (which God forbid) who may we blame for it but your ſelves, and your Fore-runners, who could never endure that body of Canons, wherein was one in Title and Doctrine againſt Socinianiſm? It is the fourth Canon agreed on by the ſeveral Synods of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York</hi> 1640. wherein Socinianiſm is called a damnable and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Hereſie, a complication of many antient Hereſies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by the four firſt General Councils; and laſtly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant to the Articles of Religion now eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> I know on what Canon or Canons the burden of your clamour was laid, and that the Lawyers helpt you to find out an irregularity in their making (though the Compoſers had the King's Commiſſion to impower them, and the Canons the King's Declaration before them) yet this Canon underwent the ſame fate as others, though not ſo audibly complain'd againſt; which I cannot think for all that, but was as well as the reſt ſecretly deſign'd againſt by the firſt Authors of our confuſions in Religion: For ſoon after the Miniſters that exerciſed before the Lords and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60886:10"/>
Commons at their Monthly Faſts complain'd againſt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Errors and Hereſies, and this (by name) of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, and that the perſons who were guilty of it were not the adherents to Epiſcopacie, but ſuch as were hearded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Diſſenters, and joyn'd for a pretended Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The matter therefore well conſidered, though you diſlike Socinianiſm (as well you may) yet you may ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directly, or by accident, I enquire not, who unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſtred to its growth, if not to its firſt Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Concerning the Diſcipline of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> I have found nothing ſo boldly talkt againſt, as the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of Excommunications, as if they were irregularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, and on light and unmeet occaſions. But theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are ſo idle and vain, that they argue either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or unrighteouſneſs in thoſe who firſt made them. For had they obſerv'd how, and by whom men are Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally cenſured, they would not think the Keys uſurp'd by Lay-men. 'Tis no news to hear Courts and their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings firſt miſunderſtood, and then miſrepreſented by thoſe who are obnoxious, or have an itch to rule, and are impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of Government. Now Government it ſelf being ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and neceſſary, they that quarrel at it muſt begin with the ſuſpected corruptions of it (of which they are neither capable to judge or amend) and ſo proceed to confuſion; but ſtill keeping up to a noiſe of corruption, till themſelves are poſſeſs'd of it, and then become abominable.</p>
            <p>And as for the cauſes and occaſions of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are inſiſted on by you to be light and trivial, it is manifeſt that thoſe who ſo accuſe are very heedleſs, or very illiterate. For let them but read the ordinary form of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and they will find the cauſe is renouncing to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60886:11"/>
and contempt of the Court; that is, when men do not acknowledge the Juriſdiction, or will not ſubmit and acquieſce in its determinations and cenſures,</p>
            <p>Having thus mentioned your Principle of Diſſent, and ſome Applications that you make thereof for your own pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful defence againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> let me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther add ſomething of the ways and manners you obſerve, or at leaſt are in uſe among your ſelves. I have ſometime conſidered your Worſhipping of God, and finde, that though you have long handled that Text <hi>[That God is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth]</hi> to ſerve you againſt thoſe you oppoſe; yet there is little aſſurance that there is more ſpirit or truth in your wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip than in your ſlighted Neighbour's. For, if to worſhip God in ſpirit be to joyn the Soul with external performances in God's Worſhip, what can you ſay for your ſelves more, than thoſe from whom you ſeparate, who acknowledg the Doctrine, and profeſs the practiſe of the ſame beyond your diſproof, knowing herein they are to be tried by God (and not you) who ſearcheth the heart, and trieth the reins.</p>
            <p>But yet have not the Sons of the Church of <hi>England</hi> greater appearances, that their Souls are joyn'd to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial parts of Gods worſhip than you? when they readily uſe ſuch Acts and Indications of reverence, as you make Conſcience to deny, and a piece of Religion to contemn; nay ſometime become diſtinctly character'd from us by an obſtinate and inſolent refuſal to uſe them. The Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that worſhip God according to the Canons and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks yf the Church of <hi>England</hi> do in Prayer and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions kneel, in hearing they are uncovered, and in any other conſtant or contingent Office are decent &amp; orderly; of which they are ſo far obſervant, that to prevent any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60886:11"/>
for confuſion, it is their Principle to ſubmit and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to a ſtated rule given them by their Superiours, which is the only guard againſt indecencie and diſtraction.</p>
            <p>But your Aſſemblies (thoſe of our County) are otherwiſe managed. Many profeſs to come with no other deſigne than to hear only, and think themſelves diſcharg'd to God and their own wiſh, if they come time enough to hear a myſtical Text pronounc'd, as the warning to a Sermon. This they believe to be the worſhip of God, or elſe have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of none. And when they come, there is no difference between them in the Market, and in the Meeting-houſe, and to ſay truth, there needs none, that their carriage may bear proportion to the nature of ſuch unlawful Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>They have been taught, that Preaching and Hearing are the principal Duties of Miniſter and People, and for the one to preach plain Doctrine, and the other to be uncovered are both ſuperſtitious; and moreover, that Superſtition is ſo dangerous, that rudeneſs is much ſafer with ſuch-like whimſies, that whenever they are reproved for it in our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, eſpecially in this point of the Hat, they think they are abridged of their Chriſtian Priviledges.</p>
            <p>Neither is your Worſhip better for truth than ſpirit, if to worſhip God in truth be to worſhip him after the manner, that Chriſt hath revealed him, who is the true God. For, concerning God, nothing is more Emphatical in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of him by Chriſt, than, <hi>then that he ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,</hi> Rom. 8. 32. which Doctrine, that it might be preſerved freſh in the memories of Chriſtians, then was an holy Rite inſtituted by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that carried with it the moſt eaſie and familiar ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sacrament of the Lords-Supper, which is to be celebrated with ſuch words that do import the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60886:12"/>
very Doctrine, whereby is ſhewn not only our Saviour's care and faithfulneſs to continue an aſſertion of the Point; but over and above, that this is the moſt properly differing Character of the Chriſtian Society.</p>
            <p>But, alas! Of what little uſe is this among you? your former ſetting up ſpiritual Rails by ſtrange and unchriſtian Niceties hath made a deſolation of this Table, not yet to be repaired by the ſoundeſt Doctrines and vehementeſt exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to thoſe that otherwiſe are governable people.</p>
            <p>And as for your own Societies (I ſpeak of <hi>Kent)</hi> there is a very little obedience to it, or ſuch obedience as little comports with the merit of the Doctrine it relates to, or the ſolemnity wherewith it was inſtituted.</p>
            <p>And to my experience, there are ſome who frequent your Aſſemblies with good affection, having yet a veneration of that Sacrament do conſtantly communicate with us, not our of compulſion, or more than ordinary perſwaſion; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not in practice in ſuch Meetings of yours, to which they uſually betake themſelves. I pray then conſider how intire &amp; integral your Worſhip is, eſpecialiy where there is nothing but an <hi>extemporary</hi> prayer and attempts on a Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical Diſcourſe. If in any place the Holy Scriptures are read, I do not hear of any great care or order had for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame, in the moſt material parts thereof; but in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places there is no more uſe of them than in ſuch Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are brought in to attend the Sermon; and in the reſt, the Method or Confuſion of reading is left to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the gifted Brother, Paſtor, or Miniſter, be he young or old, Stranger or home-born. And therefore it is, that the skill your Auditors have in the Scriptures is very narrow, referring only to thoſe Texts which are moſt in faſhion for your Sermons: They obſerve little connexion or diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60886:12"/>
between Old and N. Teſtament, nor particularly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe Scriptures that eſſentially concern Chriſtianity but are under Rote and Government of ſuch gloſſes, as you have fixt on thoſe places that appear faireſt (at leaſt in ſound) for diſſent and difference from the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This conſideration makes me reflect on your way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſuppoſing inſtruction of men, not worſhip of God to be the chief end of your aſſembling: For if it were not, you could not reaſonably lay ſuch ſtreſs on Sermons as you do; and you cannot deny, but God may be publikely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped without them, and that acceptably too, eſpecially in thoſe places where the Goſpel hath been long received, and in ſuch a Church, where there are ways of another name conſtantly uſed to inſtruct the Members thereof. But if you ſhould aſſemble without Sermons for worſhip, what will become of you? For you have ſo long preach'd a woe upon the neglect and very omiſſion of Preaching, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (you know) will curſe you, if you ſhould but attempt to call them together in any publike Meeting without it. But yet to let this paſs, when you are conven'd, your way of inſtructing one would think might be better adviſed. I meddle not now with the unaptneſs of your Subjects to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get Principles of Chriſtianity in your Hearers; and if they were Principles which you teach, how unduly they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd to their capacities being inveloped with ſuch Phraſes, that it were hard for the very Apoſtles to know their own Doctrines again, or the Primitive Chriſtians to reſume their faith and practice of them, if they were to judge and live by your Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>But, ſay your way of Preaching is mended (for indeed the Writings of Diſſenters in other Cities and Countries
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60886:13"/>
are, being more congruous to ſenſe, and beginning to be more Orthodox as to Doctrine) what reaſons can there be in order to better edification (as you pretend) to neglect the uſe of the Ten Commandments, publike Catechiſms, the Antient Creeds, and the Lords Prayer, which deliver the Elements of Religion in ſuch plain words, and tractable Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods as the meaneſt judgment and memory may receive and manage them? And if the memory only be firſt obliged in thoſe wiſe and bleſſed accomodations of Divine Truths, they are the nearer to the underſtanding, and may at laſt rule in the affections and converſation.</p>
            <p>Yet with theſe you inſtruct not, but make them all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide to your own private ſenſes and illuſtrations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If this be told abroad to thoſe who are of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, it will become to their Judgment equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wicked and incredible. That men ſhould pretend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction (and the beſt way too) without a Catechiſm, or the uſe of it without the Decalogue, Creeds, or Lords Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For to ſay you touch on all theſe in your Pulpit-decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations is but to tell us of a Wild-gooſe-chaſe, wherein the Learner though he may come to hear ſome good, ſhall never have a form of ſound words.</p>
            <p>This is the ſtranger for that theſe things are omitted, not only on choice, but in oppoſition to Laws, that enjoyn them: but what ſpeak I of Laws, when as there is no Church or Kingdom on the face of the whole earth that hath better and more wholeſome Laws than ours; and yet none ſo ſlighted and baffled; not by the Banditi, or men that live without any conduct of Law and Conſcience, but by thoſe that pretend to have the greateſt apprehenſion of Religion and livelieſt ſenſe of the fear of God? For what Authority hath conſulted with greater wiſdom and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60886:13"/>
towards thoſe it governs, hath waited with more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and deſire of Conformity and Obedience, or inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more gently and tenderly on tranſgreſſours than ours? yet what Government hath been more complain'd and libell'd againſt? That ſtand reproach'd and foil'd in its wiſeſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and moſt Chriſtian Sanctions to the wonder and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment, as well as to the evil Example of all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons round about us.</p>
            <p>Should other men take your licence to except againſt. Laws that they do not like and abate openly in their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them as you do, no Law would be regarded, but the conſtitution of the Kingdom muſt diſſolve. Yet for this you have taught them Principles, and given them Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns, which they may know how to uſe in matters of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and eſtate, as you in your pretended concerns of Soul, and Religion. For, if you may deny Conformity to Law on the account of Conſcience towards God in a matter that is not intrinſecally evil, or by any word of God abſolutely ſinful (as you cannot prove any thing in our uſages is) then may others alſo be ſet onto violate other Laws, which they judge inexpedient, or otherwiſe; for I know not what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, do not pleaſe them. I believe many of you intend no ſuch evil to your Nation and Country, but then why will you hold and love that Principle, that may be ſo naturally improv'd to infinite miſchiefs?</p>
            <p>The time paſt ſurely may ſuffice you to have wrought your own will, the Conſequences whereof cannot without horrour be contemplated by any that have affection to the Church or Commonwealth. Remember, I pray, your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and oppoſitions were and are againſt ſuch a Church, that you cannot accuſe of any defect in neceſſaries to Salvation, or hath any thing in uſe or injunction, that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:60886:14"/>
may otherwiſe hazard any mans happineſs (but ſet it for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward) that ſhall unite unto it: And yet your oppoſition to it viſibly contradicts ſuch a Doctrine (for ought yet hath been proved) whoſe infringement brings damnation, <hi>viz.</hi> obedience to Authority. Nor are your followers any way better prepared to diſcharge themſelves of being involved in this guilt, but by the precarious Argument of an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite Belief, that your Leaders are good men, and will not go againſt the Scriptures; which Scriptures if you would be intreated to look into without Party or Paſſion, and ſo far yield to as you are convinc'd, you would quickly both Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Follower, leave your Tents and Camps, and find more comfort (though perhaps not ſucceſs) in obedience than obſtinacie.</p>
            <p>Here is nothing (I believe) in this Paper, but ſome of you may have heard, but, I doubt, few of you conſider'd, and therefore my deſign hereby is only to give in familiarly another Memorial, and to renew the inſtance for peace and conformity; which I do offer to you from the bottom of my heart, without ſenſe of any particular wrong or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation from you, ſave what is to every Member of the Church of <hi>England</hi> by your receſſions from it, or batteries againſt it.</p>
            <p>I need not tell you, that you with us are of one common Nature and Country, but Religion too, for you are wont to defend your ſelves in all aggreſſes upon you by the name and pretence to the cauſe of Engliſh Proteſtants; but ſure you were never acknowledged abroad, as you ſtand in your diſagreements from the Church of <hi>England</hi> to be in reſpect of Forein Churches either Mother, Siſter, or Daughter, yet will you not ceaſe to multiply diſtinctions from us, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities againſt us. Conſider how much the right ſpirit of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:60886:14"/>
Chriſtianity is ſeen in meekneſs and peaceableneſs, which; if they are to be exerciſed towards all, then doubtleſs not to be denied to a righteous and innocent Authority.</p>
            <p>We ask you not to part with any Chriſtian Vertue or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, as neceſſary to a compliance with us, but rather to become more practical in the moſt eminent points thereof, and that you would leave off to mingle, and prefer your own things before the things of Jeſus Chriſt, his Goſpel, and his Church.</p>
            <p>There was a time when the Ordinances of a ſmall piece of a Parliament were cried up for Laws by you, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Obedience preſs'd to them on pain of Delinquencie and Damnation, but Neutrality curſed, though the very matter of thoſe Laws was either to begin, or juſtifie Rebellion or Schiſme: And ſhall an integral and full Authority betram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled under your feet in Laws that are for right Religion, peace, and? Unity?</p>
