         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </note> which here hee reckons up, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
them to be these three:</p>
            <list>
               <item>First, the World; (<hi>They walked according to the
course of the world.</hi>)</item>
               <item>Secondly, the Devill; (<hi>According to the prince of

               <item>Thirdly, the lusts of the flesh; (<hi>Among whom
also we all had our conuersation, in times past, in the
lusts of our flesh, &amp;c.</hi>)</item>
            </list>
            <p>The first point that we will observe as naturally
arising out of the words,<note place="margin">Doct.</note> is this,</p>
            <p>That all men by nature are dead in trespasses and
sinnes.</p>
            <p>This point is to be considered of all men, both
those which are alive, and quickened out of this
Lethargie; and those which are yet dead in their
trespasses and sinnes. That wee are thus dead in
sinne,<note place="margin">The Doctrine proved first by Reason,</note> it plainly appeares by this reason; All man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde
were represented in our first parent <hi>Adam,</hi>
of whose fall this death of sinne, and of nature, was
made a part of the punishment; now he being the
root of us all, and that being dead, all the bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
must needs be dead also.<note place="margin">Secondly, by Scriptures.</note> It is also plaine by
places of Scripture: as, <hi>Ioh 5. 25. The dead shall heare
the voice of the Sonne of God, and they that heare shall
live:</hi> so againe, <hi>Ephes. 5. 14. Awake thou that slee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest,
and stand vp from the dead, and Christ shall give
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23445:3"/>
thee light.</hi> Also in the Gospell, our Saviour Christ
saith, <hi>Let the dead goe burie the dead:</hi> that is, let
such as are dead in trespasses and sinnes, goe burie
those that are dead through sinne. By all which
places it plainly appears, that all men by nature are
dead in sinne. This men consider not: You would
thinke it a gashly sight to see Churches, streets, and
houses for to lye full of dead corpes: but for to
see places full of men spiritually dead, which is
farre the worse, is a more gashly sight; and yet
who amongst us is there, almost, that doth consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
it?</p>
            <p>In this death in trespasses and sinnes, for our ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
understanding of it, I will shew you these five
things:
<list>
                  <item>1. What this death is.</item>
                  <item>2. The kinds of this death.</item>
                  <item>3. The signes of this death.</item>
                  <item>4. The degrees of this death.</item>
                  <item>5. The use to be made of it.<note place="margin">1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> What this death is.</note>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> What this death is.</p>
            <p>To know this, we must understand that as a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
death,<note place="margin">Two things, a naturall and a spiritual death</note> so a spirituall death hath two things
in it:</p>
            <p>First, As in the naturall death there is a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of life when the soule is seperated from the
bodie; so in the spirituall death there is a privation
of the life of the soule; namely, the extinction of
originall righteousnesse; by reason of which, a
man can neither set hand nor foot forward in the
waies of goodnesse; as <hi>Paul</hi> confesseth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23445:4"/>
for as the seperation of the soule makes the
body to dye; so the extinction of originall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
makes the soule to dye.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As in the death of the bodie there is a
stinking carkasse left, when the soule is departed
thence; so in the death of the soule there is a posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
corrupted qualitie left, called the flesh, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
a man is prone to doe all evill: And therefore
they are called <hi>dead workes:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dead workes why so called.</note> 
               <hi>Therefore leaving the
principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us goe on unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
not laying againe the foundation of repentance
from dead workes, &amp;c. Heb.</hi> 6. 1. And so againe in the
9. chapter of the same Epistle,, and 15. verse; where
it is said, <hi>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who
through the eternall spirit offered himselfe without spot to
God, purge your conscience from dead workes, to serve
the living God.</hi> Now it seemes a contradiction that
they should be workes, and yet dead; but yet it is
so, because besides the privation of good, there
is a positive evill, and stirring qualitie, which
is active, and bringeth forth these evill and dead
workes.</p>
            <p>Now for the chiefe seat of this death:<note place="margin">The seat of this death.</note> It is
chiefly seated in the minde and understanding,
and not in the will. The Understanding is <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum
vivens, &amp; moriens primum;</hi> the first living,
and first dead: for although the will bee corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
yet whatsoever is in it, is carried through
the understanding. And this death of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is such a darkenesse of judgement, as
thereby a man esteemes not, but dislikes the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23445:4"/>
wayes of God and goodnesse, and approves the
wayes of sinne and wickednesse. And in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie
of man, the understanding, is this death of
sinne chiefly seated; therefore it it is said, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 4, 5.
<hi>In him was light, and that light was the life of men.</hi> So
also, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 14. the place before mentioned, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake
thou that sleepest, and stand vp from the dead, and
Christ shall give thee light:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 5. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> where hee sayes, not
life, but light; for if there be light, life will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
follow: So againe, <hi>Acts 26. 18. To open their
eyes, that they may turne from darknesse to light.</hi> One
would thinke, that in these places it should bee
life, and not light; but it is so put to shew that
the chiefest seat of this death is in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
Therefore also is it said, <hi>Be renewed
in the spirit of your mindes, Rom.</hi> 12. 2. And to the
same purpose also saith <hi>Iames, Iam. 1. 18. The word
of Truth begat you:</hi> now Truth hath a reference to
the understanding. And thus briefly have I gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
you a taste what this death is, and the place
wherein it is seated.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">2. The kinds of this death.</note> Now it followes that we speake of the kinds
of this death; which for the better handling, and
benefit of your memories, I will range into these
three sorts:
<list>
                  <item>1 The death of guilt, by which we are bound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
to eternal damnation: and so in the same
manner usually wee say, a man condemned is
a dead man.</item>
                  <item>2 The death which is opposed to the life of grace
which is the seperation of grace from our soule.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:23445:5"/>
3. The death which is opposed to the lif of joy
and comfort, which is a thousand times more
terrible than all deaths, if it were truly, and
as it is indeed apprehended.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Which latter death, that you may the better
conceive of, I will open it a little to you.</p>
            <p>God joynes with every mans soule, and gives
to the most wicked man some seeming life of grace,
and some colourable life of comfort; for else they
would indure an hell here upon earth.</p>
            <p>For the first; although the wicked have no true
grace, yet they have a shadow of it, as is manifest in
their morall vertues. So for the second, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
they have some, although no true comfort:
for God is the author of comfort, as the Sunne is
of light; which all, both good and bad, doe more
or lesse participate of, or else they could not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist:
As may appeare by the contrary; for, when
he doth but once with-draw his comfort from us,<note place="margin">How terrible the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of Gods presence is.</note>
it is the terriblest thing in the world: An example
of this we may see in Christ; when this comfort
was with-drawne from him but in sense and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
onely, it made him cry out, <hi>My God, my God,
why hast thou forsaken me? Matth.</hi> 27. 46. Where
Gods presence is taken away, there is nothing but
horror and trembling: and I have knowne such,
that in his absence, when his presence hath beene
taken away, have had their soules so pressed with
horror, that they have said, That if at a thousan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
yeeres end they might enjoy the comfortable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of God, they would thinke themselves th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:23445:5"/>
happiest men in the world. The absence of this,
made <hi>Luther</hi> to say, That if all the creatures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and hell should set to torment him, they could
not doe it so much as the with-drawing of Gods
comfort did.</p>
            <p>Alas, poore creatures, now in this world God is
not seperated from you, you feele not the torment
of this death, but now you enjoy the <hi>crepusculum,</hi>
and day-light of this comfort; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it bee now slightly esteemed, and little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,
yet when that day shall come that the Lord
shall totally seperate them from his presence, they
shall by lamentable experience learne how terrible
a thing it is. Thus much for the second point, the
kinds of this death.</p>
            <p>3.<note place="margin">3. The signes of this death.</note> For the signes of this death.</p>
            <p>The signes of it may be taken from them of the
bodily death; the signes of that are these foure:
<list>
                  <item>1. The understanding faileth.<note place="margin">Foure signs of bodily death.</note>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. There is want of sense.</item>
                  <item>3. Want of motion.</item>
                  <item>4. There is a deadnesse in the face.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>These foure things you shall finde in a spirituall
death:<note place="margin">1. Privation of reason.</note> First, As those that are corporally dead,
want reason and understanding, so doe those that
are spiritually dead; they cannot understand the
things of God, no more then men can judge of
colours in the darke.</p>
            <p>I but some man will object and say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> The carnall
man knowes many things, he hath a generall noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the God-head, and can talke of the creation
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23445:6"/>
of man, and his redemption by Christ, he can dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of faith, repentance, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>There is a great difference betweene knowing
Spirituall things,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> A difference betweene knowing spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things, and knowing them in a right manner.</note> and knowing them after a right
manner; a carnall man knoweth them, but not in a
right manner, not in a spirituall manner. And hence
is that of the Apostle, <hi>Tit. 1. 16. They professe that
they know God, but in workes they deny him, being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable,
and disobedient, and unto every good worke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate:</hi>
The word which there is translated <hi>repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi>
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; signifying, <hi>unable to judge.</hi> Indeed in
the generall they may understand and like the
things that are of God, but come to particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
that crosseth them; they, as a Divine
sayes of them, love <hi>veritatem lucentem, non redargu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entem;</hi>
they wholly dislike particulars, because
they bring them to <hi>hic et nunc,</hi> to particulars. In the
abstract they loue holinesse, but not as it is applied
to particulars, as it convinces them of their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
sinnes. Hence it is that godly men are most
hated of them that come neerest to them in shew,
because they bring light home to them, and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their <hi>acerrima proximorumodiv,</hi> their inward and
bosome hatred of their neighbours: It is as much
as if one should bring a Torch to one that is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some unlawfull thing, some deed of darknesse,
he would wish him further off: their lives shine as
lights, and therefore giving good examples by a
shining and godly conversation, which is contrary
to the life of the ungodly and hypocriticall ones,
they cannot chuse but hate them: and as all wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23445:6"/>
men hate them, so especially those that are
nighest unto them in shew; because that their life
doth not onely shine unto them, and lay open their
vildnesse, but scorch them also; and therefore
they being occupied about the workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
wish them as farre off as they can: So that
hence we see, with an approving judgement, not
any save those which are quickned, can understand
spirituall things.</p>
            <p>2.<note place="margin">2. Privation of sense.</note> The second thing wherein a naturall death
consisteth, was in a privation of sense; so also is
it in the Spirituall death; for their hearts are strong
and cannot bee moved; although I deny not but
sometime they may have a little griping of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
and sense of Gods judgement, which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
ariseth from conscience; but they never
have any reall and true feeling of it.</p>
            <p>3.<note place="margin">3. Want of motion.</note> In a naturall death they are without moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so likewise it is in a Spirituall death; for the
wicked can no more move themselves unto any
good worke, than a dead man can move himselfe
out of his grave.</p>
            <p>4.<note place="margin">4. Want of beauty and vigour.</note> In a naturall death there is a want of vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse
and beauty, as well in the face as in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts of the body; so also there is in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
death the losse of that vigorous beauty which
followes the life of grace; they may bee seene to
have death in the face; if a living man beholds
them, he knowes how to discerne it: although I
deny not but that they may have hypocriticall
painted vertues, which may to weake eyes for a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23445:7"/>
great while seeme true ones; as men may have
painted faces that have been taken for living ones,
but they are not true graces, such as proceed from
the life of grace indeed.</p>
            <p>I but some may here object and say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> have not
some men many excellent morall vertues, such as
even the godly themselves have not?</p>
            <p>Indeed it's true that they have,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> How wicked men may have moral vertues</note> and these are Gods
gifts also, but yet they are but as chaines of gold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
a dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s neck, oras pearls in a swines snout:
There may be many good things in them, but they
make them not good men; for as the evill actions
of good men redound not to their persons to make
them evill, so these good actions in evill men, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound
not to their persons to make them good;
they may have good in them, but are not good.
And thus much for this third point, the signes of
this death.</p>
            <p>4. To come to the degrees of this death:
First,<note place="margin">4. The degrees of this death. The death of guilt.</note> for the death of guilt, that hath degrees;
some men are more bound over than others, as the
Heathen men that were guided onely by the light
of nature, they indeed were guilty; but the Jewes
which had a more perfect knowledge, they were
more guilty then they: and now we that live under
the tropicke of the Gospell, and have Sermon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Sermon, line upon line, and every day are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed,
are more guilty then the Jewes: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, they that have most meanes, and profit
least, are most guilty of all; and therefore are most
bound over unto this death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:23445:7"/>
Secondly,<note place="margin">The death opposite to the life of grace.</note> for the death that is opposite to the
life of grace and sanctification, that also admits
degrees:</p>
            <p>1. For the first part, the privation of life, indeed
there is no degree; but all that are dead, in regard
of the privation and absence of originall righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
are all dead alike.</p>
            <p>2. But for the second, to wit, the positive cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
quality, which is called <hi>the flesh,</hi> that admits
degrees: for one may be mad and drunke both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,
but the one may have some sparkes of reason
more then the other. The degrees therefore of
this death,<note place="margin">Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of this death. The first.</note> are these three that follow:</p>
            <p>1. When men doe oppose and set themselves
against a holy life, although it bee closely and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly
under other names, for against them directly
the Divell will not speake, because the knoweth it
will not be regarded; but he speakes against them
under names of reproach, which he himselfe hath
invented. These men are one of the bottome staires
of the chamber of death; and therefore it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
impossible they should ever rise, but must
needs remaine in a pittifull case, although it may
be they thinke farre otherwise.</p>
            <p>2. When men are given up to voluptuousnesse
and sensuality;<note place="margin">The second.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh of the wanton wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6. that because shee lived in volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuousnesse,
shee was <hi>dead while she lived:</hi> Even so,
the more a man is sunke into voluptuous courses,
the more hee is dead, and as it were buried in his
corruptions, so that hee is altogether unable to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:23445:8"/>
stirre out of them; it is a very difficult thing to
leave them;<note place="margin">The third.</note> as in the sinnes of uncleannesse.</p>
            <p>3. When we are indifferent, and care not how
things goe; and this is when a man is addicted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the death of civill men, which is a degree nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
to life, yet is truly and indeed no better than a
death: such as have much restraining grace, these
are nearer the gate of heaven then others, yet they
are as truly shut out as they that are furthest off; it
is no matter how neere they are to heaven, since
they are all out of heaven alike; they shall be sure,
if never any more quickened, to goe to hell as well
as others.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">The death op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the life of ioy.</note> The death that is opposed to the life of
joy and comfort, that hath also degrees: God
sometimes with-drawes his comfort from some
more than others, and so suffers some to have
lesse horror then others: Thus I have briefly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
this death, in which all men naturally are.
I will now answer an objection of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that which hath beene said, and so come to
the fifth thing.</p>
            <p>Some there be that say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> If all men are dead in
sinne, as you say they are, then to what end is all
our Preaching, and your hearing? for the dead
are without life, and cannot be moved with any of
these things, and therefore they are all in vaine.</p>
            <p>To this I answer;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1</note> first, that although every man
by nature be dead unto grace, yet he hath the lif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
of reason in sinne, whereby hee is able to perceive
two things:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:23445:8"/>
1. To see that they are dead, and without this
life of grace, their conscience telling them so.</p>
            <p>2. By the sight and feeling of their death, they
are able to bring themselves to the meanes of life,
as to the Word and Sacraments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I answer;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 2.</note> that though all men be dead,
yet there is an end and effect of our speaking, and
their hearing: for the Word that we speake may
put life into them, as the word that Christ spake
unto <hi>Lazarus,</hi> was able to raise him <hi>from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 3. A difference betweene the spirituall and corporall death.</note> Wee must know that there is a great
difference betweene this spirituall death, and the
corporall death; for this death consisteth in the
understanding and will, and is a free willing
death; in it they freely slye good, and embrace e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill;
they freely choose the wayes of death, and
therefore are said to be <hi>already dead:</hi> as, suppose a
man is resolved to commit murder, or treason, and
a friend come to him, and perswade him from it,
and cannot prevaile, that man may bee said to bee
dead, because he will doe that that will cost him
his life: Even so we may affirme that that man is
dead already, because hee will doe that that will
bring death after the doing of it.</p>
            <p>5.<note place="margin">5. The Vses of this point.</note> Now for the fift thing, the uses of this point,
That <hi>all men by nature are dead in sinne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The first Use then that wee may make of this
point,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vses.</hi> 1.</note> is, If all men are dead in sinne, then let us be
exhorted not to deferre our repentance,<note place="margin">Not to defer repentance.</note> saying, we
will repent afterward. This is a fault usuall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
young men, and such as presume of their
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23445:9"/>
strength and ability of nature to live a great while,
they find nature strong in them, and therefore put
off repentance till they be sick, and age bring them
to thinke of death: but let such consider that they
are dead already, and repentance is a putting of a
new life into them: Dost thou thinke it is in thy
power to create a new life in thee when thou art
dead? Surely,<note place="margin">How the devil deceives men in perswading them to put off their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</note> no more is it in thy power to repent
when thou wouldest. Hereby the devil entrappeth
many, in putting this conceit into them, that they
may repent when they will; and this hee bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
them unto, by making them to mistake repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
in conceiving of it to be nothing else but a
sorrow for sinne past, and a purpose to live well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward,
and leave all sinne: he neuer tels them, nor
they neuer thinke that it is the creation of a new
life in them; for then they would say more: but
they are decejued, this is not to repent, for thou
mayest doe all this, and yet when thou hast done,
be damned. But such repentance as will save thy
soule,<note place="margin">Saving repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance what it is.</note> is a sorrow for they sinne that is past, and a
purpose for the time to come to endevour to leave
all sinne, arising out of a love to God: for all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
ariseth either out of a love of God, or else
from selfe-love: if it be out of a love of God, thou
wilt presently give thy selfe unto his service, and
forsake thy sinne: if it be not out of love to God,
but out of selfe-love, that thou purposest to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
thy sinne, then it is not true repentance, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
false, and riseth from by-respects. Repentance is
hard to be had, it is not in thine owne power; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23445:9"/>
God breathe a new life into thee, thou canst
not repent; thou art as the red clod of earth before
God, of which he made <hi>Adam;</hi> it had no life, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
<hi>he breathed into it:</hi> so while the spirit breatheth
in us, we are dead. A Beast may desire his owne
life, so may a man his owne salvation, but hee can
doe nothing without the spirit blowes. When
then the spirit blowes, why wilt thou be so foolish
as to deferre thy repentance unto another time?
If a man upon paine of death were within twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
dayes to be beyond the Seas,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> if the wind should
blow well for his purpose the first, second, or
third day, would hee bee so foolish as to neglect
it, and deferre his journey, and say, it may bee it
will blow againe tenne dayes hence, and then I
will goe? No, he will not be so foolish, for hee
knowes <hi>the winde bloweth where and when it listeth;</hi>
and therefore he will take it when it blowes, least
it blow there no more. In these earthly things men
are not so foolish, why therefore are they so igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
in this point of spirituall wisdome? Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of us then hereby be perswaded to learne
wisedome; when the spirit bloweth, neglect it
not: certaine it is, that except it doth blow in thy
heart, thou art damned; therefore when it doth
blow, suppose it be at 17. or 18. yeeres of age, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
it not, omit it not, neither deferre it, it may be
it will never blow againe, and thou canst not make
it blow when thou wouldest, for it is free.</p>
            <p>There are none which live vnder the Gospell,
but at some time or other have had some blasts of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23445:10"/>
the Spirit, but in some it vanisheth as bubbles in
the water: but let us take heed of that, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
we could have them againe when we would,
let us not let them passe: when thou hast but the
least sparke, let it not goe out, leave it not till it is
become a slame to purifie thy heart.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francis Spira</hi> neglecting these comfortable
blasts,<note place="margin">An example of <hi>Spira.</hi>
               </note> at the last wished that hee might have had
but one drop of that comfort which once he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised;
and so till his last breath, cryed out, I am
damned. God not therefore still on in thy sinnes,
falsly perswading thy selfe, saying, thou shalt bee
saved: Remember what God threatneth unto
such men, <hi>Deut. 29. 19. He that hearing the words of
this curse, shall blesse himselfe, saying, I shall have
peace though I follow my sinnes; the Lord will not bee
mercifull to that man.</hi> Sit downe therefore but one
halfe houre, and consider with thy selfe, that thou
art but a dead man, and that thou canst not quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
thy selfe, but it is God onely that is able to
quicken thee; and the quickeneth whom hee will,
and those whom he quickeneth are but very few,
as the gleaning after the harvest, or the grapes
after the vintage, and thou knowest not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thou art in that small number: Consider, I
say, but this with thy selfe, and surely this will
make thee never to give thy selfe rest, untill thou
findest life in thee, and never be quiet untill thou
art sure thou art quickened.</p>
            <p>Another Use which wee will make of this
point,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 2. How to esteem civill men.</note> is, If naturally all men are dead in trespasses
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23445:10"/>
and sinnes, this should teach us how to esteeme of
civill men, and such like; wee should esteeme
of such men as of dead men: and therefore,
<list>
                  <item>1 We should not overvalue them.</item>
                  <item>2 We should not make them our companions.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, We should not overvalue them. For their beauty, they have none that is true
beauty: what beauty have dead men in them?
they are dead, let us not regard their seeming beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Esteeme the poore Saints; for they, though
never so meane, are better then those, though never
so brave. Grant your civill men bee as Lions,
(then which no irrationall creature is better,) and
that your Saints are but as dogges (then which no
creature is worser,) yet a living dogge is better
than a dead Lion. It's a signe of a new life to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
no carnall excellencie: so saith <hi>Paul, 2 Cor.
5. 16, 17. Wherefore henceforth know wee no man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flesh; yea, though wee have knowne Christ after
the flesh, yet now henceforth know wee him no more.
Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature:
old things are past away; behold all things are become
new:</hi> hee, that is, a new creature, will not regard
these things, but they will bee dead in his account.
They account us but dead men, therefore let us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
them so also.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Make them not your companions.</p>
            <p>Wee may, and ought to love them with the
love of pitty, but not with the love of delight
and complacency: if thou love them, and delight
in them, it is a signe thou art dead also; yet in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23445:11"/>
this we are to blame, that wee doe not more pitty
them, and seeke their salvation, but wee must not
delight in them, and make them our familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
for wee can never thrive in grace till
we leave them: for although they bee dead, yet
they have a leaven which wil infect thee, although
thou perceivest it not. Wee use to say, wee will
make use to our selves of the good in them, but
let the hurt goe: but wee cannot doe so; for wee
are insensibly hurt, when we thinke we are furthest
from it:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> Even as a man is tanned when he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the Sunne, and hee never perceives it; so
doth their company infect us insensibly, when wee
thinke least of it: It's therefore but a folly to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to serve God, and not to breake off their
company;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yea, it is a plaine contradiction. Every
man is compared to a coale, he is either living or
dead; if he be a living coale, hee will kindle him
that is next him; but if hee bee a dead coale, hee
then will blacke and fully thee: Even so it is with
company, if it be good and zealous, it will kindle
our affections; but if bad, it will bee sure to
infect us: therefore from such company thou must
either gaine good or harme; but for good, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it is that thou canst receive none, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thou must receive harme: <hi>If thou walke with
the wise, thou shalt be more wise; if with the foole, thou
shalt learne folly, Pro.</hi> 13. 20.</p>
            <p>The third Use wee will make of this point, is
this,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 3. To stirre up to thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quickned.</note> Seeing that by nature all of us <hi>are children of
wrath, and dead in trespasses and sinnes,</hi> This should
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23445:11"/>
stirre up those that are quickened, to be thankefull
to God therefore. Above all, wee ever labour to
bee most thankefull to him that hath saved our
lives; and this God hath done for us, let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
stirre up ourselves to thankfulnesse. <hi>Paul,</hi> as
we may read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25. joynes these two to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
his deliverance, and his thankfulnesse;
<hi>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from
this body of death? I thanke God, through Iesus Christ
our Lord.</hi> I confesse the world esteemes not this,
but if they have riches therein, they rejoyce; and
so like the dunghill Cocke, or unskilfull Lapida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
preferre vaine things before this precious
Jewell; but they that have once found the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of it, will not lose it for a world: for if wee
have but this, what though wee lose wife, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
goods, credit, and good name? they are all
too light being layd in the ballance with this. Doe
yee every one therefore consider who it was that
gave thee this, and to him yeeld all thankfulnesse.
Let us love much, because as much is forgiven, so
much is given to us: <hi>Paul</hi> was much stirred up
with this consideration, thinking that he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doe enough for Christ, who had done so much
for him; as appears in many places of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles.</p>
            <p>The fourth Use we will make of this point, is,
If we are all dead in trespasses and sinnes,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 4. How to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of the meanes of grace.</note> then this
teacheth us how we should esteeme of the means
of grace: if wee are dead, then it must bee an
Omnipotent power which must quicken us. All
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23445:12"/>
the meanes, as the Word preached, the receiving
the Sacraments, &amp;c. are but dead letters, they are
but as pennes without inke, God must put inke
into them if ever they be effectuall: and therefore
as wee must not give too little to the meanes, so
wee must not give too much, nor rest in them.
When wee come to heare the Word preached, it
is not the hearing of the Minister, but Christ in
the Word preached, which makes us live. It is
good to heare the Minister, but except wee heare
another voyce speaking to the heart, as his doth to
the eare, we shall never be the better: it is Christs
voyce in the Word which doth quicken and put
life in our soules. But here let mee warne you to
take heed of breaking the Conduit-pipe from the
Fountaine; if thou hearest and profitest not, know
that it is because Christ speaketh not to the eares
of the heart, as well as the Minister to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
eares.</p>
            <p>The fifth and last Use wee will make of this
point shall be,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse</hi> 5. To examine ourselves whether we have life in us or no. <hi>Simile.</hi>
               </note> If that naturally all men are dead
in sinne, this should teach us to try our selves, and
see whether wee are dead or alive. Consider the
shortnesse and uncertainty of thy life here: Mans
life is like an houre-glasse; if it runnes his course
it is but an houre, and it may be broken before it is
run out: ye have but a short while to live here, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the course of Nature, and yet perhaps that
course may not runne out too, it may bee broken
off before wee are aware; and then for ever, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in heaven or hell, wee must abide hereafter:
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23445:12"/>
Oh then never be quiet vntill you see wihther you
shall goe, to eternall blisse, or everlasting woe.
Here the Diuels triicke is to put it into mens heads,<note place="margin">How the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell deceives civill men.</note>
that a civill life will serue the turne: but he dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
with them as those that take gold from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants,
and give them counters and rattles: and thus
he would keepe them from this consideration, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swading
them of the latitude of religion, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
them that they are well enough, seeing they
are troubled for some sinnes, and doe some duties,
perhaps, in private, but this you may doe, and yet
be dead still. If he cannot prevaile this way, then
he will labour to hinder them by drawing them on
in a voluptuous course of life, or with worldly
cares, and so draweth them from themselves, and
so makes them never to consider what they are do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
nor whit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er they are going: and therefore is
it that in the Gospell of Saint <hi>Luke, chap.</hi> 16. the
prodigall Son is sayd, <hi>to come home to himselfe,</hi> when
he once beganne to consider his estate: Although
their conscience tell them all is wrong, yet the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brets
of lusts and pleasures make such a deane
where they are, that they heare it not, and so never
consider: nay, if that Christ himselfe againe, or
the sonnes of Thunder should speake, yet except
Gods Spirit should inwardly worke, it would not
make men seriously to consider their estates: It is
the hardest thing in the world to make men sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of life and death. Let us therefore bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in particular to consider whether we are dead
or alive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:23445:13"/>
If thou art quickened,<note place="margin">Two signes of our quickning 1.</note> thou shalt finde, one time
or other, these two things in thee:</p>
            <p>First, Thou once hadst a deepe and sensible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration
of thine estate by nature, thou wert
deeply affected with it, so that thou sawest what
need thou hadst of Christ: till thou hast had this
consideration, thou art a dead man. I know God
can save thee without this, hee could come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the terrible voyce, as Christ could have come
without <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> before him, but hee will not,
neither ever doth, because it is impossible for a man
highly to esteeme of Christ till hee is thus hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled;
for hee never will preferre him in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
actions, and take him with all crosses and los<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
till hee fully see what need hee hath of him,
which he cannot untill he is thus humbled.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Consider if thou wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ever changed
from what thou formerly wert; neither is it a
slight change that will serve, but it must bee both
constant and generall; it must not be for a month
or a yeare, but daily and continually. It must bee
such a change that all where thou livest may see
it; thou must become a new soule in another bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
Thy change must be so great that thou mayst
say, <hi>Ego non sum ego,</hi> I am not my selfe, I am quite
another man: There must be as great a change
in thee, as there is in a white cloth when it is died
blacke. Such a change was in <hi>Paul,</hi> he was conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from a persecutor to a Preacher: So thou must
of a Lion be made a Lambe: there must as much
difference be in us, as is between winter &amp; summer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:23445:13"/>
And now seeing the time of the Sacrament is at
hand,<note place="margin">An applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to examine our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</note> let us all examine our selves: we must not
make excuses to keepe from the Sacrament, but as
all, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. were to come to the Passeover, else
they were to be cut off from their people, except
they could shew some good cause; so I know
no reason why it should not be so still for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.
But againe, on the other side, if wee doe
come, and are dead men, <hi>wee come unworthily, and
eat and drinke our owne damnation in not discerning the
body of Christ, 1. Cor.</hi> 11. 29. which we doe when
wee doe not sufficiently esteeme it, and conceive
not what right we have to, which was the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>
sinne; for they knew well enough that that
did represent his body. Let us therefore take heed
we come preparedly; for as God strooke <hi>Vzzah</hi>
for touching the Arke with polluted hands, and
<hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for offering of strange fire, so if
thou come unpreparedly to the Sacrament, he will
strike thee.</p>
            <p>But to returne to the poynt which was even now
handled, That all men are dead in trespasses and
sinnes, because it is point which concernes all
sorts of men, wee will a little further consider it,
and in the next place speake of the nature of dead
men.<note place="margin">The nature of dead men.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Dead men are either,
<list>
                  <item>1. Such as are starke dead in sinne,<note place="margin">Two kinds of spiritually dead men.</note> and doe
make no shew at all of life; as are all open
prophane, and notoriously wicked men.</item>
                  <item>2. Such as are dead indeed, and in truth, but yet
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23445:14"/>
make a shew of life, outwardly seeme to
have it; like the Angels, that have appeared
many times in assumed bodies, but yet have
none of their owne that is true and substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall;
and these are chiefly dissembling hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
or men meerely civill.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>First, This starke deadnesse, without any shew
at all of life,<note place="margin">First, starke deadnesse.</note> of which sort wee have every where
too too many; consists chiefly,
<list>
                  <item>1. In the privation of life.</item>
                  <item>2. In an active positive principle.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are certaine signes arising from both
these, and they are
<list>
                  <item>1. Positive.</item>
                  <item>2. Privative.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1 The Positive signes of a dead man,<note place="margin">Three positive signes of dead men.</note> are these
three:</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, All those which live any life, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it be,<note place="margin">A careless neglect of goodnesse.</note> seeke such things as are agreeable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
that life, and hate the contrary: as a man
that liveth a naturall life, looketh for food, ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
&amp;c. so in the life of grace, there is an apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
to cleave unto goodnesse, and unto Christ, as
iron doth to the Loadstone: So a man that lives
the life of grace, his delight is in praying, hearing,
reading, &amp;c. but his lusts, they are <hi>aegritudines ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi>
the soules sicknesses; they are as thornes to his
sides, and smoke to his eyes, and he is never well
or at quiet, untill they are removed and gone: but
a wicked man, one that is dead in sinne, he is sicke
of goodnesse (as the other is of wickednesse) and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23445:14"/>
weary of it; he is too strait-laced in it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot brooke it. A godly man hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
aptnesse and inclination to serve God, as fire
naturally inclines to goe upward: indeed hee may
sometimes contract impurity, and have some cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
yet they are but as mud in a cleere and
living fountaine, they are soone washed away; but
wicked men are like ditches which are full of
mudde at their best, and there it lyes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues.</p>
            <p>Secondly, another positive signe of this dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
is,<note place="margin">A lying still in any lust.</note> When a man lies in any living lust, or
knowne sinne: for as a mortall disease and life
cannot stand together, no more can a living lust and
the life of grace. That is a living lust, when al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
sometimes hee may have fits of resisting,<note place="margin">A living lust, what it is.</note>
yet he alwayes gives over, and still yeelds to that
lust, saying, It is their nature, and they cannot
choose but commit, it, they know not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
it; when as if there was some present Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
threatned thee, upon the commission of it,
then thou couldest forbeare: This I call a living
lust, and although it be but one, yet if other lusts
tempted thee as much as that, thou wouldest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them also: if thou forsakest other sinnes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are sinnes, why forsakest thou not this
also? <hi>Gal. 5. 24. They that are Christs, have crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the flesh, with the affections and lusts.</hi> There is in
every man a body of lust; if any member of that
body be unmortified, he is yet a dead man. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi>
5. 6. <hi>Shee which liveth in pleasure, is dead while shee is
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23445:15"/>
alive.</hi> Some may keepe themselves cleane from
some sinnes, but that will not serve; for if they
live in any knowne sinne, they are dead.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly,<note place="margin">An antipathy to God and godlinesse.</note> a third positive signe is, When a man
hath a secret antipathy against God and godlinesse.
Some beasts naturally hate some colours; so
some men, out of a naturall inclination, cannot
endure goodnesse it selfe, though they pretend
some cause. I call it an antipathy when a mans
stomacke riseth against a thing, and hee knoweth
not wherefore: so they hate goodnesse, meerely
out of a naturall abhorring of the thing it selfe, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they pretend some cause for which they
hate it. They distant holinesse of life, and for no
just cause: if it be you distast such men as professe
an holy and pure conversation, onely because they
doe not conforme (as some pretend,) why doe you
distant those also that doe conforme? If you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the professors of an holy life because of the
hypocrisie they have found in them, as some have
not stood to say, why doe you also dislike those
that you are sure are no hypocrites? They cannot
define the holy man they hate, but have a secret
naturall hatred to them they cannot tell why: but
we know the reason well enough; it is because
they live a contrary life to them, and therefore
cannot agree no more than fire and water: indeed
fire and water may agree in remisse degrees, but
not in intense; so these men can suffer those which
are indifferently holy, but if they come to any
perfection and height of holinesse, then they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23445:15"/>
endure them. Now the Apostle sayes expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
1 <hi>Ioh. 3. 14. By this we know wee are translated from
death to life, because we love the brethren: hee that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
not his brother, abideth in death.</hi> So that it is an
infallible signe of deadnesse not to love the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren:
if thou hatest the Saints; nay, if thou lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
them not; nay, if thou lovest them not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the measure of grace that is in them, and if
thou art not grieved for any of their sinnes, by
which they may cause scandall, or bee disgraced,
thou art yet a dead man. And so much for the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive
signes.</p>
            <p>2 The Privative signes of deadnesse follow,<note place="margin">Five Privitive signes of dead men,</note>
which are these five:</p>
            <p>The first privitive signe of deadnesse,<note place="margin">Privation of speech.</note> is want of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
speech: He that is dead, is speechlesse, and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse;
so he that is dead in sinne, in all holy things
is speechlesse; <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart the
mouth speaketh,</hi> saith Christ in the Gospell, <hi>Matth.</hi>
12. 14. When the mouth is speechlesse, the heart
is empty. Some that are dead in trespasses and
sinnes may speake well sometimes; but there is no
living man but doth speake well. <hi>Esa. 19. 18. Those
that belong to Canaan, will speake in the language of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan:</hi>
Their language will shew whether they are
Galileans or not: every man delights in operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
agreeable to their habits. Here you may
learne to judge of your selves by your words; not
by some words that are spoken by fits, but by thy
usuall and customary speech, that is a signe of that
that is in you. The godly sometimes cannot speake
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23445:16"/>
godlily and holily; as a Fountaine sometimes is
stopped up, so that it cannot send forth pure
streames, yet take away the rubbish that stopped
it, and then it will runne cleare againe; even so
it is with the godly; and therefore consider your
ordinary speeches, if they be not holy and good,
it is a signe that you are a dead man.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second privitive signe is Coldnesse; when
a man is dead,<note place="margin">Privation of heat.</note> he growes cold; so is it with men
dead in sinne; they may pray, but it is coldly; and
so in all other holy duties they are very cold.</p>
            <p>But some man will be ready to object and say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
You tell us of coldnesse, but for any thing I can
see, there is as much coldnesse in the best men:
for your godliest men are sometimes cold in their
prayers.</p>
            <p>It is true;<note place="margin">Answ.</note> but there is this difference betweene
the coldnesse of a godly man, and a dead man; If
the meanes be used to a godly man, it doth bring
life to him againe: if he be rubbed and chafed with
admonitions, or hath the <hi>aquavitae</hi> of the Word,
he will recover his heat, because the inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
of heat still remaines within him. But to a
wicked man use never so many reproofes, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions,
hee will still remaine cold: Let this
therefore bee a certaine tryall, if after all admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions
you still remaine cold, you are dead.</p>
            <p>The third privitive signe is Stiffenesse; a dead
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> man growes stiffe,<note place="margin">Stiffenesse,</note> and in what position his body
is in when it is dead, in the same it will remaine,
you cannot bendit; so is it with men spiritually
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23445:16"/>
dead, what course they take, what opinions they
hold, what company they keepe, they will not bee
changed from them. <hi>Rev. 22. 11. He that is filthy,
let him be filthy still:</hi> that is, he will be filthy still,
they will not be changed: If that they hold to be
Gods will, be Gods will, so it is, then they are
right; but it is not because it is Gods will, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
his pleasure fell on what they held. As a
rustie hand of a clocke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it turnes not with the day,
but stands still; but if the time of the day chance
to be such as it stands at, it is true; not because it
moveth with the day (as it should) but because
the day hath fell jumpe with it: So these men, if
Gods will hit with theirs, they will doe it; if not,
they will crosse it: This is a signe of a dead
man.</p>
            <p>The fourth privitive signe is Senslesnesse; hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
that is dead,<note place="margin">Privation of sense.</note> is senslesse: so it is with the spirituall
death, there is no sense in it; they can neither see,
heare, nor taste.</p>
            <p>I but some man will object and say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> that is not
true alwayes; for even the wicked sometimes know
m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tters of faith; nay, and sometimes they rellish
them too.</p>
            <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Matth, 13. 13. opened.</note> As it is said of the dead Idoll,
so may it be said of them: <hi>Mat. 13. 13. Eyes they have
and see not, eares and heare not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First for seeing, they see not aright: Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
see experimentally, the wicked only by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation;
and there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them, for as wee see there is a great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23445:17"/>
betwixt knowing fire to be hot, and the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of it; so betweene a meere notionall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Gods will, and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that doth
like and approve it.</p>
            <p>Secondly for taste, they finde no taste in Gods
Word; or if they finde any, like a vitiated pallat,
they account that which is most sweet to bee very
bitter.</p>
            <p>Thirdly for smelling, they smell no sweetnesse
in Christs name, whereas to his Saints it is a
sweet oyntment poured out, that perfumeth all the
roome.</p>
            <p>Fourthly for feeling, they feele not whether
the Law or Gospell be applied to them, rub over
their skarres, and make them runne downe with
blood, they are notwithstanding all that senslesse
still: they may have a counterfeit feeling arising
from a naturall conscience, but to have such a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
as may drive them to Christ, they cannot; and
therefore still they are but dead men.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fifth signe is this,<note place="margin">No sympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing in the miseries of  others.</note> A living member, if the
body be in danger, will have a sympathizing and
feeling of the danger; as the hand will lift it selfe
up to save the head, so now if we hearing the case
of Gods Church in what danger it is, if wee take
it not to heart, or be not affected with it (especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
now we are put in minde thereof) it is a certaine
signe we are dead men: We should have the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
that <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had, who even wished to be
stroyed, so they might save the Church. <hi>Moses,</hi>
rather than that should perish, would have his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23445:17"/>
               <hi>name raced out of the booke of life: Paul,</hi> for the
Churches sake would bee <hi>anathema.</hi> It is a true
signe of a living member to bee touched with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
miseries; this was an extasie of love, in
which out of love to the Church, they forgate
themselves. This here we must know, that if the
creature could destroy it selfe for God, it could
not but be well, because the good of the creature is
more contained in God than in it selfe, as the
beame of the Sunne is more contained in the Sun
than in it selfe. Now is the time of considering
this, now is the time of more than extraordinary
fasting; now if you have any feeling, you will
shew it; if you are living men, now you will
shew your selves; now the Church lyes in tents,
and wallowes in blood, now the foundations
thereof are shaken; never was the face of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
in such danger as now it is. Doe wee thinke
to stand now others fall? If the fire be at one end
of the building, shall we be safe which are at the
other end? (for all Gods house is but one buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.)
Are not they our brethren, and sonnes of
the same father? have they not the same spirit?
are they not of the same profession? shall wee not
then bee ready to helpe them? wee cannot send
armes over to them, but wee may send up prayers
unto God for them: Christians are stronger than
Politicians, and their prayers are armies. Let us
therefore doe what wee can, the storme is not yet
quite over.<note place="margin">Two things to move us to consider the Churches mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are two things that may move us to
this:
<list>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:23445:18"/>
                  <item>1. The greatnesse of the Judgement.</item>
                  <item>2. Our ability to helpe them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, The greatnesse of the Judgement:</p>
            <p>It will prove the extinguishing of Gods Church
and the Gospell, and when that is once gone, what
are all other things? It was a good saying of that
Saint, That browne bread and the Gospell was
good cheare; what are all our houses, lands, &amp;c.
if this Spirituall food be wanting?</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, Consider our ability to helpe
them.</p>
            <p>We may doe much by our prayers; hee that
knoweth not his strength, useth it not: Did not
one <hi>Moses,</hi> one <hi>Eliah</hi> stand in the gappe? They
did not these things as they were extraordinary
men, but as they were Gods children: We may
by our prayers doe as much; though one childe
may have better gifts than another, yet common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the father loves all alike; so God (although
they had better gifts than we) will grant our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
as soone as he did theirs.</p>
            <p>But some man will here bee ready to make a
question,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> and askeme, what I would have him doe
for the Church now? he is but a singleman, and
therefore is unable to doe much himselfe alone.</p>
            <p>I answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> What we must doe for the Church.</note> Though thou canst not doe much, yet
these things thou mayest doe; and therefore,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Pray for it: God delights to bee called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
for else his hand is not taken notice of; but
then we see his hand,<note place="margin">Pray for it.</note> and acknowledge it, when
wee see him granting our desires. So that the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23445:18"/>
strength of a land lyes in Christians, and their
strength lyes in their prayers, as <hi>Sampsons</hi> strength
did in his haire. Oftentimes prayer is more avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
than fighting: <hi>Moses</hi> prayer in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
did more than <hi>Ioshuahs</hi> fighting in the vallies.
<hi>If Noah, Daniel, and Iob stood before me</hi> (saith God,
<hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. 20.) <hi>they should not prevaile:</hi> which shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that if any thing could have prevailed, their
prayer would: So also <hi>Luther</hi> attributes all to
prayer, as may be seene in divers of his Treatises.
Now this prayer which I urge unto you, must</p>
            <p>1. Not onely be small expressions of the mind,<note place="margin">Our Prayers must be fervent.</note>
but now God lookes for strong cryes, and long
continuance in prayer. <hi>Moses</hi> prayed all day:
Christ, which had lesse need than we have, prayed
all night; <hi>Daniel</hi> three weekes: therefore wee
that have more wants and needs, ought to bee the
more fervent.</p>
            <p>2. Our prayers must be Spirituall,<note place="margin">Spirituall.</note> not out of
selfe-love; as to desire the safety of the Church,
that so under it we may lead a safe and quiet life;
but out of meere respect to God, and love to
his Church.</p>
            <p>3. It must be a prayer of faith;<note place="margin">Of Faith.</note> so the Apostle
saith, <hi>Iam. 5. 15, 16. The prayer of faith shall save
the sicke, &amp;c.</hi> And a little after, <hi>The effectuall fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
prayer of a righteous man availeth much:</hi> Now
there is no man righteous without faith: so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their faith Christ still yeelded to them.</p>
            <p>4. Pray with constancy and fervency:<note place="margin">With Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.</note> it is not
for a snatch and away, that is pleasing to God; but a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23445:19"/>
constant performance of duty which hee accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.</p>
            <p>5. It must bee the prayer of a righteous man:<note place="margin">Of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</note>
Therefore, <hi>Micah</hi> 2. the Prophets sought unto
God in the time of trouble, but prevailed not,
because they were not righteous: for it is said
there, <hi>vers. 7. Doe not my words doe good to him that
walketh uprightly?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. It must be with humilitie;<note place="margin">With humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> and that consists
First, in confessing how unworthy we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
any thing at the hands of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, how unable to helpe our selves, and
therefore to have our eyes onely towards God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another way to doe good to Gods Church,<note place="margin">Be more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ealous.</note> is,
to be more zealous; seeke unto God extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily:
The cause of the destruction of a Land, is
chiefly the sinnes of the godly. When they grow
cold and dead, and lose their first love, then God,
as <hi>Rev. 2. will remove the Candlesticke from among
them,</hi> and take away his Gospell. Indeed the
carnalnesse of dead men, their prophanenesse in
contemning of Gods Saints and his Gospel, &amp;c. ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
Gods Judgements on a Land, but chiefly the
Luke-warmnesse of Professors doe it: when Israel,
as <hi>Hosea</hi> saith, is as <hi>a cake halfe baked.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
rectifie our lives, renew our repentance, quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
our zeale, else shall wee be guiltie of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
of Gods Church by our sinnes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3 A third meanes to doe good to Gods Church,<note place="margin">Stir up others</note>
is, to stirre up others to take to heart the miseries
of the Church, to pray, to renew their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23445:19"/>
It would be good if Ministers would bee
as Beacons to give warning to others, and to set
them on fire. Thus the old Christians did, as it
were, make an armie (<hi>manu facta</hi>) against God, by
joyning together in prayer. This is a blessed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to stirre up others: thus they did in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Malachies</hi> time, <hi>Mal.3.16. Then they that feared
the Lord, spake often one unto another,</hi> (see the issue of
all,) <hi>and the Lord harkened and heard it, and a booke
of remembrance was written before him for them that
feared the Lord, and thought upon his Name.</hi> So, <hi>Zach.</hi>
8. 21. there they did so; <hi>And the Inhabitants of the
Citie shall goe one to another, saying, Let us goe spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
to pray before the Lord, and to seeke the Lord of
hoasts, I will goe also. Let us therefore,</hi> as the Apostle
exhorts, <hi>Heb. 10. 24. consider one another to provoke
our selves</hi> to this good worke of fasting and prayer
for the Church; let us marke who is a likely man
to joyne with us, and not let him passe.</p>
            <p>4 A fourth meanes to doe good to the Church,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
is,<note place="margin">Performe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in due time.</note> to doe it in due time: Jerusalem had a time to
seeke God; if then shee would have sought, shee
might have beene saved: And Christ complaines,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 41, 42. saying, <hi>If thou hadst knowne, even
thou in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy
peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi> And so
before Christ, the Prophets of old complained of
the people; as <hi>Ier. 8. 7. Yea, the Storke in the heaven
knoweth her appointed times, and the Turtle, and the
Crane, and the Swallow observe the time of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
but my people know not the judgement of the Lord.</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:23445:20"/>
The time to seeke unto the Lord is now: Some
Judgements are sudden, and have no fore-runners,
as the Gunpowder-treason, in such God lookes
not that wee should meet him by repentance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we know them not: Others use lingring,
such as send feare and rumours before them, as are
those mentioned by the Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. 30, 31.
there God expects we should make up the hedge,
and stand in the gap before him, and so meet him
with repentance to stop the judgement.</p>
            <p>5 The fifth meanes to doe good to the Church,<note place="margin">With Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</note>
is this, Let us doe it with continuance: It may be
while the newes is fresh wee will bee fervent in
prayer; but often the newes altereth, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it happens to be good, and then wee leave
off: But this must not be; wee must bee constant
in this dutie, to the very uttermost end of all;
there may be ebbs and flowings, but it is the last
issue which brings all: therefore let us continue in
this dutie of fasting and praying, that wee may
trie that last issue of al. It is the common fashion to
make the afflictions of the Church onely a wonder
of nine dayes. This was the Jewes fault, <hi>Ier. 34. 10,
11.</hi> When they heard of their enemies, for a while
they would pray. But although the newes bee
good, yet still continue as the importunate widow
did to the Judge, and your importunitie will
move God. Set therefore to it, and continue in
it; <hi>Pray for Ierusalem, let those prosper that love her
peace, Psalm.</hi> 122. 6. Mourne apart, every familie
apart: It is not enough to heare this, and to let the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23445:20"/>
Ministers voyce be to you as <hi>one that singeth with a
pleasant voyce:</hi> Thus were the Prophets to the
Jewes, <hi>Ezek. 33. 32. Who heard his words, but did
not doe them:</hi> and therefore God tells them that
they shall be destroyed in the judgment. The divel
will suffer you to purpose and purpose to doe this
dutie,<note place="margin">The Divels cunning to deferre men from doing good Duties.</note> but keepes you from the execution of it, and
present practice, which is that onely which may
doe the deed. Consider it therefore, and deferre
not the present doing of this dutie: what can you
doe better than to deliver Gods Church, and you
may doe it, although you be poore and despised,
yet being Gods Saints, your prayers are in force
with God; as in <hi>Eccles.</hi> 9. 14, 15. the poore man
delivered the citie by his wisedome; hee was
poore and despised, yet it was hee that delivered
it. Others may seeme to doe much, and stand
vaunting on the hatches, but it is the Saints that
doe it. If there be any consideration of Christ in
you, if any love, any grace, any well-wishing to
the Church, pray for it: this is that I feare, you
will purpose to doe it, but will deferre it; but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
the doing onely God regards. Wee, when
we reade how much <hi>Alexander, Caesar,</hi> and the like,
did, we admire them; why we may doe more by
our prayers, performed in a right manner: if you
doe it, either the Church shall bee delivered, and
you shall have comfort; or else you shall save
your owne soules. Without you thus pray, you
are guiltie of the Churches destruction: The
horsemen, if they stand still, although they fight
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23445:21"/>
not against their owne armie, yet are guiltie of
their destruction, because they should have fought
for them. The Praetor, if hee let the enemies in
the gate, hee is the destroyer of the Citie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he should have kept them out: so the Saints,
which should stand in the breach, if they pray
not, they destroy the land: So God saies, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
22. 30, 31. <hi>And I sought for a man among them, that
should make up the hedge, and stand in the gap before
me for the land, that I should not destroy it: but I
found none: therefore have I powred out againe indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
upon them, I have consumed them with the fire
of my wrath: their owne way have I recompenced upon
their heads, saith the Lord God.</hi> Because hee could
not find a man to stand in the gap, therefore hee
powred forth his indignation on the land. Their
not praying destroyes the land: The Saints and
holy Prophets are the Chariots and horse-men of
Israell; if then they stand still, they doe what in
them lies to destroy the whole Nation: they are
not onely the Chariots, but the horsemen also;
they are the whole defence of Israell; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if at these times they be idle, they are guiltie
of the destruction of the whole Church. Hence
<hi>Salomon</hi> said, <hi>An idle man is brother to him that is
a great waster.</hi> As a Pilot, who for want of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
suffers a Ship to bee overthrowne, or split a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the rockes, is guiltie of the losse thereof:
So the Prophet <hi>Samuell,</hi> notwithstanding the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
had sinned a great sinne in forsaking God to
be their King, saith, 1 <hi>Sam. 12. 23. God forbid that I
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23445:21"/>
should sinne against the Lord in ceasing to pray for
you:</hi> and therefore it is a great sinne not to pray
for Gods Church. The Jewes in the captivitie
were commanded to pray for the peace of <hi>Nabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar,</hi>
who was an heathen Prince; how
much more then ought wee to pray for Christian
Princes? And surely, if God should take away
from you this Prince, and give you such an one
as <hi>Queene Mary,</hi> you would then know what it is
to enjoy such a Prince, as now by Gods mercie
we doe. Therefore stirre up your selves to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
by fasting and praying, much may you doe
this way. <hi>Ester</hi> delivered all the Jewes by this
meanes: it was not <hi>Esters</hi> word that did it; for
what made the King not to sleepe that night? how
came he to call for the booke of the Chronicle?
how light hee on that place of <hi>Mordecay?</hi> They
had first turned God by fasting and prayer, and
then hee thus prepared the King for <hi>Ester</hi> to speak.
Thus then, and by these meanes we may releeve
the Church in distresse: And therefore if we be
true living members, let us manifest our endevour
to releeve them by these meanes. And thus much
for the signes of men which are starke dead.</p>
            <p>Now follow signes of distinction betweene
such as seeme to live, and such as live indeed: and
these may bee resembled to such spirits as as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
bodies to themselves, and seeme to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
them; and they are chiefly all Civill
men. Now they are discerned by these and the
like signes;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:23445:22"/>
The first signe is this;<note place="margin">Signes of civil men that seem to have life, but have none indeed.</note> As the Angels in their assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
bodies seemed to eat and drinke, but mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested
not any effect of it, for they did not grow
by it: so these man, they seeme to heare the
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Word,<note place="margin">They doe not Grow.</note> but they make no progresse in it: they
may seeme to feed on the Sacraments, but they
grow by none of these meanes, they still goe on in
their old tract. They are not unlike some men
which eat as much, or more than others, but are
never the fatter, but as leane as ever they were:
even so the Ministers of the Gospell now deliver
the Spirituall food of the Word, in as great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
as ever, yet where is the fruit? who growes
any fatter, any better liking than before? Wee,
(beloved) desire not to have againe the fruit of
our teaching in your understanding only (although
that be good) but in your practice: Like sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
which would not have their hay againe of
their sheepe in hay, but in the milke and wooll.
And hence it is that the Apostle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts
them, 1 <hi>Pet. 2. 2. As new borne babes to desire the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
milke of the Word:</hi> and why? <hi>that they may
grow thereby.</hi> Though thou beest never so weake
at the first, yet if thou growest stronger, it is a
signe of life; but if thou hast gotten no strength
in grace, nor no victorie over your lusts, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all the meanes of grace you have had,
yet whatsoever you seeme, you are still but dead
men.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The second signe is;<note place="margin">They are moved by an outward Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</note> As the Angels, though
they were moved, yet it was from no inward, but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23445:22"/>
from an outward principle; so these Civill men,
and all hypocrites may be moved, and doe all that
good men can doe, but it is not from an inward
principle, but from some outward and by-respect.
They are like Clockes and Watches, which are
moved by some spring, and therefore when the
weights or spring is downe, they move no longer:
when that false end which made them take in hand
the shew of Religion is gone, then they will bee
no more Religious. Thus <hi>Ioash</hi> was Religious,
but for some by-end; <hi>viz.</hi> while <hi>Iehoiada</hi> lived;
and therefore after his death, <hi>Ioash</hi> forsooke God.
Thus many will be good whilest they are in good
families, under good Governors, but being remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from them, they turne with the swine to the
tumbling in the mire. Some againe, good exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and counsell will make them live well, and
they will continue so, while they are in that good
mood: Others will bee good while a storme of
ficknesse indures, but when the sunne-shine of
prosperitie shall beginne to appeare, they returne
to their old courses: they are like a Bullrush, which
hangs downe his head till the storme is over it,
but as soone as the Sunne shines it lifts it up againe.
Some may hold out longer than others, yet at the
last all will give over, because they are not moved
from some inward principle.</p>
            <p>The third is this; As the Angels assumed those <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
bodies but for certaine times,<note place="margin">They doe it but in some places and company.</note> and places, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,
and afterwards laid them aside againe; so
will your hypocrites doe in some places and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23445:23"/>
at some times, they will take on them the
bodies of living men, and so have a name to live,
but indeed are dead: But come they in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
or companies, they will lay aside their bodies,
and then will be as profane as any. I confesse, a
godly man may bee the worse for being in an ill
companie; they may be myrie and dirtie, but yet
they still remaine sheepe: as a pibble and a pearle
foyled with the same mire can scarce be distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
till they be washed; so the godly, doe but
wash them, and then you shall discerne them to be
pearles; but these Wolves, the wicked, which
onely takes sheepes cloathing on them, comming
amongst Wolves, cast off that cloathing and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
as much Wolves as any.</p>
            <p>The fourth signe is this: As Angels or devils
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which assume bodies,<note place="margin">They speake from the teeth, not fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the heart.</note> cannot speake heartily as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
men, but have an artificiall framed voice,
which is from the teeth outward, not heart; so
where there is no true grace but seeming, it may be
discerned from the speeches, not in the matter, but
in the manner; an hypocrite may often babble
more than the true Christian, as a blazing Starre
shines as bright, if not brighter than the true Star;
but there is abroad difference betwixt them; the
one speakes but from the head, and the other from
the heart: for a true living man doth speake hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
and feelingly. That the manner of speaking
doth much affect others,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Iunius</hi> conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-mans har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty speaking.</note> it is plaine: Hence is that
that <hi>Iunius</hi> reports of himselfe, that hee lighting
into a Countrie mans house, which was wholly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23445:23"/>
illiterate and unlearned, hee confesseth that his
heartie speaking of faith and repentance, &amp;c. did
so move him, that he thought that there was som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more in it than meere knowledge, and so
wrought on him, that by Gods grace it converted
him; so that the manner of speaking doth often
affect where the matter doth not; which an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
cannot have. And thus much for the signes
of seeming living, but indeed dead men.</p>
            <p>Now having shewed that all are dead, it followes
that we should shew the meanes of getting life,
which are also comprehended in my text,<note place="margin">Two meanes to get life.</note> and they
are these two:</p>
            <p>1. To labour to see that ye are dead, (<hi>You that
were dead in trespasses and sinnes, &amp;c.</hi>) as all men are
by nature.</p>
            <p>2. To goe to Christ for life, hee it is onely that
can give it; so saith my Text (<hi>hee hath quickened
you:</hi>) It is the propertie of God alone to give life.
Now wee cannot goe to him but by Christ, and
we must goe to Christ by faith, therefore is faith
called a living faith, because it unites Christ and
the soule together. Now the difficultie is in this,
that men will not come to Christ and take him:
some come not for him at all, others take him,
but not in good earnest; as grafts put into a stock,
but not so ingrafted as to grow thereby: but when
a man is once soundly humbled, then will he come
to Christ, and not before; for till then hee doth
not hunger and thirst after him: but the extreame
hungrie will bee satisfied with nought but meat:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23445:24"/>
as <hi>Sampson</hi> said, Give me drinke or else I dye. Now
life consists in the union betwixt Christ and thy
soule: This union is by <hi>Luther</hi> compared to fire
and iron united, which causes the iron to have all
the properties of fire, as burne, scorch, &amp;c. so an

            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>The Doctrine of Humiliation.</head>
               <p>Now these must bee handled distinctly: and
therfore the first meanes of life, is to see our selves
children of wrath, and that wee are dead in tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes
and sinnes: The point that hence ariseth,
is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That whosoever would be translated from death to life,
must first apprehend himselfe to bee a child of wrath:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> No translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to life, without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of Gods wrath due to sinne.</note>
that is, he must see the face of God, as of an angry
Iudge, so farre forth as it may drive him to Christ.
So that a man cannot be saved untill hee hath not
onely a touch or two, but a true sense of sinne, a
deepe apprehension of his sinnes, of death, and of
damnation; for onely to such are all the promises
made, Christ is onely sent to binde up the broken
hearted: Christ came to call all that were heavie
laden, and those onely, those he will ease: Peace
must be preached to none but those that moume in
Sion. Therefore the Apostle saith, <hi>Gal. 4. 21. Tell
me, ye that are under the Law, doe ye not desire to heare
the Law?</hi> Yea, the Law is said to be a <hi>Schoolmaster
to drive men to Christ:</hi> that is, first there must bee
the Law before Christ can bee had; for else, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
wee should Preach the Gospell, it would
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:23445:24"/>
be contemned: therefore Christ in his time gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
onely the poore; <hi>The poore receive the Gospell:</hi>
that is, the poore in spirit. God will have his
jewels of life and salvation to be esteemed, which
we will never doe untill we see our miserie, how
that we are in the estate of death. As the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
out of Egypt would never have beene so
sweet, had they not beene in extreame slavery and
bondage first. God deales with us, as Princes doe
with their malefactors; first they bring their
neckes to the blocke, and then give them a pardon,
for then they apprehending death, the pardon is
the sweeter and more welcome and acceptable to
them. Indeed if the question were made, what
God could doe in his absolute power; I know that
God might convert us and not humble us if hee
would; he might say as hee did in the Creation,
Let it be, and it must be: hee might come in a still
voyce onely, without sending before a voyce ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the rockes: hee might use lightning and no
thunder, but wee speake of his ordinary course,
wherein hee will not; for none are saved but such
as have not onely a sight, but also a deepe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
of their sinnes.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding of this point,<note place="margin">Things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</note> wee
must consider these things:</p>
               <p>1 That there are three things which keepe a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
man from Christ.<note place="margin">Three things keepe a man from Christ: 1. Vnbeleefe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, Vnbeleefe: when men will not beleeve
that he which was borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was
Christ and God; therefore about the proving of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23445:25"/>
this, the Apostles did spend most time, because
then it was hard to beleeve.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not caring for Christ:<note place="margin">2. Neglect of him.</note> as those that
came not to the Kings feast, they beleeved that
there was a King and a feast, but cared not for it,
they regarded more their Oxen, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Not willingnesse to part with all for
Christ;<note place="margin">3. Vnwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to part with other things for him</note> they will not take him upon all conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
they see some need they have of Christ, but
not much; and so they will forsake some things
for him, but not all: they are loath to part with
their master sinne; like the young man in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
he had done a great deale, yet he would not
part with his possessions.<note place="margin">Three things to be set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these, to bring us to Christ.</note> But to these three things
must be opposed three other things to bring us to
Christ:
<list>
                     <item>1. Faith to beleeve he is God.</item>
                     <item>2. A sleight humiliation to bring vs in love
with Christ.</item>
                     <item>3. Sound humiliation, to be willing to part
with all for his sake.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The first is received amongst all Christians, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it is to be feared that many doe beleeve it
but confusedly. The second is a sleighter manner
of apprehending of Christ, and that a little sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
will doe, a little humiliation. But the third
(which we must have before we can be saved) to
be willing to forsake all, to leave every sinne for
Christ his sake: and that we will not doe vntill
we be thorowly humbled,<note place="margin">The necessity of a deepe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</note> &amp; are fully broken har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
therefore first a deepe humiliation is necessary
for salvation.</p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:23445:25"/>
               <p>Secondly, If we have not such an humiliation,
then either:
<list>
                     <item>1. We will not come to Christ.</item>
                     <item>2. Or we will not stay with him.</item>
                     <item>3. Or else we will not doe or suffer any thing
for him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And if wee want any of these wee cannot be
saved.</p>
               <p>First, If we be not truly humbled, we can never <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
come to Christ,<note place="margin">Without sound humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation we will not come to Christ.</note> nor regard him: we may preach
Christ long enough, and no body will regard him,
except they be soundly humbled for their sinnes:
as in the Law no body did care for the Citie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,
but he that had slaine a man; to him onely
whom the revenger of blood pursueth, is the Citie
of refuge sweet: when the fiery Serpent had stung
a man, then he looked to the Brazen-serpent, and
nevertill then: so when we see our sinnes and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie
thereby, then, J say, and never till then is Christ
welcome. The prodigall Sonne never thought of
returning home to his Father vntill he saw that he
must else starve; when he saw he could no longer
subsist, then he returned. So, when wee are so
humbled for our sinnes that we see we shall indeed
be damned without Christ, then, and never untill
then we care for him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">We will not stay with him.</note> Although we doe come to Christ,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
yet without we be truly humbled wee will never
stay with him, althougst wee may rejoyce in his
light for a season. And for the better understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of this, consider the foure sorts of grounds
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:23445:26"/>
which represented foure sorts of hearers,<note place="margin">Humiliation compared to the sout sorts of ground,</note> 
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note>
The first were not humbled at all, (<hi>It fell by the
wayes side, and presently the Fowles of the aire devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
it, vers</hi> 4) The second was humbled a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
but not so much as to suffer for him, (<hi>The
Sunne parched them for lacke of rooting, vers.</hi> 6.)
The third sort were so farre humbled for sinne,
that they suffered some persecutions, but would
not part with all for Christ, the world they estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
more; <hi>The thornes choaked them, vers.</hi> 7.) But
the fourth ground was fully humbled; that is,
they were so humbled in a sight of their sinne,
that they saw that they had more need of Christ,
than of any thing in the world, and so would part
with all for him, and suffer any thing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they are said <hi>to bring forth fruit with patience.</hi>
Others may stay a while with Christ, but when
that comes that they preferre before Christ, then
they leave Christ; for untill a man can bring his
heart to that passe, that he can prize Christ above
all things, undergoe all persecutions for his sake,
he is not soundly humbled, but is like the second
and third ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 3. If wee stay thus with Christ,<note place="margin">We will not suffer or doe any thing for him.</note> yet except wee
be thus humbled, we shall neither suffer nor doe
any thing for Christ. If Christ had bidden <hi>Paul,</hi>
(before he was humbled) to have done so much
for him as he did, he would never have done it;
but when he was humbled, then, <hi>Lord, what wouldst
thou have me doe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the reason of this is apparent, if we consider
these things:</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:23445:26"/>
First,<note place="margin">Reas. 1.</note> There are many lusts that doe encumber
us whilest our hearts are unbroken; so that there
is such a basenesse on the outside of Religion, that
except we be humbled wee will never like it, but
shall be offended at it; and like proud servants, say
our wages are too little, our fellow-servants too
base: but on the contrary, hee that hath once
beene soundly humbled, thinkes all too good
for him.</p>
               <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Reas. 2.</note> There be such strong lusts to be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,
which cannot be done without humiliation,
that we care not for Christ: our lusts indeed may
for a while sleepe, but when once they are awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
like <hi>Sampson,</hi> they cracke a two all the bonds
of good purposes and vowes; they are never slaine
untill we be soundly humbled.</p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> there are such contrary lawes to bee
delighted in, that wee can never frame our nature
unto, untill we hunger and thirst after Christ, and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>en his lawes will bee meat and drinke unto us:
for before we delighted in the Law of the flesh,
but now if we be truly humbled, we must delight
in the law of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">Reas. 4.</note> There are so many strong lusts to be
parted from, so many <hi>Isaacks,</hi> which every man at
some time or other will be called upon to offer up,
the which if hee doth not doe, hee will damne his
owne soule; yet untill he is humbled, and shewne
what damnation is, he will not buy salvation so
deare.</p>
               <p>For these causes is Humiliation necessary in the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:23445:27"/>
first place: Therefore in the Scripture this method
is alwayes used,<note place="margin">The Doctrine of Humiliati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on must goe before Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</note> by the Prophets, Apostles, and
Christ himselfe, they preached ever repentance
and humiliation before sanctification and justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
This was Christ order, as you may see,
<hi>Luke</hi> 4. Thus did <hi>Nathan</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> he laboured
to humble him, before he told him God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
him. Thus did <hi>Ionas; Yet forty dayes and Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veh
shallbe destroyed, Ion.</hi> 3. Thus also God dealt with
<hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise, he intended to reveale unto him
the promises of the Gospell, and yet at the first
he strikes him downe with terror that made him
hide himselfe, then he told him of his sinnes, and
after all reveales the Gospell unto him, (<hi>The seed
of the woman shall breake the Serpents head, Gen.</hi> 3.)
Thus dealt <hi>Peter</hi> with his auditors, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38, 39.
<hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you see that Humiliation is so necessary,
that without it there is no salvation: Let us come
in the next place to make some Use of it.</p>
               <p>Therefore (my brethren) seeing this is so,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
not your selves with morality and civility,
except you have more in you than nature can give
you; nay, except you be all new, not patched up;
as 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. Except you bee wholly changed and
cast into a new mould, being first broken by humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
you cannot be saved. Try therefore whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
now you doe that that others will not doe;
wherein else doth the power of Religion consist?
Try whether you have denied your selves, and
throughly mortified your dearest lust, and what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

will stand you in no stead, because it commeth not

dutie, never so constantly performed, except it
comes from a broken heart, God accepts it not:
So the Prophet <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 16, 17. God

                  </gap>nto him; and therefore
whatsoever you have done from a broken heart, is
accepted of God. But here Satan deceives men,
with gilded things, namely, formall performance

                  </gap> or trouble) stand them in no

them money to doe some murders, they laying up
the money, and when they have need of it, going

thus will all the holy duties wee have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
from an unbroken heart faile us. They are
like Glowormes, they glister greatly in the darke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note>
but when once the Sunne comes, their light is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.
So <hi>Paul,</hi> before he was humbled, hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
himselfe a godly man, and none better
than he; but afterward, <hi>hee was not worthy</hi> (as hee
said) <hi>to be counted an Apostle.</hi> Therefore deceive
not your selves any longer, for nothing is more
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23445:28"/>
dangerous than an unsound heart, therefore take
heed it deceive you not: if you never have beene
humbled, now labour to be humbled; for it was
that that made the Publican to be justified rather
than the Pharisie, because hee was humbled and
the Pharisie was not: and indeed none are further
from salvation than those that content themselves
with outward formalities.</p>
               <p>Now in Humiliation, for our fuller under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of it,<note place="margin">Three questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> I will explaine these three que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions:
<list>
                     <item>1 Wherein Humiliation doth consist.</item>
                     <item>2 What kinde of sorrow is required in this
Humiliation.</item>
                     <item>3 How we shall know whether our sorrows
are true or not.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The first question is,<note place="margin">Quest. 1.</note> Wherein consists this true
Humiliation?</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> In three things:</p>
               <p>1. In seeing your life to abound with acutall
sinnes,<note place="margin">True humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion consists</note> then in looking into your heart and nature,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> which is wholly corrupted,<note place="margin">In seeing our lives abound in sinne.</note> and the root of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,
and where your corruption is strongest, as fire
in the root. Many labour to excuse their sinnes
from their nature, because that that is prone unto
it; but that makes their cause the worse, it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
their vildnesse; for, why hast thou such a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and dost not curbe it? Besides, their natures
are odious to God, though they never should
breake out; as a Serpent is odious unto us, though
he never hurt us. Further, consider, hast thou not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:23445:28"/>
made thy nature worse? Every sinne thou hast
committed makes it worse; for actuall sinne doth
more increase the custome and habit of sinne; so
that besides <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, thou thy selfe art guilty
of corrupting thine owne nature.</p>
               <p>2. In considering that there is nothing in thee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
that is good at all;<note place="margin">In considering that there is nothing good in thee.</note> so the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 18.
<hi>For I know that in me dwelleth no good thing:</hi> and,
<hi>Gal. 3. 22. The Scripture hath concluded all</hi> (not onely
men, but things) <hi>under sinne.</hi> Men thinke well of
themselves, because they have much good in them;
but consider with thy selfe thou hast nothing good
in thee at all: Can good fruit proceed from an ill
tree?</p>
               <p>3. In smiting thy heart with an apprehension <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of death,<note place="margin">In smiting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> hell, and misery, due to thy sinne; then
wilt thou find thy selfe in a miserable estate, and
canst not chuse but be humbled, when in conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of these things, thy heart smites thee, as
<hi>Belchazzars</hi> did him. And so much for the first
question.</p>
               <p>The second question is,<note place="margin">Quest. 2.</note> What kinde of sorrow
is required in this Humiliation?</p>
               <p>I answer;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> Not those violent flashings of sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
which for a while amaze like a land-stood,<note place="margin">What sorrow is required to true humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>
but it must be this:</p>
               <p>When thy judgement is enlightned to see thy
estate, and the judgements of God hanging over
thee; and after this convincing, then thy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are stirred to mourne for thy sinne. If the
judgement bee fully convinced, the affections will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23445:29"/>
follow: therefore in Scripture, when any is
said to be humbled, in those places is shewed that
their affections were stirred; as we may see, <hi>Acts</hi>
16. in the Jaylor: and of <hi>Peter,</hi> it is said of his
conversion, <hi>He went out and wept bitterly:</hi> So also of
those, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. it is said, <hi>They were pricked in their
hearts:</hi> for the ground of their sorrow is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
of the judgement, which workes upon the
affections; therefore Christ saith, <hi>The Spirit shall
come to convince the world of sinne, &amp;c. Ioh.</hi> 16. 8. The
other sorrow not arising from this convincing of
the judgement, is but a passion, and so is streight
gone; this is an affection, and so is more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
although it is stiller, as the deepest water; are
ever stillest. And so much for the second que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>The third question is,<note place="margin">Quest. 3.</note> How shall he know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
these sorrowes of his be true or no?</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> There is an Humiliation not
deepe enough,<note place="margin">How to know true sorrow.</note> a sleight Humiliation; and there is
another too deepe, which so drownes vs in sorrow
that it takes away all hope of salvation, and brings
despaire, such was the sorrow of <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel:</hi>
but the third and true, is an indifferent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
both: sometimes there may be an humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and no grace, as there may be a plowing and

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> hypocrite may;<note place="margin">In the rise.</note> first, be wounded with Gods
wrath: secondly, desire freedome from hell; but
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23445:29"/>
into the godly God doth instill gracious seeds,
whereby hee is humbled for sinne as well as hell,
and desires grace as well as mercy: But the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
onely desires mercy and freedome from these
torments, and therefore when the terrour ceaseth
his holinesse and desire of goodnesse ceaseth, and
so being eased from the torments, he cares for no
more; but the godly hee desires to be joyned to
Christ, and to have his lusts mortified.</p>
               <p>Secondly, in the continuance of it: hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
humiliation may be longer or shorter,<note place="margin">In the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance.</note> but it is
never constant,<note place="margin">Bousion Cons. 299.</note> it doth vanish; but true humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
doth last all the life long.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Simile.</hi>
                  </note> The humiliation
of hypocrites is like iron, which while it is hot
in the fire you may fashion it which way you will,
but when it is once out, it is presently stiffe againe:
So <hi>Pharaoh</hi> as long as Gods hand was on him, hee
would let the people goe, but as soone as the fire
of affliction was removed, his heart was hardned,
so was <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Saul.</hi> But in true humiliation God
takes away the iron heart, &amp; gives an heart of flesh,
so that although it may be brawnie a little, yet still
it is flesh: Hypocrites so long onely as they are
under the judgement are soft, but the heart of the
godly is alwaies soft.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">By the signes and effects.</note> by
the signes of brokennesse of heart:<note place="margin">Contrition of heart.</note>
Now brokennesse of heart</p>
               <p>1. Heales our sinnes. First, the beloved, the
master sinne,<note place="margin">1. Heales our Sinnes.</note> and then all the rest: other humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
skinne over, but cures not; it stops the streame
for a while, but it breakes out againe: it may cause
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23445:30"/>
you to make many purposes to leave the sinne; yea,
and to leave it awhile, but you will returne to
them againe; whereas if one bee truly humbled
he is stronger against that beloved sin than against
any other; not but that hee hath strong inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to that sinne, but hee is more shye of it, and
shunnes the occasions of that sinne, because hee
hath fully felt the smart of it, and hath by his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
seene that sinne more than any other.
Now after the beloved sinne is once healed, then
the other sinnes will soone be healed;<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as in a cloth
by washing out a deeper staine, the same labour
doth wash out lesser staines.</p>
               <p>2. It causeth love of Christ:<note place="margin">2. It causeth love to Christ:</note> So <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi>
because she was humbled much, and saw that
Christ had forgiven her much, therefore she loved
much. So <hi>Paul,</hi> who was much humbled, ever
expressed a servent love to Christ, as we may see,
<hi>Acts</hi> 21. 13. where hee saith, having beene per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded
by his friends not to goe to Jerusalem,
<hi>I am ready not to bee bound, but also to dye for the name
of the Lord Iesus:</hi> as who should say, I feare no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
because I care for nothing but Christ, So
also, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14. he saith, <hi>The love of Christ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straineth
mee:</hi> and therefore when by humiliation
we see what Christ hath done for us, we thinke we
can never doe enough for him.</p>
               <p>Now you may know if you love Christ or not,<note place="margin">Signs to know whether we love Christ or no.</note>
by these signes:</p>
               <p>The first signe to know the love of Christ,<note place="margin">1. Obedience.</note> is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
Hee that loveth Christ, keepeth his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23445:30"/>
Commandements, and they are not grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him.</p>
               <p>The second signe is this;<note place="margin">2. Affection towards him.</note> If you love him, you
shall finde in your heart that you love him, your
heart will be carried towards him; as I can tell
if I love a man, for then my heart is carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him.</p>
               <p>The third signe to know the love of Christ,<note place="margin">3. The light prizing of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall things.</note> is
this; It causeth me to esteeme of spirituall things,
to prize them at an high rate, and other things lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
worth: for when a man is soundly humbled,
aske him then what he desires most, he will answer
Christ and Grace, and that his corruptions may
cease in him; as for outward things, hee passeth
not for them: as a man that sees he must dye, hee
cares for no outward wealth, take you that, give
him onely the pardon of his sinnes.</p>
               <p>The fourth signe of the love of Christ, is this;
It maketh him content with the meanest conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">4. Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with the meanest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</note>
The prodigall Sonne, when he was humbled,
so he might be in his fathers house he was content;
he liked the meanest condition, even to be a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant;
<hi>I am unworthy to be thy sonne, make mee as one
of thy hired servants, Luk.</hi> 15. 21. So <hi>Paul,</hi> after hee
was humbled, thought himselfe unworthy for the
Saints company, and that not for a fit onely, but
even ever after he still cryes out, <hi>I am unworthy to
be an Apostle.</hi> Thus <hi>Naomi,</hi> returning home to her
Countrey, said, <hi>she went out full,</hi> and yet had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but her selfe, sonnes, and husband; she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
any thing too much for her. If a man
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23445:31"/>
once come to be verily perswaded that he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be destroyed, hee can with patience beare
any losses and crosses; for these are nothing to
death, which he knowes he hath deserved; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
what impatience soever thou hast, so much
art thou short of true humiliation.</p>
               <p>The fifth signe to know we love Christ,<note place="margin">5. Feare of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending God.</note> is this;
It makes us fearefull of offending God: tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of conscience is ever according to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of true humiliation; for by how much the
more we are humbled, by so much doe wee feare
to offend God, and labour to walke obediently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him. <hi>Esay</hi> 66. 2. the Lord saith, <hi>To him will I
looke that is poore and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth
at my word:</hi> If thou art of a contrite heart, thou
wilt tremble at his words; that is, at his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements;
such an one feares to breake any
Commandement, he is sensible of the least sinne:
Hence it is, that <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 14. feare is opposed to
hardnesse of heart; <hi>Happy is the man that feareth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
but he that hardneth his heart shall fall into mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe:</hi>
Now the opposite to hardnesse, is broken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of heart, but feare is opposed to it because
it is a signe of brokennesse of heart. Now this fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
stands in two things:</p>
               <p>1. In a facility to be convicted of any sinne;
for he that is not thus broken in heart, stands out
with God, and will not yeeld unto him.</p>
               <p>2. In a feare to offend God; for when hee is
once convinced, he labours to doe according to his
knowledge; and then is afraid to displease God, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:23445:31"/>
1 In committing the least sinne; as <hi>Moses</hi> would
not leave the least hoofe behinde him; and
as <hi>Iob</hi> feared lest his <hi>sonnes should have sinned
in heart, Iob</hi> 1. 4. He was so truly humbled,
that hee would not sacrifice for owne sinnes
onely, but even for his sonnes also, and that
the least, the thoughts of their hearts.</p>
               <p>2 In omitting the least good duty, or doing it
formally; which thing the hypocrite cannot
doe, because he hath not this tendernesse of
conscience.</p>
               <p>The sixth signe of the love of Christ,<note place="margin">6. The finding of sweetnesse in the word of God.</note> is this;
It makes Gods Word sweet unto us; as it was to
<hi>David, Sweeter than the honie and the home-combe:</hi>
Crummes are sweet to an hungry man; so if a
man hunger after the Gospell, it will <hi>be sweet unto
him.</hi> Indeed if the Word be sweetened with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Eloquence, it may bee sweet to one that is
carnall (for so it is pleasing to nature,) but if the
purer it is, and the more it is seperated from those
gaudy flowers; if the more piercing it is, the
sweeter it is to us, then it is a signe of a broken
heart; for it is a reproach to those that have not
a broken heart, and so it cannot be sweet: as wee
may see, <hi>Ier</hi> 6 10. where the Lord saith, <hi>Behold,
their eare is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken:
behold, the Word of the Lord is unto them a reproach,
they have no delight mit.</hi> And againe, the Prophet
saith, <hi>Ier. 15. 16. Thy words were found, and I did
eat them, and thy Word was unto mee the joy and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
of mine heart:</hi> It is joy and rejoycing to those
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23445:32"/>
that have a broken heart, as the Prophet had: nay,
the sharper it is, the more they delight in it.</p>
               <p>The seventh signe of our love to Christ,<note place="margin">7. Meekenesse of spirit.</note> is this;
It causeth meeknesse of spirit. <hi>The spirit that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethin
us</hi> (before we are humbled) <hi>lusteth after en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
Iam.</hi> 4. 5. now every naturall man is so; but he
that is of a broken heart envieth not, he spends his
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nger on himselfe, and lookes to his owne offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
so much, that he regards not others.</p>
               <p>But some man will here bee ready to object
and say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> My nature is hasty, and I cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
it.</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> It is true, every one by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a Lion;<note place="margin">Humiliation changeth our nature.</note> but grace when that comes, it tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s
us into Lambs and meeke Sheepe. <hi>Luk. 3. 4. Iohn</hi>
cryes in the wildernesse, <hi>Prepare the way of the Lord,
&amp;c.</hi> but how? by Humility: <hi>Every high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and hill shall be digged downe, and the crooked shall
be made straight, and the rough wayes shall bee made
smooth:</hi> Humility, which prepareth for Christ,
diggeth downe those high mountaines, and maketh
plaine those rough wayes. I deny not but that
somtimes Gods child may haue a passion of anger;
yet the peace of God rules in his heart, although
that sometimes breakes out as a rebell, but it dwels
not in him: Christ is meeke, and so are all his. And
so much for the third question.</p>
               <p>Now to proceed further in the explication of
Humiliation, and come to the fourth question,
which is this,</p>
               <p>Whether this Humiliation must be in all men,<note place="margin">Quest. 4.</note>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:23445:32"/>
as well in those which are well educated, and
have fallen into no grosse sinnes, as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers?</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> yes; it must be in all, even this great
Humiliation here spoken of, else let them goe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so farre, they will in the end fall away: and
that is the very reason why so many Professors, that
have given up their names to follow Christ, fall
away, because they were never humbled soundly
for sinne.</p>
               <p>Yet there is this difference betwixt the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
of one brought up well,<note place="margin">The differen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of humiliation in one well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated and a grosse sinner.</note> and a grosse
sinner:</p>
               <p>1. The filth of sinne is not so suddenly revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to those that have beene well brought up, and
have some knowledge, and therefore they are not
so suddenly smitten, as to those that lived in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
all their life long: those that have a light on
the sudden, it presently amazeth them; even so
God strikes downe suddenly the grosse sinner, and
amazes him with a more violent sorrow and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,
than he doth the other.</p>
               <p>2. The Joy is not so sudden, nor flashing, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
sensible in him that hath more knowledge; the
medicine is knowne to him as soone as the wound:
he knowes Christ a Saviour offered up for all that
are wounded for sinne, and so as soone as he feeles
the wound he applies the medicine; so is not his
trouble so irkesome, neither being delivered hath
he such sensible joy: For instance, Suppose a man
be in the way wounded among theeves, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23445:33"/>
killed, so that he saw no meanes of life; if
one, a friend of his, on the sudden should steppe
forth and helpe him, hee would be more sensible
of it, than such an one as knowing before he shall
be robbed, getteth company to goe with him, and
so escapes the danger. And so much for the fourth
question.</p>
               <p>The fifth question is this;<note place="margin">Quest. 5.</note> What is the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of Humiliation that must be in one that will
be saved?</p>
               <p>I answer, it is so much as will bring us home
to Christ;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> that is, so much as will make us ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
sinne to be the greatest evill in the world,<note place="margin">The least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation will make us count sin the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test cuill, Christ the greatest good</note>
and Christ to be the greatest good; so much as
will enable us to make sinne our chiefest sorrow,
and Christ our chiefest joy: when wee doe so,
then whatsoever is offered we neglect for Christ,
and preferre him. Thence is it that the Churches
are said to <hi>rejoyce in Christ with joy unspeakeable and
glorious, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. 8. For when we apprehend sinne
to be the greatest evill, and by Christ to beefreed
from it,<note place="margin">A mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in three things.</note> we must needs rejoyce unspeakably. For
wee are to know that our conversion consists in
threethings:</p>
               <p>1. In being soundly humbled, so that wee see
sinne to be the greatest evill in the world.</p>
               <p>2. In stedfastly laying hold of Christ, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving
in him, so that wee will not part with him
for any thing in the world.</p>
               <p>3. In a newnesse of life, walking in obedience
to all his Commandements: and therefore Christ
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23445:33"/>
saith, <hi>Iohn 16. Hee will send the Comforter to convince
the world of sinne, and righteousnesse:</hi> first, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for sinne: and in this also there are degrees;
for here one may be humbled more than another,
and so thirst after Christ more; but the more wee
are humbled, the better we are humbled; it is a
signe God hath a greater worke to doe by us,
when we are thus humbled: It is a great fault in
us that we are prone to thinke that we are humbled
enough, and that our humiliation at our first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
was enough; no (beloved) our humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
must not be like a land-flood, that runnes but
for a little time, but like a spring running con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually;
for all degrees in grace, depending on
God, mortification of our lusts, &amp;c. depends on
the degrees of our humiliation; and hee that is
the most humbled, would be much more if he saw
himselfe to be the better. And so much for the
fifth question.</p>
               <p>The sixth question is this,<note place="margin">Quest. 6.</note> How shall we come to
be thus humbled?</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> By the Law; for though the whole
act of our humiliation is wrought by the Law and
the Gospell,<note place="margin">The Law the onely meanes of humiliation</note> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. yet that humiliation which I
now urge, is that legall humiliation which is
wrought by the Law: by the Law, I meane not
onely the ten Commandements, but the rectitude
of our persons to the whole Scripture, which is
the exposition of them: First, consider therefore
how much perfection Gods word requireth, then
how short you come of that perfection; this is one
meanes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:23445:34"/>
I but some man will bee ready to say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> I have
done what I could, and yet I am not humbled.</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> it is not the Law alone that
must humble us, but it must be joyned with the
spirit of bondage; for as to make the Gospell ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
there is required the spirit of consolation,
and a faith to beleeve it; so to make the Law ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall
there is required the spirit of bondage, and
faith proportionable.<note place="margin">The spirit of bondage, what and why re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</note> The spirit of bondage is
that which enlightneth us to see the bondage
wherein we are by reason of our sinnes, and then
is required a faith to beleeve the threats against
those sinnes; for faith is required to beleeve
Gods threats as well as his promises; faith in the
generall being nothing but a lifting us up to see
what nature cannot: for when the uncleane person
is threatned he is not moved because he beleeves
not.</p>
               <p>But here some man will be ready to object and
say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Afflictions often humbleus, therefore it is not
the Law that doth it.</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> Afflictions, as the plow, make
way,<note place="margin">How afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and the Law concurre to humiliation</note> but it is the seed of the Law sowne in our
hearts that must humble us: indeed those notions,
which they had before, are in afflictions made to
seem otherwise then before: but we must take heed
that afflictions cause not worldly sorrow, for that
is the applying of the corrosive to a whole place.</p>
               <p>Now you must know that there is an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
humiliation which God at some times
workes in some men; we urge not to that, (God
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23445:34"/>
workes that in whom he pleaseth, and intendeth to
make extraordinary,) wee urge to the ordinary
humiliation. Now the meanes to attaine that, are
these five:</p>
               <p>The first meanes to aftaine humiliation,<note place="margin">Five meanes to humiliatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> is, To
enter into a serious consideration of our estate, as
the prodigall Sonne did;<note place="margin">1. Meanes, to consider our estates.</note> he is said, <hi>Luk. 15. to
come to himselfe,</hi> and consider that his father had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
and he starved. So every one of us should
doe: consider</p>
               <p>First, the greatnesse of thy sinnes in particular,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
and make Catalogues of them.</p>
               <p>And then secondly, let our actuall sinnes leade <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
us to our corrupt heart, which is the root of all.
So God dealt with the children of Israel, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.
2. where it is said, <hi>God led them forty yeares in the
wildernesse, to humble them, and to prove them, and
to know what was in their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Hee himselfe
knew it well enough, but by their sinnes he would
make it knowne to themselves and others. So al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
God dealt with <hi>Hezekias, 2 Chron.</hi> 32. 31. Where
it is said, <hi>God left him, to try him, and to know all
that was in his heart. Hezekiah</hi> had a proud heart,
and God left him to himselfe, not that God might
know what was in his heart, but that hee himselfe
might know. So God tels the Israelites, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.
31. <hi>Yee shall remember your owne evill wayes, and
your doings that were not good, and shall loath your
selves in your owne sight for your iniquity, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Having thus considered your sinnes,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
consider Gods wrath, and the certainty of it; the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:23445:35"/>
wrath of a King is the messenger of death, what
then is the wrath of almighty God? even as the
power of God is more than the power of man, so
is his wrath also: as long as he lives, so long will
he punish thee in hell. The consideration of this
made <hi>Moses</hi> breake out, <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. and say, <hi>Who knowes
the power of his wrath? Paul</hi> is in great heavinesse for
the Iewes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. And as God shewed his almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
power in making of man, so will he in destroying
and punishing. And this wrath of his shall fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the most sensible part of man, <hi>viz.</hi> the soule,
which as it is capable of the greatest measure of
joy, so is it capable of the greatest measure of
griefe. What is God but infinite? what is his wrath
but infinite? under it thou shalt most wish for death,
which now thou most fearest.</p>
               <p>The second meanes to obtaine Humiliation,<note place="margin">1. Meanes, to suffer sorrow to abide on us</note> is,
to stay a great while on this consideration, to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
sorrow to abide on our hearts; for it is the oft
and serious consideration that effects this: and
therefore we may learne something from Sathan,
when he would drive a man to despaire, he oft puts
thoughts of Gods wrath due unto our sinnes into
our mindes, hee holds the object close unto our
mindes, and so letteth us thinke of nothing else. It
is the frequent and seirous consideration of these
things that humbleth us: This was that that hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<hi>David, Psal. 51. My sinne was alwaies before me:</hi>
so <hi>Iam. 4. 8. cleanse your hands ye sinners, and purifie
your hearts yee double minded:</hi> How is that done?
<hi>vers. 9. be afflicted and mourne:</hi> all waveringnesse
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:23445:35"/>
and instability comes from the corruption of the
heart, and therefore cleanse that; and the way to
cleanse that is to be humbled; and the way to be
humbled is to sequester your selfe from all carnall
mirth (though else lawfull) and stay on these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</p>
               <p>The third meanes is this; If you cannot see
sinne in it selfe,<note place="margin">3. Meanes see sinne in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> effects.</note> labour to see it in his effects. All
miseries which you feele in your selfe, or know in
others, are the fruits of it; and this will make you
say, it is a bitter thing to sinne; so <hi>Peter</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Epistle and second chapter, by this effect ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates
sinne, where he shewes it was for sinne
that the Angels were throwne downe into hell,
that the old world was drowned, that <hi>Sodome</hi> and
<hi>Gomorrah</hi> were destroyed.</p>
               <p>The fourth meanes to attaine humiliation is,<note place="margin">4. Meanes, to make these e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilspresent by faith.</note> to
make these evils present before you by faith: as in
an opticke glasse, those things that are a far off will
seeme neere to those that looke in it; so these by
faith should seeme at the very doore: it may be the
not considering them as present makes them not
affect you; for what is a farre off, although it be in
it selfe feareful, yet is not feared, as death, &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
set hell before your eyes, and see it as present
before you.</p>
               <p>Make present unto you these two things:<note place="margin">Two things ought to be present before vs.</note>
               </p>
               <p>1 All sinnes past: a thing that is past vs will
seeme small unto us, though it be as great as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
it was before, and so doe our sinnes to us:
we usually doe as men that leave something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:23445:36"/>
them, when they are far gone they thinke
it is but a little, and therefore they will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
for it; so we being far off from our sinnes,
they seeme little unto us, but we must remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
the day of our iniquity. Let us therefore
make them our sinnes present, God he esteemes
them as great as ever they were, let us doe so
therefore, let them seeme abominable to us:
thus did <hi>Iob</hi> possesse the sinnes of his youth.</p>
               <p>2. Things future: as Gods judgements, which are
neere at hand, and lye at the doore, as God saies
to <hi>Cain,</hi> although they seeme to us a farre off:
But this is Satans cunning to deceive us; he is as
a Painter, who by the collusion of colors makes
things seeme far off which are nigh; so he makes
Gods wrath which lyes at our doore, seeme a
farre off, when as it may bee it will light on us
the next day.</p>
               <p>The fifth meanes to attaine Humiliation,<note place="margin">5. Meanes. To take heed of shifts;</note> is,
To take heed of all such false shifts whereby
you may seeme to keepe off the blow of Gods
law from lighting on you: wee are never moved
with these considerations untill all shifts are
removed; so that wee see nothing but death, and
then we tremble.</p>
               <p>The shifts by which men thinke to keepe off the
blow of Gods judgments,<note place="margin">Eight shifts, whereby men think to keep off iudgments</note> and so with-hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from being humbled, are these eight:</p>
               <p>1 Civilitie;<note place="margin">1. Civility.</note> this Gloworme of civility so glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth
in the darke, that wee thinke it to bee a true
sparke of grace, but where the spirit shines wee
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:23445:36"/>
shall finde it false: and as the Divell deludeth
Witches, in giving them leaves instead of silver
and gold, so doth hee deale with thee here; for
except there be a supernaturall frame of thy hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,
there is not cause of comfort notwithstanding all
thy civility: and therefore thou must bee sure to
have something in thee more than nature, for civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
will not bring to heaven.</p>
               <p>2 Formall performance of holy duties;<note place="margin">2. Formall performance of holy duties.</note> as
praying, reading, &amp;c. that puffes men up, and keeps
them from humiliation. If you either omitted
them altogether, then your conscience would
checke you; or performed them well, then your
heart would be bettered, and you would be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
but this formall doing of them keepes the
heart dead and senslesse. Remember therefore that
no sacrifice is acceptable to God, but that that
comes from a <hi>Broken heart, Psal.</hi> 51.</p>
               <p>3 The badnesse of your nature;<note place="margin">3. Badn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sse of nature.</note> you would
doe better, but your nature is so bad that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not.
But remember,<note place="margin">Two cautions</note> first, That that aggravates your
sinne, and God likes you the worse for that, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
will the hardlier pardon you; even as wee our
selves are readiest to pardon an offence in a good
nature. Secondly, your selfe is the cause of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
badnesse of your nature: God gave you in <hi>Adam</hi>
a good nature, but you have lost it, and since by
many sinnes have made it worse by farre.</p>
               <p>4 Gods mercy:<note place="margin">4. Gods mercy</note> he is mercifull, therefore you
will not feare: but what if hee be mercifull, hee
calls not thee, thou art not burdened with thy
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:23445:37"/>
sinnes, he cals onely such, <hi>Come unto mee all ye that
are heavy laden, and I will ease you.</hi> What hast thou
to doe with mercy, which seest not thy misery?
thou hast no part in it, as <hi>Iehu</hi> said to <hi>Iezabell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>5 The making conscience of many things;<note place="margin">5. The making conscience of many things.</note>
so <hi>Herod</hi> did many things after <hi>Iohns</hi> preaching; so
the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did by nature the things contained in
the Law, yet were without God, <hi>Rom</hi> 2. but there
is no example like unto that of <hi>Amazia, 2 Chron.
25. 2. he did that which was right in the sight of the
Lord</hi> for a long time, <hi>but not with a perfect heart.</hi>
One may make conscience of praying in private,
and of doing many good duties, and yet have no
true grace, but doe all out of a naturall conscience
for feare of punishment.</p>
               <p>6. Because Judgements come not swiftly,<note place="margin">6. The delay of executing of judgement</note> and
are not speedily executed, Ministers threaten but
they feele nothing: But wee must know, that the
lesse afflictions we have had, the more are behind;
and I know not a more miserable condition than
this is; it is a most dangerous signe thou art or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to death, when thou art thus let alone vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punisht:
As we use to say, when men are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sicke there is no danger of death,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but when they
never have beene sicke, and at length fall into it, it
is very dangerous; so it is to be feared, that when
once God beginnes with thee, hee will make an
end, as hee threatned to <hi>Hophnie</hi> and <hi>Phincas;</hi> hee
will so strike, that he will not strike twice: so that
nothing can be worse, than for a sinner to goe on
without trouble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:23445:37"/>
7. Men judge their estates and sinnes in a false
ballance of opinion:<note place="margin">7. A false opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their estates,</note> none (say they) thinke ill
of them, but a few that are more precise than wise.
But consider:</p>
               <p>1 That Ministers are onely the men by whom
ye beleeve,<note place="margin">Three cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> not whom ye should beleeve: take our
words but so farre forth as they are proved unto <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
you by Scripture; and if they be true, then (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
few be of that minde) yet you ought to
beleeve them.</p>
               <p>2 Consider whether that latitude of Religion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
which thou stickest unto, and hopest to bee saved
by, will serve thee on thy death-bed, and at the day
of Judgement.</p>
               <p>3. Consider that it is the part of holy men, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
of none else, to discerne which are the wayes of
God: every one is to be beleeved in his owne art,
therefore beleeve them.</p>
               <p>Men thinke that it concernes onely some to bee
holy,<note place="margin">8. An opinion that some should be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and not all.</note> as Ministers, &amp;c. and not all. I will answer
such with the saying of <hi>Wisedome, The way of
godlinesse is too high for a foole:</hi> If thou wert wise,
thou wouldest thinke it concerned thee also.</p>
               <p>Now I beseech you (brethren) humble your
selves,<note place="margin">Vse.</note> and so much the rather, because now the
time and necessity of the Church requires it, now
while shee is thus in her mourning gowne seeke
not after your profits and pleasures, drinke not
Wine in bowles, use not now the liberties that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
lawfully you might. Remember that
saying of <hi>Vriah, 2 Sam. 11. 11. The Arke, and Israel,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:23445:38"/>
and Iudah abide in tents, and my Lord Ioab, and the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of my Lord are encamped in the open fields, shall
I then goe into my house to eat and to drinke, and to
lye with my wife? &amp;c.</hi> And doe as <hi>Daniel</hi> did, <hi>chap.</hi>
9. Now practise all the parts of Humiliation, now
Gods Church needeth it; although you your
selves were free, yet humble your selves for the
sinnes of others; continually pray to God for
them. Remember what God threatneth to those,
<hi>Esa.</hi> 22. 12. that when he called to mourning, they
followed their pleasure; hee saith, He will not
forget it to the death: so <hi>Esa.</hi> 66. 4. God is angry
with all that neglect this duty, and will not bee
stirred up to performe it; but those that doe call
on him he will heare. The <hi>unrighteous Iudge, Luk.</hi>
18. was overcome by importunity, and then much
more will God: if we humble our selves, as <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decay,
Ester</hi> 4. 14. concluded excellently, <hi>Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
shall arise from another place;</hi> so may we;
then certainly the Church shall stand, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
shal fall, as a mill-stone into the sea, never
to rise up againe. I grant hee may rage very farre,
he hath raged farre already, and how farre more
he shall rage, God onely knowes; yet in the end,
certaine it is he shall fall, &amp; the Church shall stand.
Let us all therefore be humbled, you which have
not yet begunne this humiliation, now beginne;
and yee which have begunne, bee stedfast therein,
knowing that your labour shall not bee in vaine in
the Lord.</p>

               <p>The next thing to be shewed after this doctrine
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:23445:38"/>
that <hi>wee are dead in sinne,</hi> is the meanes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
our life, and that is <hi>by Christ,</hi> as it is in the

<hi>Hee,</hi> that is, Chist hath done it. Hence learne
this doctrine of comfort, as a refreshing cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
next after the bitter potion of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
That:</p>
               <p>Whosoever will come to Christ,<note place="margin">Doctr. 3.</note> may come and finde
mercy, Rev. 22. 17. Whosever will,<note place="margin">3 Things in the doctrine,</note> let him taste of
the waters of life freely. <hi>Here I will shew:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1 What is meant by <hi>will (whosoever will</hi>) that
is,<note place="margin">1 Taking of Christ.</note> he that will receive Christ with all his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
to be his Lord and his Ruler, &amp;c.
Whosoever will thus take Christ hee may: if
wee would take Christ before wee were hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
we might, but till we be humbled we will
not take him. It is Christ that gives life, but till
we be hungry we wil not take him and eat him:
the Sunne enlighteneth,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> but the window lets it
in; Christ gives life, but our hungring after
him makes us eat him, which we will not doe
untill wee be humbled.</p>
               <p>2 <hi>May come to Christ</hi>] that is,<note place="margin">2 Laying hold of him.</note> receive him,
and beleeve in him; it is but laying hold of him
when hee sees he must perish,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as a man that is

and there will lie and rest; so wee seeing wee

                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:23445:39"/>
for Christ is a common fountaine, he that will,
may come; As <hi>Iohn 7. 3, 7. If any man thirst, let
him come unto mee and drinke: hee that beleeveth in
mee,</hi> as saith the Scripture, <hi>out of his belly shall
flow living waters:</hi> and againe, <hi>Iob. 3. 16. God gave
his onely begotten Sonne, that whosoever beleeved in
him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</hi> As
the old <hi>Adam</hi> was a common root of sinne and
damnation; so is Christ the second <hi>Adam,</hi> of
grace and salvation: as at the yeere of <hi>Iubilee,</hi>
when the trumpet sounded, whosoever would
might goe free, but if any would be sollavish as
to serve, they might; so now to Christ, now he
calleth, whosoever will, may goe free and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered;
but if there be any so flavish minded
as to stay, they may.</p>
               <p>The grounds of this Doctrine why I thus ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
deliver it,<note place="margin">The grounds of the Doctrin generally.</note> are these:</p>
               <p>1 Because else there were no ground of our
faith;<note place="margin">1 Otherwise no ground of our faith.</note> faith must have a ground of Scripture,
and the Scripture makes no particular promise
to any man; it saith not, thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> or thou
<hi>Iohn,</hi> shalt be saved, but it faith, <hi>Whosoever will,
let him come, and drinke freely of the water of life:</hi>
Then we say, but I will; therefore on this
ground is the strength of faith, that whosoever
will, may come.</p>
               <p>2 Because faith is about things that are;<note place="margin">2. Faith is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout things that are.</note>
faith presupposeth his object: God gives the
generall promise, <hi>Whosoever will beleeve, shall be
saved:</hi> This is the object of faith, this premised
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:23445:39"/>
the faith followeth; and is the the cause of all
the consequences, as that Christ is mine, I
am sanctified, justified, &amp;c. these follow faith,
but the object is before, <hi>viz.</hi> that whosoever wil
come to Christ, may: as, if I beleeve the world
is created, then it must first be created; so if I
beleeve, I shall be saved, if I goe to Christ, then
I must first have this, for to beleeve, that <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
will come to Christ, may come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To exhort so many as are humbled for sinne,<note place="margin">Vse.</note>
and see what need they have of Christ, to come
to him to be quickened; the fountaine is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
so that, be thy sinnes never so many, or great
however, committed of knowledge after many
vowes or covenants, yet if thou art so touched
and humbled for thy sinnes, that thou truely
thirstest after Christ, if thou wilt take him,
thou maist. To those onely that are humbled
is this wide doore of comfort opened; art thou
but humbled, let thy sinne be never so great,
suppose it be of murther, uncleannesse, &amp;c. let
them be aggravated with all the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
yet if thou canst be but humbled, and then
lay hold on Christ thou maiest, Read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9.
See what great sinnes those were, how can you
name greater? <hi>Neither fornicator, nor idolater, nor
adulter, nor effeminate, now abusers of themselves with
mankind, nor theeves, nor covetous, nor drunkards,
nor revilers, not extortioners, shall inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of God. And such were some of you: But yee
are washed but ye are sanctified, but ye are iustified, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:23445:40"/>
Nay, suppose you have not one jot of holinesse,
nor of godly sorrow, yet doe but take Christ,
and hee is thine. To looke for sorrow and
holinesse before thou takest Christ, is to looke
for life before the soule. Therefore doe but
take him and hee is thine: for,</p>
               <p>1 The promise is free without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
If godly sorrow and grace were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
it were not free; godly sorrow and
grace followes faith, but are not required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it.</p>
               <p>2 The promise is generall, <hi>Mark. 16. 16.
Goe yee unto all the world, and preach the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
to every creature:</hi> If therefore there be any
poore soule touched with his sinnes, so as
hee will doe or suffer any thing for Christ,
to him I speake comfort, to him Christ doth
belong, thou maiest have CHRIST if thou
wilt.</p>
               <p>But some man will here be ready to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> Then every one will take him.</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">

                  </note> Every one would take him
for a Saviour,<note place="margin">Every one would take Christ as a Saviour, but not as a Lord.</note> but there be conditions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                  <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is no condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to those which are in Christ Iesus, who walke not
after the flesh, but after the spirit.</hi> If there be no
condemnation to those which walke after the
spirit; then certainely there is condemnation
to those which walke after the flesh: So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
<hi>Rom. 6. 14. Sin hath no dominion over you, for
you are not under the law, but under grace;</hi> that is, if
sin hath but dominion over you, then were you
in the estate of death: if but any lust hath do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
over you, so that you must yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to it, you are not in the estate of grace, but
of damnation: and the reason hereof is vers. 18.
because, <hi>you are the servants of sinne, (for his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
you are whom you obey.</hi>) Suppose you have
but any one predominant sinne, it is enough to
damme thee. There are some that can deny the
sin of lusts, but for to leave their company, that
they cannot doe: Againe, some can leave their
company, but by no meanes will part with the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:23445:42"/>
sinne of lust; some can part with both: but for
their riches, they will not part with a penny;
and so for other particulars, many will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to part with some of their sins, but one is so
sweet, that they will not part with it. But let all
such know, that if they have but any one sinne
to rule and reigne so in them, that they must
needs obey it; if it be so sweet unto them, that
they cannot leave it, they are in the estate of
condemnation: yea, if they continue but in any
one knowne sinne, for there is but one way to
heaven, but by-waies a thousand: now, if thou
takest but one by-way, it will leade thee from
heaven as well as if twenty; for the right way
to hit the marke, is but one, but there are many
by-waies wherein we may misse.</p>
               <p>I added, <hi>Whosoever walketh in any knowne sinne.</hi>
Indeed, a man may sometimes by chance slip
out of the way into some sinne; but I meane
not such a man, but him that maketh some sinne
his continuall walke.</p>
               <p>But every one will be ready to say; This is a
hard saying,<note place="margin">By reason.</note> and who can indure it? I will
therefore shew you some reasons for it.</p>
               <p>The first reason is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> 1.</note> because, that whosoever
walketh in any knowne sinne,<note place="margin">Hee that wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in sin is overcome of sinne.</note> is overcome of
sinne, and whosoever is overcome of sinne can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be saved. Indeed, a godly man may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
be foiled, but never is overcome, and at
the last getteth the victory: But when a man
assimulates himselfe to sinne, and without any
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:23445:43"/>
reluctation is overcome of it, striving no more
against it, as fire when it is ouercome by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that man is certainely in the estate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.
This is the meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
<hi>Peter, 2 Pet. 2. 9. While they promise them liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
they themselves are the servants of corruption, for
of whom a man is overcome, of the same hee is brought
in bondage:</hi> If any sinne overcome thee, thou art
in the estate of damnation. It will not serve our
turne, to use those weake excuses, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
is our plea; to say, wee cannot leave
them, because we are flesh and blood, and they
are naturally in us.</p>
               <p>The second reason is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reason.</hi> 2.</note> because, whosoev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r
walketh in any knowne sinne,<note place="margin">In him sinne hath the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est command, and God no place.</note> in him sinne is
predominant, and hath the chiefe command,
and where that hath the chiefe command and
rules, God hath no place; for the motion fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes
the predominant element; if godlinesse
be predominant, that moves us and rules us;
if sinne be predominant in us, that rules us. As
a man speaketh out of the abundance that is
in his heart, so also he worketh out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
that is in his heart. This is plaine, for
when Christ would shew their hearts to be
bad, hee biddeth them consider their speech;
and if he could gather the naughtinesse of their
hearts by their speech, then certainly much
more by their actions and workes.</p>
               <p>I,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> but some may say, I have a secret sinne in
my heart, yet it breaketh not forth; I keepe it
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:23445:43"/>
in, and will not suffer it to come out, and so long
it is not predominant, neither doth it beare
rule, neither doth he walke after it, but covers
it.</p>
               <p>I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> they have so, and though they doe
not walke after them, yet they are not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for that, for God judgeth according to the
inward heart, he judgeth according to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
we aime at in our owne hearts, he feeth the
secret bent of the heart which way it is; it
may seeme contrary to the eyes of men, but hee
judgeth not according to the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
but hee judgeth with righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>The third reason is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reas.</hi> 3.</note> because, that whosoever
lyeth in any knowne sinne,<note place="margin">Hee is an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite.</note> is an hypocrite, and
no hypocrite can be saved, though he doth other
things never so well; for such an one hangeth
not like the sprigge, but like a bough that is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
rent off the olive tree, which can never
prosper. If he did but a little, and yet did it in
sinceritie, it would be accepted, whereas, while
he doth much,<note place="margin">God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect unto small things with sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more than many great things with hypocrisie.</note> yet in hypocrisie, God regardeth
it not. This I finde by comparing these two
places together. 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 25. 2. And 2 <hi>Cron.</hi> 15.
17. In the first place it is said, that <hi>Amazia did
that which was right in the sight of the Lord, but not
with a perfect heart,</hi> and therefore God rejected
him: the meaning is, that he was not through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
perfect, but had some secret sinne in him,
therefore God rejected him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:23445:44"/>
Now, in the other place, It is said, <hi>The hears
of</hi> Asa <hi>was perfect all his daies;</hi> yet as we may read,
he had many infirmities: as 1 He put not away
the high places: 2 He relied upon the King of
<hi>Egypt:</hi> 3 He trusted on the Physicians: 4 He
put the Prophet into prison. Yet notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
all these infirmities, it is said, <hi>his heart was
perfect,</hi> because that these did not rule in him:
For, where there is found humiliation wrought
in any man, he, though these through infirmity
may be in him, yet he walketh not after them;
and then only humiliation is good, when a man
is desirous to be rid of his sinnes; and this the
hypocrite wanteth, because there is rottennesse
at the core, and his heart is not truly sound.</p>
               <p>The fourth reason is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reason</hi> 4,</note> because that hee that
walketh but in any one knowne sinne,<note place="margin">He is ready to runne into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sins upon occasion.</note> if he had
but tentation unto other sinnes, he would runne
into them also. Thence is that of the Apostle
<hi>Iames 2. 10, 11. Whosoever shall keep the whole law,
and yet offend in one point, is guiltie of all;</hi> his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that if such a man had but as strong ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
unto other sins, he would commit them
also; for if a man doeth any duty out of sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
he would do all, because that God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
all, as it followeth in the same place: <hi>For
he that said, Doe not commit adulterie, said also, Doe
not kill: Now, if thou commit not adulterie, yet if thou
kill, thou art become a transgressor of the whole Law.</hi>
For, looke what sinne soever thou art tempted
unto, the same thou wilt commit, and if a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:23445:44"/>
tentations should as much beset thee, thou
wouldest yeeld to them all as well as to one.</p>
               <p>For the better meaning of the point,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi>
                  </note> here it
may be demanded, what this walking is.<note place="margin">What this wal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king is.</note>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> It is a metaphor taken from
the manner of men in their most usuall and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
carriage of themselves;<note place="margin">Right walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is knowne</note> and therefore it
needes some explanation,<note place="margin">1 By the choice of the way.</note> because it is a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
speech. Now it is discerned by these
foure things.</p>
               <p>First, See what way a man chooseth to walke
in; If a man by accident happeneth to fall into
some by-path, where lies not his journy, that
way is not of his choosing, hee is not said to
walke in that way: <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 30. There <hi>David</hi>
saith, <hi>I have chosen the way of truth, thy iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have I laid before me.</hi> His meaning is, when
hee did wholly consider what journie to take,
then hee fell into Gods path, and went in his
waies; this was his resolution. If then after
consideration thou hast a full purpose and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
resolution to go in the paths of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
thou walkest right.</p>
               <p>2 See what way thou goest forward in,<note place="margin">2 By the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse therin.</note> for
that way thou walkest in; if a man choose a
way, and goe not on in that way, it is nothing:
<hi>David, Psal.</hi> 119. 32. saies, <hi>I will runne the way
of thy commandements, when thou shalt inlarge my
heart.</hi> But many are here deceived, they thinke
they have chosen the waies of God, and yet go
on in the waies of sinne; if they would walke
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:23445:45"/>
aright, they must hold on the paths of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>3 See what companions and guides you
choose for your journie;<note place="margin">3 By compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and guides.</note> if thou professe thou
hast chosen the waies of God, and yet dost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in the same sinfull pleasures thou didest
desire, thou maiest say what thou wilt, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein
it is, that thou art the same man thou wert:
for <hi>Davids</hi> resolution, when hee walked in this
path, was quite contrary, he saies, <hi>Away from me
yee that worke iniquitie, for I will now keepe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of my God.</hi> And this is laid downe
in the Text: if therefore wee follow the same
guides, the world, the flesh and the divell, wee
still go wrong, and are not yet in the right way.</p>
               <p>4 See what provision thou makest for the
place before thou come thither;<note place="margin">4 By the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision wee make.</note> See whether
thou seekest God or the divell. A man that is
to travell into <hi>Italy,</hi> or any other country to traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke
there, will be sure to provide afore hand
for his journie; doe thou likewise, see for what
country thou bringest exchange for; if thou
laist out all here for heaven, it is a signe thou art
travelling thither; but if wee will make ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke
of a good conscience, and all our care is
to gaine here, it is a plaine signe we walke not
aright; and that wee mind nothing lesse than
heaven. Now, thus much for the meaning of
walking.</p>
               <p>The uses follow:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 1.</note> 1 This should be a triall
for us to examine ourselves,<note place="margin">For triall to see whether we walke in the right way or no.</note> whether wee be
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:23445:45"/>
living men or no; for if we be living, then we
walke, and if wee walke, then wee are to see
whether we walke in the right way or not; for,
this is the scope of the Aposte here. Now, this
we may know by that place, <hi>Rom. 8. 1. There is
no condemnation to them which are in Christ Iesus,
who walke not after the flesh, but after the Spirit:</hi>
his meaning is, by this yee shall know, whether
ye are in Christ Jesus or not, if ye are in Christ,
yee walke not after the flesh, but after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.
This is a sure place of triall, and a true
touchstone. And this triall is very necessarie
for us; because, that men live in the Church
as corne lies in the barne, after it is thresht in
the floore. It is called corne from the more
worthy part, and that rightly; yet there is
more chaffe than corne in the heap, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is necessary that the fanne should come
and discerne the chaffe from the true corne: so
in the Church, there is need of the fanne also,
to winnow the good corne from the chaffe. Let
men therefore by these two rules examine
themselves:<note place="margin">Two rules to try whether we walke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right.</note>
                  <list>
                     <item>1 See if it be a knowne sinne.</item>
                     <item>2 See if you continue in any sinne.<note place="margin">1 To see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a knowne sin.</note>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>1 See if it be a knowne sinne. A good man may continue in sinne, and yet
be perfect before God, if hee know it not to be
a sinne; as the Patriarkes lay in polygamie, yet
it was not acounted of before God, because
they knew it not to be a sinne: There were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:23445:46"/>
good Kings continued in it, but if they had
knowne it to be a sinne, they would have forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
it, and therefore, for all that they are said
to serve God:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As for example, a good subject
may be said to be obedient to his Prince, when
it may be he doeth not that which at that time
is his Princes will; because, that if he knew
what were his Princes will, he would doe it:
but if a man willingly commits treason, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be said to be a faithfull subject; so he that
sinnes against knowledge, cannot be a good
man.</p>
               <p>2 See if thy sinne be continued in.<note n="2" place="margin">To see if thy sinne be continued in.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It is the continuance in sin that makes thee
the in estate of condemnation: if it be a knowne
sin a man fals into, yet if he continue not therin,
this is no argument against him, for the godliest
man upon occasion may fall, but such a man is
not himselfe. Hence is that saying, <hi>He was not
himselfe when hee did it:</hi> But as for those that
make a common trade of sinning, they cannot
say, but that they are themselves in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
thereof. In the godly, as <hi>Paul</hi> said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.
17. <hi>Now, then, it is no more I that do it, but sinne that
dwelleth in mee.</hi> It is not they, but sinne that still
remaineth in them: yet the sinne, though it be
in them after their regeneration, yet it hath no
possession as it had before. Take heed therefore,
that although thou hast the same occasions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
thee as before thou haddest, yet thou dost
not continue in it, but totally absteine there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23445:46"/>
for a wicked man may a great while, even,
a whole yeer, absteine from some sin, and yet be
said to lie in it, because, that if he had the same
occasions offered as before he had, he would
have committed the same sinne as before hee
did. Let every man therefore looke backe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his owne heart, and consider with himselfe,
whether he is not the same man he was; some
had their delight in covetousnesse, some in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
some in preferment, some in credit, examin
now your selves, and see whether thou dost not
delight in the same things still; see if thou
dost not continue still in them, and c<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>omit them
usually, and so judge of it accordingly.</p>
               <p>But here men may make many evasions,
and find many doubts, that it is no knowne sin,
that they lie not in it, and the like. Therefore,
to the end I may make it plaine, I will reduce
all to these five heads:</p>
               <p>The first question shall be this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Quest.</hi>
                  </note> when it is a
knowne sinne,<note place="margin">I. When sin is a knowne sin.</note> for the hypocrite will be ready to
find an evasion about this; as for the breaking of
the Sabbath, for covetousnesse and the like,
they will say they are no sinnes, how shall they
know they are sinnes?</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi>
                  </note> the sparkes of conscience
will glow in the midst of this darknesse,<note place="margin">Every mans conscience will tell him what is a known sin</note> that
will grudge at that sin, and then be sure it is a
knowne sin, though it doe but whisper against
it. If therefore thy conscience tells thee, that
such and such things are naught, and to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:23445:47"/>
(although it may be for a time thou
maiest keepe downe thy conscience, and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
it not to speake out for the noise thy lusts
make) yet, when thou shalt come to lie upon
thy death-bed, and at the last day, when thou
shalt appeare before God in judgement, then
for certaine shalt thou find these to be sins, and
that to thy cost: Thou now wilt be ready to
say some thing, and put away thy sin from thee,
but that will not serve the turne; harken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now to thy conscience, and see whether
that doth not tell thee, such and such things are
sinfull.</p>
               <p>Here it may be demanded;<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> A godly man
sometimes may have a scruple in conscience,
whether he is to doe such or such things; now
therefore wherein lies the difference betweene
the scruple of the godly, and ignorance of the
wicked.</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Indeed there is a great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene the scruple of the godly, and
the ignorance that is in the wicked,<note n="3" place="margin">Differences betweene the accusing of a guilty consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the scruples of the godly.</note> and the
murmuring and accusing of a guilty consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
There are three signes whereby they may
be discerned:</p>
               <p>1 For the guilty conscience; when he lies in
a knowne sin,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Differ.</hi> 1.</note> and his conscience tells him it is
a sin, he makes no inquiry after it,<note place="margin">The wicked after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge lie in it, but the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forsake it.</note> but he findes
such a sweetnesse in it, that his heart is ingaged
to it, he cannot speake against it, nay, he resolves
to sin, yea, and whensoever he is reproved for it,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23445:47"/>
he is very angry. But on the contrary side, for
him that hath a scruple in conscience might he
but be informed of it that it were a sinne, hee
would fain know it, and with all his heart leave
it. Therefore he doth but inquire and labour by
all meanes to know if it be a sin, and no sooner
doth he know it to be a sin, but he forsaketh it.</p>
               <p>2<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Differ.</hi> 2.</note> Thou maiest discerne of it by the subject
matter of their scruple:<note place="margin">In the subiect matter.</note> if it be a hard knot and
question, then it may be in a good man, and such
an one should gather the soundest and best rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and see what side is most probable, and
that he must follow. But on the contrary side,
if it be an easie matter of morality, then thou
art the more to be suspected, for the morall law
is ingrafted into our hearts. For an instance, if
it be about the neglect of the Sabbath, or about
company keeping, and the like, the conscience
that is a virgin, and never will be corrupted,
that will tell thee these things, and perswade
thee of them: Indeede, sometimes thou
maiest have a seared conscience, past feeling,
and then, when once thy conscience hath done
telling of thee, then thou art in a pittifull case.</p>
               <p>3<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Differ.</hi> 3.</note> Thou maiest discerne of them by the rest
of their actions;<note place="margin">In the rest of their actions.</note> if they have a good conscience,
they will be troubled about that, and the rest of
their life will be good: but thou maiest quickly
gather whether it be a raging sin or no, for then
they will doe all things on the other side, and
one known sin drawes on another, and the false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:23445:48"/>
of their hearts will be discerned in other
things also; for one raigning sin is like to a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
that weakneth all the faculties of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
for even so that weakneth all the faculties
of the soule. And so much of the first question.</p>
               <p>The second question is this,<note place="margin">Quest.</note> he that is a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
man may say, I doe many good things as
well as others, and although I doe sometime
sin, yet I allow not my selfe therein; and what
can a godly man doe or say more?</p>
               <p>To this I answer:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> Godly men and wicked
may goe farre together,<note place="margin">Wherein a godly man &amp; a wicked may bee said to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree &amp; differ.</note> but in themselves they
differ much. Therefore first, I will shew how
farre they may be said to agree and differ, and
secondly, how they may be discerned.</p>
               <p>1.<note n="1" place="margin">1 They agree in the way &amp; differ in the end of their journey.</note> In these things they agree and differ.</p>
               <p>First, both may agree in the way, and yet dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
in the end, their journeies end may be 2. se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
places: for the end of all that a godly man
doth, is the glory of God; but the good which
a wicked man doth, is either out of some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
feare, or hope, or flashes of conscience, or
for som by-respects, so that in al he aimes most
at his owne profit; it proceedeth not from the
inward man, a new regenerated heart, as it doth
in the godly:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> for example, suppose a man tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling,
and by chance fall into London road,
because it is coincident with his way, and not
because his journey lies to London, but only
for that is his readiest and perhaps cleanest
way; now wee cannot say, that man tends to
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:23445:48"/>
London for all that, because here the denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

of evill: I know that this may be in the
wicked a disapproving of evil, as well as in the
godly: wherefore we are to know that there is
a twofold disapproving of evill.</p>
               <p>1. That that ariseth from a principle na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">Disapproving of evill two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold.</note>
in conscience.</p>
               <p>2. From a true principle of regeneration.</p>
               <p>If thy disallowing of sin doth but arise from
a naturall conscience, that is nothing. But if it
be from a principle of regeneratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that is, from
a new disposition that is wrought in us, if from
it we disallow sin, our case is good.</p>
               <p>But now the signes whereby we shall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
betweene these two,<note place="margin">Three s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gnes to distinguish betweene a naturall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like of evill and a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</note> are three:</p>
               <p>The first signe is this; if thou dost disallow
thy selfe in sinne from a new principle of
regeneration, thou wilt absteine from sin with
delight,<note n="1" place="margin">A delightful absteining fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sin.</note> and settle upon goodnesse, as a stone,
or any other heavy thing rests in its centre, for
working with a habit, is working with delight,
when a man sets himselfe against sin with all
might and maine, then it is a true signe. But
now for the naturall conscience, let him be but
out of his old company he is out of his element
whatsoever good thing he doth, lie doth it not
with the whole bent of his spirit, but it seemes
tedious unto him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:23445:49"/>
The second signe whereby you may discerne
the natural conscience,<note n="2" place="margin">A change &amp; rising of the heart both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst old sins and the doers of them.</note> is sin; if he loveth those
that continue in such sins as he doth; if he be a
drunkard, he doth delight in drunkards, if a
gamester, he doth delight in gamesters: for he
never comes to the contrary grace, but hath
pleasure in them that commit the same sins
But the regenerate man, hee that hath a heart
changed, his heart riseth against such men.
Therefore, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 32. it is said, <hi>Who knowing the
iudgement of God (that they which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit such things,
are worthy of death) not onely doe the same, but have
pleasure in them that doe them.</hi> If this is reckoned
as one of the sins of the Gentiles, not onely to
commit sins themselves, but also to take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in those that commit the same sins. When
therefore a man hates them that love goodnes,
and favoureth and delighteth in those that are
evill, its a great signe the heart is not changed;
for the Scripture makes that a lesse signe of a
dead man, to doe evill, than to favour them that
doe it. On the contrary side, for a man to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
good men and goodnesse and hate sin, it
is a great signe of a regenerated man; when, as
the wise man saith, <hi>Prov. 29. 10. The unjust man
is an abomination to the just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third signe whereby you may discerne
it,<note n="3" place="margin">A change of the whole m<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> is this, if thy disallowance of sinen arise
from a true principle of regeneration,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it will
transforme the whole man; as a sprig being
once ingrafted into the stocke, will change the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23445:49"/>
whole nature of the stocke. For looke what
the will is set upon, that wil change the whole
man, and draw that after it; see therefore now
what thy speeches and delights are, if thy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowance
of sinne arise from a good principle,
they are true. On the contrary side, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
conscience that doth not transforme the
whole man, but onely in some few things;
though it disallow of sinne, yet it will goe on in
sin; and such men hold, or as the word in the
originall is, (<hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 18.) <hi>They imprison the
truth in unrighteousnesse.</hi> Their consciences be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inlightned,
they keepe it, and imprison it in
that faculty; The conscience that telleth us
what to doe, and yet there is no general amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in us. And this is a great signe wee are
not inwardly changed. And so much for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
question.</p>
               <p>The third question is this;<note place="margin">Quest. 3.</note> godly men often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
relapse and goe backe againe and againe,
and often fall into the same sin, and they know
it to be a sin: how therefore shall I distinguish
betweene this relapsing and lying in sin?</p>
               <p>To this I answer:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> You shall distinguish it
by these 3. signes:</p>
               <p>The first signe is this,<note place="margin">Distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt a godly mans relap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and lying in sinne.</note> a godly man never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapses
into purposes of sinning, hee doth not
before hand premeditate and think of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santnesse
and sweetnesse thereof: and after
this manner is it said,<note n="1" place="margin">He hath no purpose to sin</note> 
                  <hi>he that is borne of God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
sinne;</hi> for hee is overcome of sin but upon
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:23445:50"/>
some occasion. But the wicked man after hee
hath committed sin, doth purpose to doe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
so that hee cannot be properly said to
fall into sin againe, because in purpose hee ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
left it.</p>
               <p>The second signe is this;<note n="2" place="margin">He favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his sin</note> Looke what sinne
a carnall man lyeth in, that is his beloved sinne,
he favoureth it most, and would not be crossed
in it, he cannot abide to be told and admonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of that sinne. Now it is otherwise with the
godly man, he favoureth not himselfe herein,
but that sinne which he is most ready to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
he is gladdest to heare that condemned, he
is very willing to heare the Preacher speake a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
that. As for the wicked man hee must
not be touched, hee is like a lame man which
cannot indure to be stirred, so he cannot abide
that his beloved sin should bee spoken against.</p>
               <p>3. There is a great difference in these two
things.<note n="3" place="margin">He falls not into the same sin.</note>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The godly man falls not into it so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as he did before.</item>
                  <item>2. Hee falls not into it after the same
manner.</item>
               </list>
               <p>1. He falls not so often as he did before.<note n="1" place="margin">So often as before.</note>
               </p>
               <p>He doth greatly resist it, the being and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of sinne is not still in him, though it may
be in part; if the same occasions bee set before
him, yet he is not drawne away as hee was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
As for the wicked man, he is the same he
was, and upon every slight occasion he will be
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:23445:50"/>
drawne away; he cannot absteine from sinning,
because that sinne is not weakend, but is full
still in him.</p>
               <p>2 For the manner:</p>
               <p>Although he doth sometimes slip,<note n="2" place="margin">After the same manner.</note> yet it is
with great griefe and reluctation, hee is more
sorry for it alwaies, and every time gets ground
of it, and strength against it. But as for the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man it is nothing so, hee doth it with as
much joy as ever he did, hee findeth as much
sweetnesse in it as ever he did before. So then
we see there is a plaine difference between the
relapses of the godly, and the wickeds lying in
sin. And so much for the third question.</p>
               <p>The fourth question,<note place="margin">Quest. 4.</note> or rather an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is this: No body can doe all things, the best
of us are sinners, we are but flesh and blood,
which is fraile, the best have some imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
and therefore, who is it that sinneth not?</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">Answ.</note> It is true that all men are
sinners, the godly offend as well as the wicked,
yea, the godly offend often, and much;<note place="margin">A double dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the sins of the godly and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</note> but yet
there is a double difference between the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the godly and the wicked.</p>
               <p>1 The hypocrite hath alwaies some pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
and ruling sin in him,<note n="1" place="margin">In the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked some sin is ever predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant.</note> wherein he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth
himselfe, so that all he doth must have
respect to it, and where religion crosses that it
must give place, and there must be a bawlking
of good duties, if it be against it. But as for the
godly, in them there is no predominant sinne, it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:23445:51"/>
may be now one infirmity starts up, then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but downe they goe againe, none can get
the victory over him. The hypocrite hath
some dominering sinne, in which he will be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured,
but as for the godly man, he desires
none to spare him.</p>
               <p>2 There is a great difference in the manner;<note n="2" place="margin">The wicked commit sinne as a proper worke.</note>
a wicked man doth it as his proper worke,
his delight and his glory, hee acts himselfe in
it. But the godly man, he acts not himselfe in
committing such a sinne, it is not he that sins,
but something that is in him, and he is very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
afterwards that he was so foolishly overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
therewith.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> One man may weare a chaine
for an ornament, another for a fetter, and would
with all his heart be rid of it: so it is with the
godly man, his sin is a burthen unto him, and
he would be very glad to be rid of it, but to the
wicked man it is no burthen, but he rejoyceth
in it, he accounteth it all his pleasure, he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
it a losse to be hindred in his way, or to
leave it. The godly man he esteemeth it as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hurtfull, he knowes it hinders him, so that
he cannot doe that he would. The godly man,
he entertaines sin as a theefe, but the wicked
man as a welcome guest. And so much for the
fourth question.</p>
               <p>The fifth and last question is this,<note place="margin">Quest. 5.</note> How shall
wee distinguish betweene the purposes of the
wicked and of the godly, because that oft times
both seeme to be good; and there be many men
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:23445:51"/>
that have good purposes, and do but very little.</p>
               <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> The purposes of the wicked are weak and fruitlesse, but of the godly strong and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall.</note> the purposes of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite
are weake, and bring nothing to passe, but
as they rise, so they presently vanish againe,
But the godly mans, they are well rooted in
the soule, and bring the thing to passe that
they labour to effect. A good man will use all
the meanes he can to absteine from sin, he will
shun all the occasions: but the wicked man,
he will not absteine from the occasions, hee
knowes his nature will be ready to take hold
of sinne, and yet he will not avoid the occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and allurements thereto; surely therefore
this man hath no purpose to leave sin; for if his
purpose be not put in practice, he had as good
never purpose, for it hath no effect. The god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
man, hee will use all good meanes to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
his intent, by fasting and praier, and all
other good duties. Againe, a godly man, if he
hath a lust in sinne, hee will resist it with all
his might, and never give over, though hee
doth slip, yet hee presently riseth againe, and
never ceaseth, and therefore it shall not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him; but if a man hath flitting pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses
in his braine, that is nothing, though he
falleth no into the same sinne so often.
Thus much for the first use of triall.</p>
               <p>The second use serveth for comfort.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vse.</hi> 2. To comfort al those that do not continue sinne.</note> For
if this be a signe of deadnesse, to walke in
sinne; Then is it a matter of comfort to all
those, who, although they often times slip
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:23445:52"/>
into sinne, yet are sincere hearted, and doe
not continue in knowne sinnes. You had
therefore no neede to cry out against us, that
our words are cruell words, for this is a
doctrine full sweete; you must at the first
give us leave to open the wound, though it
be painefull, yet after, you shall finde the
ease and sweetnesse.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> The bone-setter, that
because hee would not deale roughly, setteth
not the bone aright, but puts in the sore
joynt only a little, and doth not set it through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
it may be at first thou shalt be called a
good bone setter, because the person ill affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
for the present, feeles no paine, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
when the joint is not seated, will be
railed against: or the Surgeon that will not
search the wound, to the bottome, for paining
the patient, at the first may be pleasing; but
afterwards in the end hee shall have little
thanke for his labour: in like manner should
the doctrine be harsh at first, because it fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the sore to the quicke, yet the end of
it is comfort. The end of Christs speaking
to the people in Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> Gospell, was at
the last comfort and joy. Labour therefore
all of you to make this use of this doctrine;
you that have sincere hearts, take it home to
your selves, if you doe walke in no knowne
sinnes: but if yee have walked formerly in
any knowne sinnes, now beginne to rectifie
your lives, that so you may have cause to
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:23445:52"/>
take this Doctrine unto your owne soules.
Breake the bands of Satan, and forget all
his faire allurements, you must part with all
your sweetest sinnes for it, and give all you
have to purchase this Jewell. Comfort you
may have, and all our desire is, to make
your hearts perfect, that so you may finde
comfort.<note n="4" place="margin">Comforts in a perfect heart.</note> If your hearts be perfect, you shall
finde these foure comforts:</p>
               <p>1 You shall finde more comfort in easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and contentednesse to forbeare that lust
wee most delighted in,<note n="1" place="margin">Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake lust.</note> than ever wee did
in yeelding to it.</p>
               <p>2 You shall finde your selves able to rest,<note n="2" place="margin">Ability <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> prayer.</note>
to pray, to heare, and to sanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath;
make your hearts good, and you shall
doe these things with delight: for,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> as when
a mans hand is out of joint he cannot worke;
so if the soule be out of frame it cannot
pray, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>3 You shall find your selves able to beare
afflictions;<note n="3" place="margin">Abilitie to beate afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> before you can beare nothing,
but every thing is as a burthen unto you: A
man having a shoulder that is out of joynt,
cannot beare any thing; so, if sinne be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with affliction, it makes that bitter: but
after you have purged your selves from sinne,
you shall be able to beare them; but when
there is no strength within, how shall wee
beare them?</p>
               <p>4 When you hearts are perfect,<note n="4" place="margin">Sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d pea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> and lasting.</note> the wound
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:23445:53"/>
will presently be healed and grow well. The
peace of the wicked is but like a wound that
is skinned over, at the last it will breake out
againe, hee may make a shew for a while, but
there is a secret disease in him; and the later
end of that man will be worse than the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning;
their paine will be worse hereafter,
the paine that hee shall indure when death
comes, when Gods insupportable wrath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to charge his sin upon his conscience,
that will be worse than all hee indured before.
And thus you see this Doctrine is most sweet
to all those that have perfect hearts, but to
the other, that remaine still in their sins, most
dangerous.</p>

offering his
Sonne <hi>Isaack:</hi> now
that so great a passage
of Gods providence,
and so great a tryall of
<hi>Abrahams</hi> faith might
not passe away, but be
remembred, the Lord delivereth it in a proverbe,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23445:55"/>
               <hi>As it is said unto this day;</hi> because wee are apt to
forget, and proverbs are short and pithy, and so
the better remembred, and therefore the Lord
setteth this marke upon it:<note place="margin">Observ.</note> whence by the way
we observe, That speciall passages of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
should not be forgotten.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is the manner of the Lord in
such passages of his providence, to make songs of
them: and so hath it beene likewise the practice
of the Lords people to turne such things into
songs, which they would not forget, as we see at
the Red Sea,<note place="margin">Iudg. 5. Deut. 31. 19.</note> and in the time of <hi>Dehora;</hi> and so
did <hi>Moses,</hi> when he would have some things to bee
remembred of the children of Israel, he left them
a song: so did <hi>David</hi> likewise, who for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of the Lords goodnesse, made many
Psalmes of thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>Now a proverbe is much of the same nature;
but it is short, and makes a greater impression, and
therefore this great matter here set forth by it, is
the dispensation of the Lords providence.</p>
            <p>Wherein note wee in the first place, That <hi>the
Lord will be seene:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Two things observable in the Text.</note> why, what strange thing is that?
the Lord is seene every where of us, and makes
himselfe continually visible unto us. I, but this is
another kinde of sight, which is not in a generall
manner to bee beheld, but in his speciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
to his servants in their afflictions.</p>
            <p>The second thing is, The time when he will be
seene; that is, <hi>In the mount:</hi> that is, when things
are brought to an extremity, when we thinke there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23445:55"/>
is no more helpe nor hope, that is the time when
the Lord will be seene.</p>
            <p>Now the scope of this place is,<note place="margin">The scope of the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.</note> to helpe us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
discouragements, when wee see it goe hard
with the Church that there is no hope for them,
for then we are not to distrust, Because <hi>in the mount
will the Lord be seene,</hi> in distresse will the Lord shew
himselfe; and therefore you are to take heed of
discouragements that you leave not your hope, for
then you take away indevour, and so Gods causes
fall to the ground, and thereby the Lord is forsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of us; for it is our hope that sets all aworke,
and the want of hope makes us turne our backes;
yea, foyle and give over the Lords Battels; and
therefore we should still maintaine our hope in all
extremities whatsoever, for when the Lord sends
any afflictions on the Church or our selves, wee
ought not to despise or make light of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are the messengers of the Lord, to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
us: so we must not on the other side have the
sinewes of our soules loosened by them; for as
we are not to despise the Chastening of the Lord,
so are wee not to faint when wee are rebuked of
him; for <hi>in the Mount will the Lord be seene:</hi> that is,
it is a thing that the Lord will usually doe, not at
this time when thou wouldest have him, but even
when <hi>Abraham</hi> was fetching the blow, then to stay
his hand: And it is his usuall course so to doe; and
therefore it is turned into a proverbe, because it is
ordinary.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">For ordinary use.</note> we have ordinary use of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

likewise it is put into a proverbe; for the
Lord usually brings us into extremities; and that
it might be the better remembred of us, it is put
into a proverbe, for that is the use of short senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to be easily carried in the memory; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord hath thus turned it: As men doe
by their Silver,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> they change it into Gold that it
may with the more ease be carried.</p>
            <p>Now to cometo the words; out of which wee
may learne,<note place="margin">Doct. 1.</note> That <hi>it is Gods usuall manner to bring his
children to extremities.</hi> The examples are so many
in Scriptures, and in our daily experience of this,
that we need not insist on the proofe of it, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to shew the reasons thereof.</p>
            <p>And the first cause why the Lord doth so usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
doe it,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. To make it an affliction.</note> is, When hee brings afflictions on his
children, he lets it runne along till they may thinke
there is no more helpe, nor hope, that so it may be
an affliction to them; for it would not bee an affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
except it did runne on to the uttermost point;
for if there were any doore for us to get out, wee
were not compassed about, but when a man hath
no gap to goe out at, that is it that makes the spirit
of a man to sinke.<note place="margin">Simile.</note> If a man were in a smoky house,
and had a doore open, it were no difficulty for him
to shift himselfe out of it; but when wee are shut
up, that is it which makes it difficult; and that it
might be so, the Lord suffers it to come to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. Because the Lord might be sought unto.</note> The Lord brings us to an extremity
because the Lord might be sought to; for so long
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23445:56"/>
as the Creatures can doe us any good, we will goe
no further; but when they faile us, wee are ready
to looke up to the Lord:<note place="margin">Simile.</note> As it is with men which
are on the Seas, when they are in an extremity,
those that will not pray at any other time, will
pray now, and bee ready to say with these in the
Prophet <hi>Hosea 6. 1. Come and let us returne unto the
Lord; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> hath torne, and he will heale us; he hath
smitten, and he will binde us up:</hi> and the reason is,
because where the Creature ends, the Lord must
beginne, otherwise there can be no helpe at all.
And hence it is that at the time of death, when a
man once sees that, and hath no deliverance, it
quaileth the stoutest spirits that are: as <hi>Saul,</hi> when
he could see nothing but death before him, then
he sanke downe to the ground, and till then the
Lord is not sought to; but <hi>in their afflictions they
will seeke mee,</hi> saith the Lord; because then they
can goe no where else. Therefore when a man is
brought to say, vaine is the helpe of man, then he
will looke to the Lord for his helpe; but till
then, man is subject to looke round on every side
to see if there bee any that will helpe: but when
there is none, then hee seekes unto the Lord and is
delivered.</p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. Because God may be known to be the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</note> The Lord doth it, because that hereby
it comes to passe that the Lord may bee knowne to
be the helper; that when wee are delivered, hee
may have all the praise; for otherwise if there be
but a little helpe in the Creature, wee are ready
many times to ascribe it all to it, or at least to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23445:57"/>
the prayse; and therefore the Lord said to
<hi>Gideon, Iudg. 7. 2. The people that are with thee, are too
many:</hi> though indeed they were but few in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of the multitude which they were to goe
against, yet they were too many for <hi>Gideon,</hi> to have
acknowledged the hand of the Lord in it, if hee
should have had the victory with them. But the
Lord will not divide his glory with another, and
therefore he will bring a man to the streight to bee
without all hope, that so hee may have all the
praise; for when other meanes concurre with his
helpe, then it is divided; but without that, his
arme lyes naked, as it were, and therefore that it
might bee knowne, hee brings them to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The Lord doth it, because all that
we have,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 4. Because we might receive it as a new gift</note> wee might have as a new gift: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord suffers us, as it were, to forfeit our
Leases, that he may renew them; otherwise we
should thinke our selves to bee Free-holders. But
when wee come to see all gone, our health, wealth,
and credit to faile us, and in that extremity the
Lord to give it us, it is as a thing given on a new
gift, and then we take our life as given againe of
the Lord: and so in any other streight, when there
is no helpe of man left, then wee take it wholly
from the Lord; and then wee give it to him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>Fifthly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 5. Because wee may know the Lord. <hi>Quest.</hi>
               </note> The Lord doth it, because hee may
teach us by Experience to know him.</p>
            <p>But here some man will be ready to say, Why
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23445:57"/>
cannot that be without these extremities?</p>
            <p>To this I answer,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> God is never knowne well but by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience.</note> You must know when a man
goes on in a course, without any troubles, or chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
his experience is to no purpose; for hee hath
no great experience of the Lord: But when a man
is in tribulation, that brings experience; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pe; for it is another kinde of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that is so learned, than that which comes
without it: and indeed nothing is well learned till
it bee learned by experience. And therefore our
Saviour Christ himselfe that had all knowledge
that could be had without this, would have this
also of experience likewise; for when a man is in
ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>emity, then shall hee have experience of the
Lord: And therefore it is said of <hi>Manasses,</hi> when
he was in affliction, and had prayed to the Lord,
humbling himselfe, and was restored, that <hi>he knew
the Lord was God, 2 Chron.</hi> 33. 13. Why, did hee
not know that before? No, not as now hee did;
for now hee knew the Lord by experience: and
the want of this is the cause why many feare not
God; for because they have no changes, they
know him not by experience, and therefore they
feare him not.<note place="margin">God manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleth himselfe ever upon some great change.</note> And for this cause, when the Lord
did ever manifest himselfe in any speciall manner
to any of his people, ye shall see it alwayes to bee
upon some great change that befell them: As
when <hi>Iacob</hi> was forced to leave his fathers house, to
flye from his brother <hi>Esau,</hi> then did the Lord in
a speciall manner manifest himselfe unto him;
and so likewise at his returning home againe, when
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23445:58"/>
his brother <hi>Esau</hi> came against him with foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
men to destroy him, which was a great
change, then the Lord appeared to him againe:
so still upon the great changes of his people doth
the Lord appeare unto them; and as hee did to
them in former dayes, so he doth to us now; hee
doth appeare unto us sometimes by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>erience of
his goodnesse; which that he may doe, he brings
us to extremities.</p>
            <p>Lastly,<note place="margin">Reas. 6.</note> The Lord doth it for proofe and tryall,
for so it is said in the beginning of this Chapter,
<hi>God did prove Abraham;</hi> and therefore said unto
him, <hi>Take now thine onely Sonne Isaack, whom thou
lovest, and offer him up on one of the mountaines which
I shall shew thee:</hi> Now seeing the Lords intent
was to prove him whether hee would part with
his sonne <hi>Isaack</hi> for his sake, therefore he lets him
goe to the very place and utmost period of offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his sonne; for if the Lord had taken this
tryall of him before hee had brought him to the
very utmost, hee had not beenetryed; but when
the knife was as it were going to the throat of his
sonne, then was heefully tryed: And like unto
this doe we deale with friends one towards ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for when you will try how another will trust
unto you, you will let him alone till there be none
else to help; for if there be any other for him to go
to, it is no tryall; but if it is come to this that you
must doe it, or none will, then have you tryed
him and not before: in like manner did the Lord
prove <hi>Abraham</hi> in this place.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:23445:58"/>
The Use of it is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> Not to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged whatever our case be.</note> That wee might searne never
to be discouraged; whatsoever our case is, let us
never suffer our hearts to be cast downe in us; for
as we are very prone to let goe our hold upon all
occasions, so is it a very great fault so to doe. We
see how <hi>David</hi> doth recollect himselfe together
when h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> soule was disquieted within him,<note place="margin">Psal. 43. 5.</note> asking
himselfe why it was so? which hee would not
have done, if the other had not beene a fault in
him; and therefore why doe wee so cast downe
our soules? If we say,<note place="margin">Obiect.</note> it is because it will be long
before the Lord will come and undertake our
helpe:<note place="margin">Answ.</note> I answer, no, it will not, for as soone as he
doth see thee fit for helpe, hee will give it; for
when things are most desperate, then his helpe is
nearest: for as he is able then to doe it, so is hee
most willing to doe it then. And to this purpose
is that place, <hi>Hos. 14. 4, 5, 6. I will heale their backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliding,
I will love them freely,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hosea 14. 4, 5, 6. opened.</note> 
               <hi>for mine anger is tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
away from them. I will be as the dew to Israel,
he shall grow as the Lilly and cast forth his roots as
Lebanon: his branches shall spread, his beautie shall
be as this Olive, and his smell as Lebanon.</hi> When
Israel was fallen into a very low condition, and
had taken to him words, and repented of their
sinnes, then the Lord healed their back-sliding,
which was the cause of their misery: and then
though they were outwardly miserable, yet he
will be as the dew unto them; that though they be
as the Lillies in winter which hath neither colour,
scent, nor beauty, yet consider in the spring time
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23445:59"/>
what I doe unto them, and learne to know me by
the workes of nature; for if I doe but send a little
dew, such as is in the time of spring, it shall grow
againe, yea and bring forth such a flower, whose
beauty shall exceed <hi>Salomon</hi> in all his Royalty: and
if the Lord can doe so in nature to the hearbs of
the field, doe you not thinke he is able <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> doe it to
you in the ordinary passages of his providence?
If hee shall but shine on you with the light of his
Countenance, yea though you were as the Lilly
in the Winter, yet shall you spring againe as the
Lilly in the Spring: that is, you shall spring quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
I but you will say, and quickly wither againe:
No, saith the Lord, you shall be confirmed and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished
in your estate, for hee will fasten your
roots as the trees of Lebanon, and they were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
than the trees in other places; for though
they be tall, and so their boughes might bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
yet the bodies of the trees hold their owne,
because they were well rooted: and in Lebanon
they were faster than in other places, because it was
a firmer ground: so that if the Lord list to plant
you, you shall be sure to remaine firme. I but what
shall I be good for? I know not how to be usefull
neither for God nor man, but to bee laid aside as a
thing for which there is no more use. Nay, saith
the Lord, I will not onely make you beautifull as
the Lillies, and rooted as the Cedars, but I will
make you as the Olivetrees which are fit for use.
And put the case thy name and credit bee lost, yet
your smell shall be as the smell of Lebanon, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23445:59"/>
is, as Lebanon had many sweet blossomes and
sweet smels, so shall it be with you, whatsoever
your condition be.</p>
            <p>This place then is a place of comfort aganst dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,<note place="margin">Examples.</note>
which you may see exemplified in
divers examples:<note place="margin">Iob.</note> As in the example of <hi>Iob:</hi> you
know in what a case hee was, he lost all hee had,
that he had not a friend left him; no, not his wife
nor servants that would sticke unto him, but was
brought to the very Mount, to an extremity that
could not goe further, for he was at the very brim
of the hill: yet when <hi>Iob</hi> was fit for mercy, when
hee had humbled himselfe, you see what a change
the Lord made, how his beauty did returne againe,
and how all his health, prosperity, and friends did
returne unto him, in so much as he was in all things
as before, yea and beyond it. So in the fourth of
<hi>Daniel</hi> 26.<note place="margin">Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</note> who would have thought it possible for
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ever to have beene restored, that
had lost his kingdome and wits too, which is the
onely meanes to bring a man in againe; yea, hee
had lost all his beauty, for hee was a beast of the
field, yet the Lord made a change with him: now
a man would wonder how this should be brought
to passe that hee should have his kingdome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
and be made knowne to his Nobles; why
the Text saith, <hi>He looked up to heaven, vers.</hi> 34. and
then his Nobles and Princes sought unto him: for
the disposition of all people is to have the right
heire to rule the kingdome; and therefore he had
as much glory and honour as ever before. The

                  </gap>ewes in Mordicaes time.</note> when the
Church was in extremity; for you see how farre
<hi>Haman</hi> went, the blow was as it were in the giving,
the knife was in his hand to cut the throat of the
whole Church of the Jewes, yet when they had
humbled themselves by fasting and prayer to the
Lord, that made worke in heaven; and when there
was a change in heaven, you see how quickly the
Church was changed, and brought even from the
lowest degree to the highest that could be, or ever
was in the time of their trials. And therefore let
us never give over our hopes, and despaire not, for
because the Lord is ever ready to shew mercy, for
mercy pleaseth him: A man when he corrects his
childe,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> he doth it unwillingly; but when hee is fit
for mercy, hee is glad to shew that: why so it is
with the Lord, hee being willing to doe it, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
able, for hee is a Physician that is able to
heale the most dangerous diseases, and shall wee
then doubt of the accomplishment? It is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
fault amongst us to measure the Lord accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to our selves; and so when we see man cannot
helpe us, we thinke that God cannot; but he that
can turne Winter into a Summer, can speedily
turne our estates when we are fit for it: As a Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
that administers hard potions to his Patient,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> it
is not because he cannot or will not give him plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
things, but it is because his Patient is not fit
for it; for as soone as hee is fit for Cordials, hee
most willingly gives them unto him: And as the
Husbandman,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> hee is willing enough to sowe his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23445:60"/>
seed in the earth, and would bee glad if the time
were come; I but hee knoweth if he so we it on
the wilde waste ground it would be lost, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he plowes it first, and againe too, yea thrice if
it be needfull, and then having well fitted it, hee
sowes his seed; Even so it is with the Lord, hee
first plowes the ground, he digges deepe into the
hearts of men if it be needfull so to doe, but if a
little plowing will serve, he never takes a deeper;
and if one will serve, he never gives a second;
and therefore when we are fit to receive the seed,
mercy shall come in amaine amongst us, even as
that which goes with wind and tide; yea, it shall
come as fast as our misery did, which though it
comes headlong upon us as it did upon <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi>
yet how quickly did the Lord deliver him
againe? and so shall it, bee with us, because the
Lord is delighted with mercy, therefore the Lord
doth usually helpe in extremities, and not before;
for <hi>in the Mount will the Lord be seene.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as the first Doctrine is drawne naturally
from these words, That <hi>it is Gods usuall manner to
bring his children into the Mount;</hi> so in the second
place, then and there will he be seene: Therefore
it followes, That</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the time of extremities will the Lord be seene,</hi>

               <hi>and
not before:</hi> But then he will appeare in his speciall
providence, for the comfort of his Children, though
not before.</p>
            <p>And why so?<note place="margin">To exercise the graces of your God by.</note> First, because the Lord knowes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
this is the best way to draw forth the practice of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23445:61"/>
many graces, and good duties, which otherwise
would be without use: As for example; When
<hi>Iacob</hi> had made his brother <hi>Esau</hi> his enemy by his
hasty getting of the blessing, whereas if hee had
stayd the Lords time, he might have had it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any sorrowes with it; but because he will have
it a wrong way, it is accompanied with many sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes
both in him and <hi>Rebecca</hi> likewise: Now if
the Lord had presently made reconciliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
him and his brother, as he could have done,
though he did not, but made it long first, that made
<hi>Iacob</hi> exceeding fruitfull; for hee being caused to
to flye, as his mother counselled him to doe, in his
necessity became acquainted with the Lord, and
knew him better than ever otherwise hee should
have knowne him; yea, he knew himselfe better
too, and therefore vowed to give the Lord the
tenth of all that he had, and that the Lord should
be his God for ever if hee would give him food
and Clothing, of which hee felt the want at that
time; and this brought his heart to the Lord:
So likewise when <hi>Esau</hi> came against him at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home againe; if it at the first it had beene
told <hi>Iacob</hi> that his brother had beene friends with
him, hee had never wrestled with the Lord as hee
did; and so should he have missed of that great
blessing which he received in being called <hi>Israell.</hi>
And therefore we se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the Lord by this doth draw
many great fruits from them, of which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the Lord should lose the glory, and wee the
benefit, if it were not so with us. So likewise the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23445:61"/>
Angell was sent to <hi>Daniel</hi> when he began to pray;
I but if the message had then beene delivered to
him, his heart had not beene so well moulded in
the frame of grace, therefore the Lord lets him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
though hee had given the Angell charge to
deliver the message to him, yet till he had done
his worke, and was made fit for it, the message of
their full deliverance was not made knowne unto
him.</p>
            <p>A second reason why the Lord deferres, and
will stay till the very extremity comes, is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 2. To give time of repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he would give a time to men to repent and
meet him in, which is good for his Children, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
we should not seeke unto the Lord: and
for such as doe not seeke him, it is to leave them
without excuse: as in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11. 12. Chapters, you
shall finde that <hi>Roboam</hi> sought the Lord for three
yeares together, and then departed from him, yet
<hi>Shisacke</hi> was not sent against him till the fifth
yeare of his reigne: Whence this is to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that though he had forsaken the Lord, who
therefore had resolved to bring judgement upon
him, yet he gives him two yeares liberty to see if
he would returne. So when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was
like a flourishing tree, when he had dreamed his
dreame, and that made knowne unto him, that he
should be cut downe to the very root, like the lilly
in winter, nothing should be left but the stumpes,
yet you shall finde it twelve moneths after before
the Lord strucke him. So in the destruction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem
by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> the Lord was often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23445:62"/>
offering to strike it, yet called backe his
hand again that they might humble themselves and
seeke his face: but as it is said of <hi>Iezabel</hi> in the
second of the <hi>Revelations verse 12. hee gave her time
to repent, but she repented not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. To let us know the vanity of the creature.</note> the Lord doth not deliver till the time
of extremity, that we may know the vanity of the
creature. And see that they are but as reeds that are
empty: as for example, when a man is brought to
some great straight, and sees that men will forsake
him in it, as the Lord will cause them to doe when
he will bring a man to a streight indeed, for then
he will shew him that there is no helpe in man; as
when a man that is sicke,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> and so farre gone that no
physicke will doe him good, but all Physicians
have left him; or when a man hath some great
businesse in hand, and nothing that he hath will ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
it; and so likewise a man at Sea, when hee is
in such a tempest that neither rowing nor any thing
else will doe him good, then when men are in such
cases, they come to see the vanity of the creature,
and that all outward meanes will start aside like a
broken bow; for a broken bow being drawne but
a little, will hold; but if it bee drawne up to the
head, then it breakes in the hand of him that han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
it: Even so, when the creature is put to it,
then the vanity of them is seene, and that they are
but as hollow reeds that are empty, and so not bee
trusted to.</p>
            <p>Now we must adde to this,<note place="margin">Though God defer till ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, yet then he will surely helpe.</note> that as the Lord will
not deliver till then, yet then he will doe it; and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23445:62"/>
of that you must make no doubt, because the
Lord will make good his promises and bee just,
for he is abundant in truth, he will make good all
that he hath said, and that in abundance. Now if
the Lord will helpe, and yet not till a man come
to extremity, why then hee must helpe or not at
all, and so he should faile them that trust unto him,
when as one man will not faile another that trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him, for that were treachery so to doe; why
then much lesse will the Lord faile thee, if thou
rely upon him, if thy heart can tell thee thou dost
intirely rest upon him, it is impossible hee should
faile thee: And therefore hee must helpe thee at
the last cast, or else not at all; and untill thou art
so farre gone, thou art not come unto the Mount;
for <hi>Abraham</hi> was three dayes in going the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and the Lord might have revealed it before if
hee would, but hee did not till he came to the
mount: And therefore doe not say, now is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity,
and yet the Lord doth not helpe mee,
when thou art but in the way, for thou art not yet
come to the brow of the hill, thou art not at the
utmost part of the Mount.</p>
            <p>The Use of it is,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vse.</hi> To teach us not to make too much hast for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> to teach us not to make too
much haste for deliverance in the time of distresse,
but to wait upon the Lord, yea depend upon his
providence when we seeme to be without helpe:
If we looke upon the Creature, yet then are wee
to depend upon the Lord, so as never to say there
is no helpe; but on the contrary, to say, <hi>I will trust
in him though he kill me;</hi> for so did <hi>Abraham</hi> here,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23445:63"/>
he was to kill his Sonne, and yet he had hope: So
let us, though there were a thing that would bee
our utter undoing if it should come on us, yet if
it doe come thou oughtest to hope, because it is the
Lords manner to bring his people to extremities,
as here to <hi>Abraham:</hi> and the like hee did to <hi>Peter</hi>
when he came to him on the waters; for he might
have holpen him before he beganne to sinke if he
would, but hee did first let him sinke a little and
then he holpe him: So when the people were at
the Red Sea, and had no gap to goe out at, then the
Lord holpe them, by making a way thorow the
Sea: In like manner he did to <hi>Iacob</hi> when hee was
returning home from his father in law <hi>Laban,</hi> hee,
suffered <hi>Esau</hi> to come out against him with foure
hundred men, before hee holpe him; and who
would have thought that <hi>Esau's</hi> mind should have
beene so suddenly turned? But when <hi>Iacob</hi> was
brought to a streight, then the Lord turned all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
way. And the like he did with <hi>David</hi> in the
time of his distresse, he let him alone till <hi>the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were like to goe over him:</hi> but when his feet
had almost slipt, in regard of his outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
troubles, for he was at the very <hi>going downe
to the grave,</hi> then the Lord brought his feet out of
the Net, and set him at liberty, and tooke him
out of the waters that he was not drowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
therefore still trust in the Lord, and labour that
thy faith faile thee not whatsoever thy straights
be; for that was <hi>Peters</hi> fault when hee was on
the water, for if he had sunke, being hee had the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23445:63"/>
Lords word, hee should have beene safe enough,
and therefore had no cause to doubt; and so wee
should learne to doe, in all our streights still to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve;
which if we doe, wee shall finde the Lord
very exceeding ready to helpe beyond all that we
can be able to aske or thinke.</p>
            <p>See this in an example or two, how the Lord
comes betwixt the cup and the lip as it were, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the very lifting up of the hand to the stroke;
and as in the Text, so also when the <hi>Shunamite</hi> had
by the command of the Prophet left her land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the Famine that was to come when the
seven yeeres were done; for shee trusted the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
and therefore did not say, Alas, what shall I
doe for my lands againe? but did goe; and when
shee returned, and was gone to the King for her
lands againe, at that very instant was the King tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
with <hi>Elishaes</hi> servant about the great workes
of the Prophet, who then told the King of this
woman and her sonne, confirming that which <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hezi</hi>
had said, and <hi>Gehezi</hi> being present to helpe
to speake for the woman; and then shee had not
onely her lands restored her, but the fruits of it
also for the whole time of her absence. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
when <hi>Mordecayes</hi> destruction was plotted by
<hi>Haman,</hi> and so neare brought to passe, that there
could be no hope of helpe on any side, yet then
when <hi>Mordecay</hi> was asleepe in the night, and had
made no plots at all for his safety, then the Lord
brought it to passe;<note place="margin">Ester 6. 1.</note> for <hi>that night the King could not
sleepe;</hi> then hee must needs call for a booke, and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23445:64"/>
then that above all other bookes, that should bee
brought, and in that booke that very place to bee
turned to of the treason against the King, and
<hi>Mordecayes</hi> truth and faithfulnesse in discovering
the same; and that this should be done at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
extremity, when a day or two after would have
done him no good, it is worth the considering:
therefore never doubt, feare not, but trust to the
Lord in any streight; for though hee doth not
worke miracles now, yet he workes wonders, and
is able to doe as great things as ever he was, yea,
and doth so too when there is the like occasion:
In like manner, when our Saviour Christ was
brought to the very brow of the hill by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to bee cast downe from it, why then he went
a way thorow the midst of them; so is the
Lord able to doe with us, and will also if there
be the like need; and therefore let us learne to
trust in the Lord, and in all things to depend upon
him. One would have thought it impossible when
fortie men had secretly vowed neither to eat nor
drinke till they had killed <hi>Paul,</hi> for that to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and <hi>Paul</hi> to be delivered, when so many
that were able enough to destroy a poore prisoner
had conspired against him, yet we see the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
him from that great streight; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us wait still upon the Lord, for it is but
the staying till the time be out, and then he that can
save, will save, and will not tarry. And so much for
the second thing.</p>

their good; and not punishments, sent for their hurt and
ruine.</p>
            <p>The Lord did this but to prove <hi>Abraham,</hi> hee
meant him to hurt at all in it: And so the Lord
doth by afflicting others of his owne people, he
doth not meane to hurt them by it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when you see an affliction to bee so great as if
it would undoe those on whom it is, yet you shall
see in the issue it was but like an evill; for when
<hi>Abraham</hi> was bid to take his onely Sonne <hi>Isaack</hi>
whom he loved, and offer him in a Sacrifice to
the Lord, and was suffered to bee the three dayes
in the tryall, yet the Lord meant him no hurt;
here was indeed a great apprehension of evill, yet
it was no evill; but it might as much worke upon
him as the evill it selfe: Even so is it with us in
our afflictions, they are not evils, but meere try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als,
and therefore we are not much to be dismay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for the greatest afflictions that can befall us in
the world, because they are but trials, that doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
thee from God.</p>
            <p>I,<note place="margin">Obiect. Answ.</note> but will some say, what shall I get by it?
Why, so much that there is so little cause to be
sorry for it, that thou hast cause to rejoyce, if
thou woudest beleeve; as it is said in the first
of <hi>Iames 2. My Brethren, count it great joy when you
fall into divers trials:</hi> It is a very fit Text for
the purpose, for the Lord said hee would prove
<hi>Abraham;</hi> and all is no more but to try us, and
not to doe us any hurt: and this is a good reason
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23445:65"/>
why it is so, in that wee are bid to rejoyce in it;
now we have no cause to rejoyce in that which wil
hurt us, neither will the Lord lay any unreasonable
command upon us.</p>
            <p>I,<note place="margin">Obiect. Answ.</note> but what if the tryals bee many? Yet hee
bids us rejoyce, though they be of divers kindes;
when wee are not onely afflicted in the losse of
goods, and our friends forsake us, in which wee
might have some comfort, if our healths and
liberty might bee enjoyed; or if all the outward
man were afflicted, yet if the spirit were whole
it would beare out infirmitie. I, but what if that
bee wounded too? Why, if there bee tryals of
all sorts, and you fall into them all, and that of
a sudden too, as a fall of waves, one comming
upon the necke of another as they did upon <hi>Iob,</hi>
yet wee are bid to rejoyce: Why one would
thinke it were enough for a man to bee patient in
that case; yet (saith the Apostle) <hi>you must rejoyce
in it; yea, count it exceeding joy:</hi> that is, as your trials
are greater, so let your joy be greater.</p>
            <p>Why,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obiect. Answ.</hi> We ought to rejoyce in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, because the greater the tryall is, the more will be the good.</note> that is a strange command you will say:
I but though you see not the reason of Gods
Commandements, yet there is a great reason in
them, which if you saw, you would keepe them
most willingly. And the reason of this Command
is, the greater the tryall is, the more will bee the
good, and therefore the more cause of joy; for
if the most painefull bee the most gainefull, then
they that have them, have the greatest cause to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce
in them: It was a tryall for <hi>Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:23445:65"/>
to goe from his owne land, and to cast out his
sonne <hi>Ismael;</hi> I but this was the greatest, and
this brought him the greatest fruit that ever hee
had.</p>
            <p>I,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Obiect. Answ.</hi> The good that comes of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, is,</note> but what is that good? Why this; first, it
shall increase grace in your hearts; for as the gold
when it is tryed loseth nothing but drosse, and so
is made the better thereby; so it is with our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
for <hi>the triall of our faith,</hi>
               <note n="1" place="margin">Increase of grace.</note> saith the Apostle,
<hi>bringeth forth patience:</hi> so the greater thy tryall
is, the more it strengthens thy faith, and so increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
comfort: for when the afflictions of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
abounded, his Consolation abounded also.
And hence it is, that our Saviour Christ saith, <hi>You
shall receive an hundred fold with persecutions;</hi> that
is, when the tryall doth abound, the comfort shall
abound.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note n="2" place="margin">Increase of reward.</note> you shall have the greater wages; for
when a man hath a friend that hath be one employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
about any great thing for him, why the greater
the trouble was which he did undergoe for him,
the more will hee bee beholding to him, and the
greater reward will hee bestow upon him; even
so the greater the tryals are from the Lord, the
greater benefit will come to us by them; and
therefore when you see the greatest tryals befall
the Church and people of God, bee assured by
this which hath beene said, that some great bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
is comming to them; for doe you not thinke
this is a usefull doctrine; it may bee it concernes
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23445:66"/>
some of you now at this present; if not, it may
doe, and therefore lay it up before-hand; and
let us not thinke of our afflictions as of things
that will undoe us, but as tryals that will bring
us profit. For as the Spyes that went to <hi>Canaan</hi>
were of two sorts, and looked upon the Gyants
that were in it with a double eye; and so some of
them said, O the land is a very good land, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
the people to goe up into it; and others
that were afraid, they said, nay but the land eats
up the Inhabitants thereof, and discouraged the
people to goe up into it: Even so it is with many
amongst us, when they see afflictions befall the
Church and people of God, O they presently
are afraid, and therefore they say, Who would be
as these men? let me be of such as be in prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and have friends, and some that will provide
for mee: but what is the reason of this? Why
they send forth wrong spies, and therefore they
bring backe a false report: but if thou wouldest
send forth thy faith and spirituall wisdome which
ought to be in thy heart, then thou shouldest see
it were no such matter. And therefore let this be
our practice concerning the estate and condition of
the Church at this time, and needfull it is wee
should so doe; for doe you not see the dangers
that they and we are in, and the confusion that is
almost throughout all <hi>Europe?</hi> yet God hath not
forgotten us, neither will he leave us, if wee can
but rest upon him: what though there should be a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23445:66"/>
sudden change, so that all things were with us as
it was in <hi>Hesters</hi> time? yet could the Lord bring
forth some good thing out of it that should tend
much to his glory and our good: Put the case
all were turned upside downe, as it was in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
Chaos, wherein heaven and earth was ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together, and the waters overcomming all the
rest,<note place="margin">Simile.</note> yet as then when the spirit of the Lord did
but move upon the waters, many beautifull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
were brought forth, and the Sea divided
from the rest, that those waters that seemed then
to spoyle all, serves now to water all, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it we cannot bee: Even so, were the Church
in never so confused a condition, yet the Lord
shall so order the things that seeme to undoe us,
that they shall bring forth something of speciall
use; that is, something to water and make fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
the house and people of God: and therefore
be not out of hope whatsoever befalls thee, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bee humbled; for there is great cause so to
be, and the Lord calls thee to it by his Ministers,
and wee are his messengers to declare his will
unto you; and as we must bee humbled and take
to heart the cause of the Church, so wee must
consider the time, that wee may bee throughly
affected thereby; for it was <hi>Ephraims</hi> fault not
to doe it: and thou must see this distresse, so as
it may bring thee into the Mount; for it is not
an extremity simply that will cause the Lord
to helpe thee; but when thy soule is plowed up
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23445:67"/>
therewith, and then the Lord will cast in the
seed and water it, so as thy soule shall spring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
and therefore let us still maintaine our
hope in all conditions whatsoever. And for
this end did I fall upon this Text at this time,
That <hi>in the Mount will the Lord be seene.</hi>
