            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

exceeding 670. years paſt: And Firſt, I ſhall begin with the Murther of good King <hi>Edmund,</hi> Sirnamed the <hi>Ironſide,</hi> being the thirty third Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men.</p>
               <p>This King of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Line, ſucceeding his Father King <hi>Ethelred,</hi> was Crowned at <hi>Kingstone</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> by <hi>Livingus</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> on the 16 of <hi>April, Anno</hi> 1016. At what time the <hi>Pagan Danes,</hi> with bloody cruelties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſted this Iſland, deſtroying and burning all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, without regard to either Sex or Age. But ſuch was the ſucceſs of this valiant King, that he not only put a ſtop to their proceedings, but gave them many fatal overthrows, and had paſt all diſpute forced them to have left the prey, the which ſo long with bloody hands ſo eagerly they graſped, had it not been for the prodigious Treaſons of the Monſter <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drick,</hi> a Perſon who by this Kings means, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of his Father, though ill deſerving ſuch a Title, had been created a Duke, and was now General of King <hi>Edmund</hi>'s Army, and by the power of ſuch a truſt, ſought by all means the downfal of his Lord, which to his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Infamy he at laſt effected, as ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be related.</p>
               <p>Long time had this treacherous Duke ſought opportunity to bring the good King to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but ſucceſs ſo waited on his Arms, that for a long time no advantage could be propoſed;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40182:8"/>
for had he done it whilſt the <hi>Danes</hi> were weak, his hopes had been fruſtrated: Yet growing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of delay, he reſolved to make ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to bring about his wicked purpoſe. And therefore a fierce Battel being begun between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Danes</hi> at <hi>Sheroſtan</hi> in <hi>Worceſter-ſhire,</hi> which continued bloody and doubtful for two days; but in end the <hi>Danes</hi> beginning to ſhrink, <hi>Edrick</hi> preſently cut off the Head of one of his own Soldiers, named <hi>Oſmearus</hi>; like the King in Hair, ſhape of his Beard and Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, held it upon his bloody Sword, ſtill gaſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and cried to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hoſt, fly wretches, fly, get you away for your King is ſlain, behold his Head, therefore ſeek now to ſave your own Lives.</p>
               <p>The fight ſo daunted the courage of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,</hi> who entirely loved their King, that the Battel began to ſwerve, and wanted but little of plain flight, which had certainly been, had not King <hi>Edmund</hi> underſtood the cauſe, and inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from a high place ſhewed himſelf to his Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, with many words of incouragement ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in their Ranks, and by entering amongſt the reſt of the Squadrons, given them new vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, ſo that plainly perceiving the treachery, they bent their Bows againſt the Traitour, and had diſpatched him, had he not ſunk into the Rear: Yet they turned their fury upon the <hi>Danes</hi> and made great ſlaughter, even till the Field
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:40182:8"/>
was coloured with Blood, continuing the Fight till Night parted them. At what time the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous Duke came to the Kings Tent, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter much ſeeming ſubmiſſion, excuſed his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by alleadging he was miſtaken in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the Man, and thirſting to ſave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood, adviſed them to ſhift for themſelves: As for the former part of the excuſe, 'tis not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but he ſpoke true; for that day the King was diſguiſed in the Battel, and this wretch who ſought his deſtruction, might in the hurry take <hi>Oſmearus</hi> for him, and for that cauſe ſlew him. But ſuch was the goodneſs of the King, that his diſſimulation gained belief, and he was again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into favour, though contrary to the mind of the Kings Council, who would have had him baniſhed, and well had it been for King <hi>Edmund,</hi> had their advice been taken; for a treacherous friend is more dangerous than an open Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>This ſtratagem failing, the <hi>Danes</hi> raiſed their Camp in the dead of Night, and Marched with all ſpeed towards <hi>London,</hi> which City continued Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to King <hi>Edmund</hi> during his Life.</p>
               <p>The King the next Morning having notice of the <hi>Danes</hi> departure followed with all his Hoſt to prevent the ſpoil, and by his ſwift Marches, ſo terrified the <hi>Danes,</hi> that they altered the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they had to beſiege the City, and the King entered it in Triumph. And two days after ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40182:9"/>
refreſhed his Army, reſolved to follow his advantage, and thereupon Marching to <hi>Branford,</hi> where the <hi>Danes</hi> were Encamped, he gave them a great overthrow; which <hi>Edrick</hi> perceiving, and fearing the <hi>Danes</hi> would be forced to leave the Land, he adviſed King <hi>Edmund</hi> to make a truce with them, uſing ſo many Arguments that he prevailed with the King, even when he had them all at his Mercy, and therefore leaving <hi>London,</hi> he retired into the Weſt.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Danes</hi> no ſooner perceived themſelves free from danger, but they fell to plundering and burning as fearfully as ever, which cauſed the King again to advance, and entering <hi>Kent</hi> with his Army, near unto <hi>Oateford,</hi> he gave them Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, which continued doubtful and bloody for the ſpace of four hours. When the <hi>Danes</hi> Vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard giving back, their Horſe upon the Right advanced, yet fell ſoon into diſorder, and reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring amongſt the Foot put them to the rout, ſo that they were ſlain on all hands, leaving above four thouſand dead on the place; when of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> there died not above ſix hundred, and here had not the Traitour <hi>Edrick</hi> ſtopped the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in purſuit of their Enemy, by laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the danger of an Ambuſh, the <hi>Danes</hi> had never more been able to have made Head. But by this means they had leiſure to paſs into <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and ſend for recruits from beyond the Seas, and then began to tyrannize as much as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:40182:9"/>
ever, which cauſed King <hi>Edmund</hi> to enter <hi>Eſſex</hi> with his Army fluſhed with many Victories, and at <hi>Aſhdon</hi> three Miles from <hi>Saffron-Walden,</hi> gave them Battel, which was fiercely maintained on either ſide for many hours, till in the end the <hi>Danes</hi> began to recoil, which <hi>Edrick</hi> perceiving, drew off his Party, and fell to the Enemy, by which means they became Victorious: So that there died of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, Dukes, <hi>Alfred, Godwin, Athelword, Athelwin,</hi> and Earl <hi>Urchin,</hi> together with <hi>Cadnoth</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ramſey,</hi> with many other of the Clergy that were come thither to pray for the ſucceſs of the Army againſt the Pagan <hi>Danes,</hi> the remembrance of which overthrow is retained unto this day.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edmund</hi> thus betrayed was forced to retire from the Field on foot, and with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Army marched to <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> whereupon <hi>London</hi> ſubmitted to the Conquerors, as likewiſe did all the places of ſtrength adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Yet ſuch was the love of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to their King, that they from all parts reſorted to him, and earneſt to regain the late diſhonour, though at the utmoſt hazard, ſoon recruited his Army, and came on to meet the <hi>Danes,</hi> who ſwell'd with ſucceſs were advancing <hi>Northward</hi> and at <hi>Dearburs</hi> near unto the River <hi>Severn</hi> met, where both Armies were ſet in Battel Array; when juſt as the bloody blaſt was about to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:40182:10"/>
ſounded, A Captain ſtepped between the Hoſts, and deſired to be heard, which being granted, he thus began.</p>
               <p>Many Battles (ſaid he) have been fought, and many ſtreams of Blood already ſhed for the Sovereignty of this Land between theſe two valiant Nations, and the courage of the Generals, Captains and Soldiers ſufficiently tried, wherein Fortune her ſelf ſeemeth to have been Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered; for if at any time a Battel was won, it was not long kept, neither the Conquered ſo weakned, but that he retained both Courage and power to turn the Scale. What is the mark then you aim at? Is it honour and fame? Titles indeed that attend on War; but ſeldom long enjoyed, or rarely fall to the lot of the common Soldiers, at the price of whoſe Blood they are for the moſt part purchaſed. Let him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that would wear the Crown hazard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to avoid the ſlaughter of many men, and by ſingle Combate try who is moſt worthy to Command, and who to Obey, or divide betwixt them the Kingdom, which is large enough to maintain two, having heretofore maintained ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Reigning Kings.</p>
               <p>This Propoſal was imbraced by King <hi>Edmund</hi> as the beſt expedient to put an end to a hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous and doubtful War; as likewiſe by <hi>Canute</hi> King of the <hi>Danes,</hi> who by mutual conſent went into an Iſland called <hi>Alney,</hi> ſtanding in the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:40182:10"/>
adjoyning unto the City of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> where both being ſtrong of body they fought like Lions, one to ſecure his Kingdom, the other to gain it. But in the end, the <hi>Dane</hi> being wounded, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated a parly, which <hi>Edmund</hi> granted, and then with a loud voice thus proceeded;</p>
               <p>What neceſſity ſhould thus move us, moſt Heroick King, that for the obtaining of a Title, we ſhould thus indanger our Lives? Is it not better to lay malice aſide, and condeſcend to an amicable agreement? Let us now therefore become ſworn friends, and divide the Kingdom between us, and in ſuch a League of friendſhip, that each may uſe the others part as his own, ſo ſhall this Land be peaceably Governed, and we mutually aſſiſt each others neceſſity.</p>
               <p>This Speech ended, both the Kings caſt down their Swords, and imbraced each other, upon which great ſhouts aroſe in either Army, who before ſtood doubtful of the ſucceſs, and this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord being ratified, the Kingdom was divided by Lot; and that part bordering on the Coaſt of <hi>France</hi> fell to King <hi>Edmund,</hi> who howſoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it not long, for in this Treaty the offence of Duke <hi>Edrick</hi> was included, and upon his ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he taken into favour by the good King, and ſo continued as it were glutted with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and princely bounty of two Kings, till at laſt reſolving to perfect his many Treaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, he watched his opportunity as King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:40182:11"/>
was alone in the Draught-houſe evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and having placed himſelf beneath, with a ſharp Spear he run it up into the Kings Belly, that he there died; then coming up, he traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly and inhumanely cut off his Head, and eſcaping with it undiſcovered to <hi>Canute</hi> the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> King, and preſenting it to him with theſe fawning Salutations: <hi>All Hail thou now ſole Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch of</hi> England; <hi>for here behold the Head of thy Co-partner, which for thy ſake I have adventured to cut off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Canute</hi> though ambitious enough of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, yet of Princely diſpoſition, abaſhed, and ſore grieved at ſo unworthy and diſloyal an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, replied with an Oath, that in reward of that Service the bringers Head ſhould be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced above all the Peers of his Kingdom; which high honour whilſt the traiterous wretch greedily expected (and indeed for a time found ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour) his Head by the Kings command was ſmitten off, and fixed upon a Pole on the higheſt Gate of the City of <hi>London,</hi> as he moſt juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: His Wife and Children were baniſhed; and great was the rejoycing throughout <hi>England</hi> at the Death of this prodigious Regicide, and betrayer of his Country.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Edmunds</hi> Body was buried at <hi>Glaſten-bury</hi> near to his Father King <hi>Edgar</hi>; he was of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon tall, for Courage hardy, ſtrong of Limbs, and well could indure the inconveniencies of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:40182:11"/>
War; for which ſome think he had his additional name of <hi>Ironſide</hi>; with him at that time fell the Glory of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> he leaving but one Son, <hi>viz.

               <p>Thus fell this good King, and thus Heavens vengeance overtook the Traitour, whoſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable end in ſome ſort made an atonement for the innocent Blood ſhed by wicked hands; as likewiſe for the Death of <hi>Sigefreth</hi> and <hi>Morcar,</hi> King <hi>Edmunds</hi> Queens former Husband and Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who were murthered at <hi>Oxford</hi> by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of <hi>Edrick.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Hiſtorical relation of the depoſing and barbarous Murther of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, commonly called <hi>Edward</hi> of <hi>Carnarvan,</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> Lord of <hi>Ireland</hi> and Duke of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and the Forty eighth Monarch of <hi>England;</hi> with the manner of Gods vengeance upon thoſe that were guilty of ſhedding his Blood.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>EDward</hi> the Second of that Name ſince the Conqueſt, was Son to <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, (the terror of <hi>Syria,</hi> and dread of <hi>Scotland</hi>) and his Wife Queen <hi>Elenor,</hi> Born on the 25 of <hi>April,</hi> 1284. at <hi>Carnarvan</hi> in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> and after the Death of <hi>Lewellin ap Griffith</hi>; in regard of the place of his Nativity, he was with the general conſent of the <hi>Welch</hi> created Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> which Title has ever ſince devolved upon the Heir apparent to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>: This <hi>Edward</hi> being the firſt who had that Dignity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him, and his Father dying, he was Crowned with great applauſe in the 23. Year of his Age: Then having ſetled the Affairs of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he paſſed over to <hi>Bulloin,</hi> and there in great ſtate was Married to <hi>Iſabel</hi> Daughter to <hi>Philip</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:40182:12"/>
the fair, King of <hi>France,</hi> and returned with his Bride, not paſſing twelve years of Age in great Triumph, when as taking into his Favour one <hi>Pierre Gaviſton</hi> (whom his Father had baniſhed, but himſelf intirely loved;) many of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were diſpleaſed, though the King made no great account of ſuch their diſpleaſure: This <hi>Gaviſton</hi> was a ſtranger by Birth, Born in <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne</hi>; but a Gentleman in all reſpects, being in his younger years brought up with the King, during his being Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and now made Earl of <hi>Cornwel</hi>; yet ſo prevailed the Enviers of his riſe, that they procured a Decree for his perpetual Baniſhment out of <hi>England</hi>: But the Kings love ſtill following him, he was made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and within a while revoaked; and in his return met by the King at <hi>Flint-Caſtle</hi> in <hi>North-Wales</hi>; and there had beſtowed on him to Wife <hi>Joan</hi> of <hi>Acres</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Kings Siſters Daughter. Yet ſo far prevailed the diſcontented Lords, that a third time they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his baniſhment, but beyond the Seas his life being often put in hazard by the procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Enemies; as ſome ſuppoſe by the Kings ſecret ſending for he returned within ſix Months, to the great trouble of the Queen and her party, who by this time began to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affect her Husband, and joyn with the Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Gaviſton.</hi> Whereupon firſt ſeeming to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for a redreſs of grievances, they after took
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40182:13"/>
up Arms, of which the Earls, <hi>Lancaſter, Warwick</hi> and <hi>Hereford</hi> were chief, and within a while the Earl of <hi>Warwick</hi> at a place called <hi>Blacklow</hi> (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>Gavenſhead</hi>) having ſurprized <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinſton</hi> cut off his Head, to the high diſpleaſure of the King; who at that time was not capable of hindering it, yet exceſſive was the grief and diſpleaſure he conceived; ſo that the Lords thought it not ſafe to lay down their Arms till they had reconciled themſelves to the King, which was done by the mediation of <hi>Gilbert</hi> Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and ſeveral Prelates who travel'd therein. Yet not ſo firm but the King continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſecret diſpleaſure againſt the chief Actors, but his melancholy was diverted by the Queens being delivered of her firſt Son at <hi>Windſor,</hi> who ſucceeded him by the name of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, as ſhall hereafter be related.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> upon notice of this Inteſtine broil grew haughty, and under the Command of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> their King, not only put many affronts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who ſo long before had Lorded it over that Nation, but made ſeveral Inroads into the <hi>Northern</hi> parts, which cauſed King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> to draw together a great Power, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as well of Foreign Nations as of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and marched againſt them. But ſeveral of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected Lords, under pretence that the King had not ratified the promiſed Liberties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges, refuſed to aſſiſt him; ſo that for want
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40182:13"/>
of good conduct, though the <hi>Engliſh</hi> exceeded the <hi>Scots</hi> in number, yet coming to a Battel at <hi>Banocksbourn</hi> near <hi>Streveling,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were overthrown more by ſtratagem than plain force, for the <hi>Scots</hi> having digged pits, and ſet up ſharp ſtakes in them, cover'd them over with Earth and Hurdles; ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe charging furiouſly, their weight broke the Hurdles, and there goring on the ſtakes became uſeleſs, being in that manner killed on all ſides by <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Archers, who let fly at them as thick as Hail.</p>
               <p>Upon this diſcomfiture, the King was reſolved to die in the Field, and much perſwaſions were uſed to induce him to ſave himſelf by retiring. In this Battel fell the Earl of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Clifford,</hi> and about 700. Knights and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquires, and as <hi>Modes Accountans</hi> relates, 6000. common Soldiers, though the <hi>Scotch</hi> Hiſtorian will have it 15000.</p>
               <p>The King being retired to <hi>York,</hi> reſolved to raiſe a new Army to revenge this diſhonour, but ſuch was the perverſeneſs of his Nobility that it came to nothing; yet the <hi>Scots</hi> heightned with this ſucceſs attempting to win <hi>Ireland</hi> were overthrown, and <hi>Edward</hi> Brother to King <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who had cauſed himſelf to be Crowned King ſlain.</p>
               <p>And now the King having loſt his Privado or ſecond ſelf, to whom he might open the Cabinet of his thoughts, to ſupply the Room of <hi>Gaviſtone,</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40182:14"/>
began to ſettle his affections on <hi>Hugh D' Spencer</hi> Lord Chamberlain, and ſo doated on him, as likewiſe on his Son for his ſake, that all things moved by their advice, which more inraged the diſcontented Lords than the actions of <hi>Gaviſtone</hi> had done; eſpecially when they perceived two to ſpring up in the room of one. Yet ſo far the Lords prevailed, that they procured their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; but not long, for the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and the Lords of his Faction taking up Arms, the King was reſolved to maintain his Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, though with the loſs of his Life: And therefore marched againſt them, who now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome diſtaſte given, were deprived of the Queens mediation, and thereupon command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given for the reverſion of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the <hi>Spencers,</hi> which was performed at <hi>London</hi> by the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and his Suffragan: And now the King having increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Power, followed hard upon the Lords, and cauſed <hi>Lancaſter</hi> to draw off his Army from <hi>Burton</hi> upon <hi>Trent,</hi> and march towards <hi>Burrowbridges,</hi> when in the way ſeveral of the Lords of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction left him, and threw themſelves upon the Kings Mercy, amongſt whom was the Traitour <hi>Mortimer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lancaſter</hi> with his retinue being arrived at <hi>Burrow-Bridges,</hi> was there ſtopped by <hi>Andrew D' Hackerly</hi> Captain of <hi>Carlile,</hi> and <hi>Simon Ward</hi> Captain of <hi>York,</hi> who had gathered great forces
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40182:14"/>
in thoſe parts, and there after ſome parly, he and the Lords of his Faction ſurrendred them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: When three days after the King came with all his Forces, and Erected a Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, where the Earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and moſt of the Lords and Barons that were taken being Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced as Traitours, were ſhortly after Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, beſides a number of the meaner ſort, though contrary to the Kings own inclination, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuppoſe by his afterwards bewailing the Death of his near Kinſman the Earl of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Things being at this paſs, the Queen began to conceive high diſpleaſure at the proceedings of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> who had prevailed with the King to abridge her allowance; whereupon ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that ſhe was rather kept as a waiting Woman, than a Queen or Heir of <hi>France</hi>; and at that time <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth King of <hi>France</hi> ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſion of quarrel againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> took this advantage, and ſecretly dealt with the Queen to obtain leave to come to his Court, and to bring with her Prince <hi>Edward</hi> her Son, which ſhe effected, and at the ſame time the Lord <hi>Mortimer</hi> having corrupted his Keepers, or as ſome will have it, by giving them a ſleepy Potion, got out of the Tower and fled into <hi>France</hi>: Where upon the Queens arrival, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came of her Cabinet Council, and otherwiſe more familiar than either became her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40182:15"/>
or his duty, as in place convenient will appear.</p>
               <p>Theſe things happening, and great differences ariſing between the two Nations, Queen <hi>Iſabel</hi> taking the advantage, ſolicited her Husband that ſhe might go over to mediate and reconcile the buſineſs, which requeſt of hers was ſeconded by the Lord <hi>Spencer,</hi> who perſwaded the King from going over to ſecure his poſſeſſions in <hi>Normandy</hi> in perſon, upon no other account then that he was afraid to ſtay behind him.</p>
               <p>Upon this interceſſion of the <hi>Spencers,</hi> the King conſents to the Queens deſire, and all things were prepared to tranſport her; where indeed upon her arrival, ſhe ſo ſar prevailed with her Brother, that matters of debate ceaſed, upon condition that King <hi>Edward</hi> ſhould give to his Son the Dutchy of <hi>Aquitaine,</hi> and Earldom of <hi>Pontine,</hi> which was accorded to, and the Prince ſent over to do Homage to his Uncle for them, though to the utter undoing of the King his Father; for now the Plot began, which in the end diſpoſſeſſed him of his Crown and Life, though coloured under a pretence of ruining the <hi>Spencers</hi>; which ſpecious pretext drew many who would otherwiſe have been unwilling to have <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ngaged.</p>
               <p>The Prince having payed his Homage to <hi>Charles D' Volois</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> was together with Queen <hi>Iſabel,</hi> his Mother, ſent for back, but
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40182:15"/>
the conſpiracy not yet having taken root, ſhe made many trivial excuſes to delay time, which <hi>Walter Stapleton</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> who attended on the Prince perceiving, and having had ſome knowledge of the frequent Councils that were held, and ſeeing the Kings Enemies in ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with the Queen, amongſt whom <hi>Mortimer</hi> was chief, he as in duty bound, ſecretly return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and advertiſed the King of the imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; who thereupon ſolicited (though to no purpoſe) the King of <hi>France</hi> to ſend over his Wife and Son. Whereupon he unadviſedly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to be proclaimed Enemies to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and baniſhed them with all their adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Which diſcovery and Sentence of Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo nettled the Queen and her Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices, that after ſome feigned ſubmiſſion, ſhe reſolved by open force to enter the Land, and thereupon without the conſent of her Husband, or the Peers of <hi>England,</hi> ſhe affianced her Son Prince <hi>Edward</hi> to the Lady <hi>Philippa</hi> Daughter to the Earl of <hi>Hanault,</hi> and with the Money of her Portion, levied Soldiers in <hi>Germany</hi> and other places.</p>
               <p>Upon notice of theſe proceedings, the King thought it time to ſtrengthen himſelf, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſet forth his Navy, which ſcouring the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Seas, brought in a Hundred and twenty <hi>French</hi> Prizes; as likewiſe he fortified the Sea-Ports, and put Gariſons into the places that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40182:16"/>
ſtood moſt advantagious to hinder the landing of a foreign Army. Yet the Queen and her Confederates put to Sea, her whole Power not exceeding 3000 of all Nations, and two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore St. <hi>Michaels</hi> day, landed at <hi>Orwel</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> the force being commanded by the Lord <hi>John,</hi> Brother to the Earl of <hi>Hanault.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The Nation which had been formerly troubled with the Inſurrection of the <hi>Plebeans,</hi> was again troubled by the Faction of the Peers, who ſtuck not to demand the removal and baniſhment of all ſuch as were near and dear unto the King, under pretence of evil Councillours: When in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their diſtaſt for the moſt part was found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon private Animoſities, which when they perceived they could not effect by fair means, they retired into the ſeveral Counties where their Lands were, and where they were moſt popular, and there raiſed ſuch forces as they

could get; which in a ſhort time in conjuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, made an Army of Forty thouſand men, though in time of eminent danger, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended no Forces conſiderable could be levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>With theſe forces they march towards <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> with an intent to force the King to accord to what they ſhould propoſe, although at that time <hi>Dela Pole,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Perſons againſt whom they chiefly objected, were baniſhed the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: The Lords that raiſed theſe ſtirs were <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Warwick, Derby, Nottingham</hi> and <hi>Arundel</hi>; yet upon the mediation of ſome Prelates the matter was ſo ordered, that the Lords were content to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves to the King ſitting in State at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> but ſo far from truſting his Royal word, that they came ſtrongly guarded, and coming into his preſence fell on their Knees; yet after the former ſtrain, repeated their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer demands, throwing down their Gloves, proteſting to prove them Traitours by Combate, whom they had ſo named; yet the King in a ſharp reply made them ſenſible how little he feared their Braves, but in the end referred the further determination of matters to the next Parliament, which ſhortly after held at <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>: And in the mean while bid them be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and mindful of their Allegiance, yet they

they would chuſe them another King, who both would and ſhould obey the Council of his Peers, they having him preſent whom they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have Inveſted with the Diadem, <hi>viz.

               <p>The King having received this threatning meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, though much againſt his Inclination, went to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> where the Lords were Aſſembled, where they forced him not only to diſclaim the Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> diveſt the Lord Chancellour, but likewiſe turn out of favour <hi>Alexander Nevil</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Durham</hi> and <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> the Lord <hi>Souches</hi> and <hi>Beaumont,</hi> with many more of ſmaller account; ſo that having ſtripped him of his friends, they thought the eaſier to rule him, and afterward committed as many of them as they could lay hands on Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners to the <hi>Tower,</hi> to anſwer ſuch Accuſations as ſhould be objected againſt them in the next Parliament, which beginning the <hi>Candlemas</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: The firſt day of the Seſſions, moſt of the Judges were Arreſted as they were ſitting upon the Bench, and committed to the <hi>Tower</hi>; the Crime alleadged againſt them was, that at <hi>Nottingham</hi> they having given Council to the Lords, which they aſſured them was according to Law, had afterwards aſſured the King that it was not according to Law, but only they

what was more grievous to the King, his Queen whom he intirely loved, all dying almoſt in a years ſpace; whereupon the Duke of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> went over to take poſſeſſion of his Dutchy, and then upon complaint of the Out-cries commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Wild <hi>Iriſh,</hi> paſſed into <hi>Ireland</hi> with an Army to ſuppreſs them, and upon his return into <hi>France,</hi> he was Married to the Lady <hi>Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> that Kings Daughter, and thereupon a peace concluded between the two Nations for the ſpace of thirty years: And now the Duke of <hi>Ireland</hi> being dead, the diſcontents of the Lords ſeemed ſomewhat abated, yet not long, for the reſtleſs Duke of <hi>Glocester</hi> ſtill contriving to ſecure his ſteerage at Helme by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awing the King, put ſo many affronts upon him, that he often complained thereof to his Uncles the Dukes of <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> who perſwaded the King of his good intent, though his words might ſeem harſh, but within a while after a Combination of the ſaid Duke, with the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and <hi>Warwick,</hi> the Lords <hi>Cobham</hi> and <hi>Chevy,</hi> being diſcovered by <hi>Thomas Mobray</hi> Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> wherein they had conſpired to Impriſon the King and his Uncles <hi>Lancaſter</hi> and <hi>York</hi>; as likewiſe to put to death many of his Councellours; upon which they were Arreſted, and the Duke ſent Priſoner to <hi>Calais,</hi> where af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he was ſmothered with a Pillow, and here only the Earl of <hi>Arundel</hi> Beheaded.</p>

paſſed an Act for reſtoring the Blood and Eſtates of ſuch as had either ſuffered, or were diſinherited as Traytors during the Reign of King <hi>Richard,</hi> yet gained he not ſo much love, but that a conſpiracy, if ſo it may be termed, in ſo rightful a cauſe, was formed for reſtoring <hi>Richard</hi> to his Regal Dignity: The chief contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of which were the Dukes of <hi>Exceter, Surry</hi> and <hi>Amaurle,</hi> the Earls of <hi>Huntington, Kent, Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Salisbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Spencer</hi> late Earl of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Carlile,</hi> Sir <hi>Bernard Broukas,</hi> Sir <hi>John Shevele,</hi> the Abbot of <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and <hi>John Maudlin,</hi> the counterfeit King <hi>Richard,</hi> a perſon who had been his Chaplain, and much reſembled him both in Features and Lineaments with ſeveral others, ſo that undertaking grew ſtrong, but how to ſeize upon <hi>Henry</hi> and his Son they knew not, unleſs with a multitude, and that not to be raiſed without ſuſpicion; ſo that it was concluded that it ſhould be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Holydays then at hand, under pretence of ſhows and paſtime, but the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Evening it ſhould have been put in practice, it was diſcovered to the King by the Duke of <hi>Amaurle</hi> as ſome report, yet ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly the King eſcaped, that he had ſcarce reached <hi>London</hi> before the Earls of <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury</hi> not knowing their deſign was diſcovered entered the Kings Lodging at <hi>Windſor</hi> with four hundred Armed Men, ſuppoſing to have ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him there: But when they found the Bird

               <p>After he was dead, his Body was brought up to <hi>London,</hi> and in St. <hi>Pauls</hi> expoſed to the view of the people, and the better to colour ſo great an iniquity, it was cauſed to be rumoured, that upon notice of the execution of his friends he had pined away with grief, but that he was ſtarved to death, agree <hi>Stow, Walſingham, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> and other Hiſtorians of account, though ſome there be that affirm he was ſlain by Sir <hi>Piers Exton</hi> after he had in reſiſting ſlain ſeveral of his Knights, but if he had been brained, or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wounded, certain it is that he would never have been expoſed to the view of the people, nor could he have been put to death without <hi>Henries</hi> conſent, but inquiry would have been made into the cauſe of his death.

away, yet the death of ſo great a Prince was huſhed, though it proved fatal to the King and Kingdom: For in the death of theſe two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the two ſtrongeſt twiſted Cords in the Cable of Government were ſnapped in ſunder; whereupon it proved too weak to Anchor the Ship riding in ſo fierce a torrent; for now the ambitious Duke of <hi>York</hi> Couſin to the King, having made ſtrong his Faction, began to ſhew himſelf openly, laying claim to the Crown whilſt the King was yet alive, drawing to his part a number of the diſcontented Nobility, who envied the Duke of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> a man true and juſt to his Country, and one whom the King highly favoured, but that not being like to bring his deſigns to perfection, taking example by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, he reſolves to make himſelf popular, and within a while ſo dealt by his Agents with the Mobile that they roſe in many Counties in great numbers, threatning like a Deluge all before them with ruin and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and from the Counties adjacent under the Leading of <hi>Jack Cade</hi> that audacious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, they Muſtered about <hi>London</hi>; and Quarte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the <hi>Suburbs,</hi> ruining and plundering ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſtately Houſes, nor did Churches ſcape their Sacrilegious hands.</p>

               <p>By this we may ſee who incouraged them to thoſe unnatural Inſurrections; they had likewiſe a third Article, but it only contained ſcandalous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the Duke of <hi>Suffolk,</hi> but theſe Traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous demands being denied, and their Articles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, they raged worſe than before: Whereupon Sir <hi>Humfry Stafford</hi> drawing together ſuch forces as he could get, Incountered them at <hi>Seven-Oaks,</hi> whither they were retired, but was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately ſlain, and his party routed by <hi>Cade</hi> the principal Rebel who diſarmed him, and put on his Armour, which ill became ſuch a Villain.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>KING <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>France,</hi> Third Son to <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, after the Death of his Father and two Brothers, <hi>Francis</hi> and <hi>Charles,</hi> (in the latter of whoſe Reign, by his ſpecial Command, happened the Bloody Maſſacree of the Proteſtants all over <hi>France</hi>) ſucceeded to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> and was Crowned with great Solemnity, but ſate not long in his Throne e're the <hi>Guiſes</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction began to give him diſturbance, and under combination of League againſt him, take up Armes, whereupon many Battles were Fought, and what they moſt alleadged, was his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Proteſtants, and to ſuch a height the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> puſhed the Diſcontent, for the hate he bore to the <hi>Hugonets,</hi> (as the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were termed) himſelf having been the Perſwader to the former Maſſacres, that the King was forced in ſecret wiſe to fly <hi>Paris,</hi> and for refuge, betake himſelf to his Army, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:40182:55"/>
he ſent for the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards King of <hi>France,</hi> whoſe Tragedy we ſhall next relate) to his aſſiſtance, who joyning For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, fought many Battels with the Leaguers, but finding them the more obſtinate, and that the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſought to deprive him of his Crown, it was ſo reſented by ſome of the Kings Servants, that they ſet upon the Duke in the Caſtle of <hi>Chartres,</hi> and forcing their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, killed him and his Brother the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which was no doubt a ſignal Judgment for the many Thouſand Innocents that by his advice were Maſſacred.</p>
               <p>Upon this the Leaguers prevailed with Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth (willing enough of himſelf) to excommunicate the King, and every where excite his Ruffians to Aſſaſſinate him, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for their encouragement great Rewards on Earth, and greater in Heaven, but the King was ſtill Invironed with ſuch Truſty Friends, that the Popes Helliſh deſign was for a while Fruſtrated, though no way that carryed the Face of a Probabillity was leſt unattempted.</p>
               <p>The Leaguers growing ſtill more Furious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made the Duke of <hi>Mayne,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> and others their head, therefore to nip them in the bud, the two Kings advanced with their Armys, and ſate down before the great City of <hi>Paris,</hi> the chief Seat of the Leaguers, and made Sundry Aſſaults, in order to win it,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:40182:55"/>
but did not ſo ſoon prevail, but that one of the Popes Helliſh Inſtruments, prevailed againſt the Kings Life, the manner thus. One <hi>James Clement</hi> a Jacob in Monk, having been tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered withall and moulded in private, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize ſo great a wickedneſs, he in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of his Convent, declares his Reſolution to kill the King, for which reſolution he is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed, called, <hi>Saviour of his Country,</hi> applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and promiſed Mountains in this World, if he overlived the Act, and if he miſcarry to be aſſured of Saintſhip to paſs immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Heaven, without calling at Purgatory, to have ſhrines and Altars erected in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the (as they wickedly and falſly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it) Pious, Religious and Holy undertaking, which ſo Tranſported the Novice, that he thought himſelf already capering above the Clouds, and thought every moment a day till he had put his wicked deſign in practice, wherefore, either to make him the more ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous, or that themſelves did think it more expedient, they carryed him to the High-Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, prayed over him, (O wickedneſs beyond Degree) that God would Strengthen his Arm to give a ſure Blow, and thereupon delivered him a Dagger, wrapped up in the Relict of a Saint, as they called it, and the better to compleat the Impoſtor, added to all their wickedneſs, by dipping the point of it in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:40182:56"/>
Wine of the Sacrament, and then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him with what they called Bleſſings, but indeed ſuch monſtrous Impiety, that to the everlaſting Infamy of the Romiſh-church let it ſtand Recorded.</p>
               <p>This deceived wretch full Fraught as he imagined with Honour in this World, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the other, Arrives at the Kings Camp at St. <hi>Clou,</hi> and pretended an Embaſſy from the Leaguers to the King, which he was char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to deliver to no Perſon but himſelf, and ſo by Feigned pretences, had admittance, when putting his hand into his Sleeve, as though he would draw out a Letter, with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned Dagger ſmote him in the Belly; the King wreſted the Dagger from him wounded him on the Head, which Strugling, made ſuch a noiſe, that the Guards coming haſtily in, and ſeeing the King wounded, ſtayed not to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the manner, but with their Swords cut the miſerable wretch to pieces, and ſent him by that means to his propper place, from whence not all the Papal Authority, nor Maſſes of a Thouſand years can deliver him.</p>
               <p>The next Morning the King Died of his Wounds, leaving the King of <hi>Navarr</hi> his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Army, who ſucceeded him by the name of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and ſoon after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged the Death of his Predeceſſor, by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeiging <hi>Paris</hi> the chief reſidence of the Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guers,

who greatly rejoyced for the Death of the King, reduced it to ſuch extremity by Famine, no filthy thing was left uneaten, and yet 6 or 7000 Dyed with Hunger and Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>The Pope hearing of the Kings Death, much Applauded the Murtherer, cauſed his Statute to be ſet up, and gave him a red Letter in the Callender, ſaying, he was worthy of praiſe, for he Stabbed not the Picture of a King, but the King of <hi>France,</hi> in the mid'ſt of his Army, and the beſt word he could afford the King was a Favourer of Hereticks, and an unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Prince, but his joy laſted not long, for he ſoon after Died miſerably, and thus much for the fall of this great King.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>KING <hi>CHARLES</hi> the Firſt of ever Bleſſed Memory, Son to the Renowned King <hi>James,</hi> firſt ſole Monarch of Great <hi>Brittains</hi> Empire, and his Vertuous Conſort <hi>Anne,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Chriſtianus</hi> King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> was Born at <hi>Dunfermel</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> on the 19 of <hi>November</hi> 1600, and when <hi>Englands</hi> bright Star, the Glorious Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Set, he with his Royal Father, the undoubted Heir of theſe Dominions, came to <hi>London,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with great Applauſe, attracting in his Infancy the Eyes and Hearts of the Nation to gaze upon his comely perſon, and much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his Vertues, promiſing ſuch a Bleſſing to <hi>England</hi> that indeed it was not worthy of, he being ſole Heir to the Crown by the Death of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> who died at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, <hi>Anno</hi> 1625, ſucceeded to the Crown, having before

his Fathers Death contracted Marriage with the Vertuous and moſt Renowned Princeſs <hi>Henrietta Maria,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Henry</hi> the IV. of <hi>France,</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Lewis</hi> the then Reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing King, and at firſt ſuch was the Univerſal Joy, that not a Cloud of Diſcontent appeared upon the Brow of any, but ſuch is the Malice of the Powers of Darkneſs to hinder the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the Goſpel (which in his Pious Reign, whilſt he abſolutely weiled the Sword of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſpread ſo wide, that the like no Age had parallel'd) was not wanting to raiſe ſuch Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Whirlwinds of Diſcontent, or rather Treaſonable Intentions, as overturned all or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Government, bedewing <hi>Albions</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face with Blood; and laſtly, with that more valuable then Ten thouſand vulgar lives, and to accompliſh it, the Monſters his Agents a while ſought by underhand means, but at laſt finding the Rabble moulded for their purpoſe they appeared bare faced, and inveighed againſt his Favourites, and firſt of all the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> who at length was Murthered by one <hi>Felton</hi> baſely and treacherouſly at <hi>Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> for which the Murtherer was deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly hanged in Chains: The next thing was to object againſt the Legality of Ship-Money, though Twelve of the Judges were of opinion that the Land being in danger of an Invaſion, the King at any time (with the advice of his
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:40182:61"/>
Counſel) might leavy Money to defend it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out intrenching upon Priviledge of Parliament, for indeed if ſuch a thing might not be, the Nation might be over-run with a Forreigne Enemy before money in a Parliamentary way could be raiſed to defend it, yet theſe were but ſlight Cavels for what happened afterward, for they openly encouraged the <hi>Scots</hi> to Rebel, and act ſuch Inſolencies, that the like happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not in that Kingdom before in the age of Man, Sacriledge and Murther being counted Trifles, and although they in Parliament deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King any ſupply for his urgent occaſions, yet for their dear Rebel Bretheren of <hi>Scotland</hi> in recompence for the miſchief they had done in Church and State, they voated them 100000 pounds, and to ſhew themſelves better than their words, ſoon after added 200000 more, and then fell to Impeach the noble Earl of <hi>Strafford</hi> of High-Treaſon, as many believed upon no other account then that he was the Kings Favourite, and ſo far proceeded in their pernicious Deſigns, by raiſing Tumults with Clubs and Stalves to aſſault the Kings Pallace, crying out, <hi>Juſtice againſt the Earl, and no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> that the King (though not without the Earls conſent) thinking to appeaſe thoſe Blood thirſty Wretches, after his Attaindure, Signed a Bill for his Execution, which on the 12 of <hi>May</hi> 1841, was Executed on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> his
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:40182:62"/>
Majeſty being greatly averſe to that Fatal Trajedy, and at the ſame time (O the Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of this Bleſſed Prince) Signed another Bill for the Houſes ſiting, till they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be diſſolved, which they turned to his deſtruction, for having got the Millitia into their Hands, they Armed againſt him, and to them joyned ſuch Rake-Hells as they could ſcrape together, of all Religions, as <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Independants, Quakers, Presbyters, Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, Ranters, Advanities, Socinians,</hi> and what not, all fit Inſtruments of Hells, to hew down the Ceeder of Monarchy, and Imbrew the Earth with Blood of her Sons.</p>
               <p>Upon this and many other affronts, the King ſets up his Standard at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> after his having been denyed entrance into <hi>Hull</hi> by the diſloyal Knight Sir <hi>John Hotham,</hi> who had a Reward for his Treaſon, the juſt Judgment of God ſoon overtook him, for both he and his Son were ſoon after Beheaded, by their Rebellious Maſters Command, <hi>viz.</hi> The Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for to pleaſe whom, he had manifeſtly broken his Oath to his Prince.</p>
               <p>And now all being in a Combuſtion, and no likelyhood of deciding matters, but by the Sword, (though nothing was wanting on his Majeſties part that might conduce to a Peace and happy Reconcilliation) many dreadful Battels were Fought, wherein the ſucceſs was

various till moſt of the Flower of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobillity were Loſt, and the King left deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Mony, and other ſuch neceſſaries, as are Rightfully termed the Sinns of War, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who rightfully is painted Blind, turned the Scale of Victory and ſucceſs, till no conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable place of Strength but <hi>Oxford</hi> was left him, where finding no conceſſions, would mollifie the Flinty temper of his implacable Enemies; he after ſome conſultation with his Council, reſolved (rather than to hazard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged to ſuch hard conditions as a cloſe Seige might extort) to Fly to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army who were in the Parliaments pay, and from ſome of whoſe perfidious chief he had received ſeveral kind Invitations, which he effected in the diſguiſe of a Serving-Man, and found it Incamped at <hi>South-well,</hi> where he was firſt kindly entertained with promiſe of Protection, but Treacherous Villains as they were (and be it a Brand to their Poſterity for ever) rather then looſe their Arrears due from the Parliament, they delivered up their lawful Soveraign the beſt of Kings to the diſpoſe of his mercileſs Enemies, but Heavens vengeance delayed not to ſuch perfidious dealing, for ſoon after all <hi>Scotland</hi> was put into a Bloody Sweat by the Uſurper.</p>
               <p>The King being in the Hands of his Enemies was Impriſoned at <hi>Holmby,</hi> where having ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ſome time, he was taken thence by Collo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel <hi>Joyce</hi> and carryed to <hi>Childerſly,</hi> thence to <hi>Newark,</hi> and ſo by ſeveral Stages till he came to <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> where a Treaty was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed though nothing leſs intended, for at that very time the Tub-thumpers, fearing if the King ſhould be reſtored, they ſhould looſe their canting Trade, bauled out nothing but Death and deſolation, ſaying, <hi>Not words, but rhe Sword, ſhall end the Controverſie</hi>; and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a hundred Bugbears before the Peoples Eyes to render them averſe to any compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but there cant availed not, for ſuch was the Gracious conceſſions of this good King, that they were highly approved of by many, and therefore <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his Faction fearing it ſhould come to perfection, layed a Plot to fright the King from <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> by poſſeſſing him under pretence of Friendſhip that there was a deſign againſt his Life, which was ſo Hypocritically demonſtrated to him by Collonel <hi>Whaly,</hi> that the King leaving Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters behind him to ſignifie the cauſe of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, he in the Company and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Mr. <hi>Aſhburnham</hi> and others, departed about midnight, none endeavouring to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach his paſſage, the Plot being before hand ſo layed, and in the end came into the Iſle of <hi>Wight,</hi> of which Collonel <hi>Hammond</hi> was made Governour, who being Brother to his Majeſties
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:40182:63"/>
Chaplain, he thought he might the better confide in him, but as diſloyal as he was he proved perfidious to his diſtreſſed Majeſty, for upon the Parliaments publiſhing their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to make it Treaſon for any that conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Perſon, he ſecured him, and ſent them notice thereof.</p>
               <p>Upon this the King Writes to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, giving them more fully to underſtand the reaſons of his departure, and that he was ſtill deſirous that the Treaty of Peace might be continued, and that he would conſent to any thing that in Honour and conſcience he might do, ſo that after many meſſages had paſſed, the Treaty was renewed, wherein the Kings extraordinary Wiſdom appeared, and his Princely Goodneſs ſo far condeſcending for the ſake of Peace, that his conceſſions were by the Rebels themſelves Voted ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, which the Arch-Traytor <hi>Cromwell,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and finding that ſuch a concluſion would hinder him from aſpiring, he Plotted with the Factious Army Officers to marr the whole proceedings, by new modelling the Parliament, and turning out ſuch as were Inclinable to accord with his Majeſty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon placing Guards about the Parliament-Houſe, after ſome conference with the Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hewſon</hi> ſent in a Paper to the Houſe of Commons, Requiring the Impeached

Members and Major-General <hi>Brown</hi> (as Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of calling in <hi>Hammilton,</hi> a Forged pretence to pick a Quarrel) might be ſecured and brought to Juſtice, and that the ninety and odd Members that refuſed to Vote againſt the <hi>Scotch</hi> Ingagement, and all that Voted for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calling the four Votes of non Addreſſes to his Majeſty, and for a Perſonal Treaty, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcing Votes in his Majeſties anſwer ſhould be immediately ſuſpended the Houſe, and that thoſe that had done no ſuch things ſhould draw up their Proteſtations in Writing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a brave way of making and unmaking Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but the Paper being thrown out of the Houſe with deteſtation, whereupon all the Guards advanced, and a ſtrong Guard ſet at the Houſe Door, where Sir <hi>Hardreſs Waller</hi> and the Collonels, <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Hewſon,</hi> lying purdue violently ſeized upon ſeveral Knights and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes as they came out; others they decoyed out under Sleeveleſs pretences, and in the end ſeized upon, debarred of Entrance, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to decline coming no leſs then 200 forty one, all which number were ſecured and kept Priſoners, <hi>Hugh Peters</hi> being their Keeper, who proteſting againſt this force and Inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, done upon and againſt the Houſes and priviledges of Parliament were releaſed (all except Major-General <hi>Brown,</hi> who was kept Priſoner at St. <hi>James</hi>'s) <hi>Ireton</hi> bidding them at

their departure look to it, and ſee they Acted nothing againſt the preſent Parliament or Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
               <p>Thus all things being brought and fitted to their purpoſe, the King is taken from the Iſle of <hi>Wight</hi> and carried to <hi>Hurſt</hi> Caſtle, a place very incommodious both for health and neceſſaries it ſtanding in the Sea, and no freſh water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be had within three Miles, from whence <hi>Harriſon</hi> conveyed him to <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and ſo by ſeveral Journies to St. <hi>James</hi>'s, that inſolent Traytor riding in the Coach with him, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing order to his Souldiers to beat ſuch as preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed near, either to ſee him, or compaſſionate his Sufferings.</p>
               <p>And now theſe Monſters reſolving the Kings Death, to make way for their greatneſs, the offalls or fragments of a Parliament make an Ordinance, whereby they took away and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anulled the Oaths of Supremacy and Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and at the ſame time the Council of War forbid any State to be uſed towards his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, whoſe attendants were for the moſt part diſcharged, and to compleat their Villanies, and to appear in their proper colours, an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance was brought into the Commons Houſe by <hi>Scot</hi> for the Tryal of the King, ſo monſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and wicked a propoſal that no Age e're parallel'd, which after ſome debate was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of, and ſent to the Lords Houſe, who

               <p>And upon theſe Votes they made the Neſt, wherein they hatched the Monſter, called <hi>An Act for the Tryal the King, &amp;c.</hi> which the 9<hi>th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> 1648 was Proclaimed in <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Hall</hi> by Serjeant <hi>Danby,</hi> by the Beat of Drum, and ſound of Trumpet, and notice given that the Commiſſioners of the pretended High-Court of Juſtice, were to ſit the next day, and that all thoſe that had any thing to ſay againſt <hi>Charles Stuart</hi> King of <hi>England,</hi> might be heard; The like was done in <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> and at the <hi>Royal-Exchange.</hi>

               <p>Matters being brought to this paſs, on the 20 of <hi>January</hi> 1648. <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> the Preſident with about 70 of the aforeſaid pack, Guarded by Partizans, came into <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> and ſate down in the Court, whither the King was brought by Collonel <hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> and plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Bar by the Serjeant at Arms, where a Crimſon-Chair was ſet, in which he ſate down without moving his Hat, or Regarding the Monſters, yet the Preſident ſtood up and declared why he was brought thither, laying many Notorious Falſities to his charge, and was ſeconded by Solicitor <hi>Cook,</hi> but the King not to Impair his Kingly Character, abſolutely denyed the Juriſdiction of the Court, and ſo Learnedly oppoſed the Illiterate Rout, with Stupendious Arguments, that they were beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:40182:67"/>
from all Defences, and nothing to ſay but that they were well ſatisfied in their Power, and that it was not for him to diſpute their Juriſdiction, (as indeed it availed not, for paſt doubt they Right or wrong had before-hand determined his Deſtruction) and yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened his Majeſty before them the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, and the next day, as alſo on the 23 and ſtill preſſed him to anſwer the charge and own the Juriſdiction of the Court, without per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting him (though he earneſtly deſired it) to give his reaſons why he refuſed it, nor to plead for the Liberty of his Subjects, which moſt of all he inſiſted on; but Adjourned the Court to the 27 when notwithſtanding the Kings Learned Arguments and perſwaſions, which they impatiently heard, they paſſed Judgment upon him, which after a long repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of what had paſſed, during the Tryal, concluded in the words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For all which Treaſons and Crimes this Court doth adjudge that he (meaning the King) as a</hi> Tyrant, Traytor, Murtherer <hi>and</hi> Publick-E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, <hi>ſhall be put to Death by ſevering his Head from his Body,</hi> after which <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>It was the Act and Reſolution of the whole Court.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus they layed to his charge things that he knew not, nor could be poſſible Guilty of, for Kings are accountable to none but God,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:40182:67"/>
nor can any man of Sence Imagine that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be committed againſt a Subject, by his Prince, no Law allowing that it can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend, but it muſt ever aſcend.</p>
               <p>Yet to the amazement of all Nations, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carryed on their Villany to this height, they proceeded further, for on the 29 of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary</hi> a Warrant was directed under the Hands of <hi>John Bradſhaw, Thomas</hi> Lord <hi>Gray</hi> of <hi>Grooby</hi> and <hi>Oliver Cromwell,</hi> to <hi>Francis Hacker,</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel <hi>Hunks,</hi> and Lieutenant Collonel <hi>Phray,</hi> for the Execution of their wicked Sentence, the place appointed for the Tragedy being before <hi>VVhitehall</hi>; and the next day between the hours of ten in the Morning and five in the Afternoon, to compleat the great wickedneſs, But to amuſe the People that every where de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted againſt their Diabollical proceedings, and to prevent any attempt that might be made, to reſcue his Majeſty, they cauſed it to be Rumoured that they would reſpite the Execution; yet on the Fatal 30 of <hi>January</hi> in the Year aforeſaid, the Commiſſioners met, and ordered four or five of their Canting Tub-Preachers to attend upon his Majeſty at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, but he refuſed to have any conference with thoſe Varlets.</p>
               <p>In the Morning before his Majeſty was brought thence, Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> officiated, and read Divine Service, when as the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:40182:68"/>
Second Leſſon appointed to be Read for that day, by the Church Calender, happened to be the 27 Chap. of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> being the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Saviours paſſion, which cauſed his Majeſty to Thank the Doctor, for chuſing ſo fit a place of Scripture, but being given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that it fell in courſe, he was highly Animated, then his Majeſty received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, after which and ſome other Devotions ended, he was conveyed to <hi>Whitehall</hi> through the Park, by a Regiment of Foot, but about his Perſon were a private Guard of Partizans, the Biſhop on the one hand and Collonel <hi>Thomlinſon</hi> on the other, when with a chearful voice, he bid the Guard march faſter, ſaying, <hi>That now he went before them to ſtrive for a Heavenly Crown, with leſs Solicitude then he had often Incouraged his Souldiers to Fight for an Earthly Diadem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Being come to the Stairs of the long Gallery he paſſed through, and coming in to an appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment appointed for him, continued in fervent Prayer, wondering at the delay, but the reaſon was becauſe the Scaffold was not Finiſhed, here he received a Letter from the Prince, brought by Mr. <hi>Seymour,</hi> and Dinner time came, he refuſed to Dine, only Eat a bit of Bread and Drank a Glaſs of Clarret.</p>
               <p>About one of the Clock Collonel <hi>Hacker</hi> came with his Guard of Officers and brought
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:40182:68"/>
his Majeſty, accompanyed with the Biſhop and Collonel <hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> through the Banqueting-Houſe, and from thence upon the Scaffold, a Bridge being made from one of the Windows to it, round about which ſtood a Guard of 7 Regiments of Horſe and Foot there placed to keep off his weeping Subjects from approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to commiſerate their dying Soveraign, the Scaffold was hung with mourning, and ſo Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanouſly were they bent on their wicked pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that fearing his Majeſty would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmit to the Axe, they had driven in Iron ſtaples to force him to the Block with Cords, O monſtrous Barbarity of theſe Inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane monſters.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty looking upon the Blcok, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked <hi>Hacker</hi> whither there were none higher, turned to <hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> and began his Speech, wherein he declared, <hi>His Innocence, the unjuſt Incroachments of the Parliament upon his Perogative Royal, and their begining the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural War againſt him, yet Prays to God to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them all, and all that had a hand in his Death, adviſes them to reſtore the Church and Liberties of the People and the Crown to his Succeſsor, laying down the particular means and methods that would unavoidably conduce to the Nations happineſs, declaring till they were ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually obſerved, the Nation would be miſerable; and Laſtly, that his Blood was cauſeleſly ſhed,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:40182:69"/>
and that he Dyed the Martyr of the People,</hi> and then at the motion of Dr. <hi>Juxon,</hi> declared his Religion, ſaying, <hi>That he Dyed a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian according to the Profeſſion of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as he found it left to him by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of which this good man can bear me witneſs, (meaning Dr.</hi> Juxon) then turning to the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſaid, <hi>Sirs, Excuſe me for I have a good Cauſe, and I have a Gracious God,</hi> then turning to <hi>Hacker,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>Take care they do not put me to pain,</hi> after which he ſaid to the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, <hi>I ſhall ſay but very ſhort Prayers, and when I thruſt out my Hands</hi> — then he called to Dr. <hi>Juxon</hi> for his Night-Cap, which he having put on, ſaid to the Doctor, <hi>I have a Gracious God and a Good cauſe on my Side,</hi> to which the Doctor anſwered, <hi>There is but one Stage more, this Stage is Turbulent and Trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, it is a ſhort one, but you may conſider it will ſoon carry you a very great way, it will carry you from Earth to Heaven, and there you will find a great deal of Cordial Joy and Comfort,</hi> To which his Majeſty replied, <hi>I go from a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible to an Incorruptible Crown, where no diſturbance can be, no diſturbance in the World,</hi> when as the Doctor again anſwered, <hi>You are to Ex<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>After this, they asked if his Hair was well, then he taking off his Cloak and George, gave
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:40182:69"/>
to the Doctor, ſaying, <hi>Remember</hi>— which as many ſuppoſe was to give his <hi>George</hi> to the Prince, then he put off his Doublet, and bid the Executioner ſet the Block, and bid him when he ſtretched out his Hands (ſhewing him the manner) to ſtrike.</p>
               <p>After that, having ſaid ſeveral Prayers and bidding the Executioner (who was diſguiſed with a Vizard-maſque) ſtay for the ſigne, he meekly layed down his head, and after a ſhort ſpace giving the Sign, (O horror and Eternal Infamy to his Murtherers) had it ſtruck off at one blow, which (bloody as it was) was taken up and ſhewed to the People, who in Groans and tears expreſſed their unfeigned Sorrow.</p>
               <p>The Tragedy Finiſhed, his Body and Head were put into a Coffin covered with mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Velvet, and carryed to his Houſe at St. <hi>James</hi>'s, where it was Embalmed and layed in a Leaden Coffin, to be ſeen of ſuch as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither, and after a Fortnights expoſing, delivered to four of his Servants, who in a Hearſe conveyed it to <hi>VVindſor</hi> themſelves, in mourning accompanying the Corps, and placed it in the <hi>Danes-Hall,</hi> all hung with mourning, and Lights ſtuck round, whither reſorted the Duke of <hi>Lenox,</hi> the Marqueſs of <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Lindſey,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> to pay their laſt Duty, to their Royal-Maſter, having received orders of

Parliament for his Interment, but were deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Whitchcot</hi> to Bury him in St. <hi>Georges</hi> Chappel by the form of the Common-Prayer-Book of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> though they pleaded the conſent of the Parliament thereto, he alledging that the Parliament would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the uſe of what they had ſo ſolemnly aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and ſo deſtroy their own Acts, the Lords reply'd, that there was a difference between deſtroying their own Act and diſpencing with it, and that no power ſo binds its own hands as to diſable it ſelf in ſome caſes, but the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Fanatick would not hearken to their reaſons, ſo that they were obliged to ſeek a place, and at laſt found King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight his Vault, where tis conjectured his Body and that of his Wife the Lady <hi>Jane Seymore</hi> lies in Leaden Coffins, there being Room for one more, they Interred the King, and upon his Coffin fixed in large Characters King <hi>Charles,</hi> 1648, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewing the Earth with Tears and Sighs, but eſpecially the Biſhop, for that he was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to do his laſt Duty to his Royal Maſter.</p>
               <p>Thus by Murthering hands fell this bleſſed Martyr, but Heavens Vengeance was not ſlow in making it manifeſt, how Sacred Kings lives ought to be held; Firſt it is obſerved that the firſt raiſers of the Rebellion moſt of them died miſerable, ſome by Grievous Diſeaſes, ſome Beheaded and Hanged by their own Rebel
