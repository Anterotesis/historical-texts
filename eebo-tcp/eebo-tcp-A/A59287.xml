            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But who has 'em, or has 'em not, is not my present business; onely as you profess your selves Gentlemen, to conjure you to give an Adversary fair play; and that if any person whatsoever shall pretend to be aggrieved by this POEM, or any part of it, that he would bear it patiently; since the Licentiousness of the first <hi>Absolom</hi> and <hi>Achitophel</hi> has been the sole occasion of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of This, I having only taken the Measure of My Weapon; from the Length of his; which by the Rules of Honour ought not to offend you; especially, since the boldness of that Ingenious Piece, was wholly taken from the Encouragement you gave the Author; and 'tis from that Boldness only that this POEM takes its Birth: for had not his daring Pen brought that Piece into the World, I had been so far from troubling my self in any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on this kind, that I may justly say in one sence, the Writer of that <hi>Absolom,</hi> is the Author of this. This favour, as in Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice due, obtain'd from you, I shall not trouble you with a long Preface, like a tedious Compliment at the Door, but desire you to look in for your Entertainment. Onely I cannot forbear telling you, that one thing I am a little concern'd for you, <hi>Tories,</hi> that your <hi>Absoloms</hi> and <hi>Achitophels,</hi> and the rest of your Grinning Satyres against the <hi>Whiggs,</hi> have this one unpardonable Fault, That the Lash is more against a <hi>David,</hi> than an <hi>Achitophel;</hi> whilst the running down of the PLOT at so extravagant a rate, savours of very little less (pardon the Expression) than ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Majesty it self, and turning all those several Royal Speeches to the Parliament on that Subject, onely into those double-tongu'd Oracles that sounded one thing, and meant another. Besides, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this unmannerly Boldness, of not onely branding the publick Iustice of the Nation, but affronting even the Throne it self, to

Nay, you are so far now from your former niceties and scruples, and disputing about raising of Armies, and not one Commission found, that you can swallow the raising of a whole Protestant ARMY, without either Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or Commission-Officer; Nay, the very When, Where, and How, are no part of your Consideration. 'Tis true, the great Cry amongst you, is, The Nations Eyes are opn'd; but I am afraid, in most of you, 'tis onely to look where you like best: and to help your lewd Eye-sight, you have got a damnable trick of turning the Perspective upon occasion, and magnifying or diminishing at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.

And therefore I am so reasonable in this point, that I should be very glad to divide 'em between 'em, and give the Food to the <hi>Tory,</hi> and the Knave to the <hi>Whigg.</hi> For the <hi>Tories</hi> that will believe no POPISH PLOT, may as justly come under that denomination, as They, that <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>said in their Hearts there was no God.</hi> And then let the <hi>Whiggs</hi> that do believe a <hi>Popish Plot</hi> be the Knaves, for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to endeavour to hinder the Effects of a <hi>Popish Plot,</hi> when the <hi>Tories</hi> are resolved to the contrary. But to draw near a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, I have one favour more to beg of you, that you'll give me the freedom of cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <l>IN Gloomy Times, when Priestcraft bore the sway,</l>
