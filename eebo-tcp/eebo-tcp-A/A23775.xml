            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>YOu needed not any Intercession to recommend this task to me, which brought its Invitations and Reward with it. I very willingly read over all the sheets, both of the <hi>Discourse,</hi> and the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions</hi> annext, and finde great cause to bless God for both, not discerning what is wanting in any part of either, to render it with Gods blessing, most sufficient, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the great End designed, the Spiritual supplies and advantages of all those that shall be exercised therein. The Subject matter of it, is indeed, what the Title undertakes, <hi>The Whole Duty of Man,</hi> Set down in all the Branches, with those advantages of brevity and Partitions, to invite, and support, and engage the Reader, <hi>That</hi> Condescension to the meanest capacities, but with all, <hi>That</hi> weight of Spiritual Arguments, wherein the best Proficients will be glad to be assisted, that it seems to me equally fitted for both sorts of Readers, which shall bring with them a
<pb facs="tcp:60285:3"/>
sincere desire of their own, either present or future advantages. The <hi>Devotion part</hi> in the Conclusion is no way inferiour, being a seasonable aid to every mans Infirmities, and hath extended it self very particularly to all our principal concernments; <q>The <hi>Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> hath supplyed the place of a <hi>Preface,</hi> which you seem to desire from me, and leaves me no more to add, but my Prayers to God, That the Author which hath taken care to convey so liberal an Alms to the <hi>Corban so secretly,</hi> may not miss to be rewarded <hi>openly,</hi> in the visible power, and benefit of this Work, on the hearts of the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was never in more need of such supplyes, as are here afforded.</q> That his All-sufficient Grace will blesse the seed sown, and give an abundant encrease, is the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest request of</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sect. 1.</hi> THE only intent of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing <hi>Treatise,</hi> is to be a short and <hi>Plain Direction to the very meanest Readers,</hi> to behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so in this world, that they may be happy for ever in the next. But because 'tis in vain to tell men their Duties, till they be perswaded of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of performing it; I shall before I proceed to the <hi>Particulars</hi> required of every Christian, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to win them to the <hi>practice</hi> of one <hi>general</hi> Duty <hi>preparatory</hi> to all the rest, and that is the Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and <hi>CARE</hi> of their own <hi>SOULS,</hi> without which they will never think themselves much concern'd in the other.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2. MAN,</hi> We know is made up of <hi>two</hi> parts, a <hi>BODY</hi> and a <hi>SOUL:</hi> The Body only the husk or shell of the <hi>Soul,</hi> a lump of flesh, subject to many diseases and pains while it lives, and at last to <hi>Death</hi> it self, and then 'tis so far from being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, that 'tis not to be endured above ground, but layed to rot in the Earth. Yet to this viler part of us we perform a great deal of Care, all the labour &amp; toil we are at, is to maintain that. But the more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb facs="tcp:60285:4"/>
part, the <hi>Soul</hi> is little thought of, no care taken, how it fares, but as if it were a thing that nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd us, is left quite neglected never consider'd by us.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> This <hi>Carelesness</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> is the root of all the sin we commit, &amp; therefore whosoever intends to sit upon a Christian course, must in the first place amend that. To the doing whereof, there needs no deep learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or extraordinary parts, the simplest man living (that is not a <hi>natural fool)</hi> hath understanding enough for it, if he will but act in this by the same <hi>Rules</hi> of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon <hi>Reason,</hi> whereby he proceeds in his worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness. I will therefore now briefly set down some of those <hi>Motives,</hi> which use to stir up our care of any outward thing, and then apply them to the Soul.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <hi>4.</hi> There be <hi>FOUR</hi> things especially, which use to awake our care, the <hi>first</hi> is the <hi>Worth</hi> of the thing, the <hi>Second</hi> the <hi>Usefulness</hi> of it to us, when we cannot part with it without great damage and mischief, the <hi>Third</hi> the great <hi>Danger</hi> of it, and the <hi>Fourth</hi> the <hi>Likelihood</hi> that our care will not be in vain, but that it will preserve the Thing cared for.</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <hi>5.</hi> For the First, we know our care of any worldly thing is answerable to the <note place="margin">The worth of the Soul.</note> 
                     <hi>worth</hi> of it; what is of greatest Price, we are most watchful to preserve, &amp; most fearful to lose; no man locks up <hi>dung</hi> in his chest, but his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney or what he counts precious, he doth. Now in this respect the Soul deserves more care, then all the things in the world besides, for tis infinitely more worth. First in that it is made after the <hi>Image</hi> of God, it was God that <hi>breathed into man this breath of life,</hi> Gen. <hi>2. 7.</hi> Now God being of the greatest Excellency and worth, the more anything is like him, the more it is to
<pb facs="tcp:60285:4"/>
be valued. But 'tis sure that no Creature upon the earth is at all like <hi>God,</hi> but the <hi>Soul</hi> of man, and therefore nothing ought to have so much of our care. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> never <hi>Dies,</hi> We use to prize things according to their <hi>Durableness:</hi> what is most Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is most Worth. Now the Soul is a thing that will last for ever, when Wealth, Beauty, Strength, nay our very bodies themselves fade away, the Soul still Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues. Therefore in that respect also, the Soul is of the greatest worth; and then what strange madness is it for us to neglect them as we do? We can spend Days, and Weeks, and Moneths, and Years, nay our whole lives in hunting after a little wealth of this world, which is of no Durance or continuance, and in the mean time let this great durable treasure, our <hi>Souls,</hi> be stollen from us by the <hi>Divel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <hi>6.</hi> A second <hi>Motive</hi> to our care of any <note place="margin">The misery of loosing the Soul.</note> thing is the <hi>USEFULNES</hi> of it to us, or the great Mischief we shall have by the <hi>loss</hi> of it. Common Reason teaches us this in all things of this life: If our Hairs fall, we do not much regard it, because we can be well enough without them: But if we are in danger to lose our <hi>Eyes</hi> or <hi>Limbs,</hi> we think all the care we can take little enough to prevent it, because we know it will be a great mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. But certainly there is no Misery to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to that misery that follows the Loss of the Soul. 'Tis true, we cannot Lose our Souls, in one sense, that is so lose them, that they shall cease to Be; but we may lose them in another, that we shall wish to lose them even in that. That is we may lose that happy estate, to which they were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and plunge them into the extremest misery.
<pb facs="tcp:60285:5"/>
In a word we may Lose them in <hi>Hell,</hi> whence there is no fetching them back, and so they are lost for ever. Nay, in this consideration our very <hi>bodies</hi> are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, those Darlings of ours, for which all our care is layed out: for they must certainly after Death be Raised again, and be joyned again to the Soul, and take part with it in whatever state; if then our care for the <hi>body</hi> take up all our Time and Thoughts, and leave us none to bestow on the poor Soul, it is sure the Soul will for want of that care, be made for ever Miserable. But it is as sure, that that very <hi>Body</hi> must be so too. And therefore if you have any true kindness to your <hi>Body,</hi> shew it by taking Care of your <hi>Souls.</hi> Think with your selves, how you will be able to Endure <hi>Everlasting Burnings;</hi> if a small spark of Fire, lighting on the least part of the body be so intolerable, what will it be to have the Whole cast into the hottest flames? And that not for some few hours or days, but for ever; so that when you have spent many <hi>Thousands</hi> of years in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Torment, you shall be no nearer coming out of it, then you were the First Day you went in: think of this I say, and think this withal, that this will certainly be the end of Neglecting the Soul, and therefore afford it some care, if it be but in pity to the <hi>Body,</hi> that must bear a part in its Miseries.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <hi>7.</hi> The <hi>Third Motive</hi> to tke care of any thing is its being in <hi>DANGER;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The danger the Soul is in.</note> now a thing may be in danger two ways first, by <hi>Enemies</hi> from without: This is the Case of the <hi>Sheep,</hi> which is still in danger of being Devoured by <hi>Wolves,</hi> and we know that makes the Shepherd so much the more watchful over
<pb facs="tcp:60285:5"/>
it. Thus is it with the Soul, which is in a great deal of Danger, in respect of its <hi>enemies:</hi> those we know are the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> which are all such noted enemies to it, that the very First Act we do in behalf of our <hi>Souls,</hi> is to Vow a continual War against them. This we all do in our <hi>Baptisme;</hi> and whoever makes any Truce with any of them, is false not only to his Soul, but to his <hi>Vow</hi> also, becomes a Forsworn creature: A Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well worthy our laying to heart. But that we may the better understand, what Danger the Soul is in, let us a little consider the <hi>quality</hi> of these ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <hi>8.</hi> In a <hi>War</hi> you know there are divers things that make an Enemy terrible. The first is <hi>Subtilty,</hi> and Gunning, by which alone many victories have been won, and in this respect the <hi>Divel</hi> is a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Adversary, he long since gave sufficient proof of his Subtilty, in beguiling our first Parents, who yet were much wiser then we are, and therefore no wonder if he deceive and cheat us. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Watchfulness</hi> and <hi>Diligence</hi> of an <hi>Enemy,</hi> makes him the more to be Feared; and here the <hi>Divel</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds; it is his trade and business to destroy us, and he is no loiterer at it, <hi>he goes up and down seeking whom he may devour, 1 Pet. 5. 8.</hi> He watches all Opportunities of Advantage against us, with such diligence, that he will be sure never to let any slip him. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> an <hi>Enemy</hi> neer us is more to be feared then one at a <hi>Distance,</hi> for if he be far off, we may have time to arm, and prepare our selves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, but if he be near he may steal on us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares. And of this sort is the <hi>flesh,</hi> it is an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb facs="tcp:60285:6"/>
at our Doors, shall I say? Nay in our Bosoms, it is always near us, to take occasion of doing us mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the <hi>Baser</hi> and <hi>Falser</hi> an <hi>Enemy</hi> is, the more dangerous; he that Hides his malice under the shew of Friendship will be able to do a great deal the more hurt. And this again is the flesh, which like <hi>Joab</hi> to <hi>Abner, 2 Sam. 3. 27.</hi> Pretends to speak <hi>peaceably</hi> to us, <hi>but wounds us to death;</hi> tis forward to purvey for Pleasures and Delights for us, and so seems very kinde, but it has a <hi>hook</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that <hi>bait,</hi> and if we bite at it we are lost. <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> the Number of <hi>Enemies</hi> make them more Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; and the <hi>World</hi> is a vast Army against us: There is no state or condition in it, nay scarce a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which doth not at sometime or other fight against the Soul: The <hi>Honours</hi> of the world seek to wound us by <hi>pride,</hi> the <hi>Wealth</hi> by <hi>covetousness;</hi> the <hi>Prosperity</hi> of it tempt us to Forget <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities</hi> to <hi>murmur</hi> at him. Our very <hi>Table be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a snare</hi> to us, our me at draws us to <hi>Glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> our drink to <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> our <hi>Company,</hi> nay, our nearest <hi>Friends</hi> often bear a part in this War against us, whilest either by their example, or perswasions they intice us to sin.</p>
                  <p n="9">
                     <hi>9.</hi> Consider all this, and then tell me, whether a Soul thus beset hath leasure to <hi>sleep:</hi> even <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah</hi> could tell <hi>Sampson,</hi> it was time to <hi>awake</hi> when the <hi>Philistines were upon him.</hi> And <hi>CHRIST</hi> tells us, <hi>if the good man of the house had known in what houre the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not have suffered his house to be broken up,</hi> Mat. <hi>24. 43.</hi> But we live in the midst of Thieves, and therefore must look for them
<pb facs="tcp:60285:6"/>
every houre, and yet who is there among us, that hath that common providence for this precious part of him, his Soul, which he hath for his house, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the meanest thing that belongs to him? I fear our Souls may say to us, as Christ to his Disciples. Mat. <hi>26. 40. What could ye not watch with me one houre?</hi> For I doubt it would pose many of us to tell when we bestowed one Houre on them, though we know them to be continually beset with most Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enemies. And then alas! What is like to be the case of these poor Souls, when their Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries bestow so much Care, and Diligence to destroy them, and we will afford none to preserve them? Surely the same as of a Besieged Town, where no Watch or Guard is kept, which is certain to fall a prey to the enemy. <hi>Consider this ye that forget God,</hi> nay ye that forget your selves, lest <hi>he pluck you away, and there be none to deliver you,</hi> Psal. <hi>50. 22.</hi>

                     <hi>10.</hi> But I told you there was a <hi>Second</hi> way, whereby a thing may be in Danger, and that is from some Disorder or <hi>Distemper within</hi> it self. This is often the case of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> they are not only lyable to outward Violence, but they are within themselves Sick and Diseased. And then we can be sensible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that they are in danger, and need not to be taught to seek out for means to recover them. But this is also the case of the <hi>Soul;</hi> we reckon those parts of the body <hi>diseased,</hi> that do not rightly perform their <hi>office,</hi> we account it a <hi>sick palate</hi> that <hi>tastes</hi> not aright, a sick <hi>stomack</hi> that <hi>digests</hi> not.

                     <hi>11.</hi> The <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Soul</hi> are especially these three: The <hi>UNDERSTANDING,</hi> the <hi>WILL,</hi> and the <hi>AFFECTIONS.</hi> And that these are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered, there needs little proof; let any man look seviously into his own <hi>Heart,</hi> and consider, how little it is he knows of spiritual things, and then tell me whether his <hi>Understanding</hi> be not dark: How much apter is he to <hi>Will evil</hi> then <hi>good,</hi> and then tell me whether his <hi>Will</hi> be not <hi>Crooked?</hi> And how strong <hi>Desires</hi> he hath after the pleasures of sin, and what <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>faint</hi> ones towards God, and <hi>goodness,</hi> and then tell me whether his <hi>Affections</hi> be not <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered,</hi> and rebellious even against the voice of his own Reason within him? Now as in bodily diseases, the first step to the cure is to know the Cause of the sickness, so likewise here it is very necessary for us to know how the <hi>Soul</hi> first fell into this <hi>Diseased con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and that I shall now briefly tell you.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <hi>12. GOD</hi> created the first Man <hi>Adam</hi> without <hi>Sin,</hi> and indued his <note place="margin">The first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</note> 
                     <hi>Soul</hi> with the full <hi>knowledg</hi> of his <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and with such a strength, that he might, if he would, perform all that was required of him. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thus created him, He makes a <hi>COVENANT</hi> or agreement with him to this purpose, that if he <hi>continued</hi> in <hi>Obedience</hi> to <hi>God</hi> without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sin; then first, that <hi>Strength</hi> of <hi>Soul,</hi> which he then had should still be continued to him; and <hi>secondly,</hi> That he should never Die, but he taken up into <hi>Heaven,</hi> there to be Happy for ever. But on the other side, if he committed Sin and Disobeyed God, then both He and all his Children after him should lose that <hi>Knowledg</hi> and that <hi>perfect strength,</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:60285:7"/>
which enabled him to do all that God required of him: and <hi>Secondly,</hi> should be <hi>subject</hi> to <hi>death,</hi> and not only so, but to Eternal damnation in Hell.</p>
                  <p n="13">
                     <hi>13.</hi> This was the <hi>Agreement</hi> made with <hi>Adam</hi> and all <hi>mankind</hi> in him (which we usually call the <hi>FIRST COVENANT)</hi> upon which God gave <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> a particular <hi>commandment,</hi> which was no more but this, That he should not eat of <hi>one</hi> only <hi>tree</hi> of that <hi>garden</hi> wherein he had placed him. But he by the perswasion of the Devil eats of that Tree, disobeys God, and so brings that curse upon himself, and all his posterity. And so by that <hi>one</hi> Sin of his he lost both the full <hi>Knowledge</hi> of his Duty, and the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>performing</hi> it. And we being born af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his <hi>Image,</hi> did so likewise, and so are become both <hi>Ignorant</hi> in Discerning what we ought to Do, and <hi>Weak</hi> and unable to the Doing of it, having a backwardness to all <hi>good,</hi> and an aptness, and readiness to all evil; like a sick <hi>stomack,</hi> which loaths all wholsome food, and longs after such trash, as may nourish the disease.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <hi>14.</hi> And now you see where we got this <hi>Sickness</hi> of <hi>soul,</hi> and likewise that it is like to prove a Dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, and therefore I presume I need say no more, to assure you our Souls are in danger.

                  <p n="15">
                     <hi>15.</hi> That <hi>Fourth Motive</hi> is the <hi>like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood,</hi> that our <hi>CARE</hi> will not be <note place="margin">That our Care will not be in vain.</note> in <hi>VAIN,</hi> but that it will be a means

to preserve the thing cared for; where this is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it disheartens our care. A Physician leaves his <hi>Patient</hi> when he sees him past <hi>Hope,</hi> as knowing it is then in vain to give him any thing, but on the contrary when he sees hopes of recovery, he plies him with Medicines. Now in this very respect we have a great deal of reason to take care of our souls, for they are not so far gone, but they may be recovered, nay it is certain they will, if we do our parts towards it.</p>
                  <p n="16">
                     <hi>16.</hi> For though by that Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> all mankinde were under the sentence of eternal condemnation, yet it pleased God so far to pity our misery, as to give us his Son, and in him to make a new Covenant with us after we had broken the first.</p>
                  <p n="17">
                     <hi>17.</hi> This <hi>SECOND COVENANT</hi> was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and us in him, <note place="margin">The second Covenant.</note> presently after his Fall, and is briefly contained in those wards, <hi>Gen. 3. 15.</hi> Where <hi>God declares that THE SEED OF THE WOMAN SHALL BREAK THE SERPENTS HEAD;</hi> and this was made up, as the first was, of some mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to be afforded by God, and some duties to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by us.</p>
                  <p n="18">
                     <hi>18. God</hi> therein promises to send his only <hi>Son,</hi> who is <hi>God equal</hi> with himself, to earth, to become <hi>man like unto us in all things, sin only excepted,</hi> and he to do for us these Several things.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:60285:8"/>
we finde set down in the <hi>Gospel.</hi> And herein he is our <hi>PROPHET,</hi> it being the work of a Prophet of old not only to <hi>foretel,</hi> but to <hi>Teach.</hi> Our Duty in this particular is to hearken diligently to him, to be most ready, and desirous to learn that will of God which he came from heaven to reveal to us.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing He was to do for us, was to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie God</hi> for our <hi>Sins,</hi> not only that one of <hi>Adam,</hi> but all the Sins of all Mankind that truly repent and amend, and by this means to obtain for us For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins, the Favour of God, and so to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us from Hell and eternal damnation which was the punishment due to our sin. All this he did for us by his death. He offered up himself a Sacrifice for the <hi>Sins of all those</hi> who heartily bewail, and forsake them. And in this He is our <hi>PRIEST,</hi> it being the <hi>Priests</hi> Office to <hi>Offer Sacrifice for the sins of the people.</hi> Our Duty in this particular is first, truly, and heartily to Repent us of and forsake our Sins, without which they will never be forgiven us, though Christ have died. <hi>Secondly</hi> stedfastly to <hi>Believe,</hi> that if we do that, we shall have the benefits of that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of his, all our sins, how many and great soever, shall be forgiven us, and we saved from those eternal punishments which were due unto us for them. <hi>Another</hi> part of the <hi>PRIESTS Office</hi> was <hi>Blessing</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> for the people; and this also Christ performs to us: It was his especial Commission from his Father to Bless us, as <hi>St. Peter</hi> tells us <hi>Acts 3. 26. God sent his Son Jesus to Bless you;</hi> &amp; the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words shew wherein that blessing consists, in <hi>turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away every one of you from his iniquity,</hi> those means which he has used for the turning us from our
<pb facs="tcp:60285:9"/>
Sins, are to be reckoned of all other the greatest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, and for the other part, that of <hi>Praying,</hi> that he not only performed on earth, but continues still to do it in Heaven, <hi>He sits on the right hand of God and makes Request for us,</hi> Romans <hi>8. 34.</hi> Our Duty herein is not to resist this unspeakable blessing of his, but to be willing to be thus Blest in the being <hi>turned from our sins,</hi> and not to make void, and fruitless all his <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Intercessions</hi> for us, which will never prevail for us, whilest we continue in them.</p>
                  <p n="21">
                     <hi>21.</hi> The <hi>third</hi> thing, that <hi>Christ</hi> was to do for us, was to <hi>Enable</hi> us, or give us <hi>Strength</hi> to do what God requires of us. This he doth, first, by taking off from the hardness of the Law given to <hi>Adam,</hi> which was never to commit the least sin, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pain of damnation, and requiring of us only an <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>hearty endeavour</hi> to do what we are able, and where we fail, accepting of <hi>Sincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Secondly,</hi> By sending his <hi>Holy Spirit into our hearts,</hi> to govern, and Rule us, to give us strength to overcome Temptations to Sin, and to Do all that He now under the Gospel requires of us. And in this He is our <hi>KING,</hi> it being the Office of a <hi>King</hi> to govern, and Rule and to subdue ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Our Duty in this particular is to give up our selves obedient subjects of his, to be governed, and Ruled by him, to obey all his Laws, not to take part with any Rebel, that is, not to cherish any one sin, but diligently to Pray for his <hi>Grace</hi> to enable us to subdue all, and then carefully to make use of it to that purpose.</p>
                  <p n="22">
                     <hi>22. Lastly,</hi> He has purchased for all that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully <hi>obey</hi> him an <hi>Eternal glorious</hi> inheritance,
<pb facs="tcp:60285:9"/>
the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> whither he is gone before to take possession for us. Our duty herein is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding careful, that we forfeit not our parts in it, which we shall certainly do, if we continue <hi>impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> in any sin. <hi>Secondly,</hi> not to fasten our <hi>Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> on this world, but to raise them, according to the precept of the Apostle, <hi>Col. 3. 2. Set your affections on things above and not on things on the earth;</hi> continually longing to come to the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of that blessed inheritance of ours, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son whereof all things here below should seem vile and mean to us.</p>
                  <p n="23">
                     <hi>23.</hi> This is the Sum of that <hi>SECOND COVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NANT</hi> we are now under, wherein you see what <hi>Christ</hi> has done, how he Executes those <hi>Three Great Offices</hi> of <hi>KING, PRIEST</hi> and <hi>PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHET,</hi> as also what is Required of us, without our Faithful Performance, all that he hath done, shall never stand us in any stead; for he will never be a <hi>Priest</hi> to Save any, who take him not as well for their <hi>Prophet</hi> to <hi>Teach,</hi> and their <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Rule</hi> them; nay, if we neglect our part of this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> our condition will be yet worse, then if it had never bin made, for we shall then be to Answer not for the breach of <hi>Law</hi> only, as in the <hi>first,</hi> but for the abuse of <hi>mercy,</hi> which is of all sins the most provoking. On the other side, if we faithfully Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, that is, set our selves heartily to the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every precept of Christ, not going on wilfully in any one sin, but bewailing and forsaking whatever we have formerly been guilty of, it is then most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all the fore-mentioned benefits of Christ belongs to us.</p>

                     <hi>24.</hi> And now you see how little Reason you have to cast off the <hi>CARE</hi> of your <hi>SOULS</hi> upon a conceit they are past cure, for that it is plain they are not; Nay, certainly they are in that very condition, which of all others makes them fittest for our care. If they had not been thus <hi>REDEEMED</hi> by <hi>CHRIST,</hi> they had been then so hopeless, that care would have been in vain; on ther other side, if his Redemption had been such, that <hi>all</hi> men should be saved by it, though they Live as they list, We should have thought it needless to take care for them because they were safe without it. But it hath pleased <hi>God</hi> so to order it, that our care must be the <hi>means,</hi> by which they must Receive the good even of all that Christ hath done for them.</p>
                  <p n="25">
                     <hi>25.</hi> And now, if after all that God hath done to Save these <hi>Souls</hi> of ours, we will not bestow a little <hi>Care</hi> on them our selves, we very well deserve to perish. If a <hi>Physician</hi> should undertake a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that were in some desperate disease, and by his skill bring him so far out of it, that he were sure to recover, if he would but take care of himself and observe those <hi>rules</hi> the Physician set him, would you not think that man weary of his life, that <hi>would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to do that?</hi> So certainly that man is <hi>weary</hi> of his soul, wilfully casts it away, that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to those easie conditions, by which he may save it.</p>
                  <p n="26">
                     <hi>26.</hi> You see how great <hi>kindness</hi> God hath to these Souls of ours, the whole <hi>TRINITY, Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> have all done their parts for them. The <hi>FATHER</hi> gave his only Son, the <hi>SON</hi> gave Himself, left his glory, and endured
<pb facs="tcp:60285:10"/>
the bitter death of the <hi>Cross,</hi> meerly to keep our Souls from perishing. The <hi>HOLY GHOST</hi> is become as it were our attendant, waits upon us with Continual offers of his grace, to Enable us to do that which may preserve them; Nay he is so desirous we should accept those Offers of his, that he is said to be <hi>grieved</hi> when we refuse them, <hi>Ephes. 4. 30.</hi> Now what greater disgrace and affront can we put upon God then to despise what he thus values, that those Souls of ours, which Christ thought worthy every drop of his <hi>blood,</hi> we should not think worth any part of our <hi>Care?</hi> We use in things of the world, to rate them according to the opinion of those who are best skilled in them, now certainly <hi>God</hi> who made our <hi>Souls,</hi> best knowes the <hi>worth</hi> of them, and since he prizes them so high, let us (if it be but in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to him) be ashamed to neglect them. Espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now that they are in so hopeful a condition, that nothing but our own carelesness can possibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them.</p>
                  <p n="27">
                     <hi>27.</hi> I have now briefly gone over those <hi>Foure Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> of care I at first proposed, which are each of them such, as never misses to stir it up towards the things of this World; and I have also shewed you how much more Reasonable, nay Necessary it is they should do the like for the Soul. And now what can I say more, but conclude in the words of <hi>Isaiah 46. 8. Remember this and shew your selves men.</hi> That is, deal with your <hi>Soul</hi> as your <hi>Reason</hi> teaches you to do with all other things that concern you. And sure this common <hi>Justice</hi> bindes you to, for the Soul is that which furnishes you with that <hi>Reason,</hi> which you exercise in all your worldly
<pb facs="tcp:60285:11"/>
business; and shall the Soul it self receive no <hi>Benefit</hi> from that <hi>Reason,</hi> which it affords you? This is as if the <hi>Master</hi> of a <hi>Family,</hi> who provides food for his servants, should by them be kept from Eating any himself, and so remain the only starved creature in his house.</p>
                  <p n="28">
                     <hi>28.</hi> And as Justice ties you to this, so <hi>Mercy</hi> doth likewise; you know the poor Soul will fall into Endless and unspeakable Miseries, if you continue to neglect it, and then it will be too late to consider it. The Last Refuge you can hope for is <hi>Gods mercy,</hi> but that you have despised and abused.

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:60285:12"/>
what are the <hi>several</hi> things, that God now requires of us, our performance whereof will bring us to everlasting happiness, and the neglect to endless misery.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Of these things there are some which <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of the Light of</hi> NATURE.</note> God hath so stamp'd upon our souls, that we <hi>Naturally</hi> knew them; that is, we should have known them to be our Duty, though we had never been told so by the Scripture. That this is so, we may see by those <hi>Heathens,</hi> who having never heard of either <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New Testament,</hi> do yet acknowledge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves bound to some <hi>General</hi> Duties, as to <hi>Worship God,</hi> to be <hi>Just,</hi> to <hi>Honour</hi> their <hi>Parents,</hi> and the like. And as <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. <hi>Their consciences do in those things accuse or excuse them;</hi> That is, tell them, whether they have done what they should, in those particulars, or no.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Now though <hi>Christ</hi> have brought grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Light into the world, yet he never meant by it to put out any of that <hi>Natural</hi> light, which God hath set up in our <hi>Souls:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let me here by the way, advise you not to walk contrary even to this <hi>lesser</hi> light, I mean, not to venture on any of those Acts, which meer <hi>Natural Conscience</hi> will tell you are Sins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is just matter of sadness to any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian heart, to see some in these dayes, who profess much of <hi>Religion,</hi> and yet live in such sins, as a meer <hi>heathen</hi> would <hi>abhor;</hi> men that pretending to higher degrees of <hi>Light,</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:60285:12"/>
                     <hi>holiness,</hi> then their <hi>brethren</hi> do, yet <hi>practice</hi> contrary to all Rules of <hi>common honesty,</hi> and make it part of their Christian liberty so to do; of whose Seducement it concerns all that love their <hi>Souls</hi> to beware: and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose let this be laid as a Foundation, <hi>That that Religion or Opinion cannot be of God, which allows men in any wickedness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. But though we must not put out this <hi>light</hi> which God hath thus put into our Souls, yet this is not the onely way whereby God hath revealed his will, and therefore we are not to rest here, but proceed to the knowledg of those other things which God hath by other means revealed.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The way for us to come to know them <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The light of</hi> SCRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PTURES.</note> is by the SCRIPTURES, wherein are set down those several commands of God which he hath given to be the Rule of our <hi>Duty.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7.

8. All these should be severally spoke to, but because that would make the discourse very long, and so lesse fit for the <hi>meaner</hi> sort of men, for whose use alone it is intended, I chuse to proceed in another manner: By <hi>summing</hi> all these together, and so as plainly as I can, to lay down, what is now the duty of every <hi>Christian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. This I find briefly contain'd in the words <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The</hi> Three <hi>great bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of</hi> MANS DUTY.</note> of the Apostle, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>That we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent world;</hi> where the word <hi>Soberly</hi> contains our <hi>duty</hi> to our <hi>selves; Righteously,</hi> our duty to our <hi>neghbour,</hi> and <hi>Godly,</hi> our <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>God.</hi> These therfore shall be the Heads of my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, our DUTY to GOD, our SELVES, and our NEIGHBOUR. I begin with that to <hi>God,</hi> that being the best ground-work whereon to build <hi>both</hi> the other.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. There are many <hi>parts</hi> of our DUTY <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Duty to</hi> God</note> to GOD, The <hi>two</hi> chief are these: First to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be <hi>God;</hi> Secondly, to <hi>have no other;</hi> under these are contained all those particulars, which make up our <hi>whole duty</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> which shall be shewed in their order.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. To <hi>acknowledge</hi> him to be God, is to <note place="margin">Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him to be God.</note> believe him to be an <hi>infinite glorious Spirit,</hi> that was from <hi>everlasting,</hi> without beginning, and shall be to <hi>everlasting,</hi> without end. That he is our <hi>Creator, Redeemer, Sanctifier, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy-Ghost,</hi> one God, <hi>blessed for ever.</hi> That he is subject to no <hi>alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> but is <hi>Unchangeable;</hi> that he is no <hi>bodily</hi>

substance, such as our <hi>eyes</hi> may behold, but <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>invisible,</hi> whom <hi>no man hath seen, nor can see</hi> as the Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16. That He is Infinitely <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Excellent,</hi> beyond all that our <hi>wit</hi> or <hi>conceit</hi> can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that he hath <hi>received</hi> his being from none, and gives <hi>being</hi> to all things.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. All this we are to believe of him in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his <hi>Essence</hi> and being: But besides this, he is set forth to us in the <hi>Scripture</hi> by several <hi>Excellencies,</hi> as that he is of <hi>Infinite Goodness, and Mercy, Truth, Justice, Wisdom, Power, All-sufficiency, Majesty;</hi> That he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses and <hi>governes</hi> all things by his <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> that he <hi>Knowes</hi> all things and is <hi>Present</hi> in all places; these are by <hi>Divines</hi> called the <hi>Attributes</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and all these we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtingly <hi>acknowledg,</hi> that is, we must <hi>firmly believe</hi> all these <hi>Divine Excellencies</hi> to be in God, and that in the greatest <hi>degree,</hi> and so that they can never cease to be in him, he can never be other then <hi>insinitely Good, Merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, True,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. But the <hi>acknowledging</hi> him for our God signifies yet more then this; it means that we should perform to him all those seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of <hi>Duty</hi> which belong from a <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> to his <hi>God:</hi> What those are I am now to tell you.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The first is FAITH, or <hi>Belief,</hi> not only <note place="margin">FAITH.</note> that forementioned of his <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi> but of his <hi>word,</hi> the <hi>believing</hi> most firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that all that he saith is perfectly <hi>true.</hi> This
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60285:14"/>
cessarily arises from that <hi>Attribute,</hi> his <hi>Truth</hi> it being <hi>natural</hi> for us to <hi>believe</hi> whatsoever is said by one of whose <hi>Truth</hi> we are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Now the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> being the <hi>Word</hi> of God we are therefore to conclude, that all that is contained in them is most <hi>true.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. The things contained in them are of these <hi>four sorts:</hi> First, <hi>Affirmations,</hi> such are all <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of his</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmations.</note> the <hi>stories of the Bible,</hi> when it is said, Such and such things came so and so to pass; <hi>Christ</hi> was born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> was laid in a Manger, &amp;c. And such also are many points of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> as that there are <hi>three Persons</hi> in the <hi>God-head,</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and the like. All things of this sort thus delivered in <hi>Scripture</hi> we are to believe most <hi>true.</hi> And not only so, but because they are all <hi>written</hi> for our instruction; we are to consider them for that purpose, that is, by them to lay that <hi>Foundation</hi> of <hi>Christian knowledge</hi> on which we may build a <hi>Christian life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="16">16. The <hi>Second</hi> sort of things contain'd in <note place="margin">Commands</note> the <hi>Scripture,</hi> are the <hi>Commands,</hi> that is, the several things <hi>enjoyned</hi> us by God to perform; these we are to believe to come from him, and to be most just, and fit for him to <hi>command:</hi> But then this <hi>Belief</hi> must bring forth <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> that what we <hi>believe</hi> thus fit to be done, be indeed done by us; otherwise our <hi>belief</hi> that they come from him serves but to make us more <hi>inexcusable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="17">17. Thirdly, The <hi>Scripture</hi> contains threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; <note place="margin">Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings.</note> many <hi>Texts</hi> there are which <hi>threaten</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:60285:14"/>
to them that go on in their sins, the <hi>wrath</hi> of God, and under that are contained all the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments</hi> and <hi>miseries</hi> of this <hi>life,</hi> both <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi> and <hi>temporal,</hi> and <hi>everlasting</hi> destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the <hi>life</hi> to come. Now we are most stedfastly to <hi>Believe,</hi> That these are Gods <hi>threats,</hi> and that they will certainly be performed to every impenitent sinner. But then the use we are to make of this belief, is to keep from those <hi>sins</hi> to which this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction is threatned, otherwise our belief addes to our guilt, that will wilfully go on in spight of those <hi>threatnings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> contains <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Promises.</note> and those both to our <hi>Bodies</hi> and our <hi>Souls;</hi> for our <hi>bodies</hi> there are many <hi>promises</hi> that God will provide for them what he sees necessary; I will name only one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 33. <hi>Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, and all these things,</hi> that is, all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward necessaries, <hi>shall be added unto you:</hi> But here 'tis to be observed, that we must <hi>first seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness,</hi> that is, make it our first and greatest care to <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>obey</hi> him before this <hi>promise</hi> even of <hi>temporal</hi> good things <hi>belongs</hi> to us. To the <hi>soul</hi> there are many and <hi>high promises,</hi> as <hi>first,</hi> that of <hi>present ease</hi> and <hi>refreshment</hi> which we find, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 29. <hi>Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, and ye shall finde rest to your souls:</hi> But here it is apparent, that before this <hi>rest</hi> belongs to us, we must have <hi>taken on us Christs yoke,</hi> become his <hi>servants</hi> and <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60285:15"/>
Finally</hi> there are <hi>promises</hi> to the <hi>soul</hi> even of all the benefits of <hi>Christ;</hi> but yet those only to such as perform the <hi>Condition</hi> required; that is, <hi>Pardon</hi> of <hi>Sins</hi> to those that <hi>repent</hi> of them, <hi>Increase</hi> of <hi>Grace</hi> to those that diligently make use of what they have already, and humbly pray for more; and <hi>Eternal salvation</hi> to those that <hi>continue</hi> to their lives end in hearty obedience to his Commands.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. This <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Promises</hi> must therefore stir us up to perform the <hi>Condition,</hi> and till it do so, we can in no reason expect any good by them; and for us to look for the benefit of them on other terms, is the same mad presumption that it would be in a Servant to challenge his Master to give him a <hi>reward</hi> for having done nothing of his work, to which alone the <hi>reward</hi> was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised; you can easily resolve what <hi>answer</hi> were to be given to such a <hi>servant,</hi> and the same are we to expect from God in this case: nay further, it is sure God hath given these <hi>Promises</hi> to no other <hi>end,</hi> but to <hi>invite</hi> us to <hi>holiness</hi> of life; yea, he gave his Son, in whom all his <hi>Promises</hi> are as it were <hi>sum'd</hi> up, for this end. We usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally look so much at <hi>Christs</hi> comming to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for us, that we forget this other part of his errand. But there is nothing surer, then that the main <hi>purpose</hi> of his coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world was to plant good life among men.</p>
                  <p n="20">
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:60285:15"/>
20. This is so often repeated in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that no man that considers and <hi>believes</hi> what he reads can doubt of it. <hi>Christ</hi> himself tells us, Mat. 9. 13. <hi>He came to call sinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 3. 26. tells us, <hi>That God sent his Son Jesus to bless us, in turning every one of us from his iniquities;</hi> for it seems the <hi>turning us from our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> was the greatest special <hi>Blessing</hi> which God intended us in <hi>Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. Nay, we are taught by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that this was the end of his very <hi>death</hi> also, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Who gave himself for our sins, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</hi> And again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 4. <hi>Who gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for us, that he might deliver us from this present evil world,</hi> that is, from the <hi>sins</hi> and ill <hi>customes of the world.</hi> Divers other <hi>Texts</hi> there are to this purpose, But these I suppose sufficient to assure any man of this one great truth, That all that <hi>Christ</hi> hath done for us was directed to this end, the bringing us to <hi>live Christianly;</hi> or in the words of Saint <hi>Paul, To teach us, that denying ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and worldly lusts, wee should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="22">22. Now we know <hi>Christ</hi> is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all the Promises; <hi>in him all the promises of God are yea, and Amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 20. And therefore if God gave <hi>Christ</hi> to this end, certainly the <hi>Promises</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:60285:16"/>
are to the <hi>same</hi> also. And then how great an abuse of them is it to make them serve for purposes quite contrary to what they were intended, <hi>viz.</hi> To the <hi>encouraging</hi> us in sins, which they will certainly do if we perswade our selves they belong to us how <hi>wickedly</hi> soever we live. The Apostle teaches us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use of them, 2 Cor. 7. 1. <hi>Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these promises, let us cleanse our selves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting holiness in the fear of God.</hi> When we do thus we may justly apply the <hi>promises</hi> to our selves, and with comfort expect our <hi>parts</hi> in them. But till then though these <hi>promises</hi> be of certain <hi>truth,</hi> yet we can reap no <hi>bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> from them, because we are not the persons to whom they are made, that is, we perform not the <hi>condition</hi> required to give us <hi>right</hi> to them.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. This is the <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Belief</hi> required of us towards the things God hath revealed to us in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> to wit, Such as may answer the <hi>End</hi> for which they were so <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,</hi> that is, the bringing us to <hi>good lives;</hi> the bare <hi>believing</hi> the <hi>truth</hi> of them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, is no more then the <hi>Devils</hi> do, as <hi>S. James</hi> tells us, Chap. 2. 19. Only they are not so unreasonable as some of us are, for they will tremble, as knowing well this <hi>Faith</hi> will never do them any good. But many of us go on <hi>confidently,</hi> and doubt not the <hi>sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of our <hi>Faith,</hi> though we have not the least <hi>fruit of obedience</hi> to approve it by; let such
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60285:16"/>
hear S. <hi>James</hi>'s judgment in the point, Ch. 2. 26. As <hi>the body without the spirit is dead, so Faith if it have not works is dead also.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. A <hi>second Duty</hi> to God is HOPE, that <note place="margin">HOPE.</note> is, a <hi>comfortable</hi> expectation of these <hi>good</hi> things he hath promised. But this, as I told you before of <hi>Faith,</hi> must be such as agrees to the nature of the <hi>promises,</hi> which being such as <hi>requires</hi> a <hi>condition</hi> on our part, we can <hi>hope</hi> no further then we make that good; or if we do, we are so far from performing by it this <hi>duty of Hope,</hi> that we commit the great sin of <hi>Presumption,</hi> which is nothing else but <hi>hoping</hi> where God hath given us no <hi>ground</hi> to <hi>hope:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> this every man doth that hopes for pardon of sins and eternal life, without that <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to which alone they are <hi>promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;</hi> the true <hi>hope</hi> is that which <hi>purifies</hi> us: S. <hi>John</hi> saith, 1 Epist. 3. 5. <hi>Every man that hath this hope purifieth himself, even as he is pure;</hi> that is, it makes him leave his sins and earnestly endeavour to be holy as <hi>Christ</hi> is, and that which doth not so, how confident soever it be, may well be concluded to be but that <hi>hope</hi> of the <hi>Hypocrite</hi> which <hi>Job</hi> assures us shall <hi>perish.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">Despair.</note> this <hi>Duty,</hi> besides that of <hi>Presumption,</hi> and that is by <hi>Desperation,</hi> by which I mean not that which is ordinarily so called, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Despairing</hi> of <hi>mercy,</hi> so long as we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in our sins, for that is but <hi>just</hi> for us to do: But I mean such a <hi>desperation</hi> as makes us give
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60285:17"/>
over endeavour, that is, when a man that sees he is not at the present such a one, as the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises</hi> belong to, concludes, he can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come such, and therefore neglects all duty, and goes on in his sins. This is indeed the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>desparation,</hi> and that which if it be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in, must end in destruction.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Now the work of hope is to prevent this, by setting before us the <hi>generality</hi> of the <hi>promises,</hi> that they belong to all that will but perform the <hi>condition.</hi> And therefore though a man have not hitherto performed it, and so hath yet no right to them, yet <hi>hope</hi> will tell him, that that right may yet be gained, if he will now set heartily about it. It is therefore strange folly for any man, be he never so sinful, to give up himself for lost, when if he will but change his course, he shall be as certain to partake of the <hi>promises</hi> of mercy as if he had never gone on in those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sins.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. This <hi>Christ</hi> shews us in the parable of the <hi>Prodigal, Luke</hi> 15. where wee see that Son, which had run away from his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and had consumed the <hi>portion</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, in <hi>riotous living,</hi> was yet upon his <hi>return</hi> and <hi>repentance</hi> used with as much kindness by the <hi>Father,</hi> as he that had never offended, nay with higher and more passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate expressions of love. The intent of which Parable was only to shew us how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously our <hi>heavenly Father</hi> will receive us, how great soever our former sins have bin, if
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60285:17"/>
we shall return to him with true sorrow for what is past, and sincere obedience for the time to come; nay so acceptable a thing is it to God, to have any sinner return from the error of his ways, that there is a kinde of <hi>triumph</hi> in <hi>heaven</hi> for it, <hi>there is joy in the presence of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of God, over one sinner that repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: Luke</hi> 15. 10. And now who would not rather chuse by a <hi>timely repentance,</hi> to bring <hi>joy</hi> to <hi>heaven,</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> then by a sullen <hi>desperation</hi> to please <hi>Satan</hi> and his <hi>accursed spirits;</hi> especially when by the former we shall gain endlesse happiness to our selves, and by the latter as endless torments.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60285:18"/>
then some little brook; and certainly it is no less <hi>folly</hi> to suppose that the <hi>goodness</hi> of God doth not as much (nay <hi>infinitely</hi> more) <hi>exceed</hi> that of all <hi>creatures.</hi> Besides the <hi>goodness</hi> of the <hi>creature</hi> is <hi>imperfect</hi> and mixt with much evil; but his is <hi>pure</hi> and entire, without any such <hi>mixture.</hi> He is perfectly <hi>Holy,</hi> and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be rainted with the least <hi>impurity,</hi> neither can he be the <hi>Author</hi> of any to us, for though he be the cause of all the goodness in us, he is the cause of none of our <hi>sins.</hi> This <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p n="30">30. But <hi>secondly,</hi> God is not only thus good <note place="margin">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60285:18"/>
for why will ye die?</hi> To the same purpose you may read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. Consider this, I say, and then surely you cannot but say, He hath great <hi>kindness</hi> to our <hi>souls.</hi> Nay, let every man but remember with himself the many calls he hath had to <hi>repentance</hi> and <hi>amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> sometimes <hi>outward,</hi> by the <hi>Word,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>inward,</hi> by the secret whispers of Gods <hi>Spirit</hi> in his heart, which were only to woe and intreat him to avoid <hi>Eternal misery,</hi> and to accept of <hi>Eternal happiness;</hi> let him, I say, remember these, together with those many other means God hath used towards him for the same end, and he will have reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess Gods <hi>kindness,</hi> not only to <hi>mens souls</hi> in <hi>general,</hi> but to his own in <hi>particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. Neither hath he been wanting to our <hi>Bodies,</hi> all the <hi>good things</hi> they enjoy, as <hi>health, strength, food, raiment,</hi> and what ever else concernes them, are meerly his <hi>gifts;</hi> so that indeed it is impossible we should be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his <hi>mercies</hi> to them, all those <hi>outward</hi> comforts and <hi>refreshments</hi> we daily enjoy, being continual <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>witnesses</hi> of it, and though some enjoy more of these then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet there is no person but enjoyes so much in one kinde or other, as abundantly shews Gods <hi>mercy</hi> and kindness to him in respect of his <hi>Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="32">32. And now surely you will think it but reasonable we should <hi>Love</hi> him, who is in all respects thus <hi>Lovely:</hi> Indeed this is a <hi>duty</hi> so generally acknowledged, that if you should
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60285:19"/>
ask any man the question, whether he loved God or no, he would think you did him great wrong to doubt of it; yet for all this, it is too plain, that there are vey few, that do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>love</hi> him, and this will soon be proved to you by examining a little, what are the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon effects</hi> of <hi>love,</hi> which we bear to men like our selves, and then trying, whether we can shew any such <hi>fruits</hi> of our love to <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="33">33. Of that sort there are <hi>divers,</hi> but for <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Fruit of</hi> Love. <hi>Desire of pleasing.</hi>
                     </note> shortness I will name but two. The <hi>first</hi> is a <hi>Desire of pleasing,</hi> the <hi>second</hi> a <hi>Desire of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> These are constantly the <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Love.</hi> For the <hi>first,</hi> 'tis known by all, that he that loves any person, is very desirous to approve himself to him, to do whatsoever he thinks will be pleasing to him; and according to the degree of <hi>love,</hi> so is this desire more or less, where we love <hi>earnestly,</hi> we are very earnest, and careful to <hi>please.</hi> Now if we have indeed that <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> we pretend to, it will bring forth this fruit, we shall be careful to please him in all things. Therefore as you judge of the <hi>tree by its fruits,</hi> so may you judg of your <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> by this <hi>fruit</hi> of it; nay indeed this is the way of tryal, which <hi>Christ</hi> himself hath given us, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 15. <hi>If ye love me keep my commandements;</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> tell us, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>That this is the love of God, that we walk after his commandements,</hi> and where this one proof is wanting, it will be impossible to testifie our loue to God.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. But it must yet be farther considered,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:60285:19"/>
that this <hi>love</hi> of <hi>God</hi> must not be in a low or weak degree, for besides that the <hi>Motives</hi> to it, his <hi>excellency</hi> and his <hi>kindness</hi> are in the <hi>highest;</hi> the same <hi>Commandment</hi> which bids us <hi>love God,</hi> bids us <hi>love him with all our heart, and with all our strength,</hi> that is, as much as is <hi>possible</hi> for us, and <hi>above</hi> any thing else. And therefore to the fulfilling of this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> it is necessary we <hi>love</hi> him in that <hi>degree;</hi> and if we do so, then certainly we shall have not onely some slight and faint endeavours of <hi>pleasing,</hi> but such as are most <hi>diligent</hi> and <hi>earnest,</hi> such as will put us upon the most painful and costly duties, make us willing to forsake our own <hi>ease, goods, friends,</hi> yea, <hi>life</hi> it self, when we cannot keep them without <hi>disobeying</hi> God.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. Now examine thy self by this; hast thou this fruit of love to shew? doest thou make it thy constant and greatest care to keep Gods Commandments? to obey him in all things? earnestly labouring to <hi>please</hi> him to the utmost of thy power, even to the forsake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what is dearest to thee in this world? if thou dost, thou maist then truly say thou lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est God. But on the contrary, if thou wilfully continuest in the breach of many, nay, but of any one command of his, never deceive thy self, for the love of God abides not in thee. This will be made plain to you, if you consider what the <hi>Scripture</hi> saith of such, as that they are <hi>enemies to God by their wicked works,</hi> Col. 1. 21. That the <hi>carnal</hi> minde (and such is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60285:20"/>
one that continues <hi>wilfully in sin)</hi> is <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity with 'God,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. That he that <hi>sins wilfuly tramples under foot the Son of God, and doth despight unto the Spirit of Grace,</hi> Heb. 10. 29. and many the like. And therefore unless you can think <hi>enmity,</hi> and <hi>trampling,</hi> and <hi>despight</hi> to be <hi>fruits of love,</hi> you must not believe you <hi>love</hi> God, whilest you go on in any wilful disobedience to him.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. A <hi>Second fruit</hi> of <hi>Love,</hi> I told you, was <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>Enjoying.</hi> This is constantly to be seen in our <hi>love</hi> to one another. If you <note place="margin">Desire of Enjoying.</note> have a friend whom you intirely <hi>love,</hi> you desire his <hi>conversation,</hi> wish to be alwayes in his <hi>company:</hi> and thus will it also be in our <hi>love</hi> to God if that be as great and hearty as this.</p>
                  <p n="37">37. There is a <hi>two fold Enjoying of God,</hi> the one <hi>Imperfect</hi> in this life, the other more <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> and compleat in the life to come; that in this life is that <hi>conversation,</hi> as I may call it, which we have with God in his <hi>Ordinances,</hi> in <hi>Praying,</hi> and <hi>Meditating,</hi> in <hi>Hearing</hi> his <hi>Word,</hi> in <hi>Receiving</hi> the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which are all intended for this purpose, to bring us into an intimacy and familiarity with God by <hi>speaking</hi> to him, and <hi>hearing</hi> him <hi>speak</hi> to us.</p>
                  <p n="38">38. Now if we do indeed love God, we shall certainly hugely value and desire these wayes of <hi>conversing</hi> with him, it being all that we can have in this life; it will make us with <hi>David</hi> esteem <hi>one day in Gods Courts better then a thousand,</hi> Psal. 84. 10. We shall be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60285:20"/>
glad to have these <hi>opportunities</hi> of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him as often as it is possible, &amp; be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to use them <hi>diligently,</hi> to that end of <hi>uniting</hi> us still more to him; yea we shall come to these <hi>Spiritual</hi> exercises with the same <hi>chearfulness</hi> we would go to our <hi>dearest friend.</hi> And if indeed we do thus it is a good proof of our <hi>Love.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="39">39. But I fear there are not many have this to shew for it, as appears by the common <hi>backwardness</hi> and unwillingness of men to come to these; and their <hi>negligence,</hi> and heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesness when they are at them; and can we think that God will ever own us for <hi>lovers</hi> of him, whilest we have such <hi>dislikes</hi> to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that we will never come into it but when we are <hi>drag'd</hi> by <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>shame</hi> of men or some such worldly Motive? It is sure you would not think that man <hi>loved</hi> you, whom you perceived to shun your <hi>company,</hi> and to be loath to come in your <hi>sight.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be not so unreasonable as to say, <hi>You love God,</hi> when yet you desire to keep as far from him as you can.</p>
                  <p n="40">40. But besides this, there is another <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi> of God, which is more perfect and <hi>compleat,</hi> and that is our <hi>perpetual</hi> enjoying of him in heaven, where we shal be for ever <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to him, and enjoy him not now and then only for <hi>short</hi> spaces of time, as we do here, but <hi>continually</hi> without <hi>interruption,</hi> or breaking off. And certainly if we have that <hi>degree</hi> of <hi>love to God</hi> we ought, this cannot but be most
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:60285:21"/>
earnestly desired by us so much, that we shall think no <hi>labour</hi> too great to compass it. The <hi>seven years</hi> that <hi>Jacob</hi> served for <hi>Rachel. Gen.</hi> 29. 20. <hi>seemed to him but a few dayes for the love that he had to her:</hi> &amp; surely if we have <hi>love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> we shall not think the service of our whole <hi>lives</hi> too <hi>dear a price</hi> for this full <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment</hi> of him, nor esteem all the <hi>Enjoyments</hi> of the world worth the looking on in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison thereof.</p>
                  <p n="41">41. If we can truly tell our selves we do thus long for this enjoyment of God, we may believe we <hi>love</hi> him. But I fear again there are but few that can thus approve their <hi>love.</hi> For if we look into mens <hi>lives,</hi> we shall see they are not generally so <hi>fond</hi> of this <hi>Enjoyment,</hi> as to be at any pains to purchase it. And not only so, but it is to be doubted, there are many who if it were put to their <hi>choice,</hi> whether they would live <hi>here</hi> alwayes to enjoy the <hi>profit</hi> and pleasure of the <hi>world,</hi> or go to <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> to <hi>enjoy</hi> God, would, like the children of <hi>Gad</hi> and <hi>Reuben,</hi> set up their rest on this side <hi>Jordan, Num.</hi> 32. and never desire that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Canaan;</hi> so close do their affections cleave to things <hi>below,</hi> which shews clearly they have not made God their <hi>treasure,</hi> for then according to our <hi>Saviours</hi> Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 21. their heart would be with him. Nay, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther yet; it is too plain that many of us set so little <hi>value</hi> on this <hi>Enjoying</hi> of God, that we <hi>preser</hi> the <hi>vilest</hi> and <hi>basest</hi> sins before him, and chuse to <hi>Enjoy</hi> them, though by it we utterly lose our parts in Him, which is the case of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:60285:21"/>
man that continues wilfully in those sins.</p>
                  <p n="42">42. And now I fear, according to these Rules of <hi>Trial,</hi> many that <hi>prefess</hi> to <hi>love God,</hi> will be found not to do so. I conclude al with the words of S. <hi>John</hi> 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 3. 18. Which though spoken of the love of our <hi>brethren,</hi> is very fitly appliable to this love of God, let <hi>us not love in word, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="43">43. A <hi>Fourth duty</hi> to God is FEAR; this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises <note place="margin">FEAR.</note> from the <hi>consideration</hi> both of his <hi>Justice</hi> &amp; his <hi>Power;</hi> his <hi>Justice</hi> is such that he will not <hi>clear the wicked,</hi> &amp; his <hi>Power</hi> such, that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inflict the sorest punishments upon them; and that this is a reasonable cause of <hi>fear, Christ</hi> himself tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 18. <hi>Fear him which is able to destroy both body and soul in hell.</hi> Many other places of <hi>Scripture</hi> there are, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to us this duty, as <hi>Ps.</hi> 2. 11. <hi>Serve the Lord with fear: Psal.</hi> 34. 9. <hi>Fear the Lord ye that be his Saints. Pro.</hi> 9. 10. <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,</hi> and divers the like; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the threatnings of wrath against sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which we meet with in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> are only to this end, to work this <hi>fear</hi> in our hearts.</p>
                  <p n="44">44. Now this fear is nothing else, but such an awful regard of God, as may keep us from of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending him. This the wise man tells us, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16. 17. <hi>The fear of the Lord is to depart from evil:</hi> so that none can be said truly to <hi>fear</hi> God, that is not thereby withheld from <hi>sin;</hi> &amp; this is but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to that common fear we have towards man; who ever we know may hurt us, we wilbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of <hi>provoking,</hi> &amp; therefore if we be not as
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60285:22"/>
wary of <hi>displeasing</hi> God, it is plain we <hi>fear</hi> men more then we do him.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. How great a madness this is, thus to <note place="margin">
                        <hi>The folly of fearing</hi> Men <hi>more then</hi> God.</note> 
                     <hi>fear men</hi> above <hi>God,</hi> will soon appear if we compare what man can do to us with that which God can. And <hi>first,</hi> it is sure, it is not in the power of man (I might say <hi>Devils</hi> too) to do us any <hi>hurt</hi> unless God <hi>permit</hi> and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to do it: so that if we do but keep him our friend, we may say with the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist, <hi>The Lord is on my side, I fear not what man can do unto me.</hi> For let their malice be never so great, he can restrain and keep them from hurting us, nay, he can change their mindes toward us, according to that of the wise man, Prov. 16. 7. <hi>When a mans wayes please the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him.</hi> A notable example of this we have in <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32. who when his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Esau</hi> was coming against him as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, God wonderfully turned his heart, so that he met him with all the <hi>expressions</hi> of <hi>bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly kindness,</hi> as you may read in the next Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. But <hi>secondly,</hi> suppose men were left at liberty to do thee what mischief they could; alas, their power goes but a little way, they may perhaps rob thee of thy <hi>goods,</hi> it may be they may take away thy <hi>liberty</hi> or thy <hi>credit,</hi> or perchance thy <hi>life</hi> too, but that thou knowest is the utmost they can do. But now God can do all this when he pleases, and that which is <hi>infinitely</hi> more, his vengeance reaches
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60285:22"/>
even beyond death it self, to the eternal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery both of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> in <hi>hell;</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of which, death is so inconsiderable, that we are not to look upon it with any dread. <hi>Fear not them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do,</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 4. And then immediately adds, <hi>But I will forewarn you whom ye shall fear, fear him which after he hath killed hath power to cast into hell, yea, I say unto you, Fear him.</hi> In which words the comparison is set between that <hi>greatest</hi> ill we can suffer from man, the loss of <hi>life,</hi> and those sadder <hi>evils</hi> God can inflict on us; and the <hi>latter</hi> are found to be the onely <hi>dreadful</hi> things, and therefore God only to be <hi>feared.</hi>

But there is yet one thing farther con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable in this matter, which is this, It is possible we may transgress against men and they not know it: I may perhaps <hi>steal</hi> my <hi>neighbours goods,</hi> or defile his <hi>wife,</hi> and keep it so close that he shall not suspect me, and so never bring me to punishment for it; but this we cannot do with God, he knows all things, even the most secret thoughts of our hearts; and therefore though we commit a sin never so closely, he is sure to finde us, and will as sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if we do not timely repent, punish us eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally for it.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. And now surely it cannot but be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest,</hi> that it is much safer <hi>displeasing</hi> men, then God; yet alas our <hi>practice</hi> is as if we <hi>believed</hi> the <hi>direct</hi> contrary, there being nothing more ordinary with us then for the <hi>avoiding</hi> of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:60285:23"/>
some present danger we fear from men, to rush our selves upon the <hi>indignation</hi> of God. And thus it is with us, when either to save our <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,</hi> or <hi>credits,</hi> or our very <hi>lives,</hi> we commit any <hi>sin,</hi> for that is plainly the chusing to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God, rather then man.</p>
                  <p n="49">49. But God knowes this case of <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>men</hi> is not the only one wherein we venture to displease him, for we commit many sins, to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> we have none of this temptation, nor indeed any other, as for instance that of <hi>Common Swearing,</hi> to which there is nothing either of pleasure, or profit to invite us. Nay, many times, we, who so <hi>fear</hi> the mischiefs that other men may do to us that we are ready to buy them off with the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test sins, do our selves bring all those very mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs upon us, by sins of our own chusing. Thus the careless <hi>Prodigal robs</hi> himself of his <hi>estate,</hi> the <hi>Deceitful &amp; Dishoneft</hi> man, or any that lives in open <hi>notorious sin, deprives</hi> himself of his <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit,</hi> and the <hi>Drunkard &amp; Glutton</hi> brings <hi>diseases</hi> on himself, to the <hi>shortning</hi> his life. And can we think we do at all <hi>Fear God,</hi> when that fear hath so little power over us, that though it be backt with the many present <hi>mischiefs</hi> that attend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>sin,</hi> it is not able to keep us from them? sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly such men are far from fearing God, that they rather seem to defie him, resolve to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him, whatsoever it cost them, either in this world or the next. Yet so unreasonably partial are we to our selvs, that even such as these will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this fear: you may examine multitudes of the most gross scandalous sinners, before you
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:60285:23"/>
shall meet with one that will acknowledge he fears not God. It is strange it should be possible for men thus to cheat themselves; but however, it is certain we cannot deceive God, he will not be <hi>mockt,</hi> and therefore if we will not now so <hi>fear</hi> as to <hi>avoid sin,</hi> we shall one day <hi>fear</hi> when it will be too late to <hi>avoid punishment.</hi>

by him, that if we fail of performing it, when we are put to the <hi>tryal,</hi> we are not to be accounted followers of <hi>Christ,</hi> for so himself hath expresly told us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 24. <hi>If any man come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Cross and follow me;</hi> and so again, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 34.

                  <p n="55">55. We are therefore to look up to him for the provision of all things necessary for us, according to that of the <hi>Psalmist, The eyes of all wait upon thee, O Lord, and thou givest them meat in due season.</hi> And our Saviour hath taught us to <hi>pray</hi> for our <hi>daily bread;</hi> thereby teaching us that we are to live in <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dependance</hi> upon God for it. Yet I mean not by this, that we should so expect it from
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:60285:26"/>
God, as to give up our selves to <hi>idleness</hi> and expect to be fed by <hi>Miracles.</hi> No, our honest <hi>industry</hi> and labour is the meanes by which God <hi>ordinarily</hi> gives us the <hi>necessaries</hi> of this life; and therefore we must by no means <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect</hi> that. He <hi>that will not labour, let him not eat,</hi> sayes the Apostle, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 3. 10. And we may believe God will pronounce the same <hi>sentence,</hi> and suffer the <hi>slothful</hi> person to <hi>want</hi> even necessary food. But when we have faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully used our own <hi>endeavour,</hi> then we must also look up to God for his blessing on it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it can never <hi>prosper</hi> to us. And ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done thus, we may comfortably <hi>rest</hi> our selves on his <hi>Providence</hi> for such a measure of these <hi>outward</hi> things as he fees fittest for us.</p>
                  <p n="56">56. But if our <hi>condition</hi> be such that we are not able to <hi>labour,</hi> and have no other means of bringing in the <hi>necessaries</hi> of life to our selves, yet even then we are <hi>chearfully</hi> to rest upon God, believing that he who <hi>feeds</hi> the <hi>Ravens,</hi> will by some means or other, though we know not what, <hi>provide</hi> for us so long as he pleases we shall continue in this world, and never in any case <hi>torment</hi> our selves with <hi>cark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>distrustful</hi> thoughts; but as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Cast all our care on him who careth for us.</hi>

it down at large, Verse 25. <hi>Therefore, I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; neither for your body, what you shall put on; is not the life more then meat, and the body then rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns, yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better then they? Which of you by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thought can adde one cubit to his stature? And why take ye thought for raiment? consider the Lilies of the field how they grow, they toil not, neither do they spin, and yet I say unto you, that even Solomon in all his glory was not arayed like one of these. Wherefore if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is cast into the Oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye of little faith? Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or what shall we drink? or wherewithal shall we be clothed? (for after all these things do the Gentiles seek) for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. But seek ye first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and then all these things shall be added unto you. Take therefore no thought for to morrow, for the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row shall take thought for the things of it self, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</hi> I might adde many other texts to this purpose, but this is so <hi>full</hi> and <hi>convincing</hi> that I suppose it needless.</p>
                  <p n="58">58. All therefore that I shall say more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">The benefit of trusting on God.</note> this <hi>duty,</hi> is to put you in minde of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60285:27"/>
great <hi>benefits</hi> of it; as <hi>first,</hi> that by his <hi>trusting</hi> upon God, you <hi>engage</hi> and <hi>binde</hi> him to <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide</hi> for you. <hi>Men,</hi> you know, think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves highly <hi>concern'd</hi> not to <hi>fail</hi> those that depend and <hi>trust</hi> upon them; and certainly God doth so much more. But then <hi>secondly,</hi> there is a great deal of <hi>ease</hi> and quiet in the <hi>practice</hi> of this <hi>duty;</hi> it delivers us from all those <hi>carkings</hi> and <hi>immoderate</hi> cares which <hi>disquiet</hi> our <hi>minds,</hi> break our <hi>sleep,</hi> and <hi>gnaws</hi> even our very <hi>heart.</hi> I doubt not but those that have felt them, need not be told they are <hi>uneasie.</hi> But then me thinks that <hi>uneasiness</hi> should make us forward to embrace the means for the <hi>removing</hi> of them, and so we see it too often doth in <hi>unlawful</hi> ones; men will <hi>cheat,</hi> and <hi>steal,</hi> and <hi>lie,</hi> and do any thing to deliver themselves from the <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>want.</hi> But alas, they commonly prove but <hi>deceitful</hi> remedies; they bring Gods curse on us, and so are more likely to <hi>betray</hi> us to <hi>want,</hi> then to keep us from it. But if you desire a certain and <hi>unfailing</hi> cure for <hi>cares,</hi> take this of <hi>rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> upon God.</p>
                  <p n="59">59. For what should cause that man to fear <hi>want</hi> that knowes he hath one that cares for him, who is <hi>All-sufficient,</hi> and will not suffer him to want what is fit for him. If a <hi>poor</hi> man had but a <hi>faithful promise</hi> from a <hi>wealthy</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that he would never suffer him to <hi>want,</hi> it is sure he would be highly cheered with it, and would not then think fit to be as carking as he was before, and yet a mans promise may
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60285:27"/>
fail us, he may either grow <hi>poor</hi> and not be <hi>able,</hi> or he may prove <hi>false</hi> and not be <hi>willing</hi> to make good his word. But we know God is subject neither to impoverishing nor deceit. And therefore how vile an injury do we offer to him if we dare not trust as much upon his <hi>promise</hi> as we would that of a <hi>man?</hi> yea, and how great a mischief do we do our selves by loading our mindes with a multitude of vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and tormenting cares, when we may so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely <hi>cast our burden upon God?</hi> I conclude this in the words of the Apostle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests be made known unto God.</hi>

Who after he had heard the sad threatnings of <hi>God</hi> against him, of the <hi>destruction</hi> of his <hi>family,</hi> the loss of the <hi>Priesthood,</hi> the cutting off <hi>both his sons in one day,</hi> which were all of them afflictions of the heaviest kinde, yet this one considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it <hi>was the Lord,</hi> inabled him calmly and quietly to yield to them; saying, <hi>Let him do what seemeth him good, Verse</hi> 18. The same effect it had on <hi>David,</hi> in his <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Psalm</hi> 39. 9. <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth because thou didst it: God doing</hi> it <hi>silenced</hi> all <hi>murmurings</hi> and <hi>grumblings</hi> in him.

face.</hi> But thus do we when ever we grudg and repine at that which God layes upon us. But besides the want of Humility in our so doing, there is also a great want of <hi>justice</hi> in it; for God hath, as we are his creatures, a Right to do with us what he will, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for us to resist that <hi>right</hi> of his, is the <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est injustice</hi> that can be; nay farther, it is also the greatest <hi>folly</hi> in the world, for it is only our good that God aims at in afdicting us; that heavenly Father is not like our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones, who sometime correct their children only to satisfie their own angry humour, not to do them good. But this is subject to no such frailties, <hi>he doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of man,</hi> Lam. 3. 33. They are our sins, which do not only give him just cause, but even force and necessitate him to punish us He carries to us the bowels and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the tenderest Father: now when a Father sees his childe <hi>stubborn</hi> and <hi>rebellious,</hi> and running on in a course that will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undo him, what greater act of Fatherly kindness can he do then chasten and correct him, to see if by that means he may amend him; nay indeed he could not be said to have true kindness to him if he should not. And thus it is with God when he sees us run on in <hi>sin,</hi> either he must leave off to love us, and so leave us to our selves to take our own course, and that is the <hi>heaviest curse</hi> that can be fall any man; or else if he continue to <hi>love</hi> us, he must <hi>correct</hi> and <hi>punish</hi> us to bring

Now this <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God</hi> is expresly contained in the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Testament,</hi> where he speaks to us, to shew us his <hi>Will</hi> and our duty. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">The holy Scriptures.</note> to this <hi>Word</hi> of his, we are to bear a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful respect, to look upon it, as the <hi>rules</hi> by which we must frame all the actions of our life; and to that end to <hi>study</hi> it much, to read in it as often as we can, if it may be, never to let a <hi>day</hi> pass us without <hi>reading</hi> or <hi>hearing</hi> some part of it read.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. But then that is not all: We must not only <hi>read,</hi> but we must mark what we read, we must diligently <hi>observe,</hi> what <hi>duties</hi> there are which God commands us to perform, what <hi>faults</hi> they are, which God there charges us not to <hi>commit,</hi> together with the <hi>rewards pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised</hi> to the one, and the <hi>punishment threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> to the other.

so <hi>loosely</hi> and <hi>carelesly</hi> that they shall <hi>presently drop</hi> out again; but we must so fasten them there by often thinking and meditating on them, that we may have them ready for our <hi>use.</hi> Now that <hi>use</hi> is the directing of our <hi>lives;</hi> and therefore when ever we are tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>committing</hi> of any evil, we are then to call to minde this is the thing which in such a <hi>Scripture</hi> is <hi>forbidden</hi> by God, and all his vengeances threatned against it; and so in like manner when any opportunity is offered us of doing good, to remember, this is the <hi>duty</hi> which I was <hi>exhorted</hi> to in such a <hi>Scripture,</hi> and such <hi>glorious rewards</hi> promised to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; and by these considerations <hi>strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> our selves for <hi>resisting</hi> of the <hi>evil</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance</hi> of the <hi>good.</hi>

                  <p n="24">24. But besides this of the <hi>written</hi> Word, it hath pleased God to provide yet further for our instruction by his <hi>Ministers,</hi> whose <hi>Office</hi> it is to teach us Gods <hi>Will,</hi> not by saying any thing <hi>contrary</hi> to the <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten</hi> Word (for whatsoever is so, can never be Gods <hi>Will)</hi> but by <hi>Explaining</hi> it, and making it <hi>easier</hi> to our understandings, and then <hi>applying</hi> it to our particular <hi>occasions,</hi> and <hi>exhorting</hi> and stirring us up to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it; all which is the <hi>end</hi> at which <hi>first</hi> their <hi>Catechizing</hi> and then their <hi>Preaching</hi> aimeth. And to this we are to bear also a due <hi>respect</hi> by giving <hi>diligent</hi> heed thereto, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being present at <hi>Gatechizings</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and either <hi>sleep</hi> out the time, or think
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:60285:37"/>
of somewhat else, but carefully <hi>marking</hi> what is said to us. And surely if we did but rightly consider, how much it <hi>concerns</hi> us, we should conclude it very <hi>reasonable</hi> for us to do so.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. For <hi>First</hi> as to that of <hi>Catechizing,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing.</note> it is the laying the <hi>foundation</hi> upon which all <hi>Christian practice</hi> must be built, for that is the teaching us our <hi>duty,</hi> without which it is impossible for us to perform it. And though it is true, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are the <hi>Fountains,</hi> from whence this <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>duty</hi> must be fetched, yet there are many who are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to <hi>draw</hi> it from this <hi>Fountain</hi> themselves, and therefore it is absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> it should be thus brought to them by others.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. This <hi>Catechizing</hi> is generally look't on as a thing belonging only to the <hi>youth,</hi> and so indeed it ought, not because the <hi>oldest</hi> are not to learn, if they be <hi>ignorant,</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all <hi>children</hi> should be so <hi>instructed,</hi> that it should be impossible for them, to be <hi>ignorant</hi> when they come to <hi>years.</hi> And it neerly concernes every <hi>Parent,</hi> as they will free themselves from the <hi>guilt</hi> of their <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens</hi> eternall undoing, that they be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to see them <hi>instructed</hi> in all <hi>necessary</hi> things; to which purpose it will be fit early to <hi>teach</hi> them some <hi>short Catechism,</hi> of which sort none so fit as the <hi>Church Catechism;</hi> yet are they not to rest on these endeavours of their own; but also to call in the <hi>Ministers</hi> help, that he may build them up farther in <hi>Christian knowledge.</hi>

But although it were their <hi>Parents</hi> fault that they were not <hi>Instructed</hi> when they were <hi>young,</hi> yet it is now their own if they remain still <hi>ignorant;</hi> and it is sure it will be their <hi>own ruine</hi> and <hi>misery</hi> if they wilfully continue so. Therefore whoever it be, of what age or condition soever, that is in this <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> estate, or in any such degree of it, that he wants any part of <hi>necessary saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> let him as he loves his <hi>soul,</hi> as ever he would escape <hi>eternal damnation,</hi> seek out for <hi>instruction,</hi> and let no fear of <hi>shame</hi> keep any from it: For <hi>first,</hi> it is certain the <hi>shame</hi> belongs only to the wilful continuing in <hi>ignorance,</hi> to which the desire of <hi>learning</hi> is directly <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and is so far from a <hi>shameful,</hi> that it is a most <hi>commendable</hi> thing, and will be sure to be so accounted by all <hi>wise</hi> and good men.

                  <p n="29">29. As for those who have already this <hi>foundation</hi> laid by the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>grounds</hi> of <hi>Christian</hi> Religion, there is yet for them a farther help provided by <hi>Preaching.</hi> And it is no more then needs, for God knows those <note place="margin">Preaching.</note> that understand their duty well enough are too apt to <hi>forget</hi> it; nay, sometimes by the <hi>violence</hi> of their own <hi>lusts</hi> to <hi>transgress</hi> it even when they do <hi>remember</hi> it, and therefore it is very useful we should be put in minde of it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our <hi>forgetting,</hi> and also often <hi>exhorted</hi> and <hi>assisted</hi> to <hi>withstand</hi> those <hi>lusts</hi> which draw us to those <hi>transgressions.</hi> And to these purposes preaching is intended, <hi>first,</hi> to warn us to be upon our <hi>guard</hi> against our <hi>spiritual enemy,</hi> and then to furnish us with <hi>weapons</hi> for the fight; that is, such means and <hi>helps</hi> as may best enable us to beat off <hi>temptations</hi> and get the <hi>victory</hi> over them.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. Since therefore this is the end of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> we must not think we have done our <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> when we have heard a <hi>Sermon,</hi> though
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60285:39"/>
never so attentively, but we must lay it up in our hearts those <hi>instructions</hi> and advices we there meet with, and use them <hi>faithfully</hi> to that end of <hi>overcoming</hi> our sins. Therefore when ever thou comest to the <hi>Physician</hi> of thy <hi>Soul,</hi> do as thou wouldst with the <hi>Physician</hi> of thy <hi>Body;</hi> thou comest to him not only to hear him <hi>talk</hi> and tell thee what will <hi>cure</hi> thee, but also to do according to his directions; and if thou dost not so here, thou art as vain as he that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects a bare <hi>receipt</hi> from his <hi>Doctor</hi> shall <hi>cure</hi> him though he never make use of it. Nay, thou art much more vain and <hi>ridiculous,</hi> for that though it do him no good will do him no harm, he shall never be the worse for having been taught a <hi>medicine</hi> though he use it not: but in these <hi>Spiritual Receipts</hi> it is otherwise, if we use them not to our <hi>good</hi> they will do us a great deal of <hi>harm,</hi> they will rise up in <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> against us, and make our condemnation so much the heavier. Beware therefore not to bring that <hi>danger</hi> upon thy self, but when thou hast heard a <hi>Sermon,</hi> consider with thy self what <hi>directions</hi> there were in it for ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling thee to eschew <hi>evil,</hi> or to do <hi>good.</hi> And if there were any thing especially concern'd thine own <hi>bosome</hi> sin, lay that close to thy heart, and all the week after make it matter of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, think of it even whilst thou art at thy work, if thou wantest other time; and not only think of it, but set to the <hi>practice</hi> of it, do what thou wert advised to, for the <hi>subduing</hi> sins and quickning <hi>grace</hi> in thee. Finally, look
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:60285:39"/>
carefully to <hi>practice</hi> the counsel of the Apostle, Jam. 1. 22. <hi>Be ye doers of the Word, not hearers only, deceiving your own souls.</hi> To hope for <hi>good</hi> from the <hi>Word</hi> without doing of it, is, it seems, nothing but a <hi>deceiving</hi> our selves: Let us never therefore measure our <hi>godliness</hi> by the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Sermons</hi> which we hear, as if the hearing many were the certain mark of a good <hi>Christian;</hi> but by the store of <hi>fruit</hi> we bring forth by them, without which all our <hi>hearing</hi> will serve but to bring us into that heavier por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>stripes,</hi> which belongs to him that <hi>knowes his Masters will and does it not,</hi> Luke 12. 47. But this <hi>reverence</hi> which is due to <hi>Preaching</hi> we must not pay to all that is now a dayes called so, for God knows there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>false Prophets gone out into the world,</hi> as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>John</hi> 41. And now, if ever, is that <hi>advice</hi> of his necessary, <hi>To try the spirits whether they be of God.</hi> But what I have said, I mean only of the <hi>Preaching</hi> of those who <hi>first</hi> have a <hi>lawful calling</hi> to the <hi>Office,</hi> and <hi>secondly</hi> frame their <hi>doctrine</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>right rule,</hi> the <hi>written Word</hi> of God. But if any man say, He is not able to <hi>judg</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Doctrine</hi> be according to the <hi>Word</hi> or no, let him at least try it by the <hi>common</hi> known rules of <hi>duty</hi> which he doth understand, and if he find it a <hi>Doctrine</hi> giving men liberty to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit</hi> those things which are by all acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>sins,</hi> such as <hi>rebellion, injustice, unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, uncleanness,</hi> or the like, he may conclude, it is utterly <hi>contrary</hi> to God and his <hi>Word,</hi>

The <hi>first</hi> of them, <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> that enters us into <hi>covenant</hi> with <hi>God,</hi> makes us <hi>members</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so gives us right to all those <hi>precious benefits,</hi> that flow from him, to wit, <hi>pardon of sins, sanctifying grace,</hi> and <hi>heaven</hi> it self, on <hi>condition</hi> we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our parts of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And as for the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> that is not only a <hi>signe</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>death;</hi> but it is actually the <hi>giving Christ,</hi> and all the <hi>fruits</hi> of his <hi>death</hi> to every <hi>worthy</hi> receiver; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a most <hi>high estimation,</hi> and <hi>value</hi> due to each of them.</p>
                  <p n="32">32.

                     <hi>baptized</hi> when they were of <hi>years.</hi> But for us, it suffices to give us this right to <hi>Baptism,</hi> that we are <hi>born</hi> within the <hi>pale</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> that is, of <hi>Christian parents;</hi> and all that is required at that time is what we can only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form by others, they in our stead <hi>promising</hi> that when we come to <hi>years</hi> we will <hi>perform</hi> our parts of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> But by how much the less we are then able to do so much, the greater bond lies on us to perform those <hi>after-duties required</hi> of us, by which we are to supply the <hi>want</hi> of the former.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. Now if you would know what those <note place="margin">The vow of Baptism.</note> 
                     <hi>duties</hi> are, look over those <hi>promises</hi> which your <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> then made in your name, and you may then learn them. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give you them in a better form then that of our <hi>Churches Catechism,</hi> which tells, <hi>That our Godfathers and Godmothers did promise and vow three things in our names;</hi> first, <hi>that we should forsake the Devil and all his workes, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the sinful lusts of the flesh.</hi> Where, by the <hi>Devil</hi> is meant, <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>worshipping</hi> of all <hi>false gods,</hi> which is indeed but <hi>worshipping the Devil:</hi> A sin which at the time of <hi>Christs</hi> coming into the world was very common, most part of <hi>mankinde</hi> then living in that vile <hi>Idolatry.</hi> And therefore when <hi>Baptism</hi> was first ordained, it was but needful to make the <hi>forsaking</hi> of those <hi>false gods</hi> a principal part of the <hi>vow.</hi> And though those <hi>false worships</hi> are now much rarer, yet there was one spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60285:41"/>
part of them, which may be <hi>feared</hi> to be yet too common among us, and that is all sorts of <hi>uncleanness,</hi> which though we do not make <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did of theirs, yet the <hi>committing</hi> thereof is a most high provocation in Gods eyes, such as drew him to destroy whole <hi>Cities</hi> with <hi>fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. Nay, the <hi>whole World</hi> with <hi>water, Gen.</hi> 6. and will not fail to bring down judgments, and strange ones, on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that continue therein; and therefore the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking</hi> them well deserves to be <hi>look't</hi> on as an especial part of this <hi>promise.</hi> Besides this, all dealing with the <hi>Devil</hi> is here <hi>vowed</hi> against, whether it be by <hi>practising witchcraft</hi> our selves, or consulting with those that do upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny occasion whatever, as the <hi>recovery</hi> of our <hi>health,</hi> our <hi>goods,</hi> or whatever else; for this is a degree of the former <hi>sin,</hi> it is the <hi>forsaking</hi> of the Lord, and setting up the <hi>Devil</hi> for our <hi>God,</hi> whilst we go to him in our needs for help.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. But we also <hi>renounce</hi> all the <hi>works</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> and those are either in general all those which the Devil tempts us to, or else those particular kinds of sin which have most of his <hi>image</hi> on them; that is, those which he himself most <hi>practises,</hi> such are <hi>pride</hi> (which brought him from being an <hi>Angel of light</hi> to the accursed condition he is now in) and <hi>lying;</hi> he is, as our Saviour saith, <hi>John</hi> 8. 44.

nothing wherein we become so like him, as in <hi>tempting</hi> and drawing others to sin, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is his whole <hi>trade</hi> and <hi>business,</hi> and if we make it any part of ours, we become like that <hi>roaring Lion, that goes about seeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 8.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. The <hi>second</hi> thing we <hi>vow</hi> to <hi>forsake,</hi> is the <hi>pomps and vanities of this wicked world.</hi> By the pomps and vanities there are several things meant; some of them such as were used by the <hi>Heathens</hi> in some <hi>Unlawful sports</hi> of theirs, wherein we are not now so much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, there being none of them remaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: but besides that, there is meant all <hi>excess,</hi> either in <hi>diet,</hi> or <hi>sports,</hi> or <hi>apparel,</hi> when we keep not those due measures, which either by the general rules of <hi>sobriety,</hi> or the <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> circumstances of our <hi>qualities</hi> and <hi>callings</hi> we are bound to. Next, by the <hi>wicked world,</hi> we may understand, <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>wealth</hi> and <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> which though we do not so totally renounce, that it is unlawful for a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to be either rich or great, yet we thus far <hi>promise</hi> to <hi>forsake</hi> them, that we will not set our hearts upon them, nor either get or <hi>keep</hi> them by the least unlawful means. <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the <hi>wicked world,</hi> we may understand the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies</hi> and <hi>customes</hi> of the <hi>world,</hi> which so far as they are <hi>wicked</hi> we here <hi>renounce;</hi> that is, we <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> never to be drawn by <hi>company</hi> to the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of a sin, but rather to forsake the most <hi>delightful</hi> company then be ensnared by it; nor yet by <hi>custome,</hi> but rather venture the <hi>shame</hi> of being thought <hi>singular,</hi> ridiculous persons, walk

as it were in a path by our selves, then put our selves into that <hi>broad way that leads to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi> by giving our selves over to any <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful custome</hi> how <hi>common</hi> soever it be grown.

                  <p n="36">36.

For though those <hi>unclean desires</hi> which we ordinarily call the <hi>lusts</hi> of the <hi>flesh</hi> are here meant, yet they are not the <hi>only</hi> things here contained, there being divers other things which the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls the <hi>works of the flesh;</hi> I cannot better inform you of them then by setting down that list <hi>S.

                  <p n="37">37. The <hi>second</hi> thing our <hi>Godfathers</hi> and <hi>Godmothers</hi> promised for us, was, that <hi>we should
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60285:42"/>
believe all the Articles of the Christian faith.</hi> These we have summed up together in that which we call the <hi>Apostles Creed,</hi> which since we promise to <hi>believe,</hi> we are supposed also to <hi>promise</hi> to <hi>learn</hi> them, and that not only the <hi>words,</hi> but likewise the <hi>plain sense</hi> of them, for who can <hi>believe</hi> what he either never <hi>heard,</hi> of, or knows not any thing of the meaning of it? Now by this <hi>believing</hi> is meant not only the consenting to the <hi>truth</hi> of them, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the <hi>living</hi> like them that do <hi>believe.</hi> As for <hi>Example,</hi> our <hi>believing</hi> that <hi>God created</hi> us, should make us live in that <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>obedience</hi> to him which becomes <hi>Creatures</hi> to their <hi>Creator;</hi> the <hi>believing</hi> that <hi>Christ Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed</hi> us, should make us yield up our selves to him as his <hi>purchase,</hi> to be disposed wholly by him, and <hi>imployed</hi> only in his <hi>service.</hi> The <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> a <hi>judgment</hi> to come, should give us care so to walk that we may not be <hi>condemned</hi> in it.

to keep it, in respect of our own <hi>benefit.</hi> I told you before, That <hi>Baptism</hi> entred us into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God; now a <hi>Covenant</hi> is made up of <hi>two</hi> parts, that is, something <hi>promised</hi> by the one <hi>party,</hi> and something by the other of the parties that make the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And if one of them break his part of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> that is, perform not what he hath agreed to, he can in no reason look that the other should make good his. And so it is here, God doth indeed promise those benefits before mentioned, and that is his part of the Covenant. But then we also undertake to perform the several things contained in this <hi>vow</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> and that is our <hi>part</hi> of it, and unless we do indeed perform them, God is not tyed to make good his, and so we <hi>forfeit</hi> all those precious benefits and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, we are left in that <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> estate of ours, <hi>children of wrath, enemies to God, and heirs of eternal damnation.</hi> And now what can be the pleasure that any or all sins can afford us that can make us the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of recompence for such a <hi>loss,</hi> the <hi>loss</hi> of Gods <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> here, and the loss of our own <hi>souls</hi> hereafter? for as our Saviour saith, <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 36. <hi>What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul?</hi> yet this mad bargain we make when ever we break any part of this our <hi>vow</hi> of <hi>Baptism.</hi> It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore most neerly <hi>concerns</hi> us to consider sadly of it, to remember that every <hi>sin</hi> we commit is a direct breach of this <hi>vow,</hi> and therefore when thou art <hi>tempted</hi> to any <hi>sin,</hi> seem it never so

And till you have means of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better, look over what is briefly said in the entrance to this Treatise, concerning the SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COND COVENANT, which is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that <hi>Covenant</hi> which God makes with us in our <hi>Baptism.</hi> And because you will there finde, that obedience to all Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands is the <hi>condition required</hi> of us, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so that which we expresly <hi>Vow</hi> in our <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> it is necessary you should likewise know what those <hi>Commands</hi> of God are. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you finde you are ignorant of them, never be at rest till you have got your self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in them, and have gained such a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of knowledge as may direct you to do that <hi>Whole Duty of Man</hi> which God requires. And the giving thee this instruction is the only aim of <hi>This Book,</hi> which the more ignorant thou art, the more earnestly I shall intreat thee diligently to read. And if thou hast heretofore approacht to this <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> in utter ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of these <hi>necessary</hi> things, bewail thy sin in so doing, but presume not to come again till thou have by gaining this <hi>necessary knowledg</hi> fitted thy self for it, which thou must hasten to do. For though no man must come to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in such <hi>ignorance,</hi> yet if he wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continue in it, that will be no <hi>excúse</hi> to him for keeping from this holy Table.</p>

4. The <hi>second</hi> part of our <hi>Examination</hi> is, concerning our <hi>breaches</hi> of this <hi>Covenant;</hi> and here thou wilt finde the use of that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> I spake of. For there is no way of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering what our <hi>sins</hi> have been, but by <hi>try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Sins.</note> our actions by that which should be the <hi>rule</hi> of them, the <hi>Law</hi> of God. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">Several sorts.</note> thou settest to this part of <hi>Examination,</hi> remember what are the several branches of thy <hi>duty,</hi> and then ask thy own heart in every particular, how thou hast <hi>performed</hi> it. And content not thy self with knowing in <hi>general,</hi> that thou hast broken Gods <hi>Law,</hi> but do thy utmost to discover in what <hi>particulars</hi> thou hast done so. Recall, as well as thou canst, all the passages of thy life, and in each of them consider what part of that duty hath been <hi>transgrest</hi> by it. And that not onely in the <hi>grosser</hi> act, but in <hi>word</hi> also, nay, even in thy most <hi>secret thoughts:</hi> For though mans <hi>Law</hi> reaches not to them, yet Gods doth; so that whatever he forbids in the act he forbids like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise in the <hi>thoughts</hi> and <hi>desires,</hi> and sees them as clearly as our most <hi>publick acts.</hi> This par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular search is exceeding necessary; for there is no promise of <hi>forgiveness</hi> of any sin but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to him that confesseth and <hi>forsaketh</hi> it. Now to both these it is necessary that we have a <hi>direct</hi> and particular <hi>knowledge</hi> of our sins. For how can he either <hi>confess</hi> his Sin, that <hi>knowes</hi> not his guilt of it? or how can he <hi>resolve</hi> to <hi>forsake</hi> it, that discerns not himself to have formerly <hi>cleaved</hi> to it? Therefore we may
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60285:47"/>
surely conclude, that this <hi>Examination</hi> is not only <hi>useful</hi> but <hi>necessary</hi> towards a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat repentance;</hi> for he that does not take this <hi>particular</hi> view of his <hi>sins,</hi> will be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to <hi>repent</hi> but by <hi>

                     </hi> which will never avail him towards his <hi>pardon;</hi> nothing but an entire forsaking of <hi>every evil way,</hi> being suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for that. But surely of all other times it concerns us, that when we come to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> our <hi>repentance</hi> be <hi>full</hi> and <hi>compleat;</hi> and therefore this strict search of our <hi>own</hi> hearts is then especially <hi>necessary.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be true, that it is not <hi>possible</hi> by all our <hi>diligence</hi> to discover or remember eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sin of our whole <hi>lives:</hi> and though it be also true, that what is so unavoidably hid from us, may be forgiven without any more particular <hi>confession</hi> then that of <hi>Davids,</hi> Psal. 19. 12. <hi>Cleanse thou me from my secret faults;</hi> Yet this will be no plea for us if they come to be <hi>secret</hi> onely because we are <hi>negligent</hi> in searching. Therefore take heed of <hi>deceiving</hi> thy self in this <hi>weighty</hi> business, but search thy soul to the <hi>bottom,</hi> without which it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the wounds thereof should ever be <hi>throughly</hi> cured.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And as you are to enquire thus narrowly concerning the <hi>several sorts</hi> of sins, so also must you concerning the <hi>degrees</hi> of them, for there are divers <hi>circumstances</hi> which <hi>increase</hi> and heighten the sin. Of this sort there are many, as <hi>first,</hi> when we sin against <hi>knowledge,</hi> that is, when we certainly <hi>know</hi> such a thing
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60285:48"/>
to be a <hi>sin,</hi> yet for the present <hi>pleasure</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit</hi> (or whatever other motive) adventure of it. This is by Christ himself adjudged to be a great <hi>heightning</hi> of the <hi>sin.</hi> He <hi>that knows his Masters will and doth it not, shall be beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with many stripes,</hi> Luke 12. 47. <hi>Secondly,</hi> when we sin with <hi>deliberation,</hi> that is, when we do not fall into it of a <hi>sudden</hi> ere we are <hi>aware,</hi> but have time to consider of it, this is another degree of the sin. But <hi>thirdly,</hi> a yet <hi>higher</hi> is, when we do it against the <hi>resistances</hi> and <hi>checks</hi> of our own <hi>conscience,</hi> when that at the time tells us, This thing thou oughtest not to do: Nay, layes before us the <hi>danger</hi> as well as the <hi>sin</hi> of it, yet in spight of these <hi>admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>conscience</hi> we go on and commit the sin; this is a huge <hi>increase</hi> of it, such as will raise the least sin into a most <hi>high provocation.</hi> For it is plain, a sin thus committed must be a <hi>wilful</hi> one, and then be the <hi>matter</hi> of it never so <hi>light</hi> it is most hainous in Gods eyes. Nay, this is a <hi>circumstance</hi> of such force, that it may make an <hi>indifferent</hi> action, that is in it self no sin, become one. For though my <hi>conscience</hi> should erre in telling me such a thing were <hi>unlawful,</hi> yet so long as I were so <hi>perswaded,</hi> it were sin for me to do that thing; for in that case my Will <hi>consents</hi> to the doing a thing which I <hi>believe</hi> to be <hi>displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> and God (who judges us by our wils, not <hi>understandings)</hi> imputes it to me as a sin as well as if the thing were in it self <hi>unlawsul,</hi> and therefore surely we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60285:48"/>
that any thing which is in it self <hi>sinful,</hi> is made much more so by being <hi>committed</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>checks</hi> of <hi>conscience.</hi> A <hi>fourth ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation</hi> of a sin, is, when it hath been often repeated, for then there is not only the guilt of so many more <hi>acts,</hi> but every Act growes also so much <hi>worse,</hi> and more inexcusable. We alwayes judge thus in faults committed against our <hi>selves,</hi> we can forgive a <hi>single</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury more easily then the same when it hath been <hi>repeated,</hi> and the oftner it hath been so <hi>repeated,</hi> the more hainous we account it. And so surely it is in faults against God also. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> the <hi>sins</hi> which have been <hi>committed</hi> after <hi>vows</hi> and Resolutions of amendment are yet more grievous; for that contains also the breaking of those <hi>promises.</hi> Somewhat of this there is in every <hi>wilsul</hi> sin, because every such is a breach of that <hi>vow</hi> we make at <hi>Baprism.</hi> But besides that, we have since bound our selves by <hi>new vows,</hi> if at no other time, yet surely at our <hi>coming</hi> to the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> that being (as was formerly said) purposely to <hi>repeat</hi> our <hi>vow</hi> of <hi>Baptism.</hi> And the more of these <hi>vows</hi> we have made, so much the greater is our <hi>guilt,</hi> if we fall back to any sin we then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced. This is a thing very well <hi>worth</hi> weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore <hi>examine</hi> thy self particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at thy approach to the <hi>Sacrament</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thy breaches of <hi>former vowes</hi> made at the <hi>Holy Table.</hi> And if upon any other <hi>occasion,</hi> as <hi>sickness, trouble</hi> of minde, or the like, thou hast at any time made any other, call thy self to a
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60285:49"/>
strict account how thou hast performed them also, and remember that every sin committed against such <hi>vows,</hi> is besides its own <hi>natural</hi> guilt a <hi>Perjury</hi> likewise. <hi>Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> a yet higher step is, when a sin hath been so <hi>often committed</hi> that we are come to a <hi>custome</hi> and <hi>habit</hi> of it: and that is indeed a <hi>high</hi> degree.</p>

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60285:54"/>
if he be left to the satisfying of his own doubts, he will quickly bring himself to pass too <hi>favourable</hi> a sentence. Or whether he be the one or the other, if he come to the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> in that doubt, he certainly plunges himself into farther <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>scruples,</hi> if not into sin: On the other side, if he forbear because of it, if that fear be a <hi>causeless</hi> one, then he <hi>groundlesly</hi> absents himself from that <hi>Holy Ordinance,</hi> and so deprives his Soul of the <hi>benefits</hi> of it. Therefore in the midst of so many <hi>dangers</hi> which attend the mistake of himself, I would, as I said before, exhort him not to trust to his own judgement, but to make known his case to some <hi>discreet</hi> and <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Minister,</hi> and rather be guided by his, who will probably (if the case be duly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>disguise</hi> discovered to him) be better able to <hi>judge</hi> of him then he of himself.

many have run into very great <hi>mischief,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving let the doubt fester so long that it hath either plunged them into deep <hi>distresses</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> or which is worse, they have to still that disquiet within them, betaken themselves to all <hi>sinful pleasures,</hi> and so quite cast off all care of their <hi>souls.</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>second</hi> way of <hi>Dishonouring</hi> Gods <hi>Name</hi> is, by <hi>swearing,</hi> and that is of <hi>two sorts,</hi> either <note place="margin">Swearing.</note> by <hi>false Oathes,</hi> or else by <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>light ones.</hi> A <hi>false Oath</hi> may also be of <hi>two</hi> kinds, as <hi>first,</hi> that by which I <hi>affirm</hi> somewhat, or <hi>secondly,</hi> that by which I <hi>promise.</hi> The <hi>first</hi> is when I say such or such a thing was done so or so, and <note place="margin">Assertory Oathes.</note> confirm this saying of mine with an <hi>Oath;</hi> if then I know there be not perfect <hi>truth</hi> in what I say, this is a flat <hi>perjury,</hi> a downright being <hi>forsworn:</hi> Nay, if I swear to the <hi>truth</hi> of that whereof I am only <hi>doubtful,</hi> though the thing should happen to be <hi>true,</hi> yet it brings upon me the guilt of <hi>Perjury;</hi> for I swear at a <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and the thing might for ought I knew be as well <hi>false</hi> as <hi>true,</hi> whereas I ought never to <hi>swear</hi> to any thing, the truth of which I do not <hi>certainly</hi> know.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But besides this sort of <hi>Oathes,</hi> by which <note place="margin">Promissory.</note> I <hi>affirm</hi> any thing, there is the other sort, that by which I <hi>promise</hi> somewhat. And that <hi>promise</hi> may be either to <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> when it is to <hi>God,</hi> we call it a <hi>vow</hi> of which I have already spoken, under the head of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> I shall now only speak of that to <hi>man;</hi> &amp; this may become a <hi>false oath,</hi> either at, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time of <hi>taking</hi> it. At the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>taking,</hi> it is false if either I have then no real <hi>purpose</hi> of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60285:63"/>
making it good, or else take it in a sense <hi>diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> from that which I know, he to whom I make the <hi>promise understands</hi> it; for the use of <hi>oaths</hi> being to assure the persons to whom they are made, they must be taken in <hi>their sense.</hi> But if I were never so <hi>sincere</hi> at the <hi>taking</hi> the <hi>Oath,</hi> if afterwards I do not <hi>perform</hi> it I am certainly <hi>Perjured.</hi>

                     <hi>binding,</hi> it meerly concerns us to look that the <hi>Matter</hi> of our <hi>Oaths</hi> be lawful, for else we run our selves into a <hi>woful snare.</hi> For Example, suppose I <hi>swear</hi> to kill a man, if I perform my <hi>Oath</hi> I am guilty of <hi>Murder,</hi> if I break it, of <hi>Perjury.</hi> And so I am under a <hi>necessity</hi> of <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> one way or other: But there is nothing puts us under a greater degree of this <hi>unhappy</hi> necessity, then when we swear two <hi>Oathes,</hi> whereof the one is directly <hi>cross</hi> and <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory</hi> to the other. For if I swear to give a man my whole <hi>estate,</hi> and afterwards swear to give all or <hi>part</hi> of that <hi>estate</hi> to another, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain I must break my <hi>Oath</hi> to one of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is impossible to perform it to <hi>both,</hi> and so I must be under a <hi>necessity</hi> of being <hi>forsworn.</hi> And into this unhappy <hi>straight</hi> every man brings himself that takes any <hi>Oath</hi> which cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses some other which he hath formerly taken; which should make all that love either God or their own <hi>souls,</hi> resolve never thus mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably to <hi>entangle</hi> themselves by taking one <hi>Oath</hi> crosse and thwarting to another. But it may perhaps here be asked, What a person
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:60285:63"/>
that hath already brought himself into such a condition shall do? I answer, he must first hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily <hi>repent</hi> the great sin of <hi>taking</hi> the <hi>unlawful oath,</hi> and then stick only to the <hi>lawful,</hi> which is all that is in his power towards the repairing his fault, and <hi>qualifying</hi> him for <hi>Gods pardon</hi> for it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

For it is in reason to signifie one of these two things, either that we believe he knows not whether we say <hi>true</hi> or no; (and that is to make him no <hi>God,</hi> to suppose him to be as <hi>deceivable,</hi> and easie to be delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as one of our ignorant neighbours) or else that he is willing to <hi>countenance</hi> our <hi>Lyes;</hi> the former robs him of that great <hi>attribute</hi> of his, his <hi>knowing all things,</hi> and is surely a great <hi>dishonouring</hi> of him, it being even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men accounted one of the greatest <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces</hi> to account a man fit to have <hi>cheats</hi> put upon him; yet even so to deal with <hi>God</hi> if we venture to <hi>forswear</hi> upon a hope that God discernes it not.

                  <p n="5">5. But if any yet doubt the <hi>hainousness</hi> of this sin, let him but consider what God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self <note place="margin">The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it.</note> sayes of it in the <hi>Third Commandement,</hi> where he solemnly professes, <hi>He will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in vaine;</hi> and sure the adding that to this <hi>Commandment,</hi> and none of the rest, is the <hi>marking</hi> this out for a most <hi>hainous</hi> guilt. And if you look into <hi>Zac.</hi> 5. you will there finde the <hi>punishment</hi> is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, even to the <hi>utter destruction</hi> not only of the <hi>man,</hi> but his <hi>house</hi> also.

                  <p>But besides this of <hi>forswearing,</hi> I told you <note place="margin">Vain Oaths.</note> there was another sort of <hi>Oaths</hi> by which <hi>Gods</hi> Name is <hi>dishonoured,</hi> those are the <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>light Oaths,</hi> such as are so usual in our <hi>common</hi> discourse, and are expresly forbidden by <hi>Christ,</hi> Mat. 5. 34. <hi>But I say unto you, swear not at all, neither by Heaven, for it is Gods throne, nor by the Earth, for it is his foot-stool:</hi> where you see we are not allowed to <hi>swear</hi> even by <hi>meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> because of the <hi>relation</hi> they have to God. How great a <hi>wickednesse</hi> is it then to <hi>profane</hi> his holy <hi>Name</hi> by <hi>rash</hi> and <hi>vain Oaths,</hi> this is a sin that is (by I know not what <hi>charm</hi>

of <hi>Satans)</hi> grown into a fashion among us; and now its being so, draws daily more men into it. But it is to be remembred that when we shall appear before Gods <hi>Judgement seat</hi> to answer for those <hi>profanations</hi> of his Name, it will be no excuse to say, It was the <hi>fashion</hi> to do so: it will rather be an increase of our <hi>guilt,</hi> that we have by our own <hi>practice</hi> help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to confirm that <hi>wicked</hi> custome which we ought to have beat down and <hi>discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</hi>

                  <p n="6">6. And sure whatever this <hi>profane</hi> Age thinks of it, this is a sin of very <hi>high</hi> nature. <note place="margin">The sin of them.</note> For besides that it is a direct breach of the <hi>Precept</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> it shews <hi>first,</hi> a very mean and <hi>low</hi> esteem of God: Every <hi>Oath</hi> we swear is the appealing to God to judge the truth of what we speak, and therefore being of such greatnesse and <hi>Majestie,</hi> requires that the matter concerning which we thus appeal to him should be of great <hi>weight</hi> and moment, somewhat wherein either his own <hi>glory,</hi> or some considerable <hi>good</hi> of man is concern'd. But when we <hi>swear</hi> in common discourse it is far otherwise, any the <hi>triflingest</hi> or lightest thing serves for the matter of an <hi>Oath,</hi> nay, often men <hi>swear</hi> to such vain and <hi>foolish</hi> things, as a considering person would be ashamed barely to <hi>speak.</hi> And is it not a great <hi>despising</hi> of God to call him solemnly to <hi>judge</hi> in such <hi>childish,</hi> such wretched matters? God is the great <hi>King</hi> of the world; now though a <hi>King</hi> be to be resorted unto in <hi>weighty</hi> ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60285:65"/>
yet sure he would think himself much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised if he should be called to <hi>judge</hi> between <hi>Boyes</hi> at their <hi>childish games:</hi> And God knows many things whereto we frequently <hi>swear,</hi> are not of greater <hi>weight,</hi> and therefore are a sign that we do not rightly esteem of <hi>God.</hi>

                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This <hi>common swearing</hi> is a <hi>sin</hi>

8. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> This is a sin to which there is no <hi>temptation,</hi> there is nothing either of <hi>pleasure</hi> or <hi>profit</hi> got by it: Most other sins offer us <note place="margin">No tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them.</note> somewhat either of the one or the other, but this is utterly empty of <hi>both.</hi> So that in this sin the <hi>Devil</hi> does not play the <hi>Merchant</hi> for our <hi>Souls,</hi> as in others he does; he doth not so much as <hi>cheapen</hi> them, but we give them <hi>freely</hi> into his hands without any thing in <hi>exchange.</hi> There seems to be but one thing possible for men to hope to <hi>gain</hi> by it, &amp; that is to be <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> in what they say when they thus bind it by an <hi>Oath.</hi> But this also they constantly fail of, for there are none so little <hi>believed</hi> as the <hi>common swearers.</hi> And good reason, for he that makes no <hi>conscience</hi> thus to <hi>profane Gods Name,</hi> why shall any man <hi>believe</hi> he makes any of <hi>ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Nay, their forwardness to confirm every the <hi>slightest</hi> thing by an <hi>Oath,</hi> rather gives <hi>jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie</hi> that they have some inward guilt of <hi>falseness,</hi> for which that <hi>Oath</hi> must be the <hi>cloak.</hi> And thus you see in how little stead it stands them, even to this onely purpose for which they can pretend it <hi>useful:</hi> and to any other advantage it makes not the least <hi>claim,</hi> and therefore is a sin without <hi>temptation,</hi> and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently without <hi>excuse;</hi> for it shews the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est <hi>contempt,</hi> nay, unkindness to <hi>God,</hi> when we will provoke him thus, without any thing, to tempt us to it.

10. We are likewise to give thanks for <hi>Temporal</hi> blessings, whether such as concern the <hi>publick,</hi> as the <hi>prosperity</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Temporal.</note> or <hi>Nation,</hi> and all remarkable <hi>deliverances</hi> afforded to either; or else such as concern our particulars; such are all the good things of this life which we enjoy, as <hi>Health, Friends, Food, Raiment,</hi> and the like; also for those <hi>minutely</hi> preservations, whereby we are by Gods gracious <hi>providence</hi> kept from <hi>danger,</hi> and the <hi>especial</hi> deliverances which God hath given us in time of greatest <hi>perils.</hi> It will be impossible to set down the several mercies which every man receives from God, because they differ in <hi>kind</hi> and <hi>degree</hi> between one man and another. But it is sure that he which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives <hi>least</hi> hath yet enough to imploy his whole <hi>life</hi> in <hi>praises</hi> to God. And it will be very fit for every man to consider the <hi>several</hi> passages of this life, and the <hi>mercies</hi> he hath in each received, and so to gather a kind of <hi>List</hi> or <hi>Catalogue</hi> of them, at least the <hi>principal</hi> of them, which he may alwayes have in his <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,</hi> and often with a <hi>thankful</hi> heart repeat before God.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. These are the several parts of <hi>Prayer,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Publick prayer in the Church.</note> and all of them to be used both <hi>publickly</hi> and <hi>privately.</hi> The <hi>publick</hi> use of them is <hi>first,</hi> that in the <hi>Church,</hi> where all meet to joyn in those <hi>prayers</hi> wherein they are in <hi>common</hi> concerned. And this (where the <hi>prayers</hi> are such as they ought to be) we should be very constant at, there being an <hi>especial</hi> blessing
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:60285:71"/>
promised to the <hi>joynt</hi> requests of the faithful, and he that without a necessary cause absents himself from such <hi>publick prayers,</hi> cuts himself off from the <hi>Church,</hi> which hath alwayes been thought so unhappy a thing, that it is the <hi>greatest punishment</hi> the <hi>Governours</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> can lay upon the <hi>worst</hi> offender; and therefore it is a strange <hi>madness</hi> for men to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict it upon themselves.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. A <hi>second</hi> sort of <hi>Publick Prayer</hi> is that <note place="margin">In the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</note> in a <hi>Family,</hi> where all that are <hi>members</hi> of it joyn in their common supplications; and this also ought to be very carefully attended to, <hi>first,</hi> by the <hi>Master</hi> of the <hi>Family,</hi> who is to look that there be such <hi>prayers,</hi> it being as much his <hi>part</hi> thus to provide for the <hi>Souls</hi> of his <hi>Children</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> as to provide <hi>food</hi> for their <hi>Bodies.</hi> Therefore there is none, even the meanest housholder, but ought to take this care. If either himself or any of his <hi>Family</hi> can read, he may use some <hi>prayers</hi> out of some <hi>good book,</hi> if it be the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice Book</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> he makes a <hi>good</hi> choice; if they cannot read, it will then be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary they should be taught without <hi>Book</hi> some form of <hi>prayer</hi> which they may use in the <hi>Family,</hi> for which purpose again some of the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> will be very fit, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most easie for their <hi>memories</hi> by reason of their <hi>shortness,</hi> and yet containing a great deal of <hi>matter.</hi> But what choice soever they make of <hi>prayers,</hi> let them be sure to have some, and let no man that professes himself a Christian,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:60285:71"/>
keep so <hi>heat henish</hi> a <hi>Family,</hi> as not to see God be daily worshipped in it. But when the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of a <hi>Family</hi> hath done his duty in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding, it is the duty of every member of it to make use of that provision, by being constant and diligent at those <hi>Family-Prayers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Private</hi> or <hi>secret Prayer</hi> is that which <note place="margin">Private Prayer.</note> is used by a man <hi>alone</hi> apart from all others, wherein we are to be more <hi>particular,</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our <hi>particular</hi> needs, then in <hi>publick</hi> it is fit to be. And this of <hi>private Prayer</hi> is a duty which will not be excused by the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the other of <hi>publick.</hi> They are <hi>both</hi> required, and one must not be taken in <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> for the other. And whoever is diligent in <hi>publick</hi> prayers, and yet negligent in <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate,</hi> it is much to be feared he rather seeks to <hi>approve</hi> himself to <hi>men</hi> then to <hi>God,</hi> contrary to the command of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. who enjoynes this <hi>private prayer,</hi> this <hi>praying to our Father in secret,</hi> from whom alone we are to expect our <hi>reward,</hi> and not from the <hi>vain praises of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. Now this duty of <hi>Prayer</hi> is to be <hi>often</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Frequency in Prayer.</note> performed, by none seldomer then <hi>Evening</hi> and <hi>Morning,</hi> it being most necessary that we should thus <hi>begin</hi> and <hi>end</hi> all our works with God, and that not only in respect of the duty we owe him, but also in respect of our selves, who can never be either prosperous or <hi>safe,</hi> but by committing our selves to him; and therefore should <hi>tremble</hi> to venture on the <hi>perils</hi> either of <hi>day</hi> or <hi>night</hi> without his safeguard. How
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60285:72"/>
much oftner this duty is to be performed, must be judged according to the <hi>business</hi> or <hi>leisure</hi> men have; where, by <hi>businesse,</hi> I mean not such <hi>business</hi> as men unprofitably make to themselves, but the necessary businesse of a mans <hi>Calling,</hi> which with some will not afford them much time for <hi>set</hi> and <hi>solemn</hi> Prayer. But even these men may often in a day lift up their <hi>hearts</hi> to God in some <hi>short</hi> Prayers, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven whilest they are at their <hi>work.</hi> As for those that have <hi>more leisure,</hi> they are in all reason to bestow <hi>more time</hi> upon this duty. And let no man that can finde time to bestow upon his <hi>vanities,</hi> nay, perhaps his <hi>sins,</hi> say he wants leisure for <hi>prayer,</hi> but let him now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to redeem what he hath mis-spent, by imploying more of that <hi>leisure</hi> in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the future. And surely if we did but rightly weigh how much it is our own <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Prayer.</note> to perform this duty, we should think it <hi>wisdom</hi> to be as <hi>frequent</hi> as we are ordinarily <hi>seldom</hi> in it.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. For <hi>first,</hi> it is a great <hi>Honour</hi> for us poor <note place="margin">Honour.</note> 
                     <hi>worms</hi> of the earth to be allowed to speak so freely to the <hi>Majestie</hi> of heaven. If a <hi>King</hi> should but vouchsafe to let one of his meanest <hi>Subjects</hi> talk <hi>familiarly</hi> and <hi>freely</hi> with him, it would be looked on as a huge ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; that man how despiseable soever he were before, would then be the <hi>envy</hi> of all his neighbours; and there is little question, he would be willing to take all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of receiving so great a <hi>grace.</hi> But alas!
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:60285:72"/>
this is nothing to the <hi>honour</hi> is offered us, who are allowed, nay, <hi>invited</hi> to speak to, and converse with the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore how <hi>forward</hi> should we in all reason be to it?</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is a great <hi>Benefit,</hi> even the <note place="margin">Benefit.</note> greatest that can be imagned; for <hi>Prayer</hi> is the <hi>instrument</hi> of fetching down all <hi>good</hi> things to us, whether <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>temporal;</hi> no <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> that is qualified as it ought to be, but is sure to bring down a <hi>blessing,</hi> according to that of the <hi>wise man,</hi> Eccles. 35. 17. <hi>The Prayer of the humble pierceth the clouds, and will not turn away till the highest regard it.</hi> You would think him a happy man that had one certain means of helping him to whatever he <hi>wanted,</hi> though it were to <hi>cost</hi> him much pains and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; now this happy man thou mayest be if thou wilt. <hi>Prayer</hi> is the never-failing means of bringing thee, if not all that thou thinkest thou wantest, yet all that indeed thou dost, that is, all that God sees fit for thee. And therefore be there never so much <hi>weariness</hi> to thy flesh in the duty, yet considering in what continual <hi>want</hi> thou standest of something or other from God, it is madness to let that <hi>uneasiness</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearten thee, and keep thee from this so sure means of <hi>supplying</hi> thy wants.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. But in the <hi>third</hi> place, this duty is in it <note place="margin">Pleasantness</note> self so far from being uneasie, that it is very <hi>pleasant.</hi> God is the <hi>fountain</hi> of <hi>happiness, and at his right hand are pleasures for evermore, Psalm</hi> 16. 11.

draw to him the <hi>happier</hi> we must needs be, the very <hi>joyes</hi> of heaven arising from our <hi>neerness</hi> to God. Now in this life we have no way of <hi>drawing</hi> so neer to him, as by this of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and therefore surely it is that, which in it self is apt to afford <hi>abundance</hi> of <hi>delight</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> if it seem otherwise to us, it is from some distemper of our own hearts, which like a <hi>sick</hi> palate cannot relish the most pleasant meat. <hi>Prayer</hi> is a <hi>pleasant</hi> duty, but it is withal a <hi>spiritual</hi> one; and therefore if thy heart be <hi>carnal,</hi> if that be set either on the <hi>contrary</hi>

                     </hi> whilest thou longest after the <hi>flesh pots of Egypt.</hi> Therefore if thou finde a <hi>weariness</hi> in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>suspect</hi> thy self, <hi>purge,</hi> and <hi>refine</hi> thy heart from the love of all <hi>sin,</hi> and endeavour to put it into a <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>spiritual frame,</hi> and then thou wilt find this no <hi>unpleasant</hi> exercise, but full of delight and satisfaction.

thy heart in time of <hi>prayer</hi> to keep out all <hi>wandring</hi> thoughts, or if any have gotten in let them not find entertainment, but as soon as ever thou discernest them, suffer them not to <hi>abide</hi> one moment, but cast them out with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, and <hi>beg</hi> Gods <hi>pardon</hi> for them. And if th ou dost thus sincerely and diligently strive against them, either God will enable thee in some measure to overcome, or he will in his mercy pardon thee what thou canst not <hi>prevent:</hi> But if it be through thy own <hi>negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence</hi> thou art to expect neither, so long as that negligence continues.</p>

Now surely the things we ask from God are so much above the rate of an ordinary <hi>Alms,</hi> that we can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver expect they should be given to slight and heartless petitions.

from a heart truly affected with the <hi>sense</hi> of his <hi>mercies;</hi> it's but a kind of <hi>formal comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,</hi> which will never be approved by him who requires <hi>the heart,</hi> and not the <hi>lips</hi> only. And the like may be said of all the other <hi>parts</hi> of <hi>Prayer.</hi> Therefore be careful when thou drawest nigh to God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> to raise up thy soul to the highest pitch of <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>earnestness</hi> thou art able. And because of <hi>thy self</hi> alone thou art not able to do any thing, beseech <hi>God</hi> that he will inflame thy <hi>heart</hi> with this <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fire</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> and when thou hast obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, beware that thou neither <hi>quench</hi> it by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wilful sin, nor let it go out again for want of <hi>stirring</hi> it up and imploying it.</p>

                     <hi>prayers</hi> to right <hi>ends;</hi> And that either in respect of the <hi>prayer</hi> it self, or the things we pray for; <hi>First,</hi> we must <hi>pray</hi> not to gain the <hi>praise</hi> of <hi>devotion</hi> amongst men, like those <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi> Mat. 6. 5.

                  <p n="26">26. The <hi>Ninth</hi> DUTY to God is REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE: That this is a duty to God we are <note place="margin">REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE.</note> taught by the Apostle, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 21. where speaking of <hi>repentance,</hi> he stiles it <hi>repentance towards</hi> God. And there is good reason this should be a duty to <hi>him,</hi> since there is no <hi>sin</hi> we commit but is either <hi>mediately</hi> or <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> against him. For though there be sins both against our selves and our <hi>neighbours,</hi> yet they being forbidden by God, they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>breaches</hi> of his Commandments, and so <hi>sins</hi> against him.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>repentance</hi> is, in short, nothing but a <hi>turning</hi> from <hi>sin</hi> to God, the casting off all <note place="margin">A turning from sin to God.</note> our <hi>former evils,</hi> and in stead thereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly <hi>practising</hi> all those <hi>Christian duties</hi> which God requireth of us.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60285:76"/>
a duty, that without it we certainly <hi>perish,</hi> we have <hi>Christs</hi> word for it, <hi>Luke</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Times for this Duty.</note> and thither I refer the Reader. Only I shall here mind him, that it is not to be lookt upon as a <hi>duty</hi> to be <hi>practised</hi> only at the time of <hi>receiving</hi> the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> For this being the onely <hi>remedy</hi> against the <hi>poyson</hi> of sin, we must renew it as often as we <hi>repeat</hi> our <hi>sins,</hi> that is daily. I mean we must <hi>every day repent</hi> of <note place="margin">Daily.</note> the sins of that <hi>day,</hi> for what <hi>Christ</hi> saith of other <hi>evils,</hi> is true also of this, <hi>sufficient to the day is the evil thereof;</hi> we have <hi>sins</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of <hi>each day</hi> to exercise a <hi>daily repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> and therefore every man must thus <hi>daily</hi> call himself to account.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But as it is in <hi>accounts,</hi> they who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly <note place="margin">At set times.</note> set down their <hi>daily expences,</hi> have yet some set time of <hi>casting</hi> up the whole sum, as at the end of the <hi>week</hi> or <hi>moneth;</hi> so should it also be here, we should set aside some time to <hi>humble</hi> our selves solemnly before God for the sins, not of that <hi>day</hi> onely, but of our <hi>whole lives.</hi> And the <hi>frequenter</hi> these times are, the <hi>better.</hi> For the oftner we thus cast up our <hi>accounts</hi> with God, and see what vast <hi>debts</hi> we are run in to him, the more <hi>humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> shall we think of our selves, and the more shall thirst after his <hi>mercy,</hi> which two are the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60285:77"/>
                     <hi>special</hi> things that must qualifie us for his <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> He therefore that can assign himself one day in the <hi>week</hi> for this purpose, will take a <hi>thriving</hi> course for his <hi>soul.</hi> Or if any mans state of life be so <hi>busie</hi> as not to afford him to do it so often, let him yet come as near to that <hi>frequency</hi> as is possible for him, remembring alwayes, that none of his <hi>worldly</hi> imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments can bring him in near so <hi>gainful</hi> a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn as this <hi>spiritual</hi> one will do, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is very ill husbandry to pursue them to the neglect of this.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Besides these <hi>constant</hi> times, there are <note place="margin">In the time of affliction.</note> likewise <hi>occasional</hi> times for the performance of this duty, such especially are the times of <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity</hi> and <hi>affliction,</hi> for when any such befals us, we are to look on it as a <hi>message</hi> sent from heaven to call us to this duty, and therefore must never neglect it when we are thus sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to it, lest we be of the number of them who <hi>despise the chastisements of the Lord,</hi> Heb. 12. 5.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. There is yet another time of <hi>repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">At death.</note> which in the practice of men hath gotten away the custome from all those, and that is the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>death,</hi> which, it is true, is a time very fit to <hi>renew</hi> our <hi>repentance,</hi> but sure not proper to <hi>begin</hi> it; and it is a most <hi>desperate madness</hi> for men to defer it till then. For to say the <hi>mildest</hi> of it, it is the <hi>venturing</hi> our Souls upon such <hi>miserable uncertainties</hi> as no wise man would trust with any thing of the <hi>least value.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:60285:77"/>
For <hi>first,</hi> I would ask any man that means to <hi>repent</hi> at his <hi>death,</hi> how he knows he shall have an <hi>hours</hi> time for it? do we not daily <note place="margin">The danger of deferring it till then.</note> see men <hi>snatch'd</hi> away in a moment? and who can tell that it shall not be his own case? But <hi>secondly,</hi> suppose he have a more <hi>leisurely</hi> death, that some <hi>disease</hi> give him warning of its <hi>approach,</hi> yet perhaps he will not understand that warning, but will still flatter himself, as very often sick people do, with <hi>hopes</hi> of life to the last: and so his <hi>death</hi> may be <hi>sudden</hi> to him though it comes by never so slow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. But again, <hi>thirdly,</hi> if he do discern his <hi>danger,</hi> yet how is he sure he shall then be able to <hi>repent? Repentance</hi> is a <hi>grace</hi> of God, not at our <hi>command;</hi> and it is just and usual with God, when men have a long time <hi>refused</hi> and <hi>rejected</hi> that <hi>grace,</hi> resisted all his calls and <hi>invitations</hi> to <hi>conversion</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment,</hi> to give them over at last to the <hi>hardness</hi> of their own <hi>hearts,</hi> and not to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them any more of that grace they have so despised. Yet suppose in the <hi>fourth</hi> place, that God in his infinite patience should still continue the <hi>offer</hi> of that <hi>grace</hi> to thee, yet thou that hast resisted, it may be <hi>thirty,</hi> or <hi>forty,</hi> or <hi>fifty</hi> years together, how knowest thou that thou shalt put off that <hi>habit</hi> of resistance upon a <hi>sudden,</hi> and make use of the <note place="margin">The disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of a death bed repentance.</note> 
                     <hi>grace</hi> afforded? It is sure thou hast many more advantages towards the doing it <hi>now</hi> then thou wilt have <hi>then.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="31">31. For <hi>first,</hi> The longer sin hath kept <note place="margin">The custom of sin.</note>

                     <hi>possession</hi> of the heart the harder it will be to drive it out. It is true, if <hi>Repentance</hi> were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a present <hi>ceasing</hi> from the <hi>acts</hi> of sin, the <hi>death bed</hi> were fittest for it, for then we are disabled from committing most sins; but I have formerly shewed you <hi>repentance</hi> contains much more then so, there must be in it a <hi>sincere hatred</hi> of sin, and <hi>love</hi> of God. Now how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely is it that he which hath all his life loved sin, cherisht it in his bosome, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary abhorred God and <hi>goodness,</hi> should in an instant quite change his <hi>affections,</hi> hate that sin he <hi>loved</hi> and love God and <hi>goodness,</hi> which before he utterly hated?</p>
                  <p n="32">32. And <hi>secondly,</hi> The bodily <hi>pains</hi> that attend a <hi>death bed</hi> will <hi>distract</hi> thee and make <note place="margin">Bodily pains</note> thee unable to attend the work of <hi>repentance,</hi> which is a business of such weight and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as will employ all our <hi>powers</hi> even when they are at the <hi>freshest.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="33">33. Consider those <hi>disadvantages</hi> thou <note place="margin">Danger of unsincerity.</note> must then struggle with, and then tell me what <hi>hope</hi> there is thou shalt then do that, which now upon much <hi>easier</hi> terms thou wilt not. But in the <hi>third</hi> place there is a <hi>danger</hi> behind beyond all these, and that is, that the <hi>repentance</hi> which death drives a man to, will not be a true <hi>repentance,</hi> for in such a case it is plain, it is only the fear of <hi>hell</hi> puts him on it, which though it may be a good <hi>beginning,</hi> where there is time after to <hi>perfect</hi> it, yet where it goes alone it can never avail for <hi>Salvation.</hi> Now that <hi>death bed repentances</hi> are often one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:60285:78"/>
of this sort, is too likely when it is observed, that many men who have seemed to <hi>repent,</hi> when they have thought <hi>Death</hi> approaching, have yet, after it hath pleased God to restore them to <hi>health,</hi> been as wicked (perhaps worse) as ever they were before; which shews plainly that there was no <hi>real</hi> change in them, and then surely had such a man died in that <hi>seeming repentance,</hi> God, <hi>who tries the heart,</hi> would not have accepted it, which he saw was <hi>unsincere.</hi> When all these dangers are laid together, it will surely appear a most <hi>desperate</hi> adventure for any man to trust to a <hi>Death-bed repentance.</hi> Nor is it ever the less for that example of the <hi>penitent Thief, Luke</hi> 23. 43. which is by many so much depended on. For it is sure, his case and ours differ wide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he had never heard of Christ before and so more could not be expected of him then to embrace him as soon as he was tendred to him: But we have had him <hi>offered,</hi> nay <hi>prest</hi> upon us from our <hi>Cradles</hi> and yet have <hi>rejected.</hi> But if there were not this <hi>difference,</hi> it is but a <hi>faint</hi> hope can be raised onely from a <hi>single example,</hi> and another we find not in the whole <hi>Bible.</hi> The <hi>Israeli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Yet it is full as reasonable to depend upon this <hi>example</hi> as the other.

                  <p n="34">34. To this duty of repentance, <hi>Fasting</hi> is very proper to be annexed. The Scripture <note place="margin">Fasting.</note> usually joyns them together; among the <hi>Jews</hi> the great day of <hi>atonement</hi> was to be kept with <hi>Fasting,</hi> as you may see by comparing <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 31. with <hi>Isay</hi> 58. 5. and this by Gods e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special appointment. And in the Prophets when the people are called on to repent and <hi>humble</hi> themselves, they are also called on to <hi>Fast.</hi> Thus it is <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Therefore now thus saith the Lord, Turn ye unto me with all your hearts, with fasting, and with weeping,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, so proper hath <hi>Fasting</hi> been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to <hi>Humiliation,</hi> that wee see even <hi>wicked Ahab</hi> would not omit it in his 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 27. Nor the <hi>Heathen Ninivites</hi> in theirs, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3. 5. Nor is it less fit or less accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble since Christ, then it was before him. For we see he supposes it as a duty sometimes to be performed, when he gives directions to avoid <hi>vain-glory</hi> in it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. 6. And also assures us that if it be performed, as it ought, not to <hi>please men,</hi> but <hi>God,</hi> it will surely be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by him. And accordingly we finde it <hi>practised</hi> by the <hi>Saints: Anna,</hi> Luke 2, 37. <hi>Served God with fasting and prayer:</hi> where it is observable, that it is reckoned as a service of God, fit to be joyned with <hi>prayers.</hi> And the Christians of the <hi>first</hi> times were generally very frequent in the <hi>practice</hi> of it. Now though <hi>fasting</hi> be especially <hi>proper</hi> to a time of <hi>humiliation,</hi> yet is it not so restrained to it

but it may be <hi>seasonable,</hi> whensoever we have any <hi>extraordinary</hi> thing to request from <hi>God.</hi> Thus when <hi>Esther</hi> was to endeavour the <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi> of her people from destruction, she and all the <hi>Jews</hi> kept a <hi>solemn</hi> Fast, <hi>Esther</hi> 416. And thus when <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were to be <hi>Ordained Apostles,</hi> there was <hi>fasting</hi> joyned to prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 3. And so it will be very fit for us, whensoever we have need of any <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> directions, or assistance from <hi>God,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning our <hi>temporal</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments, thus to quicken our prayers by <hi>Fasting.</hi> But above all occasions, this of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation</hi> seems most to require it, for besides the advantages of <hi>kindling</hi> our <hi>zeal,</hi> which is never more necessary then when we beg for <hi>pardon</hi> of <hi>sins, Fasting</hi> carries in it somewhat of <hi>revenge,</hi> which is reckoned as a <hi>special</hi> part of <hi>repentance,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 11. For by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Fasting a revenge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ourselvs.</note> our bodies the refreshment of our ordinary food, we do inflict somewhat of <hi>punishment</hi> upon our selves for our former <hi>excesses,</hi> or whatever other sins we at that time accuse our selves of; which is a proper effect of that <hi>indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> which every sinner ought to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himself. And truly he that is so tender of himself that he can never finde in his heart so much as to miss a <hi>meal,</hi> by way of punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his <hi>faults,</hi> shewes he is not much fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len out with himself, for committing them, and so wants that indignation which the Apostle in the forenamed text mentions as a part of true repentance.</p>

35. There is no doubt, but such <hi>Holy reven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> upon our selves for sins are very <hi>acceptable</hi> to God; yet we must not think that either <note place="margin">Such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable with God.</note> those, or any thing else we can do, can make <hi>satisfaction</hi> for our offences, for that nothing but the <hi>blood</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> can do. And therefore on <hi>that,</hi> and not on any of <hi>our</hi> performances <note place="margin">Yet no sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for sins.</note> we must depend for pardon. Yet since that <hi>blood</hi> shall never be <hi>applyed</hi> to any but penitent sinners, we are as much concern'd to <hi>bring forth all the fruits of repentance,</hi> as if our <hi>hopes</hi> depended on them only.</p>
                  <p n="36">36. How <hi>often</hi> this duty of <hi>fasting</hi> is to be performed, we have no direction in Scripture. <note place="margin">Times of fasting.</note> That must be allotted by mens own <hi>piety,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as their <hi>health,</hi> or other <hi>considerations</hi> will allow.

                  <p>§. 1. THIS DUTY to our SELVES is by <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Duty to our</hi> SELVES.</note> 
                     <hi>S. Paul</hi> in the forementioned Text, <hi>Titus</hi> 2. 12. summed up in this <hi>one</hi> word, <hi>Soberly.</hi> Now by <hi>Soberly,</hi> is meant our keeping within those due bounds which God hath set us. My business will therefore be to tell you what are the particulars of this <hi>Sobriety:</hi> And that <hi>first,</hi> in respect of the <hi>soul; secondly,</hi> in respect of the <hi>body:</hi> The <hi>sobriety</hi> of the <hi>soul</hi> stands in right <hi>governing</hi> its <hi>passions</hi> and <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;</hi> and to that are many <hi>Virtues</hi> required. I shall give you the particulars of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>first</hi> of them is <hi>Humility,</hi> which may well have the prime place, not only in respect <note place="margin">Humility.</note> of the excellency of the <hi>virtue,</hi> but also of its usefulness towards the <hi>obtaining</hi> of all the <hi>rest.</hi> This being the foundation on which all others must be built. And he that hopes to gain them without this, will prove but like that foolish builder Christ speaks of, <hi>Luke.</hi> 6. 49. <hi>who built his house on the sand.</hi> Of the <hi>Humility</hi>
                     <pb n="137" facs="tcp:60285:81"/>
towards God I have already spoken, and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the necessity of it, I am now to speak of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, as it concernes our selves, which will be found no lessnecessary then the former.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This <hi>Humility</hi> is of two sorts, the <hi>first</hi> is, the having a mean and low opinion of our selves, the <hi>second</hi> is the being content that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers should have so of us. The first of these is contrary to pride, the other to vain-glory. And that both these are absolutely necessary to Christians, I am now to shew you; which will, I conceive, best be done by laying before you <hi>first,</hi> the sin, <hi>secondly,</hi> the danger, <hi>thirdly,</hi> the contrary vices.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And <hi>first,</hi> for <hi>Pride;</hi> the sin of it is so <note place="margin">The great sin of Pride.</note> great, that it cast the <hi>Angels</hi> out of <hi>heaven,</hi> and therefore if we may judge of sin by the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,</hi> it was not onely the <hi>first,</hi> but the greatest sin that ever the Devil himself hath been guilty of: But we need no better proof of the hainousness of it, then the extream hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness of it to God; which besides that instance of his punishing the Devil, we may frequently finde in the Scriptures, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 5. <hi>Every one that is proud in heart is an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the Lord.</hi> And again, Chap. 6. 16. where there is mention of several things the Lord hates, <hi>a proud look</hi> is set as the first of them: So <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>God resisteth the proud;</hi> and divers other texts there are to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, which shew the great hatred God bears to this sin of Pride. Now since it is certain, God who is all goodness hates nothing, but
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:60285:82"/>
as it is evil, it must needs follow, that where God hates in so great a degree, there must be a great degree of evil.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But <hi>secondly,</hi> PRIDE is not only very <note place="margin">The danger.</note> sinful but very dangerous; and that <hi>first,</hi> in respect of drawing us to other sins; <hi>secondly,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Drawing into other sins.</note> of betraying us to <hi>punishments. First,</hi> Pride draws us to other <hi>sins,</hi> wherein it shews it self indeed to be the direct contrary to humility; for as that is the root of all Vertue, so is this of all Vice. For he that is proud sets himself up as his own God, and so can never submit himself to any other rules or Laws then what he makes to himself. The ungodly, saies the Psalmist, <hi>is so proud that he careth not for God,</hi> Psal. 10. 4. Where you see it is his pride that makes him despise God. And when a man is once come to that, he is prepared for the commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all sins. I might instance in a multitude of particular sins that naturally flow from this of pride; as <hi>first, Anger,</hi> which the wise man sets as the effect of pride, <hi>Pro.</hi> 21. 24. calling it <hi>proud wrath;</hi> secondly, <hi>strife</hi> and <hi>contention;</hi> which he again notes to be the off spring of pride, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 10. <hi>Only by pride cometh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</hi> And both these are indeed most <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> effects of pride. For he that thinks very highly of himself expects much submission and observance from others, and therefore cannot but rage and quarrel whenever he thinks it not sufficiently paid. It would be infinite to mention all the fruits of this bitter root: I shall name but one more, and that is,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:60285:82"/>
that pride not onely betrayes us to many sins, but also makes them incurable in us, for it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the working of all remedies.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Those remedies must either come from <note place="margin">Frustrating of remedies.</note> God or man; if from God, they must be either in the way of meekness and gentleness, or else of sharpness and punishment. Now if God by his goodness essay to lead a provd man to repentance, he quite mistakes Gods meaning, and thinks all the mercies he receives are but the reward of his own desert, and so long 'tis sure he will never think he needs repentance. But if on the other side God use him more sharply, and lay afflictions and punishments upon him, those in a proud heart work no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but murmurings and hatings of God, as if he did him injury in those punishments. As for the remedies that can be used by man, they again must be either by way of <hi>correction,</hi> or <hi>exhortation;</hi> corrections from man will sure never work more on a proud heart, then those from God; for he that can think God unjust in them, will much rather believe it of man. And exhortations will do as little. For let a proud man be admonished though never so mildly and lovingly he looks on it as a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace. And therefore in stead of <hi>confessing</hi> or amending the fault, he falls to reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his reprover as an over-busie or censo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious person, and for that greatest and most precious act of kindness, looks on him as his enemy. And now one that thus stubbornly resists all means of cure must be concluded
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60285:83"/>
in a most dangerous estate.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. But besides this danger of sin, I told you there was another, that of <hi>punishment;</hi> and of <note place="margin">Betraying to punishment.</note> this there will need little proof when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, that God is the proud mans profest enemy, that he hates and resists him, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Texts forecited: And then there can be little doubt, that he which hath so mighty an adversary shall be sure to smart for it. Yet besides this general ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, it may not be amiss to mention some of those <hi>texts</hi> which particularly threaten this sin, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Pride goeth before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and an haughty spirit before a fall:</hi> Again, Prov. 16 5. <hi>Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord, though hand joyn in hand, yet they shall not be unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</hi> The decr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e it seems is unalterable, and whatever endeavours are used to preserve the proud man they are but vain, for he <hi>shall not go unpunished.</hi> And this is very remarkable in the story of <hi>Nebuchadnezzor, Dan.</hi> 4. who though a King, the greatest in the world, yet for his pride was <hi>driven from among men</hi> to dwell and feed with beasts. And it is most frequently seen, that this sin meets with very <hi>extraordinary</hi> judgments even in this life. But if it should not, let not the <hi>proud man</hi> think that he hath escaped <hi>Gods vengeance,</hi> for it is sure there will be a most sad reckoning in the next; for if God spared not the Angels for this sin, but cast them into hell, let no man hope to speed better.</p>
                  <p n="8">
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:60285:83"/>
8. In the <hi>third</hi> place I am to shew you the great <hi>Folly</hi> of this sin; and to do that, it will be necessary to consider the several <note place="margin">The Folly.</note> things whereof men use to be proud; they are of three sorts, either those which we call the <hi>goods</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> or the <hi>goods</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> or the <hi>goods</hi> of <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. By the <hi>Goods</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> I mean <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">In respect of the goods of Nature.</note> 
                     <hi>Strength, Wit,</hi> and the like, and the being proud of any of these is a huge <hi>folly:</hi> For <hi>first,</hi> we are very apt to mistake and think our selves Handsome or Witty when we are not, and then there cannot be a more <hi>Ridiculous Folly</hi> then to be proud of what we have not, and such every one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steems it in another man, though he never supposes it his own case, and so never dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns it in himself. And therefore there is nothing more despiseable amongst all men, then a <hi>Proud Fool,</hi> yet no man that enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains high opinions of his own wit but is in danger to be thus deceived, a mans own judgement of himself being of all others the least to be trusted. But <hi>secondly,</hi> suppose we be not out in judging, yet what is there in any of these <hi>natural</hi> endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which is worth the being Proud? There being scarce any of them which some creature or other hath not in a greater degree then man. How much does the whitenesse of the <hi>Lilly,</hi> and the redness of the <hi>Rose</hi> exceed the white and red of the fairest face? What a
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60285:84"/>
multitude of creatures is there, that far sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass man in <hi>strength</hi> and <hi>swiftness?</hi> And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others there are which as far as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns any useful end of theirs, act much more wisely then most of us; and are therefore of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in Scripture proposed to us by way of Example. It is therefore surely great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness for us to think highly of our selves for such things as are common to us with beasts and plants. But <hi>thirdly,</hi> if they were as excellent as we fancy them, yet they are not at all durable, they are impaired and lost by sundry means; a <hi>phrensie</hi> will destroy the rarest wit, a <hi>sickness</hi> decay the freshest beauty, the greatest strength, or however old <hi>age</hi> will be sure to do all. And therefore to be proud of them is again a folly in this respect. But lastly, whatever they are, we gave them not to our selves. No man can think he did any thing towards the procuring his natural beauty or wit, and so can with no reason value himself for them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. In the <hi>second</hi> place, the folly is as great <note place="margin">The goods <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Fortune.</note> to be proud of the <hi>goods</hi> of <hi>Fortune;</hi> by them I mean wealth and honour, and the like; for it is sure, they adde nothing of true worth to the man, somewhat of outward pompe and bravery they may help him to, but that makes no change in the person. You may load an Ass with money, or deck him with rich Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings, yet still you will not make him a whit the nobler kind of beast by either of them. Then <hi>secondly,</hi> these are things we have no
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:60285:84"/>
hold of, they vanish many times, ere we are aware, he that is rich to day, may be poor to morrow, and then will be the less pitied by all in his poverty, the prouder he was when he was rich. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We have them all, but as <hi>Stewards,</hi> to lay out for our <hi>Masters</hi> use, and therefore should rather think how to make our accounts, then pride our selves in our receipts. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Whatever of these we have, they, as well as the former, are not owing to our selves. But if they be lawfully gotten, we owe them onely to God, whose blessing it is, that maketh rich, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 22. If unlawfully, we have them upon such terms that we have very little reason to brag of them. And thus you see in these several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, the folly of this second sort of pride.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The <hi>third</hi> is that of the <hi>goods of grace;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The goods of grace.</note> that is any vertue a man hath. And here I can not say, but the things are very valuable, they being infinitely more precious, then all the world, yet nevertheless this is of all the rest the highest folly. And that not onely in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going respect, that we help not our selves to it, grace being above all things most immediately Gods Work in us; but especially in this that the being proud of grace, is the fine way to lose it. God, who gives grace to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, will take it from the proud. For if, as we see in the parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 28. the talent was <hi>taken from him</hi> who had onely put it to no use at all, how shall he hope to have it
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60285:85"/>
continued to him that hath put it to so ill, that in stead of trading with it for <hi>God,</hi> hath trafficked with it for <hi>Satan?</hi> And as he will loose the <hi>Grace</hi> for the future, so he will loose all <hi>Reward</hi> of it for the time past. For let a man have done never so many good acts, yet if he be proud of them, that pride shall be charged on him to his destruction, but the good shall never be remembred to his reward. And this proves it to be a most wretched folly to be proud of grace. It is like that of <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that pull those things in pieces they are most fond of, but yet much worse then that of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, for we not only loose the thing (and that the most precious that can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) but we must also be eternally punished for doing so, there being nothing that shall be so sadly reckoned for in the next world as the abuse of Grace, and certainly there can be no greater abuse of it, then to make it serve for an end so directly contrary to that for which it was given, it being given to make us humble, not proud; to magnifie God, not our selves.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Having shewed you thus much of this <note place="margin">Means of Humility.</note> sin, I suppose it will appear very necessary to be eschewed; to which purpose it will <hi>first</hi> be useful to consider what hath been already said concerning it, and that so seriously, as may work in thee not some slight dislike, but a deep and irreconcileable hatred of the sin: <hi>secondly,</hi> to be very watchful over thine own heart that it cherish not any beginnings of it;

And <hi>first,</hi> that this <note place="margin">The sin.</note> is a sin, I need prove no otherwise, then by the words of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 5. 44. <hi>How can ye believe, that receive honour one of another?</hi> Where it appears, that it is not onely a sin but such a one, as hinders the receiving of Christ into the heart, for so <hi>believing</hi> there signifies. This then in the <hi>second</hi> place shews you likewise the great dangerousness of this <note place="margin">The danger.</note> sin, for if it be that, which keeps Christ out of the heart, it is sure it brings infinite danger, since all our safety, all our hope of escaping the wrath to come, stands in receiving him.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:60285:86"/>
But besides the authórity of this text, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience shews, that where ever this sin hath possession it endangers men to fall into any other. For he that so considers the praise of men, that he must at no hand part with it when ever the greatest sins come to be in fashion and credit (as God knows many are now adays) he will be sure to commit them rather then run the disgrace of being too single and precise; I doubt there are many consciences can witness the truth of this, so that I need say no more to prove the <hi>danger</hi> of this sin.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The <hi>third</hi> thing I am to shew, is the <note place="margin">The Folly.</note> 
                     <hi>folly</hi> of it; and that will appear <hi>first,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering what it is we thus hunt after, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a little <hi>air,</hi> a <hi>blast,</hi> the <hi>breath</hi> of men, it brings us in nothing of real advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: for I am made never the wiser nor the better for a mans saying I am wise and good. Besides, if I am commended, it must be either before my face or behind my back; if the former, it is very often flattery, and so the greatest abuse that can be offered, and then I must be very much a fool to be pleased with it. But if it be behind my back, I have not then so much as the pleasure of knowing it; and therefore it is a strange <hi>folly</hi> thus to pursue what is so utterly gainless. But <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,.</hi> it is not only gainless, but painful and uneasie also, He that eagerly seeks praise is not at all master of himself, but must suit all his actions to that end, and in stead of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:60285:86"/>
doing what his own reason and conscience (nay perhaps his worldly conveniency) directs him to, he must take care to do what will bring him in <hi>commendations,</hi> and so enslaves him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to every one that hath but a tongue to commend him. Nay, there is yet a further un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness in it, and that is, when such a man fails of his aym, when he misses the praise, and perhaps meets with the contrary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, (which is no mans lot more often then the vain-glorious, nothing making a man more despised) then what disturbances and disquiets, and even tortures of minde he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? A lively instance of this you have in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 17. 23. who had so much of this upon <hi>Absaloms despising his counsel,</hi> that he chose to rid himself of it, by <hi>hanging</hi> himself. And sure this painfulness that thus attends this sin, is sufficient proof of the <hi>folly</hi> of it. Yet this is not all, it is yet further very hurtful. For if this <hi>vain glory</hi> be concerning any good, or Christian action, it destroys all the fruit of it; he that <hi>prays</hi> or gives <hi>alms</hi> to be <hi>seen of men, Matth.</hi> 6. 2. must take that as his reward, <hi>Verily I say unto you, they have their reward;</hi> they must expect none from God, but the portion of those Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites that <hi>love the praise of men more then the praise of God.</hi> And this is a miserable <hi>folly</hi> to make such an exchange. It is like the <hi>Dog in the Fable,</hi> who seeing in the water the shadow of that meat he held in his mouth, catcht at the shadow, &amp; so let go his meat. Such
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:60285:87"/>
                     <hi>dogs,</hi> such unreasonable creatures are we when we thus let go the eternal rewards of Heaven to catch at a few good words of men. And yet we do not only lose those eternal joyes, but procure to our selves the contrary eternal miseries, which is sure the highest pitch of <hi>folly</hi> and madness. But if the <hi>vain glory</hi> be not concerning any vertuous action, but only some indifferent thing, yet even there also it is very hurtful; for <hi>vain glory</hi> is a sin that wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is placed endangers our eternal estate, which is the greatest of all mischiefs. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the present it is observable, that of all other sins it stands the most in its own light, hinders it self of that very thing it pursues. For there are very few that thus hunt after praise, but they are discerned to do so, and that is sure to <hi>eclipse</hi> whatever praise-worthy thing they do, and brings scorn upon them in stead of reputation. And then certainly we may justly condemn this sin of <hi>folly</hi> which is so ill a manager even of its own design.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. You have seen how wretched a thing <note place="margin">Helps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory.</note> this <hi>vain glory</hi> is in these several respects, the serious consideration whereof may be one good means to subdue it, to which it will be necessary to adde, <hi>first,</hi> a great watchfulness over thy self; observe narrowly whether in any <hi>Christian duty</hi> thou at all considerest the <hi>praise of men,</hi> or even in the most indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent action, look whether thou have not too eager a desire of it, and if thou findest thy self inclined that way, have a very strict eye
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:60285:87"/>
upon it, and where ever thou findest it stirring check and resist it, suffer it not to be the end of thy actions: But in all matters of Religion let thy Duty be the Motive; in all indifferent things of common life let Reason direct thee; and though thou mayest so far consider in those things the opinion of men, as to observe the rules of <hi>common decency,</hi> yet never think any praise that comes in to thee from any thing of that kinde, worth the contriving for: <hi>Secondly,</hi> set up to thy self <hi>another aime, viz.</hi> that of <hi>pleasing</hi> God; let that be thy enquiry when thou goest about any thing, whether it be approved by him? and then thou wilt not be at leisure to consider what praise it will bring thee from men. And surely he that weighs of how much more moment it is to please God, who is able eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to reward us, then men, whose applause can never do us any good, will surely think it reasonable to make the former his only care. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> if at any time thou art praised, do not be much overjoyed with it, nor think a jot the better of thy self; but if it be <hi>Virtue</hi> thou art praised for, remember it was God that wrought it in thee, and give him the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, never thinking any part of it belongs to thee: If it be some <hi>indifferent action,</hi> then remember that it cannot deserve praise, as having no goodness in it: But if it be a <hi>bad one</hi> (as amongst men such are sometimes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest to be commended) then it ought to set thee a trembling in stead of rejoycing, for
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:60285:88"/>
then that woe of our Saviours belongs to thee, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 26. <hi>Woe unto you when men speak well of you, for so did their Fathers to the false Prophets,</hi> and there is not a greater sign of a hardned heart, then when men can make their sins the matter of their glory. In the last place let thy <hi>prayers</hi> assist in the fight with this corruption.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. A <hi>second</hi> VERTUE is MEEKNES, <note place="margin">MEEK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NES.</note> That is a calmness and quietness of spirit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rages and impatiencies of Anger. This Vertue may be exercised either in respect of <hi>God,</hi> or our <hi>neighbour.</hi> That towards God I have already spoken of, under the head of <hi>Humility,</hi> and that towards our neighbour I shall hereafter. All I have here to say of it is, how it becomes a duty to our selves; that it does, in respect of the great <hi>advantage</hi> we reap by it; which, in meer kindness to our <note place="margin">Advantages fit.</note> selves, we are to look after. And to prove that brings us this great <hi>advantage;</hi> I need say no more, but that this <hi>meekness</hi> is that to which Christ hath pronounced a blessing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 5. <hi>Blessed are the meek,</hi> and not only in the next world, but even in this too, <hi>they shall inherit the earth.</hi> Indeed none but the <hi>meek</hi> person hath the true enjoyment of any thing in the world, for the angry, and impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient are like sick people, who we use to say, cannot enjoy the greatest prosperities: For let things be never so fair without, they will raise storms within their own brests. And surely whoever hath either in himself, or others ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60285:88"/>
the great uneasiness of this passion of anger, cannot chuse but think meekness a most pleasant thing.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. Besides, it is also a most honourable thing, for it is that whereby we resemble Christ, <hi>Learn of me,</hi> saith he, <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart,</hi> Matth 11. 28. It is also that whereby we conquer our selves, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our own unrulie passions, which of all <hi>victories</hi> is the greatest and most noble. Lastly, it is that which makes us behave our selves like men, whereas anger gives us the fierceness and wildness of Savage Beasts. And accordingly the one is by all esteemed and loved, whereas the other is hated and abhorred, every man shunning a man in rage as they would a furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beast.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. Farther, yet meekness is the sobriety of the mind, whereas anger is the direct madness, it puts a man wholly out of his own power, and makes him do such things as himself in his sober temper abhors; how many men have done those things in their rage, which they have repented all their lives after? and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore surely as much as a man is more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable then a beast, a sober man then a mad man, so much hath this vertue of <hi>Meekness</hi> the advantage of <hi>Honour</hi> above the contrary vice of Anger.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Again, meekness makes any condition tolerable and <hi>eàsie</hi> to be endured. He that meekly bears any suffering takes off the edge of it that it cannot wound him, whereas he
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60285:89"/>
that frets and rages at it; whets it and makes it much sharper then it would be; nay, in some cases makes that so, which would not else be so at all, as particularly in the case of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful words,</hi> which in themselves can do us no harm, they neither hurt our bodies nor lessen our estates, the only mischief they can do us is to make us angry, and then our anger may do us many more; whereas he that meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly passes them by is never the worse for them, nay, the better; for he shall be rewarded by God for that patience. Much more might be said to recommend this vertue to us, in respect of our <hi>own present advantage,</hi> but I suppose this may suffice to perswade men to esteem of it. The harder matter will be to gain them to the practice of it, wherein men pretend I know not what difficulties of natural consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and the like; yet sure there is no man of so <hi>Cholerick</hi> a temper, but if he did hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily set about it, would find it were not impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible in some good measure to subdue it: But then he must be diligent in using means to that end. Divers of these <hi>Means</hi> there are, I shall mention some few.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. As <hi>first,</hi> The imprinting deep in our <note place="margin">Means of obtaining it.</note> minds the loveliness and benefits of meekness, together with the ugliness and mischiefs of anger. <hi>Secondly,</hi> To set before us the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Christ, who endured all reproaches, yea, torments with perfect patience, that was <hi>led as a sheep to the slaughter,</hi> I say 53. 7. That <hi>when he was reviled, reviled not again; when
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60285:89"/>
he suffered, threatned not,</hi> 1 Peter 2. 23. And if he, <hi>the Lord of glory</hi> suffered thus meekly and unjustly from his own creatures, with what face can we ever complain of any injury done to us? <hi>Thirdly,</hi> To be very watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prevent the very first beginnings of anger, and to that purpose to mortifie all <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peevishness</hi> and <hi>frowardness</hi> of minde, which is a sin in it self, though it proceed no farther, but will also be sure, if it be cherish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to break out into open effects of anger. Therefore when ever thou findest the least rising of it within thee, make as much haste to <hi>check</hi> it as thou wouldest to quench a fire in thy house, but be sure thou bring no fuel to it, by entertaining any thoughts that may increase it. And at such a time especially keep a most strict watch over thy tongue, that it break not out into any angry speeches, for that breath will fan the fire, not only in thine adversary, but thy self too; therefore though thy heart be hot within, stifle the flame, and let it not break out; and the greater the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is, the more earnestly lift up thy heart to God to assist thee to overcome it. <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> Often remember how great punishments thy sins have deserved, and then whether thy sufferings be from God or man, thou wilt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them to be far short of what is due to thee, and therefore wilt be ashamed to be impatient at them.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. The <hi>third Vertue</hi> is CONSIDERA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, <note place="margin">CONSI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON.</note> and this in a most special manner we
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60285:90"/>
owe to our Souls. For without it we shall, as rash unadvised people use to do, rush them into infinite perils. Now this <hi>Consideration</hi> is either of our <hi>State,</hi> or of our <hi>Actions.</hi> By <note place="margin">Of our State.</note> our <hi>State,</hi> I mean what our condition is to God ward, whether it be such that we may reasonably conclude our selves in his favour. This it much concerns us to consider and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, and that not by those easie rules men are apt to frame to themselves, as whether they believe that Christ died for their sins, that they are of the number of the Elect, and shall certainly be saved; if these and the like were all that were required to put us into Gods favour, none but some melancholy person could ever be out of it; for we are apt enough generally to believe comfortably of our selves. But the Rules God hath given us in his Word are those by which we must be tryed at the last day, and therefore are certainly the only safe ones by which to try our selves now. And the sum of those are, That whosoever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues <note place="margin">The Rule by which to try our State.</note> in any <hi>one wilful sin</hi> is not in his favour, nor can if he so <hi>die</hi> hope for any mercy at his hand.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Now it is highly necessary we should consider what our condition is in this respect: for since our life is nothing but a puff of breath in our nostrils, which may for ought we know be taken from us the next minute, it nearly concerns us to know how we are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for another world, that so in case we want at present that oil in our Lamps where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:60285:90"/>
we are to meet the Bridegroom, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 8. we may timely get it, and not for want of it be ever shut out like the foolish Virgins from his presence. The neglect of this <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The danger of Inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</note> hath undone many souls; some by too easie a belief that they were in a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, without considering and trying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by the foregoing Rule, but presuming either upon some slight outward performances, or upon such a false faith as I even now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; others by the wretched careless go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, without so much as asking themselves what their condition is, but hope they shall do as well as their neighbours, and so never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring farther; which wretched carelesness will as certainly undoe the spiritual, as the like would do the temporal estate; yet in that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is wise enough to foresee, that a man that never takes any accounts of his estate to see whether he be worth something or nothing, will be sure to be a beggar in the end. But in this far weightier matter we can generally be thus improvident.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. The <hi>second</hi> thing we are to consider, is <note place="margin">Our Actions.</note> our <hi>Actions,</hi> and those either before or after the doing of them. In the first place, we are to consider before we act, and not to do any <note place="margin">Before we do them.</note> thing rashly or headily; but <hi>first,</hi> to advise with our consciences, whether this be lawful to be done, for he that follows his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, and does every thing which that moves him to, shall be sure to fall into a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of sins. Therefore consider soberly and
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:60285:91"/>
be assured of the lawfulness of the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou venture to do it. This advisedness is in all worldly things accounted so necessary a part of wisdom, that no man is accounted wise without it; a rash man we look upon as the next degree to a fool: And yet it is sure there is not so much need of looking about us in any thing as in what concerns our souls, and that not only in respect of the great value of them above all things else, but also in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the great danger they are in, as hath been shewed more at large in the beginning of the Treatise.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to consider the actions when they are <hi>past</hi> also, that is, we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine <note place="margin">After they are done.</note> whether they have been such as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable by the Laws of Christ. This is very necessary whether they be good or bad; if they be good, the recalling them helpeth us to the comfort of a <hi>good conscience,</hi> and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort again encourageth us to go on in the like; and besides, it stirs us up to thankfulness to God, by whose grace alone we were enabled to do them. But if they be bad, then it is especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally necessary that we thus examine them, for without this it is impossible we should ever come to amendment; for unless we observe them to have been amiss, we can never think it needful to amend, but shall still run on from one <hi>wickedness to another,</hi> which is the greatest curse any man can lie under.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. The oftener therefore we use this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:60285:91"/>
that any of our sins shall escape our knowledge. It is much to be wisht that every man should thus <hi>every night try the actions of the day,</hi> that so if he have done any thing amiss he may soon check himself for it, and settle his resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions against it, and not let it grow on to a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit and course. And that he may also early beg Gods pardon, which will the easier be had the sooner it is asked, every delay of that being a great increase of the sin. And surely whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver means to take an account of himself at all, will find this the easier course, it being much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to do it so a little at a time, and while pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages are fresh in his memory, then to take the account of a long time together. Now if it be considered, that every wilful sin must have a particular repentance before it can be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Danger of omitting it.</note> me thinks men should tremble to sleep without that repentance; for what assurance hath any man that lies down in his bed that he shall ever rise again? and then how dangerous is the condition of that man that sleeps in an unrepented sin? The weighing of these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Motives may be a means, by Gods blessing, to bring us to the practice of this duty of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration</hi> in all the parts of it.</p>

This none can doubt of that considers what a multitude of fears and jealousies, cares and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions there are that attend <hi>ambition</hi> in its progress, besides the great and publick ruines that usually befal it in the end.

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is contrary to <hi>Covetousness;</hi> this the Apostle witnesseth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 5. <hi>Let</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness.</note> 
                     <hi>your conversation be without</hi> covetousness, <hi>and be content with such things as ye have;</hi> where you see contentedness is set as the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>covetousness.</hi> But of this there needs
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:60285:93"/>
no other proof then common experience; for we see the covetous man never thinks he hath enough, and therefore can never be content; for no man can be said to be so that thirsts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter any thing he hath not. Now that you may see how excellent and necessary a virtue this is that secures us against <hi>covetousness,</hi> it will not be amiss a little to consider the nature of that sin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That it is a very great crime, is most <note place="margin">Covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness contrary to our duty to God.</note> certain, for it is contrary to the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all good life; I mean those <hi>three great Duties,</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> to our <hi>Selves,</hi> to our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. First,</hi> It is so contrary to our Duty to God, that Christ himself tells us, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 13. <hi>We cannot serve God and Mammon:</hi> he that sets his heart upon wealth, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily take it off from God. And this we daily see in the <hi>covetous</hi> mans practice, he is so eager in the gaining of riches, that he hath no time or care to perform duty to God; let but a good bargain, or opportunity of gain come in his way, <hi>Prayer,</hi> and all duties of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, must be neglected to attend it. Nay, when the committing the greatest sin against God may be likely either to get or save him ought, his love of wealth quickly perswades him to commit it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is contrary to the Duty we <note place="margin">To our Selves.</note> owe our <hi>Selves,</hi> and that both in respect of our Souls and Bodies. The covetous man despises his Soul, sells that to eternal destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for a little pelf: for so every man does
<pb facs="tcp:60285:93"/>
that by any unlawful means seeks to enrich himself, Nay, though he do it not by unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful means, yet if he have once set his heart upon wealth, he is that covetous person up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom the Apostle hath pronounced, <hi>That he shall not enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 10. Nor doth he only offend against his Soul but his Body too. For he often denies that those necessary refreshments it wants, and for which his wealth (as far as it concerns himself) was given him. This is so constantly the custome of rich Misers that I need not prove it to you.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In the <hi>third</hi> place, <hi>Covetousness</hi> is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">To our neighbours.</note> to the duty we owe to our <hi>neighbours.</hi> And that in both the parts of it, Justice and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: he that loves money immoderately, will not care whom he cheats and defrauds so he may bring in gain to himself; and from hence spring those many tricks of deceit and couse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, so common in the world. As for Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that is never to be hoped for from a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man who dreads the lessening of his own heaps more then the starving of his poor brother. You see how great a sin this is, that we may well say of it as the Apostle doth, 1 Tim. 6. 10. <hi>The love of money is the root of all evil.</hi> And it is not much less uneasie then wicked, for between the care of getting and the fear of losing, the covetous man enjoyes no quiet hour. Therefore every man is deeply concerned, as he tenders his happiness either in this world or the next, to guard
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:60285:94"/>
himself against this sin, which he can no way do, but by possessing his heart with this vertue of <hi>contentedness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, it is contrary to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Contented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness contrary to envy.</note> for he that is content with his own condition, hath no temptation to <hi>envy</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: How unchristian a sin this of <hi>envy</hi> is, shall hereafter be shewed: At the present, I need say no more, but that it is also a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie one, it frets and gnaws the very heart of him that harbors it. But the worse this sin is, the more excellent still is this grace of <hi>content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,</hi> which frees us from it. I suppose I have said enough to make you think this a very lovely, and desirable Vertue. And sure it were not impossible to be gain'd by any, that would but observe these few directions.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>First,</hi> To consider, that whatever our estate and condition in any respect be, it is <note place="margin">Helps to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>edness.</note> that which is alotted us by God, and therefore is certainly the best for us, he being much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to judge for us, then we for our selves; and therefore to be displeased at it, is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to say, we are wiser then he. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider thorowly the vanity of all worldly things, how very little there is in them, while we have them, and how uncertain we are to keep them; but above all, in how little stead they will stand us at the day of death or judgement, and then thou canst not think any of them much worth the desiring, and so wilt not be discontented for want of them. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Suffer not thy fancy to run on things
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:60285:94"/>
thou hast not: many have put themselves out of love with what they have, only by think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what they want. He that sees his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour possess somewhat, which himself hath not, is apt to think how happy he should be, if he were in that mans condition, and in the mean time never thinks of enjoying his own, which yet perhaps in many respects may be much happier, then that of his neighbours which he so much admires. For we look but upon the <hi>outside</hi> of other mens conditions, and many a man that is envied by his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as a wonderful happy person, hath yet some <hi>secret trouble,</hi> which makes him think much otherwise of himself. Therefore ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver compare thy condition in any thing with those thou countest more prosperous then thy self, but rather do it with those thou knowest more unhappy, and then thou wilt finde cause to rejoyce in thine own portion. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Consider how far thou art from deserving any good thing from God, and then thou canst not but with <hi>Jacob, Gen</hi> 32. 10. confess, that thou art <hi>not worthy of the least of those mercies</hi> thou enjoyest; and in stead of murmuring that they are no more, wilt see reason to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire, and praise the bounty of God, that they are so many. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> be often thinking of the joyes laid up for thee in Heaven; look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that as thy home, on this world, only as an <hi>Inne,</hi> where thou art fain to take up in thy passage; and then as a Traveller expects not the same conveniences at an <hi>Inne,</hi> that he hath
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60285:95"/>
at home, so thou hast reason to be content with what ever entertainment thou findst here knowing thou art upon thy journey to a place of <hi>infinite happiness,</hi> which will make an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant amends for all the uneasiness, and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thou canst suffer in the way. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Pray to God, from whom all good things do come, that he will to all his other blessings, adde this of a contented minde, without which thou canst have no taste or relish of any other.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. A <hi>fifth Duty</hi> is DILIGENCE: This is made up of two parts, <hi>watchfulness,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">DILI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GENCE.</note> and both these we owe to our Souls.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>First, Watchfulness,</hi> in observing all <note place="margin">Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness against sin.</note> the dangers that threaten them. Now since nothing can endanger our Souls, but sin, this <hi>watchfulness</hi> is principally to be imployed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that: And as in a <hi>besieged City,</hi> where there is any weak part, there it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to keep the strongest guard; so it is here, whereever thou findest thy inclinations such, as are most likely to betray thee to sin, there it concernes thee to be especially <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> Observe therefore carefully to <hi>what sins</hi> either thy natural temper, thy company, or thy course of life do particularly incline thee, and <hi>watch</hi> thy self very narrowly in those; Yet do not so lay out all thy care on those, as to leave thy self open to any other, for that may give <hi>Satan</hi> as much advantage on the other side; but let thy <hi>watch</hi> be general, against all sin, though in a special manner against those, which are like oftenest to assault thee.</p>
                  <p n="12">
                     <pb n="165" facs="tcp:60285:95"/>
12. The <hi>second</hi> part of <hi>diligence,</hi> is <hi>indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,</hi> or <hi>labour,</hi> and this also we owe to our Souls, for without it they will as little prosper <note place="margin">Industry in improving gifts.</note> as that vineyard of the sluggard, which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> describes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 30. For there is a husbandry of the Soul, as well as of the estate, and the end of the one, as of the other, is the increasing, and <hi>improving</hi> of its riches. Now the riches of the Soul are either Natural, or Divine. By the natural I mean its faculties of reason, wit, memory, and the like; by the Divine I mean the graces of God, which are not the Souls natural portion, but are given immediately by God, and both these we are to take care to improve, they being both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents intrusted to us for that purpose.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. The way of improving the <hi>natural</hi> is <note place="margin">Of Nature.</note> by imploying them so, as may bring in most honour to God: we must not let them lye <hi>idle</hi> by us, through sloth, neither must we overwhelm them with intemperance, and bruitish pleasures, which is the case of too many, but we must employ them, and set them on work. But then we must be sure it be not in the Devils service, like many, who set their wit only to the profaning of God, or cheating their neighbours, and stuff their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories with such filthiness, as should never once enter their thoughts; our use of them must be such, as may bring in most glory to God, most benefit to our neighbours, and may best fit us to make our accounts, when God shall come to reckon with us for them.</p>
                  <p n="14">
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:60285:96"/>
14. But the other part of the <hi>Soules riches,</hi> is yet more precious, that is <hi>grace,</hi> and of this we must be especially careful, to husband, and <note place="margin">Of Grace.</note> improve it. This is a duty expresly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us by the Apostle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Grow in grace.</hi> And again, in the first Chapter of that <hi>Epistle,</hi> verse 5. <hi>Give all diligence to adde to your faith vertue, and to vertue knowledge,</hi> &amp;c. Now the especial means of improving <hi>grace</hi> is by imploying it, that is, by doing those things for the enabling of us whereunto it was given us: This is a sure means, not only in respect of that easiness, which a custome of any thing brings in the doing of it, but prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, as it hath the promise of God, who hath promised, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 29. That <hi>to him that hath</hi> (that is, hath made use of what he hath) <hi>shall be given, and he shall have abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.</hi> He that diligently and faithfully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys the first beginnings of <hi>grace,</hi> shall yet have more, and he that in like manner hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands that more, shall yet have a greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; so that what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of temporal riches, is also true of spiritual, <hi>The hand of the diligent maketh rich.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="15">15. Therefore whenever thou findest any <note place="margin">To improve good motions</note> good motion in thy heart, remember that is a season for this spiritual husbandry: If thou have but a check of conscience against any sin, thou livest in, drive that on till it come to a hatred, and then that hatred, till it come to resolution, then from that resolution, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to some endeavours against it. Do this
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:60285:96"/>
faithfully, and sincerely, and thou shalt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly finde the grace of God assisting thee, not only in every of these steps, but also en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling thee to advance still higher, till thou come to some victory over it. Yet to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry thou must not fail to adde thy prayers also, there being a promise, that God will <hi>give the holy Spirit to them that ask it,</hi> Matth. 7. 11. And therefore they that ask it not, have no reason to expect it. But it must be asked with such an earnestness, as is some way answerable to the value of the thing, which being infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more precious then all the world, both in respect of his own worth, and its usefulness to us, we must beg it with much more zeal and earnestness, then all temporal blessings, or else we shew our selves despisers of it.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Having directed you to the means of <hi>improving grace,</hi> I shall to quicken you to it, mention the great <hi>danger</hi> of the <hi>contrary;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The danger of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</note> And that is not as in other things, the losing only those further degrees, which our indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry might have helped us to, but it is the losing even of what we already have; <hi>For from him that hath not</hi> (that is again hath not made use of what he hath) <hi>shall be taken away even that which he hath,</hi> Matth. 25. 29. God will withdraw the grace, which he sees so neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, as we see in that Parable, the Talent <hi>was taken from him that</hi> had onely <hi>hid it in a Napkin,</hi> and had brought in no gaine to his <hi>Lord.</hi> And this is a most sad punishment, the greatest that can befal any man, before he
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60285:97"/>
comes to Hell, indeed it is some kind of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taste of it, it is the delivering him up to the power of the Devil, and it is the banishing him from the face of God, which are not the least parts of the misery of the damned. And it is also the binding a man over to that fuller portion of wretchedness in another world; For that is the last doom of the <hi>unprofitable servant,</hi> Matth. 25. 30. <hi>Cast ye the unprofitable servant into outer darkness, there shall be weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gnashing of teeth.</hi> You see there are no light <hi>dangers</hi> that attend this neglect of grace, and therefore if we have any love, nay any common pity to our Souls, we must set our selves to this industry. I have now done with those VERIUES, which respect our SOULS. I come now to those which concern our BODIES.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The first of which is <hi>Chastity,</hi> or <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">CHASTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY.</note> which may well be set in the front of the duties we owe to our bodies, since the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 18. sets the contrary as the espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial sin against them, <hi>He that committeth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, sinneth against his own body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="18">18. Now this vertue of <hi>chastity</hi> consists in a perfect abstaining from all kinds of unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; not only that of adultery, and forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but all other more unnatural sorts of it, committed either upon our selves, or with any other. In a word, all acts of that kinde are utterly against Chastity, save onely in <hi>lawful marriage.</hi> And even there men are not to think themselves let loose to please
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60285:97"/>
their bruitish appetites, but are to keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves within such rules of moderation, as agree to the end of marriage, which being these two, the begetting of Children, and the avoiding of fornication, nothing must be done which may hinder the first of these ends; and the second aiming onely at the subduing of lust, the keeping men from any sinful effects of it, is very contrary to that end to make marriage an occasion of heightning, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming it.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But this vertue of <hi>chastity</hi> reacheth not only to the restraining of the grosser act, but <note place="margin">Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the very lowest degrees.</note> to all lower degrees; it sets a guard upon our eyes, according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 28. <hi>He that looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart;</hi> and upon our <hi>hand</hi> as appears by what Christ adds in that place, <hi>If thy hand offend thee, cut it off:</hi> so also upon our <hi>tongues,</hi> that they speak no immodest or filthy words, <hi>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth,</hi> Ephes. 4. 29. Nay upon our ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoughts, and fancies, we must not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain any foul or filthy desires, nor so much as the imagination of any such thing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that forbears the grosser act, and yet allows himself in any of these, it is to be suspected that it is rather some outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, that keeps him from it, then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of the sin. For if it were that, it would keep him from these too, these being sins also, and very great ones in Gods sight.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60285:98"/>
Besides, he that lets himself loose to these, puts himself in very great danger of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it being much more easier to abstain from all, then to secure against the one, when the other is allowed. But above all, it is to be considered that even these lower degrees are such as make men very odious in Gods eyes who seeth the heart, and loves none that are not pure there.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. The <hi>loveliness</hi> of this Virtue of <hi>Chasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of it.</note> needs no other way of describing then by considering the loathsomeness and <hi>mischiefs</hi> of the contrary sin, which is, <hi>first,</hi> very bruitish; those desires are but the same that the beasts have; and then how far are they sunk below the nature of men, that can boast of their sins of that kind as of their special excellency? when if that be the measure, a <hi>Goat</hi> is the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent creature. But indeed they that eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursue this part of Beastiality do often leave <note place="margin">To the Soul.</note> themselves little, besides their humane shape, to difference them from beasts: This sin so clouds the understanding, and defaceth the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Soul. Therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> very well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the young man that was going to the harlots house, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7. 22. <hi>He goeth after her as an Ox goeth to the slaughter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. Nor <hi>secondly,</hi> are the effects of it better to the body then to the mind. The many foul <note place="margin">To the Body.</note> and filthy, besides <hi>painful</hi> diseases, which often follow this sin, are sufficient witnesses how mischievous it is to the <hi>body.</hi> And alas, how many are there that have thus made
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60285:98"/>
themselves the <hi>Divels Martyrs?</hi> Suffered such torments in the pursuit of this sin, as would exceed the invention of the greatest tyrant? Surely they that pay thus dear for damnation, very well deserve to enjoy the purchase.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. But <hi>thirdly,</hi> Besides the natural fruits of this sin, it is attended with very great and <note place="margin">The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God a gainst it.</note> heavy Judgments from God; the most extra ordinary and miraculous Judgement that ever befel any place, <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Brimstone from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> upon <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> was for this sin of <hi>uncleanness.</hi> And many examples like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of Gods vengeance may be observed on particular persons, for this sin. The incest of <hi>Amnon</hi> cost him his life, as you may read, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. <hi>Zimrie</hi> and <hi>Cozbi</hi> were slain in the very act, <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 8. And no person that commits the like, hath any assurance it shall not be his own case. For how secretly soever it be committed, it cannot be hid from God, who is the sure avenger of all such wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. Nay, God hath very particularly threatned this sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>If any man defile the Temple of God, him shall God destroy.</hi> This sin of <hi>uncleanness</hi> is a kind of <hi>sacriledge,</hi> a polluting those bodies, which God hath chosen for his <hi>Temples,</hi> and therefore no wonder, if it be thus heavily punished.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>Lastly,</hi> This sin shuts us out from the <note place="margin">It shuts out from Heav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60285:99"/>
it is <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 19 and so again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 9. If we will thus pollute our selves we are fit company only for those black spirits, the Divel and his Angels; and therefore with them we must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect our portion, where our flames of <hi>lust</hi> shall end in flames of <hi>fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. All this layed together, may surely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend <note place="margin">Helps to Chastity.</note> the virtue of <hi>Chastity</hi> to us, for the preserving of which we must be very careful, <hi>first,</hi> to check the <hi>beginnings</hi> of the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to cast away the very <hi>first fancy</hi> of lust with indignation, for if you once fall to parley and talk with it, it gains still more upon you, and then it will be harder to resist; therefore your way in this temptation is to flie rather then fight with it. This is very necessary, not only that we may avoid the danger of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to act the sin, but also in respect of the present fault of entertaining such fancies, which of it self, though it should never pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, is, as hath been shewed, a great abomination before God. <hi>Secondly,</hi> have a special care to <hi>flye Idleness,</hi> which is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per soil for these filthy weeds to grow in; and keep thy self always busied in some innocent or virtuous employment, for then these fancies will be less apt to offer themselves. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> never suffer thy self to recal any unclean passages of thy former life with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, for that is to act over the sin again, and will be so reckoned by God; nay, perhaps thus deliberately to think of it may be a greater guilt then a rash acting of it.

this both shews thy heart to be set upon fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiness, and is also a preparation to more acts of it. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> forbear the company of such light and wanton persons as either by the filthiness of their discourse, or any other means, may be a snare to thee. <hi>Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> pray earnestly that God would give thee the Spirit of <hi>Purity,</hi> especially at the time of any present temptation.

25. The <hi>second</hi> VIRTUE that concerns our bodies is TEMPERANCE: And the exercises of that are divers, as first, <hi>temperance</hi> in <hi>Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">TEMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE.</note> secondly, In <hi>Drinking,</hi> thirdly, in <hi>Sleep,</hi> fourthly in <hi>Recreation,</hi> fifthly, in <hi>apparel.</hi> I shall speak of them severally; and first of <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> in <hi>eating.</hi> This <hi>temperance</hi> is observed <note place="margin">In <hi>Eating.</hi>
                     </note> when our eating is agreeable to those <hi>ends</hi> to which eating is by God and Nature designed; <note place="margin">Ends of eating.</note> those are <hi>first,</hi> the being, <hi>secondly,</hi> the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of our bodies.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Man is of such a frame that <hi>Eating</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Preserving of life.</note> becomes necessary to him for the preserving his life, hunger being a natural disease which will prove deadly if not prevented, and the onely Physick for it is <hi>Eating,</hi> which is therefore become a necessary means of keeping us alive. And that is the first end of eating; and as men use not to take Physick for pleasure, but remedy, so neither should they eat.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. But <hi>secondly,</hi> God hath been so boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful as to provide not only for the being, <note place="margin">Of Health.</note> but the <hi>well being</hi> of our bodies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are not tyed to such strictness, that we may eat no more then will just keep us from starving, but we may also eat whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver either for kind or quantity most tends to the <hi>health</hi> and welfare of them: Now that eating which is agreeable to these ends, is within the bounds of <hi>temperance,</hi> as on the contrary whatsoever is contrary to them, is a transgression against it; he therefore that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:60285:100"/>
sets up to himself other ends of eating, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pleasing of his taste, (what is yet worse) the pampering of his body that he may the better serve his lust, he directly thwarts and crosses these ends of Gods; for he that hath those aims doth that which is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to health, yea, to life it self, as appears by the many diseases and untimely deaths which surfetting and uncleanness daily bring on men.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. He therefore that will practice this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <hi>Temperance,</hi> must neither eat so much, <note place="margin">Rules of Temperance in Eating.</note> nor of any such sorts of meat (provided he can have other) as may be hurtful to his health: what the sorts or quantities shall be is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to set down, for that differs according to the several constitutions of men; some men may with temperance eat a great deal, because their stomacks require it, when another may be guilty of <hi>intemperance</hi> in eating but half so much, because it is more then is useful to him. And so also for the sort of meat, it may be niceness and <hi>luxury</hi> for some to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in them, when yet some degree of it may be <hi>necessary</hi> to the infirmities of a weak stomach, which not out of wantonness but disease cannot eat the courser meats. But I think it may in general be said, That to health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bodies the plainest meats are generally the most wholsome, but every man must in this be left to judge for himself; and that he may do it aright, he must be careful that he never suffer himself to be enslaved to his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:60285:101"/>
for that will be sure to satisfie it self, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of health or life.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. To secure him the better let him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, <note place="margin">Means of it.</note> 
                     <hi>First,</hi> How unreasonable a thing it is that the whole body should be subjected to this one Sense of <hi>Tasting,</hi> that it must run all hazards only to please that. But it is yet much more so that the diviner part, the <hi>Soul,</hi> should also be thus enslaved; and yet thus it is in an intemperate person, his very soul must be sacrificed to this Brutish appetite; for the sin of intemperance, though it be acted by the Body, yet the Soul must share in the eternal punishment of it. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Consider how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme short and <hi>vanishing</hi> this pleasure is, it is gone in a moment, but the pains that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the excess of it are much more durable, and then surely it agrees not with that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon reason, wherewith, as men, we are indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to set our hearts upon it. But then in the <hi>third</hi> place, it agrees yet worse with the temper of a <hi>Christian,</hi> who should have his heart so purisied and refined with the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of those higher and spiritual joyes he looks for in another world, that he should very much despise these gross and <hi>brutish plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi> which beasts are as capable of as we, and to them we may well be counted to leave them, it being the highest their natures can reach to; but for us who have so much more <hi>excellent hopes,</hi> it is an intolerable shame that we should account them as any part of our happiness. <hi>Lastly,</hi> The sin of <hi>Gluttony</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:60285:101"/>
is so great and <hi>dangerous,</hi> that Christ thought fit to give an especial warning against it, <hi>take heed to your selves that your hearts be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with surfetting, &amp;c.</hi> Luk. 21. 34. And you know what was the end of the <hi>rich glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> Luk. 16.

                  <p>§. 1. THe <hi>second</hi> is <hi>Temperance</hi> in <hi>Drinking,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Temperance in Drinking.</note> and the ends of eating and <hi>drinking</hi> being much the same, I can give no other direct rules in this, then what were given in the former, to wit, that we drink neither of such sorts of liquor, nor in such quantities as may not agree with the <hi>right ends of drinking,</hi> the preserving of our lives and healths: Only in this there will be need of putting in <hi>one Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> for our understandings being in more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be hurt by drinking then meat, we must rather care to keep that safe, and rather not <hi>drink</hi> what we might safely in respect of our healths, if it be in danger to distemper our
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:60285:102"/>
reason. This I say because it is possible some mens brains may be so weak that their heads cannot bear that ordinary quantity of <hi>drink</hi> which would do their bodies no harm. And whoever is of this temper must strictly abstain from that degree of <hi>drink,</hi> or that sort of it which he finds hath that effect, yea, though it do in other respects appear not only safe but useful to his health For though we are to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our healths, yet we are not to do it by a sin, as drunkenness most certainly is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But alas! of those multitudes of <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">False ends of drinking.</note> we have in the world, this is the case but of very few, most of them going far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what their health requires, yea, or can bear, even to the utter destruction thereof. And therefore it is plain men have set up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves some <hi>other ends of drinking</hi> then those al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable ones forementioned; it may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss a little to explain what they are, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to shew the unreasonableness of them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>first,</hi> and most owned, is that which <note place="margin">Good Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship.</note> they call <hi>Good fellowship;</hi> one man drinks to keep another company at it. But I would ask such a one, Whether if that man were drinking rank poyson he would pledge him for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny? If he say he would not, I must tell him, that by the very same, nay, far <hi>greater reason,</hi> he is not to do this. For <hi>immoderate drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> is that very poyson; perhaps it doth not always work death immediately (yet there want not many instances of its having done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that, very many having died in their <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:60285:102"/>
fit) but that the custome of it does usually bring men to their ends, is past doubt, and therefore though the poyson work slowly, yet it is still poyson. But however it doth at the present work that which a wise man would more abhor then death; it works madness, and frenzy turns the man into a beast, by drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that reason which should difference him from one. Certainly the effects of drink are such, that had being drunk been first enjoyned as a punishment, we should have thought him a more then ordinary Tyrant that had invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A <hi>second</hi> end of drinking is said to be the maintaining of friendship and <hi>kindness</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <note place="margin">Preserving of kindness.</note> men. But this is strangely unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that men should do that towards the maintaining of friendship, which is really the greatest mischief that can be done to any man. Did ever any think to befriend a man by help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to destroy his estate, his credit, his life? Yet he that thus drinks with a man does this and much more, he ruines his reason, yea, his soul, and yet this must be called the way of preserving of friendship; this is so ridiculous that one would think none could own it but when he were actually drunk. But besides, alas, experience shews us, that this is fitter to beget quarrels then preserve kindness, as the many <hi>drunken brawls</hi> we every day see, with the wounds, and sometimes <hi>murders</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them, do witness.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A <hi>third</hi> end is said to be the <hi>chearing of <note place="margin">Chearing the spirits.</note>
                        <pb n="180" facs="tcp:60285:103"/>
their spirits,</hi> making them merry and jolly. But sure if the mirth be such that reason must be turned out of doors before it begin, it will be very little worth; one may say with <hi>Solomon, Eccl.</hi> 2. 2. <hi>The laughter of such fools is madness.</hi> And sure they that will be drunk to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in this temper, must by the same reason be glad of a Frenzie, if they could but be sure it would be of the merry sort. But little do these merry folks think what sadness they are all this while heaping up to themselves, often in this world, when by some <hi>mad pranks,</hi> they play in their jollity, they bring mischief upon themselves, but however certainly in another, where this mirth will be sadly reckon'd for.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. A <hi>fourth</hi> end is said to be the <hi>putting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Putting away cares.</note> 
                     <hi>of cares;</hi> but I shall ask what those <hi>cares</hi> are? be they such as should be put away? perhaps they are some <hi>checks</hi> and remorses of <hi>conscience,</hi> which must be thus charmed. And I doubt this hath proved too effectual with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to the laying them asleep: But this is the wickedst folly in the world; for if thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est not these checks to have something consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in them, why do they trouble thee. But if thou do, it is impossible thou canst hope this can long secure thee from them. Thou maist thus stop their mouthes for a while, but they will one day cry the louder for it. Suppose a <hi>Thief</hi> or a <hi>Murderer</hi> knew he were pursued to be brought to justice, would he think you to put away the fear of being hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, fall to drinking, and in the mean time take
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:60285:103"/>
no care for his escape; or would you not think him desperately mad if he did? Yet this is the very case here, thy conscience tells thee of thy danger, that thou must ere long be brought before <hi>Gods Judgement Seat;</hi> and is it not mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness for thee instead of endeavouring to get thy pardon, to drink away the thought of thy dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But in the <hi>second</hi> place, suppose these cares be some worldly ones, and such as are fit to be put away; then for shame do not so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace thy Reason, thy Christianity, as not to let them be as forcible to that end as a little drink. Thy Reason will tell thee it is in vain to care, where care will bring no advantage: and thy Christianity will direct thee to one on whom thou mayest <hi>safely cast all thy cares, for he careth for thee,</hi> 1 Pet. 5. 7. And therefore unless thou meanest to renounce being both a man and a Christian, never betake thee to this pitiful shift to rid thee of thy cares. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, this will not do the deed neither; for though it may at the present, whilst thou art in the height of the drunken fit, keep thee from the sense of thy cares, yet when that is over, they will return again with greater violence; and if thou have any conscience, bring a <hi>new care</hi> with them, even that which ariseth from the guilt of so foul a sin.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. A <hi>fifth</hi> end is said to be the <hi>passing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of time.</hi> This though it be as unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as any of the former, yet by the way it serves to reproach idleness, which is, it seems, so bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome a thing, that even this <hi>vilest employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
                     <pb n="182" facs="tcp:60285:104"/>
is preferred before it. But this is in many a very false plea. For they often spend time at the pot not only when they have nothing else to do, but even to the neglect of their most necessary business. However it is in all a most unreasonable one, for there is no man but he may finde somewhat or other to imploy himself in. If he have little worldly business of his own, he may yet do somewhat to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of others; but however there is no man but hath a <hi>Soul,</hi> and if he will look carefully to that he need not complain for <hi>want of business,</hi> where there are so many corruptions to <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie,</hi> so many inclinations to <hi>watch</hi> over, so many temptations (whereof this of <hi>drunkenness</hi> is not the least) to <hi>resist;</hi> The <hi>Graces</hi> of God to improve and stir up, and former <hi>neglects</hi> of all these to <hi>lament,</hi> sure there can never want suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient imployment; for all these require time, and so men at their deaths find; for then those that have all their lives made it their business to drive away their time, would then give all the world to redeem it. And sure where there is much leisure from wordly <hi>affairs,</hi> God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects to have the more time thus imployed in Spiritual exercises. But it is not likely those <hi>meaner</hi> sort of persons, to whom this book is intended, will be of the number of those that have much leisure, and therefore I shall no farther insist on it, only I shall say this, that what degrees of leisure they at any time have, it concerns them to imploy to the benefit of their souls, and not to bestow it to the ruine
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:60285:104"/>
of them, as they do, who spend it in drinking.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. A <hi>sixth</hi> end is said to be the preventing of that <hi>reproach</hi> which is by the world cast <note place="margin">Preventing reproach.</note> on those that will in this be stricter then their neighbours; but in answer to this, I shall <hi>first</hi> ask, What is the harm of such reproach? sure it cannot equal the least of those mischiefs drunkenness betrayes us to. Nay, if we will take our Saviours words it is a happiness, <hi>Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,</hi> saith he, <hi>are ye when men shall revile you, and say all manner of evil against you for my sake,</hi> Mat. 5. 11. And <hi>S. Peter</hi> tells us, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 4. 14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Christ happy are ye:</hi> and sure to be reproached for <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> to any command of Christs, is to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached for his Name. Secondly,</hi> Let it be remembred that at our <hi>Baptism</hi> we solemnly <hi>renounced the world;</hi> and shall we now so far consider it, as for a sew scoffs of it to run our selves on all the temporal evils before mentioned; and which is much worse, the wrath of God and eternal destruction? But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If you fear reproach, why do ye do that which will bring reproach upon you from all wise and good men, whose opinion alone is to be regarded? And it is certain drinking is the way to bring it on you from all such. And to comfort thy self against that, by thinking thou art still applauded by the foolish and worst sort of men, is as if all the <hi>mad men</hi> in the world should agree to count themselves the only sober persons, and all others mad, which yet sure will never make
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60285:105"/>
them the less mad, nor others the less sober. <hi>Lastly,</hi> consider the heavie doom Christ hath pronounc'd on those that are ashamed of him, and so are all those that for fear of reproach shall shrink from their obedience to him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 38. <hi>Whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of the Father with the holy Angels.</hi> There is none but will at that day desire to be owned by Christ: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will not here own him; that is, cleave fast to his commands, notwithstanding all the scornes, nay, persecutions of the world, shall then certainly be cast off by him. And he that will adventure thus to maintain his credit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a company of Fools and Madmen, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves well to have it befal him: But after all this, it is not sure that even these will despise thee for thy sobriety, it is possible they may seem to do so to fright thee out of it; but if their hearts were searched, it would be found they do even against their wills, bear a <hi>secret reverence</hi> to sober persons, and none fall more often under their scorn and despising then those that <hi>run with them to the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of riot;</hi> for even he that sticks not to be drunk himself, will yet laugh at another that he sees so.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. There is a <hi>seventh</hi> end, which though every man think too base to own, yet it is <note place="margin">Pleasure of the drink.</note> too plain it prevails with many. And that is the bare pleasure of the <hi>drink;</hi> but to these
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:60285:105"/>
I confess it will not be fit to say much, for he that is come to this lamentable degree of sottishness, is not like to receive benefit by any thing can be said: Yet let me tell even this man, that he of all others hath the most means of discerning his fault, for this being such a ground of drinking as no body will own, he is condemned of himself; yea, and all his <hi>fellow drunkards</hi> too, for their denying it, is a plain sign they acknowledge it a most abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing. And if <hi>Esau</hi> were called a profane person, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 6. for <hi>selling but his birth right for a mess of pottage,</hi> and that too when he had the necessity of hunger upon him, what name of reproach can be bad enough for him who sells his health, his reason, his God, his soul, for a <hi>cup of drink,</hi> and that when he is so far from needing it, that perhaps he hath already more then he can keep? I shall say no more to this sort of persons, but let me warn all those that go on in the sin on any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grounds, that a little time will bring them even to this which they profess to loathe; it being daily seen that those which first were drawn into the sin for the love of the company, at last continue in it for love of the drink.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. I can think but of one end more, that <note place="margin">Bargaining.</note> is, that of <hi>Bargaining.</hi> Men say it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for them to drink in this one respect of trading with their neighbours, bargains being most conveniently to be struck up at such meetings. But this is yet a worse end then
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60285:106"/>
all the rest, for the bottom of it is an aim of cheating and defrauding others; We think when men are in drink we shall the better be able to over-reach them; and so this adds the sin of <hi>cousenage</hi> and defrauding to that of drunkenness. Now that this is indeed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, is manifest, for if it were only the dispatch of <hi>bargains</hi> were aimed at, we should chuse to take men with their wits about them, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the taking them when drink hath distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered them can be for nothing but to make advantage of them. Yet this often proves a great folly as well as a sin; for he that drinks with another in hope to over-reach him, doth many times prove the weaker brain'd, and becomes drunk first, and then he gives the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that opportunity of cheating him which he designed for the cheating of the other. Now this end of drinking is so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming an excuse, that it is a huge heightning of the sin; for if we may not drink intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately upon any occasion, much less upon so wicked a one as is the <hi>cousening</hi> and <hi>defrauding</hi> of our brethren.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. I suppose I have now shewed you the <note place="margin">Degrees of this sin.</note> unreasonableness of those Motives, which are ordinarily brought in excuse of this sin. I am yet further to tell you, that it is not only that <hi>huge</hi> degree of drunkeness which makes men able neither to go nor speak, which is to be lookt on as a sin, but all <hi>lower</hi> degrees, which do at all work upon the understanding, whether by dulling it and making it less fit for
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60285:106"/>
any imployment, or by making it too light and airy, apt to apish and ridiculous mirth, or what is worse, by inflaming men into rage and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. These, or whatever else make any change in the man, are to be reckoned into this sin of drunkenness: Nay, further, the drinking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the natural ends of drinking, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond moderate refreshment is a sin, though by the strength of a mans brain it makes not the least change in him, and therefore those that are not actually drunk, yet can spend whole days, or any considerable part of them in drinking, are so far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, that that greater wo belongs to them, which is pronounced, <hi>Isa.</hi> 5. 22. against those that are <hi>mighty to drink.</hi> For though such a man may make a shift to preserve his wits, yet that wit serves him to very little purpose when his imployment is still but the same with him that is the most sottishly drunk, that is, to pour down drink.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Nay, this man is guilty of the greater waste; <hi>First,</hi> of the good creatures of God: <note place="margin">The great guilt of the strong drinkers.</note> That <hi>drink</hi> which is by Gods providence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the refreshing and relieving of us, is abused and mispent when it is drunk beyond that measure which those ends require, and sure there is not the meanest of these creatures we enjoy, but the abuse of them shall one day be accounted for, and he that drinks longest hath the most of that <hi>guilt.</hi> But in the <hi>second</hi> place, this is a wast of that which is much more precious, our time, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60285:107"/>
us by God to <hi>work out our Salvation</hi> in, and must be strictly reckoned for, and therefore ought every minute of it to be most thriftily husbanded to that end in actions of good life; but when it is thus laid out it tends to the direct contrary, even the working out our damnation. Besides, he that thus drinks, though he escape being drunk himself, he is yet <hi>guilty</hi> of all the drunkenness that any of his company fall under, for he gives them en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to drink on by his <hi>Example,</hi> especially if he be one of any authority, but if he be one whose company the rest are fond of, his company is then a certain ensnaring of them, for then they will drink too, rather then lose him. There is yet a greater fault that many of these stronger brained drinkers are guilty of, that is, the setting themselves <hi>purposely</hi> to make others drunk, playing, as it were, a prize at it, and counting it matter of triumph and victory to see others <hi>fall</hi> before them: This is a most horrible wickedness, it is the making our selves the <hi>Divels Factors,</hi> endeavouring all we can to draw our poor brethren into eternal misery, by betraying them to so grievous a sin; and therefore it may well be reckoned as the highest step of this vice of <hi>drinking,</hi> as having in it the sin of mischieving others added to the excess in our selves. And though it be lookt upon in the world as a matter onely of <hi>jest</hi> and <hi>merriment</hi> to make others drunk, that we may sport our selves with their ridiculous behaviour, yet
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60285:107"/>

                  <p n="13">13. I have now gone through the several <note place="margin">The great mischiefs of this sin.</note> motives to, and degrees of this sin of drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enness, wherein I have been the more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular because it is a sin so strangely reigning amongst us, no <hi>Condition,</hi> no <hi>Age,</hi> or scarce <hi>Sex</hi> free from it, to the great dishonour of God, reproach of Christianity, and ruine not only of our own Souls hereafter, but even of all our present advantages and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in this life; there being no sin which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayes each single committer to more <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs</hi> in his understanding, his health, his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, his estate, then this one doth. And we have reason to believe this sin is one of those common crying guilts which have long layen heavy upon this Nation, and pulled down those many sad judgements we have groaned under.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Therefore, <hi>Christian</hi> Reader, let me <note place="margin">Exhortation to forsake it.</note> now intreat, nay conjure thee by all that tenderness and love thou oughtest to have to the honour of God, the credit of thy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian profession, eternal welfare of thine own Soul, the prosperity of the Church and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60285:108"/>
whereof thou art a member; Nay, by that love which certainly thou hast to thy own temporal welfare, to think sadly of what hath been spoken; And then judge, whether there be any pleasure in this sin, which can be any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable recompence for all those mischiefs, it brings with it; I am confident no man in his wits can think there is, and if there be not, then be ashamed to be any longer that fool, which shall make so wretched a bargain, but begin at this instant a firm and a faithful resolution, never once more to be guilty of this swinish sin, how often soever thou hast heretofore fallen into it, and in the fear of God betake thee to a strict <hi>temperance,</hi> which when thou hast done, thou wilt find thou hast made not only a gainful but a pleasant exchange; for there is no man that hath tryed both courses but his own heart will tell him there is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more pleasant comfort and pleasure in sobriety and temperance then ever all his drunken revellings afforded him.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The main <hi>difficulty</hi> is the <hi>first break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

That from <hi>our selves</hi> may be of two sorts; the <hi>first</hi> is, when by the habit of drinking, we have brought such <hi>false thirsts</hi> upon our selves, that our bodies seem to require it, and this wants <note place="margin">Seeming <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>essity of drink.</note> nothing but a little patience to overcome. Do but <hi>refrain</hi> some few days and it will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards grow easie; for the hardness arising onely from <hi>custome,</hi> the breaking of <hi>that</hi>
                     <pb n="191" facs="tcp:60285:108"/>
does the business. If thou say, it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie to do so, consider, whether if thou hadst some <hi>disease</hi> which would certainly kill thee if thou didst not for some little time refrain immoderate drinking, thou wouldst not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forbear then die? if thou wouldst not, thou art so brutish a sot, that it is in vain to perswade thee; but if thou hadst, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider how unreasonable it is for thee not to do it in this case also; the habit of drinking may well pass for a mortal disease, it proves so very often to the body, but will most certainly to the Soul; and therefore it is mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to stick at that uneasiness in the cure of this which thou wouldst submit to in a less danger. Set therefore but a resolute purpose to endure that little trouble for a small time, and this first difficulty is conquered, for after thou hast a while refrained, it will be perfectly easie to do so still.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. The <hi>second</hi> difficulty is that of <hi>spend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time,</hi> which those that have made <note place="margin">Want of imployment.</note> drinking their trade and business, know scarce how to dispose of. But the very naming of this difficulty directs to the cure, get thee some <hi>business,</hi> somewhat to imploy thy self in, which, as I have already shewed, will be easily found by all sorts of persons, but those meaner to whom I now write, can sure never want it ready at hand, they being generally such as are to be maintained by their labour, and therefore to them I need only give this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to be diligent in that business they have,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60285:109"/>
to follow that close as they ought; and they will have little occasion to seek out this way of spending their time.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. There is another sort of difficulty, <note place="margin">Perswasions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of men.</note> which I told you arises from others, and that is either from their perswasions, or reproaches. It is very likely if thy <hi>old companions</hi> see thee begin to fall off, they will set hard to thee, to bring thee back to thy old course, they will urge to thee the <hi>unkindness</hi> of forsaking the company of thy friends, the <hi>sadness</hi> of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all that mirth and jollity, which <hi>good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> (as they call them) enjoy, and if thou canst not thus be won, they will affright thee with the reproach of the world, and so try if they can mock thee out of thy sobriety.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. The way to overcome <hi>this</hi> difficulty <note place="margin">The means of resisting them.</note> is to foresee it, therefore when thou first enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est on thy course of temperance, thou art to make account thou shalt meet with these (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps many other) <hi>temptations,</hi> and that thou maist make a right judgement, whether they be worthy to prevail with thee, take them before hand, and weigh them, consider whether that <hi>false kindness,</hi> that is maintained among men by drinking, be worthy to be compared with that real and everlasting kindness of God, which is lost by it; Whether that <hi>foolish,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Weigh the advantages with the hurt.</note> 
                     <hi>vain mirth</hi> bear any weight with the present joyes of a good conscience here, or with those greater of Heaven hereafter. <hi>Lastly,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the unjust reproach of wicked men, the shame of the world be so terrible, as the just
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60285:109"/>
reproof of thine own conscience at the present, and that eternal confusion of face that shall befal all those, that go on in this sin, at the last day; Weigh all these, I say, I need not say, in the balance of the Sanctuary, but even in the scales of common reason, and sure thou wilt be forced to pronounce, that the motives to temperance infinitly out weigh those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; When thou hast thus advisedly judged, then fix thy resolution accordingly, and when ever any of these temptations come to stagger thee, remember thou hast formerly weighed them, knowest the just value of them, and that they are a most unworthy price for those precious advantages thou must give in exchange for them. And therefore hold fast thy resolution, and with indignation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all motions to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But be sure thou thus <hi>reject</hi> them at <note place="margin">Reject the temptation at the very beginning.</note> their very first tender, and do not yield in the least degree; For if once thou givest ground, thou art lost, the sin will by little and little prevail upon thee. Thus we see many, who have profest to be resolved upon great <hi>tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> yet for want of this care, have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured into the company of good fellowes, when they have been there, they have at the first been over intreated to take a cup, after that another, till at last they have taken their rounds as freely as any of them, and in that <hi>floud of drink</hi> drowned all their sober re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions. Therefore whoever thou art, that dost really desire to forsake the sin, take care
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:60285:110"/>
to avoid the <hi>occasions</hi> and beginnings of it; to which end it will be good openly to declare and own thy purposes of sobriety, that so thou mayest discourage men from assaulting thee. But if either thou art ashamed to own it, or seemest to be so, they will quickly make use of that shame to bring thee to break it.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. If thou be thus wary to keep thee from <note place="margin">The security of doing so.</note> the first beginnings, thou art then sure never to be overtaken with this sin: For it is like the keeping the out-works of a <hi>besieged City,</hi> which so long as they are stoutly defended there is no danger, but if they be either sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized or yielded, the City cannot long hold out. The advice therefore of the wise man is very agreeable to this matter, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 19. 1. <hi>He that despiseth small things shall perish by little and little.</hi> But because as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, <hi>Psal.</hi> 127. 1. <hi>Except the Lord keep the City the watch-man waketh but in vain:</hi> therefore to this guard of thy self adde thy most earnest prayers to God that he will also watch over thee, and by the strength of his grace enable thee to resist all temptations to this sin.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. If thou do in the <hi>sincerity</hi> of thy heart <note place="margin">The esficacy of these means, if not hindred by love of the sin.</note> use <hi>these means,</hi> there is no doubt but thou wilt be able to overcome this vice, how long soever thou hast been accustomed to it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if thou do still remain under the power of it, never excuse thy self by the impossibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the task, but rather accuse the falseness of thy own heart, that hath still such a love
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60285:110"/>
to this sin, that thou wilt not set roundly to the means of subduing it.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. Perhaps the great <hi>commonness</hi> of the <hi>sin</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">That love makes men loth to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> and thy particular custome of it may have made it so much thy familiar, thy bosome acquaintance, that thou art loath to entertain <hi>hard</hi> thoughts of it, very unwilling thou art to think that it means thee any hurt, and therefore art apt to speak peace to thy self, to hope that either this is no sin, or at most but a frailty, such as will not bar thee out of heaven: But deceive not thy self, for thou mayest as well say there is no <hi>heaven,</hi> as that <hi>drunkenness</hi> shall not keep thee <hi>thence;</hi> I am sure the same word of God which tells us there is such a place of happiness, tells us also that drunkards are of the number of <hi>those that shall not inherit it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. And again, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21. Drunkenness is reckoned among those <hi>works of the flesh,</hi> which they that do shall not <hi>inherit the kingdom of God.</hi> And indeed had not these plain texts, yet meet reason would tell us the same, That is a place of infinite purity, such as <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood,</hi> till it be refined and purified, <hi>is not capable of,</hi> as the Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 53. and if as we are meer men, we are too gross and impure for it, we must sure be more so when we have changed our selves into Swine, the soulest of beasts, we are then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for the Devils to enter into, as they did into the <hi>herd, Mark</hi> 5. 13. and that not only some one or two, but a <hi>Legion,</hi> a troop
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60285:111"/>
and multitude of them. And of this we daily see <hi>examples,</hi> for where this sin of drunkenness hath taken possession, it usually comes as an harbinger to abundance of others; each act of drunkenness prepares a man not only for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same sin, but of others; lust and rage, and all brutish appetites are then let loose, and so a man brings himself under that curse which was the saddest <hi>David</hi> knew how to foretel to any, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 28 <hi>The falling from one wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to another.</hi> If all this be not enough to affright thee out of this drunken fit, thou must still wallow in thy vomit, continue in this sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish, sensless condition, till the flames of Hell rowse thee, and then thou wilt by sad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence find what now thou wilt not believe, <hi>that the end of those things,</hi> as the Apostle saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 21. <hi>is death.</hi> God in his infinite mercy timely awake the hearts of all that are in this sin, that by a timely forsaking it they may <hi>flie from that wrath to come.</hi> I have now done with this second part of <hi>Temperance,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Drinking.</hi>

                  <p>§. 1. THE <hi>Third</hi> part of TEMPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RANCE concernes SLEEP: <note place="margin">Sleep.</note> And <hi>Temperance</hi> in that also must be measured by the end for which <hi>sleep</hi> was ordained by God, which was only the refreshing and supporting of our frail bodies, which being of such a temper that continual labour and toil tires and wearies them out, <hi>Sleep</hi> comes as a Medicine to that weariness, as a repairer of that decay, that so we may be enabled to such labours as the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion or works of our Calling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of us. <hi>Sleep</hi> was intended to make us more profitable, not more idle; as we give rest to our beasts; not that we are pleased with their doing nothing, but that they may do us the better service.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By this therefore you may judge what is <note place="margin">The rule of Temperance therein.</note> 
                     <hi>temperate sleeping;</hi> to wit, that which tends to the refreshing and making us more lively and fit for action; and to that end a moderate degree serves best. It will be impossible to set down just how many hours is that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:60285:112"/>
degree, because as in <hi>eating</hi> so in <hi>sleep,</hi> some constitutions require more then others. Every mans own experience must in this judge for him, but then let him judge uprightly and not consult with his sloth in the case, for that will still, with <hi>Solomons sluggard,</hi> cry, <hi>A little more sleep, a little more slumber, a little more folding of the hands to sleep,</hi> Prov. 24. 33. But take only so much as he really findes to tend to the end forementioned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that doth not thus limit himself falls into several sins under this general one of sloth, <note place="margin">The many Sins that follow the transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> as <hi>first,</hi> he wastes his time, that precious talent which was committed to him by God to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, which he that <hi>sleeps</hi> away, doth like him in the Gospel, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 18. <hi>Hides it in the earth</hi> when he should be trading with it; and you know what was the doom of that <hi>unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table servant,</hi> vers 30. <hi>Cast ye him into outer darkness:</hi> he that gives himself to darkness of <hi>sleep</hi> here, shall there have darkness without <hi>sleep,</hi> but with <hi>weeping and gnashing of teeth. Secondly,</hi> he injures his body, immoderate <hi>sleep</hi> sils that full of diseases, makes it a very sink of humours, as daily experience shews us. <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> he injures his Soul also, and that not only in robbing it of the service of the body, but in dulling its proper faculties, making them use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less and unfit for those imployments to which God hath designed them; of all which ill hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry the poor Soul must one day give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. Nay, <hi>lastly,</hi> he affronts and despises God himself in it, by crossing the very end of his
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60285:112"/>
creation, which was to serve God in an active obedience, but he that <hi>sleeps</hi> away his life, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly thwarts and contradicts that, and when God saith, <hi>Man is born to labour,</hi> his practice saith the direct contrary, that man was <hi>born to rest.</hi> Take heed therefore of giving thy self to immoderate <hi>sleep,</hi> which is the committing of so many sins in one.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But besides the sin of it, it is also very <note place="margin">Other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs of sloth.</note> hurtful in other respects, it is the sure bane of thy outward estate, wherein the sluggish per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son shall never thrive; according to that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the Wise man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 23. 21. <hi>Drowsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness shall cover a man with rags;</hi> that is, the slothful man shall want convenient clothing; nay, indeed it can scarce be said, that the slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard lives: <hi>Sleep</hi> you know is a kind of death, and he that gives himself up to it, what doth he but die before his time? Therefore if untimely death be to be lookt upon as a curse, it must needs be a strange folly to chuse that from our own sloth which we dread so much from Gods hand.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>fourth</hi> part of <hi>Temperance</hi> concerns <hi>Recreations,</hi> which are sometimes necessary <note place="margin">Temperance in Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> both to the body and the minde of a man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them being able to endure a constant toil without somewhat of refreshment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween; and therefore there is a very lawful use of them; but to make it so, it will be necessary to observe these <hi>Cautions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>First,</hi> We must take care that the kind of <note place="margin">Cautions to be observed in them.</note> them be lawful, that they be such as have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60285:113"/>
of sin in them; we must not to <hi>recreate</hi> our selves do any thing which is dishonourable to God, or injurious to our neighbour, as they do who make profane or filthy backbiting dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course their <hi>recreation. Secondly,</hi> we must take care that we use it with moderation: and to do so, we must <hi>first</hi> be sure not to spend too <hi>much time</hi> upon it, but remember that the end of <hi>recreation</hi> is to fit us for business, not to be it self a business to us: <hi>Secondly,</hi> we must not be too vehement and <hi>earnest</hi> in it, not set our hearts too much upon it, for that will both ensnare us to the using too much of it, and it will divert and take off our minds from our more necessary imployments: Like School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boyes, who after a play time, know not how to set themselves to their books again. <hi>Lastly,</hi> we must not set up to our selves any <hi>other</hi> end of <hi>recreations</hi> but that lawful one, of giving us moderate refreshment.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. As <hi>first,</hi> we are not to use <hi>sports</hi> only to pass away our time, which we ought to study <note place="margin">Unlue End of Sports.</note> how to redeem, not fling away; and when it is remembred how great a work we have here to do, the <hi>making our calling and election sure,</hi> the securing our title to heaven hereafter, and how uncertain we are what time shall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us for that purpose; it will appear our time is that which of all other things we ought most industriously to improve. And therefore sure we have little need to contrive wayes of driving that away which flies so fast of it self, and is so impossible to recover. Let them that
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:60285:113"/>
can spend <hi>whole dayes and nights</hi> at <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Dice,</hi> and idle pastimes, to consider this, and withal, whether they ever bestowed a <hi>quarter</hi> of that time towards that great business of their lives for which all their time was given them, and then think what a woful reckoning they are like to make when they come at last to account for that precious treasure of their <hi>time. Secondly,</hi> we must not let our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousness have any thing to do in our <hi>recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations;</hi> if we play at any <hi>Game,</hi> let the end of our doing it be meerly to <hi>recreate</hi> our selves, not to win money; and to that purpose be sure never to play for any considerable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for if thou do, thou wilt bring thy self into two dangers, the one of covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and a greedy desire of winning, the other of rage and anger at thy ill fortune, if thou happen to lose; both which will be apt to draw thee into other sins besides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: <hi>Covetousness</hi> will tempt thee to cheat and couzen in gaming, and anger to swearing and cursing, as common experience shews us too often. If thou finde thy self apt to fall into either of these in thy gaming, thou must either take some course to secure thy self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, or thou must not permit thy self to play at all: for though moderate play be in it self not unlawful, yet if it be the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sin, it is so to thee, and therefore must not be ventured on. For if <hi>Christ</hi> commands us so strictly to avoid temptations, that if our very <hi>eyes</hi> or <hi>hands offend</hi> us (that is, prove
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:60285:114"/>
snares to us) we must rather part with them then to be drawn to sin by them: How much ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must we part with any of these unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry sports, then run the hazard of offending God by them? He that so playes, layes his soul to stake, which is too great a prize to be played away. Besides, he loses all the <hi>recreation</hi> and sport he pretends to aim at, and in stead of that sets himself to a greater toil then any of those labours are he was to ease by it. For sure the desires and fears of the covetous, the impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and rage of the angry man are more real pains then any the most laborious work can be.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The last part of <hi>Temperance</hi> is that of <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Temperance in</hi> Apparel.</note> APPAREL, which we are again to measure by the agreeableness to the ends for which cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be used. Those are especially these three: <hi>first,</hi> the hiding of nakedness. This was the first occasion of <hi>apparel,</hi> as you may read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 21. and was the effect of the first sin; and <note place="margin">Apparel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed for covering of shame.</note> therefore when we remember the original of clothes, we have so little reason to be proud of them, that on the contrary we have cause to be humbled and ashamed, as having lost that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency which was a much greater ornament then any the most glorious <hi>apparel</hi> can be. From this end of clothing we are likewise en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to have our <hi>apparel</hi> modest, such as may answer this end of covering our shame: And therefore all immodest fashions of <hi>apparel,</hi> which may either argue the wantonness of the wearer, or provoke that of the beholder, are to be avoided.</p>

9. A <hi>second</hi> end of <hi>Apparel,</hi> is the <hi>fencing</hi> the body from cold, thereby to preserve the health thereof, and this end we must likewise <note place="margin">Fencing from cold.</note> observe in our clothing; we must wear such kind of habits, as may keep us in that conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient warmth, which is necessary to our healths. And this is transgrest, when out of the vanity of being in every phantastick fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we put our selves in such clothing, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not defend us from cold, or is some other way so uneasie, that it is rather a hurt then a benefit to our bodies to be so clad. This is a most ridiculous folly, and yet that which people that take a pride in their clothes are usually guilty of.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. A <hi>third</hi> end of <hi>Apparel</hi> is the <hi>distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Distinction of persons.</note> or <hi>differencing</hi> of persons, and that <hi>first</hi> in respect of <hi>Sex; Secondly,</hi> in respect of qualities. <hi>First,</hi> clothes are to make diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>Sex;</hi> this hath been observed by all Nations, the habits of men and women have always been divers. And God himself ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly provided for it among the <hi>Jews,</hi> by commanding that the man should not wear the <hi>apparel</hi> of the woman, nor the woman of the man. But then <hi>secondly,</hi> there is also a distinction of qualities to be observed in <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel;</hi> God hath placed some in a higher con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition then others, and in proportion to their condition, it befits their clothing to be; Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous <hi>apparel,</hi> our Saviour tells us, <hi>is for Kings Courts, Luke</hi> 7. 25. Now this end of <hi>apparel</hi> should also be observed. Men and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60285:115"/>
women should content themselves with that sort of clothing, which agrees to their <hi>Sex</hi> and condition, not striving to <hi>exceed,</hi> and equal that of a higher rank, nor yet making it matter of envy, among those of their own estate, vying who shall be finest, but let every man cloth himself in such sober attire, as <hi>befits</hi> his place and <hi>calling,</hi> and not think himself disparaged, if another of his neighbours have better then he.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. And let all remember that <hi>clothes</hi> are things, which adde no true worth to any, and therefore it is an intollerable vanity to spend any considerable part either of their thoughts, time or wealth upon them, or to value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves ever the more for them, or despise their poor brethren that want them. But if they desire to adorn themselves, let it be as S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> adviseth the women of his time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 4. <hi>In the hidden man of the heart, even the orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a meek and quiet spirit.</hi> Let them cloth themselves as richly as is possible with all Christian vertues, and that is the raiment that will set them out lovely in Gods eyes, yea, and in mens too, who, unless they be fools and Idiots will more value thee for being good, then fine, and sure one plain Coat thou puttest upon a poor mans back will better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thee, then twenty rich ones thou shalt put upon thine own. <note place="margin">Too much sparing a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:60285:115"/>
in all these particulars I have taken notice only of the one fault of excess, yet it is possible there may be one on the other hand; men may deny their bodies that which they neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily require to their support, and well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This is, I believe, a fault not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as the other, yet we sometimes see some <hi>very niggardly persons,</hi> that are guilty of it, that cannot find in their hearts to borrow so much from their chests, as may feed their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, or cloth their backs, and that are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent upon the world, so moiling, and drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it, that they cannot afford themselves that competent time of sleep, or recreation, that is necessary. If any that hath read the former part of this Discourse be of this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, let him not comfort himself, that he is not guilty of those excesses there complained of, and therefore conclude himself a good Christian, because he is not intemperate, for whoever is <hi>this covetous creature,</hi> his abstain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall not be counted to him as the vertue of temperance, for it is not the love of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, but wealth, that makes him refrain; And that is so far from being praise-worthy, that it is that great sin which the Apostle tells us, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 10. <hi>is the root of all evil;</hi> such a mans <hi>body</hi> will one day rise in judgement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, for defrauding it of its due porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, those moderate refreshments, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which God hath allowed it.

I shall therefore build all the particular duties we ow to our <hi>neighbor,</hi> on those two general ones, <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I begin with JUSTICE, whereof there are two parts, the one <hi>Negative,</hi> the other <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">JU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STICE.</note>
                     <pb n="207" facs="tcp:60285:116"/>
the <hi>negative justice</hi> is to do no wrong, or injury to any. The <hi>positive justice</hi> is to do right to all; that is, to yield them whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever appertains or is due unto them. I shall <hi>first</hi> speak of the <hi>negative justice,</hi> the not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring <note place="margin">Negative.</note> or wronging any. Now because a man is capable of receiving wrong in several re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects; this <hi>first</hi> part of <hi>justice</hi> extends it self into several branches, answerable to those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of injury. A man may be injured ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his <hi>Soul,</hi> his <hi>body,</hi> his <hi>possessions,</hi> or <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit;</hi> and therefore this duty of <hi>negative ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice</hi> lays a restraint on us in every of these. That we do no wrong to any man in respect either of his Soul, his body, his possessions, or credit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>First,</hi> This JUSTICE tyes us to do no <note place="margin">To the Soul</note> hurt to his Soul; and here my first work must be to examine what harm it is that the <hi>soul</hi> can receive; it is we know an invisible substance which we cannot reach with our eye, much less with our swords and weapons, yet for all that it is capable of being hurt and wounded; and that even to death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Now the <hi>Soul</hi> may be considered either <note place="margin">In the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral sence.</note> in a <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> sense; in the <hi>natural</hi> it signifies that which we usually call the mind of a man, and this we all know may be <hi>wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with gries or sadness, as <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15. 13. <hi>By sorrow of heart the spirit is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> Therefore whoever does causlesly afflict or grieve his neighbour; he transgresses this part of justice, and hurts, and wrongs his soul.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:60285:117"/>
This sort of injury <hi>malicious</hi> and <hi>spiteful</hi> men are very often guilty of, they will do things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which themselves reap no good, nay, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten much harm, onely that they may vex and grieve another; This is a most savage, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane humour, thus to take pleasure in the sadness, and afflictions of others; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever harbours it in his heart, may truly be said to be possest with a Devil, for it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture only of those accursed spirits to delight in the miseries of men; and till that be cast out, they are fit onely to dwell as the possest person did, <hi>Mar</hi> 5. 2. <hi>Among graves and tombs,</hi> where there are none capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving affliction by them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But the <hi>Soul</hi> may be considered also in the <note place="margin">In the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual.</note> 
                     <hi>spiritual sense,</hi> and so it signifies that immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal part of us which must live eternally, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in bliss or woe in another world. And the Soul thus understood is capable of two sorts of harm: <hi>First,</hi> That of sin; <hi>Secondly,</hi> That of Punishment; the latter whereof is certainly the consequent of the former; and therefore though God be the inflicter of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment yet since it is but the effect of sin, we may justly reckon, that he that draws a man to sin, is likewise the betrayer of him to punishment, as he that gives a man a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wound, is the cause of his death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the evil of sin both are contained, so that I need speak onely of that.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And sure there cannot be a higher sort <note place="margin">Drawing to in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test injury.</note> of wrong, then the bringing this great evil
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60285:117"/>
upon the <hi>Soul; sin</hi> is the <hi>disease</hi> and wound of the Soul, as being the direct contray to <hi>Grace;</hi> which is the <hi>health</hi> and soundness of it: Now this wound we give to every Soul whom we do by any means whatsoever draw into sin.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The wayes of doing that are divers, I <note place="margin">Direct means of it.</note> shall mention some of them, whereof though some are more direct then others, yet all tend to the same end. Of the more direct ones there is, <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>commanding</hi> of sin, that is, when a person that hath power over ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall require him to do something which is unlawful; an example of this we have in <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> commanding the worship of the <hi>golden Image, Dan.</hi> 3. 4. and his copy is imitated by any parent or master who shall require of his childe or servant to do any unlawful act. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is <hi>counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of sin, when men advise and perswade others to any wickedness: Thus <hi>Jobs</hi> wife counselled her husband to curse God, <hi>Job</hi> 27. And <hi>Achitophel</hi> advised <hi>Absolom</hi> to go into his <hi>Fathers concubines,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 21. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> there is <hi>enticing</hi> and alluring to sin, by setting before men the pleasures or profits they shall reap by it. Of this sort of enticement <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> gives warning, Prov. 1. 10. <hi>My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not; if they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent without a cause,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>verse</hi> the 13. you may see what is the bait, by which they seek to allure them:
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:60285:118"/>
                     <hi>we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil, cast in thy lot among us, let us all have one purse. Fourthly,</hi> there is <hi>assistance</hi> in sin; that is, when men aid and help others either in contriving or acting a sin. Thus <hi>Jonadab</hi> helpt <hi>Amnon</hi> in plotting the <hi>Ravishing of his sister,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13. all these are direct means of bringing this great evil of sin upon our brethren.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. There are also others, which though they seem more <hi>indirect,</hi> may yet be as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual <note place="margin">Indirect.</note> towards that ill end: As <hi>first,</hi> example in sin; he that sets others an ill pattern does his part to make them imitate it, and too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it hath that effect; there being generally nothing more forcible to bring men into any sinful practice, then the seeing it used by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as might be instanced in many sins, to which there is no other temptation, but their being in fashion. <hi>Secondly,</hi> there is incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in sin, when either by approving, or else at least by not shewing a dislike, we give others confidence to go on in their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness. A <hi>third</hi> means is by justifying and defending any sinful act of anothers, for by that we do not only confirm him in his evil, but endanger the drawing others to the like, who may be the more inclinable to it, when they shall hear it so pleaded for. <hi>Lastly,</hi> the bringing up any reproach upon strict and Christian living, as those do who have the ways of God in derision; this is a means to affright men from the practice of duty, when
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60285:118"/>
they see it will bring them to be scorned and despised; this is worse then all the former, not only in respect of the man who is guilty of it (as it is an evidence of the great profaneness of his own heart) but also in regard of others, it having a more general ill effect then any of the former can have, it being the betraying men not only to some <hi>single</hi> acts of disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Christ, but even to the casting off all subjection to him: By all these means we may draw on our selves this great guilt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring and wounding the <hi>souls</hi> of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It would be too long for me to instance <note place="margin">Men sadly to consider whom they have thus injured.</note> in all the several sins, in which it is usual for men to ensnare others; as <hi>drunkenness, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannness, rebellion,</hi> and a multitude more. But it will concern every man for his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, to <hi>consider</hi> sadly what mischiefs of this kinde he hath done to any, by all, or any of these means, and to weigh well the greatness of the injury. Men are apt to boast of their innocency towards their neighbours, that they have done wrong to no man; but God knowes many that thus brag, are of all others the most injurious persons: perhaps they have not maimed his body, nor stoln his goods: but alas! the body is but the case and cover of the man, and the goods some appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to that, 'tis the soul is the man, and that they can wound and pierce without remorse, and yet with the adulteress, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 20. say, <hi>They have done no wickedness;</hi> but glory of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60285:119"/>
their friendly behaviour to those whom they thus betray to eternal ruine, for whomsoever thou hast drawn to any sin, thou hast done thy part to ascertain to those endless flames. And then think with thy self how base a treachery this is, thou wouldst call him a treacherous villain, that should while he pretends to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace a man, secretly stab him; but this of thine is as far beyond that, as the soul is of more value then the body, and hell worse then death. And remember yet farther, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the cruelty of it to thy poor brother, it is also most dangerous to thy self, it being that against which Christ hath pronounced a <hi>woe, Matth.</hi> 18. 7. and ver. 6. he tells us that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever shall offend (that is, draw into sin) <hi>any of those little ones, it were better for him that a milstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the Sea.</hi> Thou maist plunge thy poor brother into perdition, but as it is with wrestlers, he that gives ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a fall, commonly falls with him, so thou art like to bear him company to that place of torment.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Let therefore thy own &amp; his danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get <note place="margin">Heartily to bewail it.</note> in thee a sense of the greatness of this sin, this horrid piece of injustice to the precious soul of thy neighbour. Bethink thy self seriously to whom thou hast bin thus cruel, whom thou hast enticed to <hi>drinking,</hi> advised to <hi>rebellion,</hi> allured to <hi>lust,</hi> stirred up to <hi>rage,</hi> whom thou hast assisted or encouraged in any ill course, or discouraged, and disheartned by thy profane
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60285:119"/>
scoffings at piety in general, or at any conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable strict walking of his in particular; and then draw up a bill of indictment accuse and condemn thy self, as a <hi>Cain,</hi> a murderer of thy brother, heartily and deeply bewail all thy guilts of this kinde, and resolve never once more to be a stumbling block, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. in thy brothers way.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. But this is not all, there must be some <note place="margin">Endeavour to repair it.</note> 
                     <hi>fruits</hi> of this <hi>repentance</hi> brought forth; now in all sins of injustice, <hi>restitution</hi> is a necessary fruit of repentance, and so it is here, thou hast committed an act (perhaps many) of high injustice to the soul of thy brother, thou hast robbed it of its innocency, of its title to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, thou must now endeavour to restore all this to it again, by being more earnest and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious to win him to repentance, then ever thou wert to draw him to sin, use now as much art to convince him of the danger, as ever thou didst to flatter him with the pleasures of his vice, in a word, countermine thy self by using all those methods, and means to recover him, that thou didst to destroy him, and be more diligent and zealous in it for 'tis necessary thou shouldst both in regard of him and thy self: <hi>First,</hi> in respect of him, because there is in mans nature so much a greater prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and readiness to evil, then to good, that there will need much more pains and diligence to instil the one into him, then the other: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the man is supposed to be already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to the contrary, which wil adde much
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:60285:120"/>
to the difficulty of the work. Then in respect of thy self; if thou be a true penitent, thou wilt think thy self obliged, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> did, <hi>to labour more abundantly,</hi> and wilt be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that when thou art trading for God, bringing back a soul to him, thou shouldest not pursue it with more earnestness, then while thou art an agent of <hi>Satans,</hi> besides the remembrance, that thou art a means of bringing this poor soul into this snare, must necessarily quicken thy diligence to get him out of it: So much for the first part of nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive justice, in respect of the souls of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The <hi>second</hi> concernes the bodies, and to those also this justice binds thee to do no <note place="margin">Negative justice to the body.</note> wrong nor violence. Now of wrongs to the body there may be several degrees, the <note place="margin">In respect of the life.</note> highest of them is killing, taking away the life; this is forbid in the very letter of the <hi>sixth Commandement. Thou shalt do no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. <hi>Murder</hi> may be committed either by <note place="margin">Several wayes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing guilty of murder.</note> open violence; when a man either by sword, or any other instrument takes away ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers life, immediately, and directly, or it may be done secretly and treacherously, as <hi>David</hi> murdered <hi>Uriah,</hi> not with his own sword but with the sword of the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Ammon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. 17. And <hi>Jozabel Naboth</hi> by a false accusation, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21. 13. And so divers have committed this sin of <hi>murder</hi> by <hi>poyson, false-witness,</hi> or some such <hi>concealed</hi> wayes.

The <hi>former</hi> is commonly the effect of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den rage, the <hi>latter</hi> hath several originals, sometimes it proceeds from some old malice fixt in the heart towards the person, sometimes from some covetous or ambitious desires; such a one stands in a mans way to his profit or preferment, and therefore he must be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and sometimes again it is to cover shame, as in the case of Strumpets, that murder their Infants that they may not betray their filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. But besides these more direct wayes of killing, there is another, and that is, when by our perswasions and <hi>enticements</hi> we draw a man to do that which tends to the shortning of his life, and is apparent to do so; he that makes his neighbour drunk, if by that drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenness the man come to any mortal hurt which he would have escaped if he had been sober, he that made him drunk is not clear of his death; or if he die not by any such sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den accident, yet if drinking cast him into a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and that disease kill him, I know not how he that <hi>drew</hi> him to that excess can ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himself of his <hi>murder</hi> in the eyes of <hi>God,</hi> though humane Laws touch him not. I wish those who make it their business to draw in customers to that <hi>trade of debauchery</hi> would consider it. There is yet another way of bringing this guilt upon our selves, and that is by inciting and stirring up others to it, or to that degree of anger and revenge which produces it; as he that sets <hi>two</hi> persons at <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance,</hi> or seeing them already so, blows the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60285:121"/>
coales, if <hi>murder</hi> ensue, he certainly hath this share in the guilt, which is a consideration that ought to aflright all from having any thing to do in the kindling, or encreasing of contention.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Now for the <hi>hainousness</hi> of this sin of <note place="margin">The hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the sin.</note> 
                     <hi>murder,</hi> I suppose none can be ignorant, that it is of the deepest dye, a most <hi>loud crying sin;</hi> This we may see in the first act of this kinde, that ever was committed, <hi>Abels blood cryed from the earth,</hi> as God tells <hi>Cain, Genesis</hi> 4. 10. Yea, the guilt of this sin is such, that it leaves a stain even upon the land where it is committed, such as is not to be washt out, but by the blood of the <hi>murderer,</hi> as appears <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 12, 13. The land cannot be purged of blood, but by the blood of him that shed it; and therefore though in other cases the flying to the <hi>Altar</hi> secured a man, yet in this of wilful <hi>murder</hi> no such refuge was allowed but such a one was to be taken even thence, and delivered up to justice, <hi>Exodus</hi> 21. 14. <hi>Thou shalt take him from my Altar, that he may dye.</hi> And it is yet farther observable, that the only two precepts which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture mentions, as given to <hi>Noah</hi> after the flood, were both in relation to this sin, that of not <hi>eating blood, Gen.</hi> 9. 4. being a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to beget in men a greater horror of this sin of <hi>murder,</hi> and so intended for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting of it. The other was for the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>He that sheddeth mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed;</hi> and the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:60285:121"/>
reason of this strictuess is added in the next words, <hi>For in the Image of God made he man;</hi> where you see that this sin is not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to our brother, but even the highest contempt, and despight towards God himself, for it is the defacing of his image, which he hath stamped upon man. Nay yet further, it is the usurping of Gods proper right, and authority. For it is God alone, that hath right to dispose of the life of man; 'twas he alone that gave it, and it is he alone that hath power to take it away; but he that <hi>murders</hi> a man does, as it were, wrest this power out of Gods hand, which is the highest pitch of rebellious presumption.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. And as the sin is great, so likewise is the <note place="margin">The great punishments attending it.</note> 
                     <hi>punishment;</hi> we see it frequently very great, and remarkable, even in this world, (besides those most fearful effects of it in the next) blood not only cryes, but it cryes for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and the great God of recompences as he stiles himself, will not fail to hear it: very many examples the Scripture gives us of this: <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> that murdered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Naboth,</hi> for greediness of his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, were themselves slain, and the Dogs licked their blood in the place, where they had shed his, as you may read in that Story; so <hi>Absalom,</hi> that slew his brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> after he had committed that sin, fell into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that of rebellion against his King and Father, and in it miserably perished. <hi>Rechab</hi> and <hi>Baanah,</hi> that slew <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60285:122"/>
put to death, and that by the very person they thought to endear by it; many more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances might be given of this out of the Sacred Story, and many also out of Humane, there having been no age but hath yielded multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of examples of this kinde, so that every man may furnish himself out of the observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his own time.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. And it is worth our notice, what <note place="margin">The strange discoveries of it.</note> 
                     <hi>strange</hi> and even <hi>miraculous</hi> meanes it hath often pleased God to use for the discovery of this sin; the very bruit creatures have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been made instruments of it; nay, often the extream horrour of a mans own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science hath made him betray himself, so that it is not any closeness a man uses in the acting of this sin, that can secure him from the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of it, for he can never shut out his own conscience, that will in spight of him be privie to the fact, and that very often proves the means of discovering it to the world, or if it should not do that, yet it will sure act revenge on him, it will be such a Hell within him as will be worse then death: This we have seen in many, who after the commission of this sin have never been able to enjoy a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes rest, but have had that intolerable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of minde that they have chosen to be their own <hi>murderers</hi> rather then live in it. These are the usual effects of this sin even in this world, but those in another are yet more dreadful, where surely the highest degrees of torment belong to this high pitch of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:60285:122"/>
for if as our Saviour tells us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 22. <hi>Hell fire</hi> be the portion of him that shall but <hi>call his brother fool,</hi> what degree of those burnings can we think proportionable, to this so much greater an injury?</p>
                  <p n="17">17. The consideration of all this ought to <note place="margin">We must watch dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all approaches of this sin.</note> possess us with the greatest horrour, and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of this sin, and to make us extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly watchful of our selves, that we never fall into it, and to that end to prevent all those occasions which may insensibly draw us into this pit. I mentioned at first several things which are wont to be <hi>originals</hi> of it, and at those we must begin, if we will surely guard our selves. If therefore thou wilt be sure ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to kill a man in thy rage, be sure never to be in that rage, for if thou permittest thy self to that, thou canst have no security against the other, anger being a madness that suffers us not to consider, or know what we do, when it has once possest us. Therefore when thou findest thy self begin to be <hi>inflamed,</hi> think be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, whither this <hi>may lead</hi> thee, if thou lettest loose to it, and immediately put the bridle upon this head strong passion; so again, if thou wilt be sure thy malice shall not draw thee to it, be sure never to harbour one mals<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious thought in thy heart, for if it once settle there it will gather such strength, that within a while thou wilt be perfectly under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of it, so that it may lead thee even to this horrible sin at its pleasure; be therefore care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful at the very first approach of this treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

guest, to shut the doors against it, never to let it enter thy mind; so also if thou wilt be sure thy covetousness, thy ambition, thy lust, or any other sinful desire shall not betray thee to it, be sure thou never permit any of them to bear any sway with thee, for if they get the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, as they will soon do, if they be once entertained in the heart, they will be past thy controul, and hurry thee to thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> or any other sin, that may serve their ends. In like manner if thou wouldst not be guilty of any of the mortal effects of thy neighbours drunkenness, be sure not to entice him to it nor accompany him at it, and to that purpose do not allow thy self in the same practice, for if thou do, thou wilt be labouring to get company at it. <hi>Lastly,</hi> if thou wilt not be guilty of the <hi>murder</hi> commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by another, take heed thou never give any incouragement to it, or contribute any thing to that hatred, or contention, that may be the cause of it. For when thou hast either <hi>kindled</hi> or blowed the <hi>fire,</hi> what knowest thou whom it may consume? bring always as much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as thou canst to quench, but never bring one drop of oil to encrease the flame. The like may be said of all other occasions of this sin not here mentioned; and this careful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving our selves from these, is the only sure way to keep us from this sin; therefore as ever thou wouldst keep thy self innocent from the great offence, guard thee warily from all such inlets, those steps and approaches to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it.</p>

But although <hi>murder</hi> be the greatest, yet it is not the onely <hi>injury</hi> that may be done to the body of our neighbour, there are others which are also of a very high nature, the next <note place="margin">Maiming a great injury.</note> in degree to this is <hi>Maiming</hi> him, depriving him of any member, or at least of the use of it, and this is a very great wrong and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to him, as we may discern by the Judgement of God himself, in the case of the <hi>bond-servant,</hi> who should by his <hi>Masters</hi> means <hi>loose a member,</hi> Exod. 21. 26. the freedom of his whole life was thought but a reasonable recompence for it, <hi>He shall let him go free,</hi> saith the text, <hi>for his eye;</hi> Nay though it were a less considerable part, if it were but a tooth, which of all other may be lost with the least damage, yet the same amends was to be made him, ver. 27.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. But we need no other way of measuring <note place="margin">That which every man dreads for himself.</note> this injury, then the judgement of every man in his own case; how much does every man dread the loss of a limb, so that if he be by any accident or disease, in danger of it, he thinks no pains or cost too much to preserve it. And then how great an injustice, how contrary to that great rule of <hi>doing as we would be done to,</hi> is it, for a man to do that to another, which he so unwillingly suffers himself.</p>
                  <p>But if the person be <hi>poor,</hi> one that must <note place="margin">Yet worse if the man be poor.</note> labour for his living, the injury is yet greater, it is such as may in effect amount to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer sin of <hi>murder,</hi> for as the wise man says,

                     <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 24. 21. <hi>The poor mans bread is his life, and he that deprives them thereof is a blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedder.</hi> And therefore he that deprives him of the means of getting his bread by disabling him from labour, is surely no less guilty. In the Law it was permitted to every man that had sustained such a damage by his neighbour to require the Magistrate to inflict the like on him, <hi>eye for eye, tooth for tooth,</hi> as it is Exod. 21. 24</p>
                  <p n="20">20. And though unprofitable revenge be <note place="margin">Necessity of making what satisfaction we can.</note> not now allowed to us Christians, yet sure it is the part of every one who hath done this injury, to make what <hi>satisfaction</hi> lies in his power; 'tis true, he cannot restore a limb again (which by the way should make men wary how they do those mischiefs which it is so impossible for them to repair) but yet he may satisfie for some of the ill effects of that loss: If that have brought the man to want and penury, he may, nay, he must, if he have but the least ability, relieve and support him, yea, though it be by his own extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary labour: for if it be a duty of us all to be eyes to the blinde and feet to the lame, as <hi>Job</hi> speaks, much more must we be so to them whom our selves have made blind and lame. Therefore whoever has done this injury to any of his poor brethren, let him know, he is bound to do all that is possible towards the repairing of it, if he do not, every new suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that the poor mans wants bring upon him, becomes a new charge and accusation

Thus some <hi>tyrannous humours</hi> take such a pleasure in tormenting those under their power, that they are glad when they can but finde a pretence to punish them, and then do it without all moderation, and others will set men together by the ears, only that they may have the sport of seeing the scuffle; like the <hi>old Romans,</hi> that made it one of their publick <hi>sports</hi> to see men <hi>kill one another,</hi> and sure we have as little Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as they, if we can take delight in such spectacles.</p>

<pb n="227" facs="tcp:60285:126"/>
therefore none that does this injury to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can be ignorant of the greatness of it. The corrupting of a mans wife, enticing her to a strange bed, is by all acknowledged to be the worst sort of theft, infinitely beyond that of the goods.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Indeed there is in this one, a heap of the <note place="margin">The enticing a mans wife the greatest injustice.</note> 
                     <hi>greatest injustices</hi> together; some towards the woman, and some towards the man: To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Woman</hi> there are the greatest ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; it is that <hi>injustice</hi> to her soul, which was before mentioned as the highest of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, 'tis the robbing her of her innocency <note place="margin">To the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</note> and setting her in a course of the horridst wickedness (no less then <hi>lust</hi> and <hi>perjury</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) from which it is probable she may never return, and then it proves the damning of her eternally. Next it is in respect of this world, the robbing her of her <hi>credit,</hi> making her abhorred and despised, and her very name a reproach among all men; and besides it is the depriving her of all that happiness of life, which arises from the mutual kindness and affection that is between man and wife, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead whereof this brings in a loathing, and abhorring of each other; from whence flow multitudes of mischiefs, too many to rehearse, in all which the man hath his share also.</p>

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:60285:127"/>
such an incommunicable right, that himself cannot, if he would, make it over to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; and therefore sure it canot without the utmost injustice be torn from him by any: Nor is this all, but it is <hi>farther</hi> the ingulfing him (if ever he come to discern it) in that most tormenting passion of <hi>jealousie,</hi> which is of all others the most painful, and which oft puts men upon the most desperate attempts, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 34. <hi>The rage of a man.</hi> It is yet farther, the bringing upon him all that <hi>scorn,</hi> and contempt, which by the unjust measures of the world falls on them, which are so abused, and which is by many esteemed the most insufferable part of the wrong; and though it be true that it is very unjust he should fall under reproach, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is injured, yet unless the world could be new moulded, it will certainly be his lot, and therefore it adds much to the injury: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, this may indeed be a <hi>robbery</hi> in the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al sense of the word, for perhaps it may be the thrusting in the <hi>childe of the adulterer</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his family, to share both in the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and portions of his own children; and this is an arrand theft: <hi>first,</hi> in respect of the man, who surely intends not the providing for another mans childe; and then in respect of the children, who are by that means de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of so much as that goes away with. And therefore whosoever hath <hi>this</hi> circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the sin to repent of, cannot do it effectually, without <hi>restoring</hi> to the family,

as much as he hath by this meanes rob'd it of.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

go through with it; for let no man flatter himself, that the guilt of a course and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of such a sin can be washt away with a single act of repentance; no, he must propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the repentance to the fault, and as one hath been a habit and course, so must the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also. And then how strange a madness is it for men to run into this sin (and that with such painful pursuits, as many do) which he knows must at the best hand, that is, supposing he do repent of it, cost him thus dear; but then if he do not repent, infinitely dearer; it loses him all his title to heaven, that place of purity, and gives him his portion in the lake of fire, where the burnings of his lust shall end in those everlasting burnings: For how closely soever he have acted this sin, be it so that he may have said with the adulterer in <hi>Job</hi> 25. 15. <hi>No eye seeth me,</hi> yet 'tis sure he could not in the greatest obscurity shelter himself from Gods sight, with whom <hi>the darkness is no darkness, Psalm</hi> 139. 12. And he it is, who hath expresly threatned to judge this sort of offenders, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Adulterers God will judge.</hi> God grant that all that live in this foul guilt, may so seasonably, and so throughly judge them selves, that they may prevent that severe and dreadful judgement of his.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The <hi>second</hi> thing, to which this <hi>Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Justice</hi> to our Neighbours possessions <note place="margin">His goods.</note> reacheth, is <hi>his Goods,</hi> under which general word is contained all those several sorts of things, as <hi>House, Land, Cattle, Money,</hi> and
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60285:128"/>
the like, in which he hath a right and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; these we are by the rule of this justice to suffer him to enjoy without seeking either to work him damage in any of them, or to get any of them to <hi>our selves:</hi> I make a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between these two, because there may be two several grounds or motives of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice; the one malice, the other covetousness.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The <hi>malicious</hi> man desires to work his <note place="margin">Malicious injustice.</note> neighbour mischief, though he get nothing by it himself; 'tis frequently seen, that men will make havock, and spoil of the goods of one, to whom they bear a grudge, though they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver designe to get any thing to themselves by it, but only the pleasure of doing a spight to the other: This is a most hellish humour, directly answerable to that of the Devil, who bestowes all his paines and industry, not to bring in any good to himself, but only to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and undoe others: and how contrary it is to all rules of justice, you may see by the Precept given by God to the Jews concerning the goods of an enemy, where they were so sar from being allowed a liberty of spoil and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, that they are expresly bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, <hi>Exodus</hi> 23 45. <hi>If thou meet thine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies Ox, or his Asse going astray, thou shalt surely bring it back to him again: If thou see the Asse of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldst forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him:</hi> Where you see it is a debt we owe to our very enemies, to prevent that loss and damage, which by any
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:60285:129"/>
accident he is in danger of: and that even with some labour, and pains to our selves. How horrible an injustice is it then, purposely to bring that loss, and damage on him? Who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is guilty of this let him never excuse him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by saying, he hath not inricht himself by the spoil of his neighbour, that he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it cleaves to his finger, for sure this <hi>malicious injustice</hi> is no less a fault then the <hi>covetous one;</hi> nay, I suppose in respect of the principle &amp; cause, from which it flowes, it may be greater, this hatred of another being worse then the immoderate love of our selves; whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hath thus mischieft his neighbour, he is as much bound to repair the injury, to make sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for the loss, as if he had enriched himself by it.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. But on the other side, let not the <hi>covetous</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Covetous injustice.</note> 
                     <hi>defrauder</hi> therefore judge his sin light because there is another, that in some one respect out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weighs it; for perhaps in others his may cast the scales; certainly it does in this one, that he that is unjust for greediness of gain is like to multiply more acts of this sin, then he that is so out of malice; for 'tis impossible any man should have so many objects of his malice, as he may have of his covetousness; there is no man at so general a defiance with all mankind that he hates every body; but the covetous man hath as many objects of his vice, as there be things in the world he counts valuable: But I shall not longer stand upon this comparison, 'tis sure they are both great and crying sins,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60285:129"/>
and that is ground enough of abhorring each: let us descend now to the several branches of this sort of <hi>covetous injustice;</hi> 'tis true they may all bear the name of robbery, or theft, for in effect they are all so, yet for methods sake it will not be amiss to distinguish them into these three, <hi>Oppression, Theft,</hi> and <hi>Deceit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9. By <hi>Oppression</hi> I mean that open and <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Oppression.</note> 
                     <hi>robbery,</hi> of seizing upon the possessions of others, and owning, and avowing the doing so. For the doing of this there are several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments; as first that of power, by which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Nations and Princes have been turned out of their rights, and many private men out of their estates: Sometimes again, Law is made the instrument of it; he that covets his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours lands or goods, pretends a claim to them, and then by corrupting of Justice by <hi>Bribes</hi> and <hi>gifts,</hi> or else over-ruling it by greatness and authority gets judgment on his side: This is a high oppression, and of the worst sort, thus to make the <hi>Law,</hi> which was intended for the protection, and defence of mens Rights, to be the meanes of overthrowing them; and it is a very heavie guilt, that lyes both on him that procures, and on him that pronounces such a sentence, yea, and on the <hi>Lawyer</hi> too, that pleads such a cause, for by so doing he assists in the oppression; sometimes again, the very necessities of the oppressed are the means of his oppression; thus it is in the case of Extortion, and griping <hi>Usury:</hi> a man is in extream want of money, and this gives
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60285:130"/>
opportunity to the executioner to wrest un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conscionably from him, to which the poor man is forced to yield to supply his present wants. And thus also it is often with <hi>exacting Land-Lords,</hi> who when their poor tenants know not how to provide themselves else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, rack &amp; skrew them beyond the worth of the thing. All these and many the like are but several wayes of acting this one sin of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression which becomes yet the more hainous, by how much the more helpless the person is, that is thus oppressed, therefore the oppression of the widow, and fatherless, is in Scripture mentioned as the height of this sin.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. It is indeed a most crying guilt, and <note place="margin">Gods venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance against it.</note> that against which God hath threatned his heavie <hi>vengeance,</hi> as we read in divers texts of Scriptures: Thus it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 12. <hi>He that hath oppressed the poor,</hi> and hath spoiled by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he shall <hi>surely die, his blood shall be upon him;</hi> and the same sentence is repeated against him, <hi>ver.</hi> 18. Indeed God hath so peculiarly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon him the protection of the poor, and oppressed, that he is engaged as it were in honour to be their avenger, and accordingly, <hi>Psal.</hi> 12. We see God solemnly declare his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of appearing for them, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord, I will set him in safety from him;</hi> the advice therefore of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> is excellent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22. 22. <hi>Rob not the poor, because he is poor, neither oppress the afflicted in the gate, for the Lord will plead their cause and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60285:130"/>
will spoil the soul of those that spoiled them;</hi> they are like in the end to have little joy of the booty it brings them in, when it thus engages God against them.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The <hi>second</hi> sort of this injustice is <hi>Theft,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Theft.</note> and of that also there are two kinds, the one the withholding what we should pay, and the other taking from our neighbour what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in his possession.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. Of the <hi>first</hi> sort is the not paying of <note place="margin">Not paying what we borrow.</note> 
                     <hi>debts,</hi> whether such as we have <hi>borrowed,</hi> or such as by our own voluntary promise are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our debts, for they are equally due to him, that can lay either of these claims to them; and therefore the withholding of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them is a theft, a keeping from my neighbour that which is his; yet the former of them is rather the more injurious, for by that I take from him that which he once actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had (be it money, or whatsoever else) and so make him worse then I found him: This is a very great, and very common inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; men can now a days with as great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence deny him that <hi>asks a debt,</hi> as they do him that <hi>asks an alms,</hi> nay many times 'tis made matter of quarrel for a man to demand his own, besides the many attendances the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor is put to in pursuit of it, are a yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther injury to him, by wasting his time, and taking him off from other business, and so he is made a looser that way too. This is so great injustice, that I see not how a man can look upon any thing he possesses as his own
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:60285:131"/>
right, whilst he thus denies another his. It is the duty of every man in <hi>debt,</hi> rather to strip himself of all, and cast himself again naked upon Gods providence, then thus to feather his nest with the spoils of his neighbours. And surely it would prove the more thriving course, not only in respect of the blessing, which may be expected upon justice, compared with the curse, that attends the contrary, but even in worldly prudence also; for he that defers pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of debts, will at last be forc't to it by Law, and that upon much worse terms, then he might have done it voluntarily, with a greater charge, and with such a loss of his credit, that afterward in his greatest necessities he will not know where to borrow. But the sure way for a man to secure himself from the guilt of this injustice, is never to borrow more then he knows he hath means to repay, unless it be of one, who knowing his disability, is willing to run the hazard. Otherwise he commits this sin at the very time of borrowing; for he takes that from his neighbour upon promise of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which he knows he is never likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store to him, which is a flat robbery.</p>
                  <p>The same <hi>justice</hi> which ties men to pay their <note place="margin">What we are bound for.</note> own debts, ties also every <hi>surety</hi> to pay those debts of others, for which he stands <hi>bound,</hi> in case the principal either cannot or will not: for by being <hi>bound,</hi> he hath made it his own debt, and must in all justice answer it to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, who its presumed, was drawn to send on confidence of his security, and therefore is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60285:131"/>
cheated and betrayed by him, if he see him not satisfied. If it be thought hard, that a man should pay for that which he never recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved benefit by, I shall yield it, so far as to be just matter of wariness to every man how he enter into such engagements, but it can never be made an excuse for the breaking them.</p>
                  <p>As for the other sort of <hi>debt,</hi> that which is <note place="margin">What we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</note> brought upon a man by his own <hi>voluntary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> that also cannot without great injustice be withho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>den; for it is now the mans right, and then 'tis no matter, by what means it came to be so. Therefore we see <hi>David</hi> makes it part of the description of a just man, <hi>Psa.</hi> 15. 4. that he <hi>keeps his promise yea, though they were made to his own disadvantage;</hi> and surely he is utterly unfit to <hi>ascend to that Holy Hill,</hi> there spoken of, either as that signifies the Church here, or Heaven hereafter that does not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually observe this part of justice. To this sort of debt may be reduced the wages of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, the hire of the labourer, and the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of these is a great sin, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of those that are thus injured, ascend up to God. <hi>Behold (saith</hi> S. <hi>James) the hire of the labourers which have reap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60285:132"/>
for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it, lest he cry against thee to the Lord, and it be sin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</hi> This is one of those loud clamourous sins, which will not cease crying, till it bring down Gods vengeance, and therefore though thou have no justice to thy poor brother, yet have at least so much mercy to thy self, as not to pull down judgements on thee by thus wronging him.</p>

                  <head>PARTITION XII. <hi>Of</hi> Theft; <hi>Stealing. Of</hi> Deceit <hi>in Trust, in Traffick. Of</hi> Restitution, &amp;c.</head>
                  <p>§. 1. THE <hi>second</hi> part of <hi>Theft</hi> is the taking from our neighbour <note place="margin">Stealing the goods of our neighbour.</note> that which is already in his possession; and this may be done either more violently, and openly, or else more closely, and sliely; the first is the manner of those that <hi>rob</hi> on the way, or <hi>plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> houses, where by force they take the goods of their neighbour; The other is the way of the <hi>pilfering thief,</hi> that takes away a mans goods unknown to him; I shall not dispute, which of these is the worst, 'tis enough that they are both such acts of injustice, as make men odious to God, unfit for humane society, and betray the actors to the greatest mischiefs even in this world, death it self being by Law appointed the reward of it; and there are few that follow this Trade long, but at last meet with that fruit of it. I am sure 'tis madness
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60285:132"/>
for any to believe he shall always steal secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for he is to contend with the industry of all those whom he shall thus injure, whose losses will quicken their wits for the finding him out, and which is infinitely more, he is to struggle with the justice of God, which doth usually pursue such men to destruction, even in this world; witness the many strange disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, that have been made of the craftiest thieves. But however, if he were secure from the vengeance here, I am sure nothing but repentance and reformation can secure him from the vengeance of it hereafter. And now when these dangers are weighed, 'twill surely appear, that the <hi>thief</hi> makes a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bargain, he steals his neighbours money, or cattle, and in exchange for it he must pay his life, or his soul, perhaps both, and if <hi>the whole world be too mean a price for a Soul,</hi> as he tells us, <hi>Mark</hi> 18. 36. who best knew the value of them, having himself bought them, what a strange madness is it, to barter them away for every petty trifle, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny do, who have got such a habit of stealing, that not the meanest worthless thing can es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape their fingers? Under this head of <hi>theft</hi> may be ranked the <hi>receivers</hi> of <hi>stoln</hi> goods, whether those that take them, as partners in the theft, or those that buy them, when they know or believe they are stoln. This many (that pretend much to abhor theft) are guilty of, when they can by it, buy the thing a little cheaper then the common rate. And here
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:60285:133"/>
also comes in the concealing of any goods a man finds of his neighbours, which whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver restores not, if he know, or can learn out the owner, is no better then a thief, for he withholds from his neighbour that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs to him: and sure 'twill not be uncharitable to say, that he that will do this, would likewise commit the grosser theft, were he by that no more in danger of Law then in this he is.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> part of injustice is <hi>Deceit,</hi> and in that there may be as many acts as there are <note place="margin">Deceit.</note> occasions of entercourse and dealing between man and man.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will be impossible to name the mall but I think they will be contained under these two general <hi>deceits,</hi> in matters of <hi>Trust,</hi> and in matter of <hi>Traffick,</hi> or bargaining; unless it be that of <hi>Gaming,</hi> which therefore here by the way, I must tell you, is as much a <hi>fraud</hi> and <hi>deceit</hi> as any of the rest.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that deceives a man in any <hi>Trust</hi> that is committed to him, is guilty of a great <note place="margin">In Trust.</note> in ustice, and that the most treacherous sort of one, it is the joyning of two great sins in one, <hi>defrauding;</hi> and <hi>promise-breaking;</hi> for in all trusts there is a promise implyed, if not exprest, for the very accepting of the <hi>trust</hi> contains under it a promise of fidelity; these trusts are broken sometimes to the living, sometimes to the dead; to the living there are many ways of doing it, according to the several kinds of the <hi>trust;</hi> sometimes a trust
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:60285:133"/>
is more general, like that of <hi>Potiphar</hi> to <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi> Gen. 39. 4. a man commits to another all that he hath, and thus Guardians of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and sometimes stewards are intrusted; sometimes again it is more limited, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to some one special thing: A man intrusts another to bargain, or deal for him in such a particular, or he puts some one thing into his hands, to manage, and dispose: Thus among <hi>servants</hi> it is usual for one to be intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with one part of the Masters goods, and another with another part of them. Now in all these, and the like cases, whosoever acts not for him that intrusts him, with the same faithfulness, that he would for himself, but shall either carelesly loose, or prodigally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezel the things committed to him, or else convert them to his own use, he is guilty of this great sin of betraying a trust to the living. In like manner he that being intrusted with the <hi>execution</hi> of a <hi>dead</hi> mans <hi>Testament,</hi> acts not according to the known intention of the dead man, but enriches himself by what is assigned to others, he is guilty of this sin, in respect of the dead; which is so much the greater, by how much the dead hath no means of remedy, and redress, as the living may have. It is a kind of <hi>robbing</hi> of <hi>graves</hi> which is a theft of which men naturally have such a horrour, that he must be a very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thief, that can attempt it. But either of these frauds are made yet more hainous, when either God, or the poor are immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60285:134"/>
in it; that is, when any thing is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a man. for the uses either of piety; or charity; this addes s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>criledge to both the fraud, and the treachery, and so gives him title to all those curses, that attend those se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral sins, which are so heavy, that he that for the present gain will adventure on them, makes as ill, nay, a much worse bargain, then <hi>Gehazi,</hi> 1 Kings 5. 27 who <hi>by getting the ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Naaman got his leprosie too.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>second</hi> sort of <hi>fraud</hi> is in matters of <hi>traffick</hi> and <hi>bargain,</hi> wherein there may be <note place="margin">In Traffick.</note> deceit both in the seller, and buyer; that of the seller is commonly either in concealing the faults of the commodity, or else in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The ways of <hi>concealing</hi> its faults are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary these, either <hi>first</hi> by denying that it <note place="margin">The sellers concealing the faults of his ware.</note> hath any such fault, nay, perhaps commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for the direct contrary quality, and this is down right lying, and so adds that sin to the other, and if that lie be confirmed by an oath, as it is too usually, then the yet greater guilt of perjury comes in also; and then what a heap of sins is here gathered together? abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough to sink any poor soul to destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and all this only to skrew a little more money out of his neighbours pocket, and that sometimes so very little, that 'tis a miracle that any man that thinks he has a Soul, can set it at so miserable a contemptible price. A <hi>second</hi> means of <hi>concealing</hi> is by using some Art to the thing, to make it look fair, and to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:60285:134"/>
hide the faults of it, and this is acting a lye, though it be not speaking one, which amounts to the same thing, and has surely in this case as much of the intention of cheating, and defrauding, as the most impudent forswearing can have. A <hi>Third</hi> means, is the picking out ignorant Chapmen; This is, I believe, an Art too well known among <hi>Tradesmen,</hi> who will not bring out their faulty wares to men of skil, but keep them to put off to such, whose unskilfulness may make them passable with them: and this is still the same deceit with the former; for it all tends to the same end, the cozening and defrauding of the Chapmen, and then it is not much odds, whether I make use of my own Art, or his weakness for the purpose. This is certain, he that will do justly, must let his Chapmen know what he buyes; and if his own skill enable him not to judge, (nay, if he do not actually finde out the fault) thou art bound to tell it him, otherwise thou makest him pay for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, which is not there, he presuming there is that good quality in it, which thou knowest is not, and therefore thou mayest as honestly take his money for some goods of another mans, which thou knowest thou canst never put into his possession, which I suppose no man will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be an arrant cheat. To this head of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment</hi> may be referred, that deceit of <hi>false weights</hi> and <hi>measures,</hi> for that is the conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the buyer a defect in the quantity, as the other was in the quality of the commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:60285:135"/>
and is again the making him pay for what he hath not. This sort of fraud is pointed at particularly by <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 11. 1. with this note upon it, that <hi>it is an abomination to the Lord.</hi>

The <hi>second</hi> part of fraud in the seller, <note place="margin">His over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating it.</note> lyes in <hi>over-rating</hi> the commodity; though he have not disguised, or concealed the faults of it, and so have dealt fairly in that respect; yet if he set an unreasonable price upon it, he defrauds the buyer: I call that an unreasonable price, which exceeds the true worth of the thing, considered with those moderate gains, which all Tradesmen are presumed to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Sale: Whatever is beyond this must in all likelyhood be fetcht in by some of these wayes: As <hi>first,</hi> by taking advantage of the buyers ignorance in the value of the thing, which is the same with doing it in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which hath already been shewed to be a deceit: Or <hi>secondly,</hi> by taking advantage of his necessity; thou findest a man hath present and urgent need of such a thing, and therefore takest this opportunity to set the Dice upon him; but this is that very sin of Extortion, and oppression spoken of before; for it is sure, nothing can justly raise the price of any thing, but either its becoming dearer to thee, or its being some way better in its self; but the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of thy brother causes neither of these; his nakedness doth not make the clothes thou sellest him stand thee in ever the more, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth it make them any way better; and
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60285:135"/>
therefore to rate them ever the higher, is to change thy way of trading, and sell even the wants and necessities of thy neighbour, which sure is a very unlawful vocation. Or <hi>thirdly,</hi> it may be by taking advantage of the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion of the Chapman: A man perhaps ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly fancies such a thing, and then suffers that fancy so to over rule his reason, that he resolves to have it upon any terms; If thou findest this in him, and thereupon raisest thy rate, this is to make him buy his folly, which is of all others the dearest purchase; 'tis sure his fancy adds nothing to the real value, no more then his necessity did in the former case, and therefore should not adde to the price. He therefore that will deal justly in the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of selling, must not catch at all advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which the temper of his Chapman may give, but consider soberly, what the thing is worth, and what he would afford it for to another, of whom he had no such advantage, and accordingly rate it to him at no higher a price.</p>

him to sell, and permit him not to stay to make the best bargain, but forces him to take the first offer; and here for the buyer to grate upon him, because he sees him in that strait is the same fault which I before shewed it to be in the seller.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. In this whole business of <hi>traffick</hi> there are so many opportunities of deceit that a man <note place="margin">Many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to deceit in Traffick.</note> had need fence himself with a very firm reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, nay, love of justice, or he will be in danger to fall under temptation; for as the Wise man speaks, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 27. 2. <hi>As a Nail sticks fast between the joynings of the Stones,</hi> so doth sin stick close between <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>selling;</hi> it is so interwoven with all Trades, so mixt with the very first principles, and grounds of them, that it is taught together with them, and so becomes part of the Art; so that he is now a dayes scarce thought fit to manage a Trade, that wants it, while he that has most of this black Art of defrauding, applauds and huggs himself, nay, perhaps boasts to others, how he hath over-reacht his neighbour.</p>
                  <p>What an intolerable shame is this, that we <hi>Christians,</hi> who are by the precepts of our <note place="margin">The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monness of injustice a reproach to Christianity</note> Master set to those higher duties of Charity, should in stead of practising them, quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learn those common rules of justice, which meer Nature teaches? For, I think, I may say, there are none of those several branches of injustice towards the possessions of our neighbour, which would not be adjudged to be so by any sober Heathen; so that, as Saint
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:60285:136"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> tells those of the Circumcision, that the Name of God <hi>was blasphemed among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> by that unagreeableness that was betwixt their practice, and their Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 24. So now may it be said of us, that the <hi>Name of Christ is blasphemed among the Turks and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> by the vile and scandalous lives of us, who call our selves Christians, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this sin of injustice; For shame let us at last endeavour to wipe of this reproach from our profession, by leaving these practices, to which me thinks this one single consideration should be enough to perswade us.</p>

thinkest thou hast been very cunning, when thou hast over reacht thy brother; but God knowes all the while, there is another over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching thee, and cheating thee of what is infinitely more precious, even thy Soul: the Devil herein deals with thee as Fishers use to do; those that will catch a great fish, will bait the hook with a less, and so the great one coming with greediness to devour that, is himself taken: So thou that art gaping to swallow up thy poor brother, art thy self made a prey to that great devourer. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! what will it ease thee in Hell, that thou hast left wealth behind thee upon earth, when thou shalt there want that, which the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est beggar here injoyes, even drop of water to cool thy tongue.

But perhaps it may be said, it will not in all cases be pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to make restitution to the wronged par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, peradventure he may be dead; in that case then make it to his Heirs, to whom his right descends.

course of fraud, may have injured many, that he cannot now remember, and many that he has no means of finding out: In this case all I can advise is this: <hi>First,</hi> to be as diligent as is possible, both in recalling to minde who they were, and endeavouring to finde them out; and when, after all thy care, that proves impossible, let thy Restitutions be made to the poor, and that they may not be made by halves, be as careful as thou canst to reckon every the least mite of unjust gain, but when that cannot exactly be done, as 'tis sure it cannot by those who have multiplyed the acts of fraud, yet even there let them make some general measures, whereby to proportion their restitution: as for example, a <hi>Trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> that cannot remember how much he has cheated in every single parcel, yet may possibly guess in the gross whether he have u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually over-reacht to the value of a third, or a fourth part of the wares, and then what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion soever he think he has so defrauded, the same proportion let him now give out of that estate he hath raised by his trade: but herein it concerns every man to deal upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in the presence of God, and not to make advantage of his own forgetfulness, to the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting short of the Restitution, but rather go on the other hand, and be sure rather to give too much, then too little. If he do happen to give somewhat over, he need not grudge the charge of such a <hi>sin offering,</hi> and 'tis sure he will not if he do heartily desire an <hi>atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>

Many other difficulties there may be in this business of <hi>restitution,</hi> which will not be foreseen, and so cannot now be particularly spoke to; but the more of those there are, the greater horrour ought men to have of running into the sin of <hi>injustice,</hi> which it will be so difficult, if not impossible for them to repair, and the more careful ought they to be to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie that which is the root of all injustice, to wit <hi>Covetousness.</hi>

                  <p>§. 1.

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60285:139"/>
thing; but that upon such weak grounds, that 'tis as likely to be false as true. In either of these cases, there is a great guilt lyes upon the reporter. That there doth so in the <hi>first</hi> of them, no body will doubt, every one acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging that it is the greatest baseness to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a <hi>lie</hi> of another; but there is as little reason to question the other, for he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a thing as a truth, which is but uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is a liar also, or if he do not report it as a certainty, but only as a probability, yet then though he be not guilty of the lie, yet he is of the injustice of robbing his neighbour of his credit; for there is such an aptness in men to believe ill of others, that any the lightest jealousie will, if once it be spread abroad, serve for that purpose; and sure it is a most horrible injustice upon every slight surmize, and fancy, to hazard the bringing so great an evil upon another; especially when it is considered, that those surmizes commonly spring rather from some censoriousness, pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishness, or malice in the surmizer, then from any real fault in the person so suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The manner of spreading these false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of both kinds, is not always the same; <note place="margin">False witnes</note> sometimes it is more <hi>open</hi> and avowed, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more <hi>close</hi> and private: the open is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times by <hi>false witness</hi> before the Court of Justice; and this not only hurts a man in his credit, but in other respects also; 'tis the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him up to the punishment of the Law,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60285:139"/>
and according to the nature of the crime pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, does him more or less mischief; but if it be of the highest kind, it may concern <hi>his life,</hi> as we see it did in <hi>Naboths</hi> case, 1 <hi>King</hi> 21. How great and crying a sin it is in this respect, as also in that of the perjury, you may learn from what hath been said of both those sins. I am now to consider it only, as it touches the credit; and to that it is a most grievous wound, thus to have a crime pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly witnessed against one, and such as is scarce curable by any thing that can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be done to clear him, and therefore whoever is guilty of this, doth a most outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous injustice to his neighbour; this is that which is expresly forbidden in the <hi>ninth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> and was by God appointed to be punisht by the inflicting of the <hi>very same suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> upon him, which his false testimony aimed to bring upon the other. <hi>Deut.</hi> 19. 16.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>second</hi> open way of spreading these <note place="margin">Publick slanders.</note> reports, is by a <hi>publick</hi> and common declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them; though not before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, as in the other case, yet <hi>in all compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and before such as are likely to carry it farther, and this is usually done with bitter railings, and reproaches, it being an ordinary Art of slanderers, to <hi>revile</hi> those whom they slander, that so by the sharpness of the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, they may have the greater impression in the minds of the hearers; this both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the slander, and the railing, is a high
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:60285:140"/>
injury, and both of them such, as debar the committers from Heaven; thus <hi>Psal.</hi> 15. where the upright man is described, that shall have his part there, this is one special thing, vers. 3. <hi>That he slandereth not his neighbour.</hi> And for railing the Apostle in several places reckons it amongst those works of the flesh, which are to shut men out both from the <hi>Church here by excommunication,</hi> as you may see 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 11. and from the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God hereafter, as it is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The other more close and private way <note place="margin">Whispering.</note> os spreading such reports is that of the <hi>Whisper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> he that goes about from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and privately vents his slanders, not out of an intent by that means to make them less publick, but rather more; this trick of delivering them by way of secret, being the way to make them both more believed, and more spoken of too; for he that receives such a tale, as a secret from one, thinks to please some body else, by delivering it as a secret to him also; and so it passes from one hand to another, till at last it spread over a whole Town: This sort of slanderer is of all others the most dangerous, for he works in the <hi>dark,</hi> tyes all he speaks to, not to own him as the author, so that whereas in the more publick accusations, the party may have some means of clearing himself and detecting his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, here he shall have no possibility of that, the slander, like a secret poison, works incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:60285:140"/>
effects, before ever the man discern it. This sin of whispering is by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among those great crimes, which are the effects of a reprobate mind, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 29. It is indeed one of the most incurable wounds of this sword of the tongue; the very bane and pest of humane society; and that which not onely robs single persons of their good names, but oftentimes whole families, nay, publick societies of men of their peace, what ruines: what confusions hath this one sin wrought in the world? 'Tis <hi>Solomons</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. 28. That a <hi>whisperer sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rateth chief friends,</hi> and sure one may truly say of tongues thus imployed, that they are <hi>set on fire of Hell,</hi> as Saint <hi>James</hi> saith, Chap. 3. 6.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This is such a guilt that we are to beware <note place="margin">Several steps toward this sin.</note> of all the <hi>degrees</hi> of approach to it, of which there are several steps; the <hi>first</hi> is the giving ear to, and cherishing of those that come with slanders, for they that entertain and receive them, incourage them in the practise; for as our common proverb says, if there were no Receivers, there would be no thief; so if there were none that would give an ear to tales, there would be no talebearers. A <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> step is, the giving too easie credit to them, for this helps them to attain part of their end, they desire to beget a general ill opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such a man, but the way of doing it must be by causing it, <hi>first,</hi> in particular men: and if thou suffer them to do it in thee, they
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:60285:141"/>
have so far prospered in their aim. And for thy own part thou dost a great injustice to thy neighbour to believe ill of him without a just ground, which the accusation of such a person certainly is not. A <hi>third</hi> step is the reporting to others, what is thus told thee; by which thou makest thy self directly a party in the slander, and after thou hast unjustly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from thy neighbour thy own good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, endeavourest to rob him also of that of others. This is very little below the guilt of the <hi>first whisperer,</hi> and tends as much to the ruine of our neighbours credit. And these several degrees have so close a dependance one upon another, that it will be very hard for him that allows himself the <hi>first,</hi> to escape the other; and indeed he that can take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to hear his neighbour defamed, may well he presumed of so malitious a humour, that 'tis not likely he should stick at spreading the slander. He therefore that will preserve his innocence in this matter, must never in the least degree cherish or countenance any that brings these false reports. And it is not less necessary to his peace, then to his innocency; for he that once entertains them, must never expect quiet, but shall be continually incited, and stirred up even against his neerest, and deerest relations; so that this whisperer, and slanderer is to be look't on by all, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemy, he being so as well to those to whom, as of whom he speaks.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. But besides <hi>this</hi> grosser way of <hi>slander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi>
                     <pb n="257" facs="tcp:60285:141"/>
there is <hi>another,</hi> whereby we may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and lessen the <hi>credit</hi> of our neighbour, and that is by <hi>contempt,</hi> and <hi>despising;</hi> one <note place="margin">Despising and scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing.</note> common effect whereof is <hi>scoffing,</hi> and deriding him. This is very injurious to a mans reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the generality of men do rather take up opinions upon trust, then judgement; and therefore if they see a man despised, and scorned, they will be apt to do the like. But besides this effect of it, there is a present in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice in the very act of despising, and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others. There are ordinarily but three things, which are made the occasions of it, (unless it be with such, with whom virtue and godliness are made the most reproachful things, and such despising is not only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to our neighbour, but even to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for whose sake it is, that he is so despised) those three are <hi>first</hi> the <hi>infirmities, secondly</hi> the <hi>calamities, thirdly</hi> the <hi>sins</hi> of a man, and each of these are very far from being ground of our triumphing over him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>First,</hi> for <hi>infirmities,</hi> be they either of <note place="margin">For infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note> body or mind, the deformity and unhandsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the one, or the weakness, and folly of the other, they are things out of his power to help, they are not his faults, but the wise dispensations of the great Creator, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stows the excellency of body and minde, as he pleases, and therefore to scorn a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath them not, is in effect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach God who gave them not to him.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. So also for the <hi>calamities,</hi> and miseries, <note place="margin">For cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities.</note>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:60285:142"/>
that befall a man, be it want, or sickness, or whatever else, these also come by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, who raiseth up, and pulleth down, as seems good to him, and it belongs not to us to judge, what are the motives to him to do so, as many do, who upon any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that befals another, are presently conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that sure it is some extraordinary guilt, which pulls this upon him, though they have no particular to lay to his charge. This rash judgement our Saviour reproves in the <hi>Jews, Luk.</hi> 13. where on occasion of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary sufferings of the <hi>Galileans,</hi> he asks them, vers. 2. <hi>Suppose ye that these Galileans were sinners above all the Galileans, because they suffered such things? I tell you nay, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you repent, ye shall all likewise perish:</hi> when we see Gods hand heavy upon others, it is no part of our business to judge them, but our selves, and by repentance to prevent, what our own sins have deserved. But to reproach, and revile any that are in affliction, is that barbarous cruelty, taken notice of by the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> as the heighth of wickedness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 69. 26. <hi>They persecute him whom thou hast smit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and they talk to the grief of them whom thou hast wounded:</hi> In all the miseries of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, compassion becomes a debt to them; how unjust are they then, that in stead of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them that debt, afflict them with scorn and reproach?</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Nay the very <hi>sins</hi> of men, though as <note place="margin">For sins.</note> they have more of their <hi>wills</hi> in them, they
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:60285:142"/>
may seem more to deserve reproach, yet cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they also oblige us to the former duty of compassion, and that in the highest degree, as being the things, which of all others make a man the most miserable; in all these cases, if we consider how subject we are to the like our selves; and that it is only Gods mercy to us, by which we are preserved from the worst that any man else is under, it will surely better become us to look up to him with thankfulness, then down on them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and despising. Thus you see <hi>the direct</hi> injustice of <hi>scorning</hi> and <hi>contemning</hi> our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to which when <hi>that other</hi> is added, which naturally followes, as a consequent of this; to wit, the begetting the like contempt in others, there can sure be no doubt of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a great and <hi>horrible injustice</hi> to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in respect of his credit.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Now how great the injury of <hi>destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Destroying the credit a great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</note> a mans <hi>credit</hi> is, may be measured by these two things; <hi>first,</hi> the value of the thing he is rob'd of, and <hi>secondly</hi> the difficulty of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reparations. For the <hi>first,</hi> 'tis commonly known, that a mans good name is a thing he holds most precious, oftentimes dearer then his life, as we see by the hazards men some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times run to preserve even a mistaken reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but 'tis sure it is that, which hath even by sober men been esteemed one of the greatest happinesses of life: And to some sort of men, such especially as subsist by dealings in the world, tis so necessary, that it may well be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:60285:143"/>
as the means of their livelyhood, and then sure, 'tis no slight matter to rob a man of what is thus valuable to him.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the difficulty of making <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations</hi> increaseth the injury, and that is such in this case of defamation, that I may <note place="margin">And irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairable.</note> rather call it an impossibility then a difficulty: For when men are possest of an ill opinion of a person, 'tis no easie matter to work it out; so that the slanderer is herein like a <hi>yong Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurer,</hi> that <hi>raises a Devil he knowes not how to lay again.</hi> Nay, suppose men were generally as willing to lay down ill conceits of their neighbours, as they are to take them up, yet how is it possible for him that makes even the most <hi>publick recantation</hi> of his slander, to be sure that every man that hath come to the hearing of the one, shall do so of the other also? And if there be but one person, that doth not, (as probably there will be many) then is the reparation still short of the injury.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. This consideration is very fit to make <note place="margin">Yet every guilty person must do all he can to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</note> men afraid of doing this wrong to their neighbour; but let it not be made use of to excuse those that have already done the wrong, from endeavouring to make the best <hi>reparations</hi> they can; for though 'tis oddes, it will not equal the injury, yet let them how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever do what they are able towards it: And this is so necessary towards the obtaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the sin, that none must expect the one, that do not perform the other. Whosoever therefore sets himself to repent of his faults
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60285:143"/>
of this kind, must by all prudent means endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to restore his neighbour to that degree of credit he hath deprived him of; and if that be not to be done without bringing the shame upon himself, of confessing publickly the slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he must rather submit to that, then be wanting to this necessary part of justice, which he owes to the wronged party.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Thus I have gone through these four branches of <hi>Negative Justice</hi> to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; wherein we must yet further observe, that this justice bindes us not onely in respect of our words, and actions, but of our very <hi>thoughts,</hi> and affections also; we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbid to hurt, but to hate, not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained <note place="margin">Justice in the thoughts.</note> from bringing any of these evils fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned upon him, but we must not so much as wish them before, not delight in them after they are befallen him: we must take no pleasure either in the sin of his Soul, or hurt of his body; we must not <hi>envie</hi> him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good thing he enjoyes, nor so much as <hi>wish</hi> to possess our selves of it: Neither will it suffice us, that we so bridle our <hi>tongue,</hi> that we neither slander, nor revile, if we have that malice in our <hi>hearts,</hi> which makes us <hi>wish</hi> his discredit; or rejoyce, when we finde it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, though we have no hand in the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it. This is the peculiar property of <hi>Gods Lawes,</hi> that they reach to the <hi>heart;</hi> whereas mens can extend only to the words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and the reason is clear, because he is the only Law-giver, that can see what is in the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60285:144"/>
heart, therefore if there were the perfectest innocency in our tongue, and hands, yet if there be not this purity of heart, it will never serve to acquit us before him. The counsel therefore of <hi>Solomon</hi> is excellent, <hi>Prov</hi> 4. 23. <hi>Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life.</hi> Let us strictly guard that, so that no malicious unjust thought en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter there; and that not only, as it may be the means of betraying us to the grosser act, but also as it is in it self such a pollution in Gods sight, as will unfit us for the blessed vision of God, whom none but the pure in heart have promise of seeing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 8. <hi>Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14. I come now to speak of the <hi>Positive</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Positive Justice.</note> part of <hi>Justice,</hi> which is the yielding to every man that which by any kinde of right he may challenge from us. Of these dues there are <hi>some</hi> that are generall to all mankinde, <hi>others</hi> that are restrained within some certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and qualities of men, and become due only by vertue of those qualifications.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Of the <hi>first</hi> sort, that is those, that <note place="margin">Speaking Truth a due to all men.</note> are due to all men, we may reckon <hi>first</hi> the speaking <hi>Truth,</hi> which is a common debt we owe to all mankinde; speech is given us as the instrument of intercourse and society, one with another, the meanes of discovering the mind which otherwise lyes hid, and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, so that were it not for this, our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations would be but the same as of beasts: Now this being intended for the good and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:60285:144"/>
of mankind, 'tis a due to it, that it be used to that purpose; but he that Lyes, is so far from paying that debt, that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary he makes his speech the means of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and deceiving him he speaks to.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. There might much be said to shew the <note place="margin">Lying ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden in Scripture.</note> several sorts of Obligations we lye under, to speak <hi>truth</hi> to all men; but supposing I write to Christians, I need not insist on any other, then the Commands we have of it in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 4 25. the Apostle commands that <hi>putting away lying, they speak every man truth with his neighbour:</hi> And again, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Lye not one to another:</hi> and <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. 17. <hi>a lying tongue is mentioned as one</hi> of those things that are <hi>abominations to the Lord.</hi> Yea so much doth he hate a lye, that it is not the most pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and religious end, that can reconcile him to it, the man that lyes, though in a zeal to Gods glory, shall yet be judged as a sinner, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 7. what shall then become of those multitudes of men that lye on quite other ends? some out of malice, to mischief others, some out of covetousness to defraud their neighbours, some out of pride, to set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out, and some out of fear, to avoid a danger or hide a fault. But of a yet stranger sort, then all these, are those, that do it without any discernable temptation, that will tell lyes by way of story, take pleasure in tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incredible things, from which themselves reap nothing, but the reputation of imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>lyars.</hi>

17. Among these divers kinds of falshoods, <hi>Truth</hi> is become such a <hi>rarity</hi> among us, that it is a most difficult matter, to finde such a <note place="margin">The great commonness and folly of this sin.</note> man as <hi>David</hi> describes, <hi>Psalm</hi> 15. 2. <hi>That speaketh the truth from his heart.</hi> Men have so glibbed their tongues to lying, that they do it familiarly upon any or no occasion, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinking that they are observed either by God or man. But they are extreamly decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in both; for there is scarce any sin (that is at all endeavoured to be hid) which is more discernable even to men: they that have a custom of lying, seldom fail, be their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry never so good) at some time or other to betray themselves; and when they do, there is no sort of sin, meets with greater scorn, and reproach; a Lyar being by all accounted a title of the greatest infamy, and shame. But as for God, 'tis madness to hope that all their Arts can disguise them from him, who needs none of those casual wayes of discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which men do, but sees the heart, and so knowes at the very instant of speaking, the falshood of what is said: and then by his Title of <hi>The God of Truth,</hi> is tyed not only to hate, but punish it, and accordingly you see, <hi>Rev</hi> 20. that the Lyars are in the number of those that are <hi>shut out of the new Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> and not only so, but also have their <hi>part in the Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone.</hi> If therefore thou be not of the humour of that unjust Judge Christ speaks of, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 2. Who <hi>neither feared God, nor regarded

man,</hi> thou must resolve on this part of Justice, the putting away lying, which is abhorred by both.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. A <hi>second</hi> thing we owe to all is <hi>Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Courteous behaviour a due to all men.</note> and <hi>Courtesie</hi> of behaviour, contrary to that sullen churlishness we finde spoken of in <hi>Nabal,</hi> who was of such a temper, <hi>that a man could not speak to him,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25. 17. There is sure so much of respect due to the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mankinde, that no accidental advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of health or honour, which one man hath above another, can acquit him from that debt to it, even in the person of the meanest; and therefore that crabbed and harsh behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to any that bears but the form of a man, is an injustice to that nature he partakes of. And when we consider how much that nature is dignified by the Son of God his taking it upon him, the obligation to reverence it is yet greater, and consequently the sin of thus contemning it.</p>
                  <p n="19">19.

the sentence of our blessed Saviour, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 11. <hi>He that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted,</hi> which we often finde made good to us, in the strange down falls of proud men. And it is no wonder, for this sin makes both God and men our enemies; God, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture every where testifies, abhorres it, and all that are guilty of it, and men are by means of it used so contemptuously and unkindly by us, that they are by nothing more provoked against us, and then whom God and man thus resist, who shall secure and uphold?</p>

That this duty of <hi>meekness</hi> is to be extended to all men, there is no doubt; for the Apostle in express words commands it, 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5. 14. <hi>Be patient to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards all men,</hi> and that it should seem in spite of all provocation to the contrary, for the very next words are, <hi>See that none ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der evil for evil, or railing for railing:</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> is commanded to exercise this <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> even towards them who oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against the Doctrine of the Gospel, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

21. This vertue of <hi>meekness</hi> is so necessary to the preserving the peace of the world, that it is no wonder, that Christ, who came to plant peace among men, should injoyn <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Brauling very insuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable.</note> to all. I am sure the contrary effects of rage and anger are every where discernable, it breeds disquiet in Kingdomes, in Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, in Families, and even between the neerest relations; 'tis such a humour, that <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> warns us never to enter a friendship with a man that is of it, Prov. 22. 24. <hi>Make no friendship with an angry man, and with a furious man thou shalt not go.</hi> It makes a man unfit to be either friend or companion, and indeed makes one insufferable to all that have to do with one, as we are again taught by <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> Prov. 21. 19 where he prefers the <hi>dwelling</hi> in a <hi>wilderness, rather then with a contentious and angry woman,</hi> and yet a woman has ordinarily only that one weapon of the tongue to offend with. Indeed to any that have not the same unquietness of humor, there can scarce be a greater uneasiness, then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with those, that have it, though it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver proceed farther, then words. How great this sin is, we may judge by what our Saviour says of it, <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. where there are several degrees of punishment allotted to several de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it; but alas! we dayly outgo that, which he there sets as the highest step of this sin; the calling <hi>thou fool,</hi> is a modest sort of reviling, compared with those multitudes of bitter reproaches we use in our rages.</p>

This is a kinde of saying our prayers backward indeed, which is said to be part of the ceremony the Devil uses, at the making of a <hi>Witch,</hi> and we have in this case also reason to look on it, as a means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us into acquaintance, and league with that accursed spirit here, and to a perpetual abide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him hereafter. 'Tis the language of Hell, which can never fit us to be Citizens of the <hi>New Jerusalem,</hi> but marks us out for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that <hi>land of darkness.</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this with the advice of the Apostle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 31. <hi>Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. Having spoken thus far of those com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">Particular dues.</note> dues, wherein all men are concerned, and have a right, I am now to proceed to those other sorts of dues, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to particular persons, by vertue of some special qualification. These qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:60285:147"/>
may be of <hi>three</hi> kinds, that of <hi>excellency,</hi> that of <hi>Want,</hi> and that of <hi>Relation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="24">24. By that of <hi>excellency,</hi> I mean any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <note place="margin">A respect due to men of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts.</note> gifts, or endowments of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; such as wisdom, learning, and the like, but especially grace: these being the singular gifts of God, have a great value and respect due to them, wheresoever they are to be found; and this we must readily pay by a willing, and glad acknowledgement of those his gifts in any he has bestowed them on, and bearing them a reverence, and respect, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thereunto, and not out of an overween<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our own excellencies, despise and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue those of others, as they do, who will yeild nothing to be reason, but what them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves speak, nor any thing piety, but what agrees with their own practice.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. Also we must not <hi>envy,</hi> or grudge that they have those gifts, for that is not only <note place="margin">We are not to envy them.</note> an injustice to them, but injurious also to God who gave them as it is at large set forth in the <hi>parable</hi> of the <hi>labourers, Mat.</hi> 20. where he asks them, who grumbled at the masters bounty to others, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own, is thine eye evil be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause mine is good?</hi> This envying at Gods goodness to others, is in effect a murmuring against God, who thus disposes it, neither can there be a greater, and more direct op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position against him, then for me to hate and wish ill to a man, for no other reason, but because God has loved and done well to him.
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:60285:148"/>
and then in respect of the <hi>man,</hi> 'tis the most unreasonable thing in the world, to love him the less, meerly because he has those good qualities, for which I ought to love him more.</p>
                  <p n="26">26. Neither must we <hi>detract</hi> from the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies <note place="margin">Nor detract from them.</note> of others, we must not seek to eclipse or darken them by denying either the kinds, or degrees of them; by that means to take off that esteem, which is due to them. This sin of detraction is generally the effect of the former, of envy, he that envies a mans worth, will be apt to do all he can to lessen it in the opinions of others, and to that purpose will either speak slightly of his excellencies; or if they be so apparent, that he knows not how to cloud them, he will try if he can by report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some either real, or feigned infirmity of his, take off from the value of the other, and so by casting in some <hi>dead flies,</hi> as the wise man speaks, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 10. 1. Strive to <hi>corrupt the savour of the ointment:</hi> this is a great inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and directly contrary to that duty we owe, of acknowledging, and reverencing the gifts of God in our brethren.</p>
                  <p n="27">27. And both those sins of <hi>envy,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The folly of both those sins.</note> do usually prove as great follies, as wickedness; the envy constantly brings pain, and torment to a mans self, whereas if he could but cheerfully, and gladly look on those good things of anothers, he could never fail to be the better for them himself; the very pleasure of seeing them would be some advantage to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:60285:148"/>
him but besides that those gifts of his brother may be many ways helpful to him, his wisdom and learning may give him instruction; his piety, and vertue, example, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but all this the envious man loseth, and hath nothing in exchange for it, but a continual fretting, and gnawing of heart.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. And then for <hi>detraction,</hi> that can hardly be so mannaged, but it will be found out; he that is still putting in Caveats against mens good thoug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts of others, will quickly discover himself to do it out of envy, and then that will be sure to lessen their esteem of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but not of those he envies, it being a sort of bearing testimony to those excellencies, that he thinks them worth the envying.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. What hath been said of the value, and <note place="margin">A respect due to men in regard of their ranks and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> respect due to those excellencies of the minde, may in a lower degree be applyed to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward advantages of <hi>honour,</hi> greatness, and the like. These though they are not of equal value with the former (and such for which no man is to prize himself) yet in regard, that these degrees, and distinctions of men are by Gods wise providence disposed, for the better ordering of the world, there is such a <hi>civil respect</hi> due to those, to whom God hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penc'd them, as may best preserve that order, for which they were intended. Therefore all inferiours are to behave themselves to their superiours with modesty, and respect, and not by a rude boldness confound that order which it hath pleased God to set in the world, but
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:60285:149"/>
according as our Church-Catechism teaches, <hi>order themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters.</hi> And here the former caution against <hi>envy</hi> comes in most seasonably; these outward advantages being things, of which generally men have more taste, then of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore will be more apt to envy, and repine to see others exceed them therein, to this therefore all the former considerations against envy will be very proper, and the more necessary to be made use of, by how much the temptation is in this case to most minds the greater.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. The <hi>second</hi> qualification is that of <hi>want;</hi> whoever is in <hi>distress</hi> for any thing, wherewith <note place="margin">Dues to those that are in any sort of want.</note> I can supply him, that distress of his makes it a duty in me so to supply him, and this in all kinds of wants. Now the ground of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>duty</hi> is, that God hath given men abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not only for their own use, but for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and benefit of others, and therefore what is thus given for their use, becomes a debt to them, whenever their need requires it. Thus he that is <hi>ignorant</hi> and wants knowledge is to be <hi>instructed</hi> by him, that hath it, and this is one special end, why that knowledge is given him: <hi>The tongue of the learned is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to speak a word in season. Esay</hi> 50. 4. He that is in <hi>sadness,</hi> and affliction, is to be <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted</hi> by him that is himself in cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. This we see Saint <hi>Paul</hi> makes it the end of Gods comforting him, that he <hi>might be able to comfort them that are in any trouble,</hi>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:60285:149"/>
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4. He that is in any course of sin, and wants reprehension and counsel, must have that want supplied to him by those who have such abilities, and opportunities, as may make it likely to do good. That this is a justice we owe to our neighbour, appears plainly by that text, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19. 17 <hi>Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, thou shalt in any wise reprove him, and not suffer sin upon him;</hi> where we are under the same obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reprove him, that we are not to hate him. He that lies under any <hi>slander,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just defamation, is to be defended, and <hi>cleered</hi> by him, that knows his innocence, or else he makes himself guilty of the slander, because he neglects to do that which may remove it; and how great an injustice, that of slandering our neighbour is, I have already shewed.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. <hi>Lastly,</hi> he that is in <hi>poverty</hi> and need, <note place="margin">To the poor.</note> must be relieved by him that is in plenty; and he is bound to it, not only in charity, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in justice. <hi>Solomon</hi> calls it a due, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 27. <hi>Withhold not good from him to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it:</hi> and what that good is, he explains in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry next verse: Say <hi>not to thy neighbour, go and come again, and to morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee:</hi> It seems 'tis the withholding a due, so much as to defer giving to our poor neighbour. And we finde God did among the <hi>Jews</hi> separate a certain portion of every mans increase to the use of the poor, <hi>a tenth</hi> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>third year</hi> (which is all one with a <hi>thirtieth
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:60285:150"/>
part every year, Deut.</hi> 14. 28. 29. And this was to be paid not as a charity, or liberality, but as a debt, they were unjust, if they withheld it. And surely we have no reason to think, that Christian justice is sunk so much below the <hi>Jewish,</hi> that either nothing at all, or a less proportion is now required of us. I wish our practise were but at all answerable to our obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in this point, and then surely we should not see so many <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s lie unrelieved at our doors, they having a better right to our superfluities, then we our selves have, and then what is it, but arrant robbery to bestow that upon our vanities, nay our sins, which should be their portion.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. In all the foregoing <hi>cases,</hi> he that hath <note place="margin">God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws those abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are not thus imployed.</note> ability is to look upon himself, as Gods stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, who hath put it into his hands to distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to them, that want, and therefore not to do it, is the same injustice and fraud, that it would be in any <hi>steward</hi> to purse up that money for his private benefit, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to him, for the maintainance of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and he that shall do thus, hath just rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to expect the doom of the <hi>unjust steward,</hi> Luke 16. <hi>to be put out of the stewardship,</hi> to have those abilities taken from him, which he hath so unfaithfully imployed. And as for all the rest, so particularly for that of <hi>wealth,</hi> 'tis very commonly to be observed, that it is withdrawn from those that thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud the poor of their parts, the griping miser coming often by strange undiscernable
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:60285:150"/>
wayes to poverty; and no wonder, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no title to Gods blessing on his heap, who does not consecrate a part to him in his poor members. And therefore we see the <hi>Israelites</hi> before they could make that challenge of Gods promise to bless them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 26. 15. <hi>Look down from thy holy habitation and bless thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Israel,</hi> &amp;c. they were first to pay the poor mans tithes, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. without which they could lay no claim to it. This withholding <hi>more then is meet,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. 24. <hi>tends to poverty;</hi> and therefore as thou wouldst play the <hi>good husband</hi> for thy self, be careful to perform this justice according to thy abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to all that are in want.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. The <hi>third qualification</hi> is that of <hi>Relation,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</note> and of that there may be divers sorts, arising from divers grounds, and duties, answerable to each of them. There is first a <hi>relation</hi> of a <hi>Debter</hi> to a Creditor; and he that stands in that relation to any, whether by vertue of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, loan, or promise, 'tis his duty to pay justly what he owes, if he be able (as on the otherside if he be not; 'tis the Creditors, to deal charitably and Christianly with him, and not to exact of him beyond his ability.) But I need not insist on this, having already by shewing you the sin of <hi>withholding debts,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed you of this duty.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. There is also a <hi>relation</hi> of an <hi>obliged</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Gratitude to Benefactors.</note> 
                     <hi>person</hi> to his <hi>Benefactor,</hi> that is one that hath done him <hi>good,</hi> of what kind soever, whether <hi>spiritual,</hi> or <hi>corporal;</hi> and the duty of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:60285:151"/>
is, <hi>first thankfulness,</hi> that is a ready and hearty acknowledgement of the courtesie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: <hi>secondly, prayer</hi> for Gods blessings, and rewards upon him; and <hi>thirdly,</hi> an endeavour, as opportunity and ability serves, to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of kindness, by doing good turns back again. This duty of <hi>gratitude</hi> to <hi>Benefactors</hi> is so generally acknowledged by all, even the most barbarous and savagest of men, that he must have put off much of his humane nature, that refuses to perform it. The very <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans</hi> and <hi>sinners,</hi> as our <hi>Saviour</hi> sayes, <hi>do good to those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>a do good to them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="35">35. Yet how many of us fail even in this, <note place="margin">The contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</note> how frequent is it to see men, not only neglect to repay curtesies, but return injuries in stead of them? it is too observable in many particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, but in none more, then in the case of <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> and <hi>admonition,</hi> which is of all others, the most precious part of kindness, the real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest good turn that can be done from one man to another. And therefore those that do this to us, should be lookt on, as our prime and <hi>Greatest Benefactors.</hi> But alas! how few are there that can finde gratitude, shall I say? nay patience for such a courtesie? Go about to admonish a man of a fault, or tell him of an Errour, he presently looks on you, as his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, you are, as <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Galatians, Chap.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>become his enemy because you tell him the truth;</hi> such a pride there is in mens hearts, that they must not be told of any thing amiss, though it be with no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:60285:151"/>
but that they may amend it. A strange madness this is, the same that it would be in a sick man, to fly in the face of him that comes to cure him, on a fancy that he disparaged him in supposing him sick; so that we may well say with the Wise man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>He that hateth reproof is bruitish.</hi> There cannot be in the world a more unhappy temper, for it fortifies a man in his sins, raises such Mounts, and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks about them, that no man can come to assault them; and if we may believe <hi>Solomon, destruction will not fail to attend it, Prov.</hi> 29. 1. <hi>He that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</hi> But then again in respect of the admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisher, 'tis the greatest injustice, I may say, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty that can be, he comes in tenderness, and compassion to rescue thee from danger, and to that purpose puts himself upon a very uneasie task; for such the general impatience men have to admonition, hath now made it; and what a defeat, what a grief is it to him to find, that in stead of reforming the <hi>first</hi> fault, thou art run into a <hi>second;</hi> to wit, that of causless displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against him? This is one of the worst, and yet I doubt, the commonest sort of unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to <hi>Benefactors,</hi> and so a great failing in that duty we owe to that sort of relation. But perhaps these will be look't on as remote re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations (yet 'tis sure they are such as challenge all that duty I have assigned to them) I shall in the next place proceed to those relations, which are by all acknowledged to be of the greatest neerness.</p>

                  <p>§ 1. THE <hi>first</hi> of those neerer sorts <note place="margin">Duty to Parents.</note> of relations, is that of a <hi>Parent;</hi> And here it will be necessary to consider the several sorts of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> according to which the duty of them is to be measured. Those are these three, the <hi>Civil,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> the <hi>Natural.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Civil Parent</hi> is he, whom God hath establisht the <hi>Supream Magistrate,</hi> who <note place="margin">Duties to the Supream Magistrate.</note> by a just right possesses the Throne in a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is the common Father of all those that are under his authority. The duty we owe to this <hi>Parent</hi> is, <hi>first, Honour</hi> and <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Honour.</note> looking on him, as upon one, on whom god hath stamped much of his own power and authority, and therefore paying him all honour and esteem, never daring, upon any pretence whatsoever, to <hi>speak evil of the Ruler of our people,</hi> Acts 23. 5.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Paying <hi>Tribute;</hi> This is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly <note place="margin">Tribute.</note> commanded by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 6. <hi>Pay ye Tribute also, for they are Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:60285:152"/>
attending continually upon this very thing.</hi> God has set them apart as Ministers for the common good of the people, and therefore 'tis all justice, they should be maintained and supported by them. And indeed when it is considered, what are the cares and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of that high calling, how many thorns are platted in every Crown, we have very little reason to envie them these dues; and it may truly be said, there is none of their poor labouring subjects that earns their living so hardly.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We are to pray for them: this <note place="margin">Prayers for them.</note> is also expresly commanded by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 2. to be done for <hi>Kings, and for all that are in authority.</hi> The businesses of that calling are so weighty, the dangers and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of it so great, that they of all others need prayers for Gods direction, assistance, and blessing, and the prayers that are thus poured out for them, will return into our own bosomes, for the blessings they receive from God tend to the good of the people, to their <hi>living a quiet and peaceable life,</hi> as it is in the close of the verse forementioned.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are to pay them <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obedience.</note> This is likewise strictly charged by the Apostle, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as Supream, or unto Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours as those that are sent by him:</hi> We owe such an <hi>obedience</hi> to the supream power, that whoever is authorized by him, we are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to; and <hi>S. Paul</hi> likewise is most full to this purpose, <hi>Romans</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers:</hi> And again, Ver. 2. <hi>Wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>soever resisteth the powers, resisteth the Ordinance of God.</hi> And 'tis observable that these precepts were given at a time, when those powers were Heathens, and cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors of Christianity; to shew us, that no pretence of the wickedness of our Rulers can free us of this duty. An <hi>obedience</hi> we must pay either <hi>Active</hi> or <hi>Passive:</hi> the <hi>Active</hi> in the case of all lawful commands; That is, when ever the Magistrate commands something, which is not contrary to some command of God, we are then bound to act according to that command of the Magistrate, to do the things he requires. But when he enjoyns any thing contrary to what God hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we are not then to pay him this <hi>active obedience;</hi> we may, nay we must refuse thus to <hi>act,</hi> (yet here we must be very well assured that the thing is so contrary, and not pretend conscience for a cloak of stubbornness) we are in that case to <hi>obey God rather then man.</hi> But even this is a season for the <hi>Passive obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,</hi> we must patiently suffer, what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts on us, for such refusal, and not, to secure our selves, rise up against him. <hi>For who can stretch his hand against the Lords anointed, and be guiltless?</hi> sayes <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Abishai,</hi> 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 26. 9. and that at a time when <hi>David</hi> was under a great persecution from <hi>Saul,</hi> nay, had also the assurance of the Kingdom after
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:60285:153"/>
him, and <hi>St. Pauls</hi> sentence in this case is most heavie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2. <hi>They that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.</hi> Here is very small encouragement to any to rise up against the lawful Magistrate, for though they should so far prosper here, as to secure themselves from him by this means, yet there is a King of Kings from whom no power can shelter them, and this damnation in the close will prove a sad prize of their victories. What is on the other side the duty of the Magistrate to the people will be vain to mention here, none of that rank being like to read this Treatise, and it being very useless for the people to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what is the duty of their Supream, wherein the most are already much better read, then in their own, it may suffice them to know that whatsoever his duty is, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever performed, he is accountable to none but God, and no failing of his part can war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to fail of theirs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The second sort of <hi>Parents</hi> are the <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual;</hi> That is, the <hi>Ministers</hi> of the Word, <note place="margin">Duties to our Pastors.</note> whether such, as be <hi>Governours</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> or others under them, who are to perform the same offices to our Souls, that our natural parents do to our bodies. Thus <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>inthians,</hi> that in <hi>Christ Jesus he had begotten them through the Gospel,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 15. and the <hi>Galatians,</hi> Chap. 4. 19. that he <hi>travels in birth of them, till Christ be formed in them:</hi> And again, 1 Cor. 3. 2. <hi>He had fed them with Milk;</hi> that is, such Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:60285:154"/>
as were agreeable to that infant state of Christianity they were then in; but he had <hi>stronger meat for them of full age, Heb.</hi> 5. 14. All these are the Offices of a Parent, and therefore they that perform them to us, may well be accounted as such.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Our duty to these is <hi>first</hi> to <hi>love them,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Love.</note> to bear them that kindness, which belongs to those who do us the greatest benefits. This is required by <hi>S. Paul,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 13. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you, brethren, mark them which labour among you, and are over you, in the Lord, and admonish you, and esteem them very highly in love for their works sake.</hi> The work is such as ought in all reason to procure them <hi>love,</hi> it being of the highest advantage to us.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'Tis our duty to <hi>value</hi> and <note place="margin">Esteem.</note> 
                     <hi>esteem</hi> them, as we see in the text now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and surely this is most reasonable, if we consider either the nature of their work, or who it is that imployes them. The nature of their work is of all others the most excellent; we use to value other professions proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the dignity and worth of the things they deal in. Now surely there is no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of equal worth with a Soul, and this is their Traffick, rescuing precious Souls from perdition. And if we consider further, who it is that imployes them, it yet addes to the reverence due to them. They are <hi>Ambassadours for Christ,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. and Ambassadours are by the Lawes of all Nations to be used with a respect, answerable to the quality of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:60285:154"/>
those that send them. Therefore Christ tells his disciples, when he sends them out to preach, <hi>He that despiseth you despiseth me, and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.</hi> Luke 10. 16. It seems there is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the despising of Ministers, then men ordinarily consider, 'tis the despising of God and Christ both. Let those think of this, who make it their pastime, and sport to affront, and deride this calling. And let those also, who dare presume to exercise the Offices of it, without being lawfully called to it, which is a most high presumption; 'Tis as if a man on his own head should go, as an Ambassadour from his Prince; the Apostle says of the Priests of the Law, which yet are inferiour to those of the Gospel, <hi>That no man taketh this honour to himself, but he which was called of God.</hi> Heb. 5. 4. How shall then any man dare to assume this greater honour to himself, that is not called to it; Neither will it suffice to say, they have the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward call</hi> of the spirit; for since God hath establisht an order in the Church, for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting men to this Office, they that shall take it upon them without that authority, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist that ordinance, and are but of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of those theeves and robbers, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour speaks, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>which come not in by the door.</hi> Besides the sad experience of these times shew, that many who pretend most to this inward call of the spirit, are called by some other spirit, then that of God, the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:60285:155"/>
they vent, being usually directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that word of his, on which all true Doctrines must be founded. Such are to be lookt on as those seducers, those false pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whereof we are so often warned in the <hi>Epistles</hi> of the <hi>Apostles.</hi> And whosoever countenances them, or follows them, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes with them in their guilt. It is recorded of <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> as a crying sin, that he made of <hi>the m<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

This is a guilt this age is too much concerned in, God in his mercy so timely convince us of it, as may put a stop to that confusion and impiety, which breaks in so fast upon us by it.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We owe to them <hi>maintenance:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> but of this I have spoken already in the first part of this Book, and shall not here repeat. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We owe them <hi>obedience, Obey them,</hi>

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:60285:155"/>
to us, to be Gods Commands, these we are diligently to obey, remembring that it is not they, but God requires it, according to that of Christ, <hi>he that heareth you, heareth me, Luke</hi> 10. 16. And this whether it be delivered by the way of publick preaching, or private exhortation, for in both, so long as they keep them to the rule, which is Gods Word, they are the <hi>Messengers of the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Mal. 2. 7. This obedience the Apostle inforceth from a double motive, one taken from their Ministry, another from themselves. <hi>They watch,</hi> sayes he, <hi>for your Souls, as they that must give an account, that they may do it with joy, and not with grief;</hi> The people are by their <hi>obedience</hi> to enable their Pastors to give a comfortable account of their Souls, and it is a most unkinde return of all their care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; to be put to grieve for the ill success of them. But then in the <hi>second</hi> place, 'tis their own concernment also; they may put their Ministers to the discomfort of seeing all their pains cast away, but themselves are like to get little by it, that (says the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17.) <hi>will be unprofitable for you;</hi> 'tis your selves, that will finally prove the losers by it, you lose all those glorious rewards, which are offered, as the crown of this obedience, you get nothing but an addition to your sin and punishment, for as our Saviour tells the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees, <hi>If he had not come and spoken to them they had not had sin, John</hi> 15. 24. that is, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with what they then had; so certainly they
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:60285:156"/>
that never had the Gospel preached to them, are much more innocent then they that have heard and resisted it. And for the punishment, what Christ told those to whom he had preached, <hi>That it should be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon,</hi> which were Heathen Cities, <hi>then for them,</hi> the same undoubtedly we may conclude of our selves.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Lastly,</hi> We are to <hi>pray</hi> for them; This <note place="margin">Prayers for them.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> every where requires of his Spiritual children; thus <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. 7, 8. having commanded prayer for all Saints, he adds, <hi>And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the Gospel;</hi> and so again, <hi>Col.</hi> 4. 3. And this remains still a duty to these Spiritual Fathers, to pray for such assistances of Gods Spirit to them, as may enable them rightly to discharge that Holy Calling. I shall omit to set down here, what is the duty of Ministers to the people, upon the same consideration, on which I forbare to mention the duty of Magistrates.</p>

And to these we owe seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral duties, as <hi>first</hi> we owe them <hi>reverence,</hi> and <note place="margin">Reverence.</note> respect; we must behave our selves towards them with all humility, and observance, and must not upon any pretence of infirmity in them, despise or contemn them, either in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward behaviour, or so much as inwardly in our hearts. If indeed they have infirmities,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:60285:156"/>
it must be our business to cover, and conceal them; like <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japhet,</hi> who while cursed <hi>Cham</hi> publisht and <hi>disclosed the nakedness of their father, covered it,</hi> Gen. 9. 23. and that in such a manner too, as even themselves might not behold it. We are as much as may be to keep our selves from looking on those <hi>naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> of our parents, which may tempt us to think irreverently of them. This is very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the practise of too many children, who do not only publish and deride the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of their Parents, but pretend they have those infirmities they have not; there is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily such a pride, and headiness <hi>in youth,</hi> that they cannot abide to submit to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, and directions of their Elders, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to shake them off, are willing to have them pass for the effects of dotage, when they are indeed the fruits of sobriety, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. To such the exhortation of <hi>Solomon</hi> is very necessary, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 22. <hi>Hearken to thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther when she is old.</hi> A multitude of texts more there are in that book to this purpose, which shews that the wisest of men thought it neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for children to attend to the counsel of their parents. But the youth of <hi>our</hi> Age set up for wisdom, the quite contrary way, and think they then become <hi>wits,</hi> when they are advanced to the despising the counsel, yea mocking the persons of their parents. Let such if they will not practice the exhortations, yet remember the threatning of the wise man, <hi>Pro.</hi>

The debt a <hi>childe</hi> owes to a parent is so great, that he can never hope himself to discharge it, he is therefore to call in Gods aid, to beg of him, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward all the good, his parents have done for him, by multiplying his blessings upon them; what shall we then say to those children, that in stead of calling to heaven for blessings on their parents, ransack hell for <hi>curses</hi> on them,

And then let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that God hath as well the power of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing, as of seeing, and therfore since he hath pronounced death to be the reward of that sin 'tis not unreasonable to expect he may himself inflict it; that they who <hi>watch</hi> for the death of their Parents, may untimely <hi>meet</hi> with their own. The <hi>fifth</hi> Commandment promiseth <hi>long life</hi> as the reward of honouring the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, to which 'tis very agreeable that untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death be the punishment of the contrary,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:60285:158"/>
and sure there is nothing more highly contrary to that duty, then this we are now speaking of, the cursing our Parents.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. The <hi>third</hi> duty we owe to them is <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;</hi> This is not onely contained in the <note place="margin">Obedience.</note> fifth Commandment, but expresly injoyned in other places of Scripture. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 1. <hi>Children obey your Parents in the Lord, for this is right;</hi> and again, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 20. <hi>Children obey your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in all things, for this is well-pleasing to the Lord.</hi> We owe them an <hi>obedience</hi> in all things, unless where their commands are contrary to the commands of God, for in that case our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God must be preferred, and therefore if any Parent shall be so wicked, as to require his childe to steal, to lie, or to do any unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing, the childe then offends not against his duty, though he disobey that command, nay, he must disobey, or else he offends against a higher duty, even that he owes to God, his Heavenly Father. Yet when 'tis thus necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to refuse obedience, he should take care to do it in such a modest, and respectful manner that it may appear 'tis <hi>conscience</hi> onely, and not <hi>stubbornness</hi> moves him to it. But in <hi>case</hi> of all lawful commands; that is, when the thing commanded is either good, or not evil, when it hath nothing in it contrary to our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, there the childe is bound to obey, be the command in a weightier or lighter matter; How little this duty is regarded is too manifest every where in the world, where Parents generally have their children no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:60285:158"/>
under command, then they are under the rod; when they are once grown up, they think themselves free from all obedience to them; or if some do continue to pay it, yet let the motive of it be examined, and 'twill in too many be found only Worldly Prudence; They fear to displease their Parents, least they should shorten their hand toward them, and so they shall lose somewhat by it; but how few are there that obey purely upon consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of duty? This Sin of <hi>Disobedience to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> was by the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> punishable <hi>with death,</hi> as you may read <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. 18. but if Parents now a dayes should proceed so with their children, many might soon make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves childless.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. But of all the acts of <hi>disobedience,</hi> that of <note place="margin">Especially in their Marriage.</note> 
                     <hi>marrying against the consent of the Parent,</hi> is one of the highest. Children are so much the goods, the Possessions of the Parent, that they cannot without a kind of <hi>theft,</hi> give away themselves without the allowance of those, that have the right in them; and therefore we see under the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Maid that had made any vow, was not suffered to perform it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Consent of the Parent. Numb.</hi> 30. 5. the right of the Parent was thought of force e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cancel, and make void the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even of a <hi>vow,</hi> and therefore surely it ought to be so much considered by us as to keep us from making any such, whereby that right is infringed.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. A <hi>fourth</hi> duty to the Parent is to <hi>assist,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Ministring to their wants.</note>
                     <pb n="292" facs="tcp:60285:159"/>
and minister to them in all their <hi>wants</hi> of what kind soever, whether weakness, and sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of body, decayedness of understanding, or poverty, and lowness in estate; in all these the child is bound according to his ability, to relieve and assist them: for the two former, weakness of body, and infirmity of minde, none can doubt of the duty, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member how every child did in his infancy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the very same benefit from the Parent, the child had then no strength to support, no understanding to guide it self; the care of the Parents was fain to supply both these to it, and therefore in common gratitude, whenever either of these becomes the Parents case, as sometimes by great age, or some accident both do, the childe is to perform the same offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces back again to them. As for that of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving</hi> their poverty, there is the very same Obligation to that with the former, it being but just to sustain thy Parent who has former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sustained thee: but besides this, Christ himself teaches us, that this is contained within the precept of honouring their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; for when <hi>Mar.</hi> 7. 13. he accuses the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees of <hi>rejecting the Commandement of God, to cleave to their own traditions,</hi> he instances in this particular, concerning the relieving of Parents, whereby 'tis manifest that this is a part of that duty which is injoyned in the <hi>fifth</hi> Commandement, as you may see at large in the Text, and such a duty it is that no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence can absolve, or acquit us of it. How
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:60285:159"/>
then shall those answer it, that deny relief to their poor Parents, that cannot part with their own excesses, and superfluities, which are indeed their sins, to satisfie the necessities of those to whom they owe their being? Na, some there are yet worse, who out of pride scorn to own their parents in their poverty: Thus it often happens, when the <hi>Child</hi> is advanced to dignity or wealth, they think it a disparagement to them to look on their Parents that remain in a low condition, it being the betraying, as they think, to the world the meanness of their birth, and so the poor Parent fares the worse for the prosperity of his child. This is such a pride and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralness together, as will surely finde a sharp vengeance from God; for if <hi>Solomon</hi> observe of <hi>Pride</hi> alone, that it is the <hi>fore-runner of destruction, Prov.</hi> 16. 18. we may much rather conclude so of it, when it is thus accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. To this that hath been said of the duty <note place="margin">Duty to be paid even to the worst of Parents.</note> of <hi>Children</hi> to their <hi>Parents,</hi> I shall adde only this; That no unkindness, no fault of the Parent, can acquit the childe of this duty; but as S. <hi>Peter</hi> tells servants, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 18. that they <hi>must be subject not onely to the good and gentle Masters, but also to the froward;</hi> so certainly it belongs to children to perform duty not only to the kinde and vertuous, but even to the <hi>harshest,</hi> and wicked'st Parent. For though the gratitude due to a kinde Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, be a very forcible motive to make the
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:60285:160"/>
child pay his duty, yet that is not the only nor chiefest ground of it; That is laid in the Command of God, who requires us thus to honour our Parents, and therefore though we should suppose a Parent so unnatural, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have done any thing to oblige the childe, (which can hardly be imagined) yet still the Command of God continues in force, and we are in conscience of that, to perform that duty to our Parents, thou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h none of the other tye of gratitude, should lye on us.</p>
                  <p>But as this is due from the childe to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, <note place="margin">Duty of Parents to Children.</note> so on the other side there are other things also due from the <hi>Parents</hi> to the <hi>Childe,</hi> and that throughout the several states and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. <hi>First,</hi> There is the care of <hi>nourishing</hi> and <hi>sustaining</hi> it, which begins from the very <note place="margin">To nourish them.</note> birth, and continues a duty from the Parent, till the child be able to perform it to himself; This is a duty, which nature teaches, even the <hi>savage beasts,</hi> have a great care and tendernesse in nourishing their young, and therefore may serve to reproach and condemn all Parents, who shall be so unnatural as to neglect this. I shall not here enter into the question, <hi>Whether the Mother be obliged to give the Childe its first nourishment, by giving it Suck her self,</hi> because 'twill not be possible to affirm universally in the Case, there being many circumstances, which may alter it, and make it not only lawful, but best not to do it; all I shall say, is, that where no impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:60285:160"/>
of sickness, weakness, or the like does happen, 'tis surely best for the Mother her self to perform this office, there being many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to the childe by it, which a good Mother ought so far to consider, as not to sell them to her own sloth, or niceness, or any such unworthy motive; for where such only are the grounds of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bearing it, they will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to justifie the omission, they being themselves unjustifiable.</p>
                  <p>But besides this <hi>first</hi> care, which belongs to <note place="margin">Bring them to Baptism.</note> the body of the childe, there is another, which should begin near as early, which belongs to their Souls, and that is the <hi>bringing them to</hi> the Sacrament of <hi>Baptism,</hi> thereby to procure them an early right to all those precious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, which that Sacrament conveyes to them. This is a duty the <hi>Parents</hi> ought not to delay, it being most reasonable, that they who have been instruments to convey the stain and pollution of sin to the poor <hi>Infant,</hi> should be very earnest and industrious to have it washt off, as soon as may be: Besides the life of so tender a creature is but a blast, and many times gone in a moment; and though we are not to despair of Gods mercy to those poor children, who dye without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, yet surely those Parents commit a great fault, by whose neglect it is, that they want it.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Secondly, The Parents must provide <note place="margin">Educate them.</note> for the <hi>education</hi> of the childe; they must, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 22. 6. <hi>Train up the
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:60285:161"/>
childe in the way he should go.</hi> As soon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as <hi>children</hi> come to the <hi>use of reason,</hi> they are to be instructed, and that first in those things, which concern their eternal well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being they are by little and little to be taught all those things which God hath commanded them, as their duty to perform; as also what glorious rewards he hath provided for them, if they do it, and what grievous and eternal punishments, if they do it not. These things ought as early, as is possible, to be instilled into the minds of children, which (like <hi>new vessels)</hi> do usually keep the favour of that which is first put into them; and therefore it neerly concerns all Parents to look they be at first thus seasoned with Vertue and Religion. 'Tis sure if this be neglected, there is one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand to fill them with the contrary, the <hi>Devil</hi> will be diligent enough to instil into them all wickedness and vice, even from their cradles, and there being also in all our natures so much the greater aptness to evil, then to good, there is need of great care and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, to prevent those endeavours of that enemy of Souls, which can no way be, but by possessing them at first with good things, breeding in them a love to vertue, and a hatred of vice; that so when the <hi>temptations</hi> come, they may be armed against them. This surely is above all things the <hi>duty of Parents</hi> to look after, and the neglect of it is a horrible cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; We justly look upon those Parents, as most unnatural wretches, that take away the
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:60285:161"/>
life of their childe; but alas! that is mercy and tenderness, compared to this of negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting his education, for by that he ruines his Soul, makes him miserable eternally; and God knowes multitudes of such cruel Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents there are in the world, that thus give up their children to be <hi>possest by the Devil,</hi> for want of an early acquainting them with the wayes of God; nay, indeed how few there are that do conscionably perform this duty, is too apparant by the strange rudeness and ignorance that is generally among youth: the children of those who call themselves Christians, being frequently as ignorant of God and Christ as the meerest Heathens. But whoever they are, that thus neglect this great duty, let them know that it is not only a fearful misery they bring upon their poor children, but also a horrible guilt upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For as God sayes to the careless watchmen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>That if any soul perish</hi> by his negligence, <hi>that soul shall be required at his hands;</hi> so surely will it fare with all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who have this office of watchmen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted to them by God over their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. A <hi>second</hi> part of education is the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up to some imployment, busying them in some honest exercise, whereby they may avoid that great <hi>snare of the Devil, Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and also be taught some useful Art or Trade, whereby when they come to age, they may become profitable to the <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> and able to get an honest living to themselves.</p>

20. To this great duty of <hi>Educating of Children,</hi> there is required as means, <hi>first, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement; secondly, Correction: Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Means to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the education of children.</note> is <hi>first</hi> to be tryed, we should endeavour to make children in love with duty, by offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them rewards and invitations, and when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they do well take notice of it, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them to go on. It is an ill course some parents hold, who think they must never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to their children but with a face of sowreness and austerity; this seems to be that, which <hi>S. Paul</hi> forewarns Parents of, when he bids <hi>fathers</hi> not to <hi>provoke their children to wrath, Col.</hi> 3. 21. To be as harsh and unkind to them, when they do well, as if they do ill, is the way to provoke them; and then the Apostle tels us in the same verse, what will be the issue of it, they will be discouraged, they will have no heart to go on in any good course, when the Parent affords them no countenance. The <hi>second</hi> means is correction, and this becomes seasonable, when the former will do no good, when all fair means, perswasions, and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements prevail not, then there is a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of using sharper; and let that be first tryed in words, I mean not by railing and foul lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, but in sober, yet sharp reproof; but if that fail too, then proceed to blowes; and in this case as <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>He that spareth his rod, hateth his son, Prov.</hi> 13. 24. 'Tis a cruel fondness, that to spare a few stripes at present, will adventure him to those sad mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, which commonly befal the childe, that
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:60285:162"/>
is left to himself. But then this correction must be given in such a manner, as may be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to do good; to which purpose it must first be given timely; the child must not be suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to run on in any ill, till it have got a habit, and a stubbornness too. This is a great error in many Parents, they will let their children alone for divers years, to do what they list, permit them to lie, to steal, without ever so much as rebuking them, nay, perhaps please themselves to see the witty shifts of the childe, and think it matters not what they do while they are little: But alas! all that while the vice gets root, and that many times so deep a one, that all they can do afterwards, whether by words or blowes, can never pluck it up. <hi>Secondly, Correction</hi> must be moderate, not exceeding the quality of the fault, nor the tenderness of the childe. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it must not be given <hi>in rage,</hi> if it be, it will not only be in danger of being immoderate, but it will lose its effect upon the childe, who will think he is corrected, not because he has done a fault, but because his Parent is angry, and so will rather blame the Parent then himself, whereas on the contrary care should be taken to make the childe as sensible of the fault, as of the smart, without which he will never be throughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> after children are grown up, and <note place="margin">The parent to watch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their souls even when they are grown up</note> are <hi>past</hi> the age of <hi>education,</hi> there are yet o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offices for the Parent to perform to them; the Parent is still to <hi>Watch</hi> over them, in respect
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:60285:163"/>
of their souls, to observe how they practise those precepts which are given them in their education, and accordingly to exhort, incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, or reprove, as they finde occasion.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. So also for their <hi>outward estate,</hi> they <note place="margin">To provide for their subsistence.</note> are to put them into some <hi>course of living</hi> in the world; if God have blest the Parents with wealth, according to what he hath, he must distribute to his children, remembring that since he was the instrument of bringing them into the world, he is according to his ability to provide for their comfortably living in it, they are therefore to be look't on as very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural parents, who, so they may have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to spend in their own riots, and excess care not what becomes of their children, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver think of providing for them. <hi>Another</hi> fault is usual among Parents in this business; they defer all the provisions for them, <hi>till themselves be dead,</hi> heap up perhaps great matters for them against that time, but in the mean time afford them not such a competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as may enable them to live in the world. There are several mischiefs come from this: <hi>First,</hi> it lessens the childs affection to his parent, nay, sometimes it proceeds so far, as to make him wish his death, which though it be such a fault, as no temptation can excuse in a childe, yet 'tis also a great fault in a Parent, to give that temptation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it puts the child up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shifts and tricks; many times dishonest ones, to supply his necessities; this is, I doubt not a common effect of it, the hardness of Parents
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:60285:163"/>
has often put men upon very unlawful cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, which when they are once acquainted with, perhaps they never leave, though the <hi>first</hi> occasion cease; and therefore Parents ought to beware how they run them upon those ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards. Besides the <hi>Parents</hi> loses that content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he might have in seeing his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren live prosperously and comfortably, which none but an arrant <hi>Earth Worm</hi> would exchange for the vain imaginary pleasure of having money in his chest. But in this business <hi>of providing for children,</hi> there is yet another thing to be heeded, and that is, that the Parent get that <hi>wealth honestly,</hi> which he makes their portion; else 'tis very far from being a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, there is such a curse goes along with an ill-gotten estate, that he that leaves such a one to his child, doth but cheat and deceive him, makes him believe he has left him wealth, but has withal put such a canker in the bowels of it, that is sure to eat it out. This is so common an observation, that I need say nothing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of it; would God it were as generally laid to heart, as it seems to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally taken notice of: Then surely Parents would not account it a reasonable motive to <hi>unjust dealing,</hi> that they may thereby provide for their children, for this is not a way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for them; nay, 'tis the way to spoil them of whatever they have lawfully gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, the least mite of unlawful gain being of the nature of leaven, which <hi>sowres the whole lump,</hi> bringing down curses upon all
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:60285:164"/>
a man possesseth. Let all Parents therefore sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie themselves with such provisions for their children as God shall enable them honestly to make, assuring themselves how little soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it be, 'tis a better portion then the greatest wealth unjustly gotten, according to that of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 16. 8. <hi>Better is a little with righteousness, then great revenues without right.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23. A <hi>fourth</hi> thing the <hi>Parent</hi> owes to the <note place="margin">To give them good example.</note> child is <hi>Good Example,</hi> he is not only to set him rules of vertue, and godliness; but he must himself give him a pattern in his own practice, we see the force of example is infinitly beyond that of precept, especially where the person is one, to whom we bear a reverence, or with whom we have a continual conversation; both which usually meet in a Parent. It is therefore a most necessary care in all Parents to behave themselves so before their children that their example may be a means of winning them to vertue; But alas! <hi>this age</hi> affords little of this care, nay, so far 'tis from it, that there are none more frequently the instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of corrupting children, then their own Parents. And indeed how can it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, while men give themselves liberty to all wickedness, 'tis not to be hoped, but that the children which observe it, will imitate it; the childe that sees his father <hi>drunk,</hi> will sure think, he may be so too, as well as his father. So he that hears him <hi>swear,</hi> will do the like, and so for all other vices, and if any Parent
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:60285:164"/>
that is thus wicked himself, should happen to have so much more care of his childes Soul, then his own; as to forbid him the things which himself practises, or correct him for the doing them; 'tis certain the child will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this a great injustice in his father, to punish him for that which himself freely does and so he is never likely to be wrought upon by it. This consideration lays a most strict tie upon all Parents, to live <hi>Christianly,</hi> for otherwise they do not only hazard their own Souls, but those of their children also, and as it were purchase an estate of inheritance in Hell.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. A <hi>fifth</hi> duty of <hi>Parents</hi> is <hi>blessing their children;</hi> the way of doing that is double, <hi>first,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To bless them.</note> by their prayer; they are by daily and earnest prayers to commend them to Gods protection and blessing, both for their spiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral estate; and <hi>secondly</hi> by their piety they are to be such persons themselves as that a blessing may descend from them upon their posterity. This is often promised in Scriptures to godly men, that their <hi>seed shall be blessed.</hi> Thus in the <hi>second commandment,</hi> God promises to <hi>shew mercy to the thousand generation of them that love him and keep his commandments.</hi> And it is very observable in the <hi>Jews,</hi> that though they were a <hi>stiff-necked generation,</hi> and had very grievously provoked God, yet the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness of their <hi>forefathers, Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> did many times move God to save them from destruction; on the other side, we see that

even good men have fared the worse for the in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quities of their fathers, Thus when <hi>Josiah</hi> had destroyed idolatry, restored Gods service, and done good beyond all the Kings that were before him, yet there was <hi>an old arrear</hi> of <hi>Manasseh</hi> his <hi>grand father,</hi> which all this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of his would not blot out, but he resolves to cast <hi>Judah also out of his sight,</hi> as you may read at large, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23. If therefore Parents have any bowels, any kindness towards their children, any real desire of their prosperity, let them take care by their own godly life to entail a blessing upon them.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. <hi>Sixthly, Parents</hi> must take heed, that <note place="margin">To give no unreasonable commands.</note> they use their power over their children with equity, and <hi>moderation,</hi> not to oppress them with <hi>Unreasonable Commands,</hi> only to exercise their own authority, but in all things of weight to consider the real good of their children, and to press them to nothing, which may not consist with that. This is a rule whereof Parents may often have use, but in none greater then in the business of <hi>marrying their children,</hi> wherein many that otherwise are good Parents, have been to blame, when out of an eagerness of bestowing them wealthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they force them to marry utterly against their own inclinations, which is a great tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that which frequently betrayes them to a multitude of mischiefs, such as all the wealth in the world cannot repair. There are <hi>two</hi> things which Parents ought especially to consider in the <hi>matching their children;</hi> the

                     <hi>first,</hi> how they may live <hi>Christianly,</hi> and to that purpose to chuse a vertuous and pious person, to link them with; <hi>the second</hi> is, how they may live <hi>cheerfully</hi> and comfortably in this world; and to that end though a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of estate may be necessary to be regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet surely abundance is no way requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site, and therefore that should not be too vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently sought after; that which much more tends to the happiness of that state, is the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual kindness, and liking of the parties, without which marriage is of all other the most uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable condition, and therefore no parent ought to thrust a child into it.

                  </head>
                  <p>§. 1. THe <hi>second</hi> sort of Relation is that of a <hi>Brother;</hi> now brotherhood may be <note place="margin">Dues to Brethren.</note> two fold, either <hi>natural,</hi> or <hi>spiritual</hi> the <hi>natural</hi> may in the largest extent contain under it all mankind, all that partake of the same nature; but I shall not consider it so in this place, having already mentioned those ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:60285:166"/>
duties, which belong to all as such. I now speak of that <hi>natural brother-hood,</hi> that is between those that are the children of the same immediate Parent; and the duty of these <note place="margin">Natural.</note> is to have united hearts, and affections: This nature points out to them, they partaking in a more especial manner, of each others sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and therefore ought to have the greatest tenderness and kindness, each to other; thus we see <hi>Abraham</hi> make it an argument, why <hi>there</hi> should be <hi>no contention between him and Lot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were brethren: Gen.</hi> 13. 8. And though by brethren there is meant <hi>only</hi> cousins, yet that helps the more strongly to conclude, that this neerer relation is in reason to be a greater bar to strise, as also that this kindness is in some degree to be extended to all that have any neer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of blood to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This kindness and <hi>Love</hi> between <hi>Brethren</hi> and <hi>Sisters</hi> ought to be very firmly grounded <note place="margin">The necessity of Love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> in their hearts, if it be not, they will be of all others in most danger of disagreeing; for the continual conversation that is among them, whilst they are at home in the fathers house, will be apt to minister some occasion of jar. Besides the equality, that is, among them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of birth, often makes them inclinable to envy each other, when one is in any respect advanced above the other. Thus we see <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephs</hi> brethren <hi>envyed him,</hi> because he had most of his fathers <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>Rachel envyed</hi> her sister <hi>Leah:</hi> because she was <hi>fruitful;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the preventing of such temptations,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:60285:166"/>
let all who have brethren and sisters, possess their minde with a great and real kindness to them, look on them as parts of themselves, and then they will never think fit either to quarrel with them, or to envie them any advantage, any more then one part of the body does ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the same body, but will strive to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance &amp; help forward the good of each other.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>second</hi> kind of <hi>Brotherhood</hi> is <hi>spiritual;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Spiritual brotherhood,</note> that containes all those who profess the same Faith with us: the Church in our <hi>Baptism</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Mother to each baptized person; and then surely they that have the relation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to her, must have also the relation of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to each other; and to this sort of bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren also we owe a great deal of tenderness and affection; the spiritual bond of Religion should, of all others, the most closely unite our hearts. This is the <hi>Brotherhood</hi> which <hi>S. Peter</hi> exhorts us to love, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2. 17. And to it we are in an especial manner bound to do all good offices, <hi>Do good,</hi> saith the Apostle, <hi>to all, but especially to them that are of the houshold of Faith, Gal.</hi> 6. 10. Our compassions are to be most melting towards them of all others, in all their needs; Christ tels us, that <hi>whosoever gives but a cup of cold water to any in the name of a Disciple, shall not lose his reward, Mat.</hi> 10. 42. From whence we may assure our selves that this peculiar love to Christians as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, is very acceptable in his sight.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Several duties there are required of us to these <hi>brethren;</hi> one principal, is the holding
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:60285:167"/>
                     <hi>Communion</hi> with them, and that first in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; we are constantly to continue in the belief and profession of all those necessary <note place="margin">Our duty to hold commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with these bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</note> truths, by which we may be markt out as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, and Disciples of Christ; this is that <hi>faith;</hi> which <hi>S. Jude</hi> speaks of, which was <hi>once delivered to the Saints, Jude</hi> 3. by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof we continue still united to this spiritual brotherhood, in respect of profession, which we must constantly do, what storms and persecutions soever attend it, according to the exhortation of the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 22. <hi>Let us hold fast the profession of our faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out wavering. Secondly,</hi> we are also, as opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity serves, to communicate with them in all holy offices; we must be diligent in frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the assemblies of the Saints, which is as it were the badge of our profession, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that willingly withdraws himself from these, gives ground to suspect, he will be apt to renounce the other also. But these parts of communion we finde strictly maintained by the first Christians, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 42. <hi>They continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine and fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers:</hi> they continued, and that stedfastly, they were not frighted from it by any persecutions, though that were a time wherein they were tryed with the sharpest sufferings; which may teach us, that it is not the danger, that attends this duty, can acquit us of it.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we are to bear with the <hi>Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To bear with their infirmities.</note> of our Christian brethren, according
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:60285:167"/>
to the advice of <hi>S. Paul, Romans</hi> 15. 1. <hi>We that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak.</hi> If one that holds all necessary Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian truths, happen yet to be in some errour, we are not for this either to forsake his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, or despise his person. This <hi>S. Paul</hi> reaches us in the case of that <hi>weak brother, who by errour made a causless scruple about meats, Rom.</hi> 14. Where he bids the stronger Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that is, those who being better instructed, discerned him to be in an errour, yet to receive him nevertheless, and not to despise him; as on the other side, he bids that weak one not to judge the stronger; the lesser differences in opinion must be born with on both sides, and must not in the least abate our brotherly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity towards each other.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we are to endeavour the <hi>resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">To restore them after falls.</note> of any fallen brother, that is, to bring him to repentance, after he hath fallen into any sin. Thus <hi>St. Paul</hi> commands the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> that they should <hi>restore him that was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken in a fault, considering themselves least they also were tempted.</hi> We are not to look on him as a cast-away to give him over as utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desperate, neither are we to triumph over him, in respect of our own innocence, like the <hi>proud Pharisee,</hi> over the <hi>poor Publican, Luke</hi> 18. 11. but we are meekly to endeavour his recovery, remembring that our own frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is such, that we are not secure from the like falls.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We are to have a <hi>Sympathy,</hi>

and fellow feeling with these brethren, to be neerly toucht with whatsoever befalls them, either as they are considered in society, or in single persons. In <hi>society</hi> first, and so they make up a Church, &amp; that either the universal, which is made up of all Believers throughout the world, or any particular Church, which is made up of all the Believers in that particular Nation, and whatever happens to either of these, either the <hi>whole Church</hi> in general, or any such <hi>single part</hi> of it, especially that whereof our selves are members, we are to be much affected and moved with it, to rejoyce in all the prosperities, and to mourn and bewail all the breaches and desolations thereof, and daily and earnestly to pray with <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 51. 18. <hi>O be favourable and gracious unto Sion, build thou the walls of Jerusalem;</hi> and that especially when we see her in distress, and persecution. Whosoever is not thus toucht with the condition of the Church, is not to be lookt on, as a living member of it; for as in the natural body every member is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the prosperity of the whole, so certainly 'tis here: it was the observation of the Psalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist, that <hi>Gods servants think upon the stones of Sion, and pitty to see her in the dust,</hi> Psal. 102. 14. and surely all his servants are still of the same temper, cannot look on the <hi>ruines</hi> and <hi>desolations of the Church,</hi> without the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est sorrow, and lamentation. <hi>Secondly,</hi> we are to have this fellow feeling with our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, considered as single persons; We are to account our selves concerned in every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:60285:168"/>
Christian, so as to partake with him in all his occasions either of joy or sorrow. Thus the Apostle exhorts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 14. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with them that rejoyce, weep with them that weep:</hi> And again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. under the similitude of the natural body he urges this duty, <hi>Whether one member suffer, all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers suffer with it, or one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi> All these seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral effects of love, we owe to these spiritual brethren. And this love is that, which Christ has made the badge of his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 13. 35. <hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another;</hi> so that if we mean not to cast off disciple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship to Christ, we must not forsake this love of the brethren.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>third</hi> relation is that between <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The wife owes to the husband obedience.</note> and <hi>Wife.</hi> This is yet much neerer then either of the former, as appears by that Text, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>A man shall leave Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife, and they two shall be one flesh.</hi> Several duties there are owe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one of these persons to the other: and <hi>first</hi> for the Wife, she owes obedience. This is commanded by the Apostle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 18. <hi>Wives submit your selves to your own Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, as it is fit in the Lord.</hi> They are to render obedience to their Husbands in the Lord, that is in all lawful commands, for otherwise 'tis here, as in the case of all other superiours, God must be obeyed rather then man, and the wife must not upon her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:60285:169"/>
command do any thing which is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God. But in all things, which do not cross some command of Gods, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept is of force, and will serve to condemn the <hi>peevish</hi> stubbornness of many wives, who resist the lawful commands of their husbands, only because they are impatient of this duty of subjection, which God himself requires of them. But it may be here <hi>asked,</hi> what if the husband command something, which though it be not unlawful, is yet very inconvenient, and <hi>imprudent,</hi> must the wife submit to such a command? To this I <hi>answer,</hi> that it will be no disobedience in her, but duty, calmly and mildly to shew him the inconveniences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and to perswade him to retract that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but in case she cannot win him to it by fair intreaties, she must neither try sharp lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor yet finally refuse to obey, nothing but the unlawfulness of the command being sufficient warrant for that.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The wife owes <hi>Fidelity</hi> to the <note place="margin">Fide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> She owes him <hi>Love,</hi> and toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Love.</note> with that all friendliness and kindness of conversation; she is to endeavour to bring him as much assistance, and comfort of life, as is possible, that so she may answer that special end of the womans creation, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a help to her husband, Gen.</hi> 2. 13. and this in all conditions, whether health, or sickness, wealth, or poverty, whatsoever estate God by his providence shall cast him into, she must be as much of comfort and support to him, as she can. To this all sullenness, and harsh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, all brawling, and unquietness is directly contrary, for that makes the wife the burden, and plague of the man, instead of a help and comfort: And sure if it be a fault to behave ones self so to any person, as hath already been shewed, how great must it be to do so to him, to whom the greatest kindness and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is owing?</p>

How many men are there, that to avoid the noise of a froward wise, have fallen to company keeping, and by that to drunkenness, poverty, and a multitude of mischiefs? Let all wives therefore beware of administring that temptation. But whenever there happens any thing, which in kindness to her husband, she is to admonish him of, let it be with that sofe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and mildness, that it may appear 'tis love, and not anger, that makes her speak.</p>

This ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forbids all harshness and roughness to them; Men are to use them as parts of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to love them as their own bodies, and therefore to do nothing that may be hurtful, and grievous to them, no more then they would cut, and gash their own flesh. Let those husbands that tyrannize over their wives, that scarce use them like humane creatures, consider, whether that be to love them, as their own bodies.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. A <hi>second</hi> duty of the <hi>Husband,</hi> is <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi>

This is by God as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of the husband, as the wife, and though the world do seem to look on the breach of this duty, with less abhorrence in the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, yet sure before that Just Judge, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, will appear no less on the mans side, then the womans.

                  <p n="14">14. A <hi>third</hi> duty of the Husband is to <hi>maintain</hi> and <hi>provide</hi> for the Wife. He is to <note place="margin">Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> let her partake with him in those outward good things, wherewith God hath blest him,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:60285:171"/>
and neither by niggardliness debar her of what is fit for her, nor yet by unthriftiness so waste his goods, that he shall become unable to support her. This is certainly the duty of the husband, who being, as hath been said, to account his wife as a part of his own body, must have the very same care to sustain her, that he hath for himself. Yet this is not so to be understood, as to excuse the wife from her part of labour and industry, when that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite, it being unreasonable the husband should toil to maintain the wife in idleness.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The husband is to <hi>instruct</hi> the <note place="margin">Instruction.</note> wife, in the things which concern her eternal welfare, if she be ignorant of them. Thus <hi>St. Paul</hi> bids the <hi>wives learn of their husbands at home,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 36. which supposes, that the husband is to teach her. Indeed it belongs to every Master of a Family to endeavour that all under his charge be taught all neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary things of this kinde, and then sure more especially his wife, who is so much nearer to him, then all the rest.

all sin, and by being like true yoke-fellowes, helpful and assistant to each other in the doing of all sorts of good, both to their own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and all others within their reach. This is of all other the truest and most valuable love. Nay, indeed how can it be said they do love at all, who can contentedly let each other run on in a course that will bring them to eternal misery? And if the love of husbands and wives were thus grounded in Vertue and Religion, 'twould make their lives a kinde of Heaven on earth, 'twould prevent all those contentions, and brawlings, so common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, which are the great plagues of Families, and a lesser Hell, in passage to the greater; and truly where it is not thus found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there is little comfort to be expected in marriage.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. It should therefore be the care of every <note place="margin">The vertue of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the chief considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</note> one that means to enter upon that <hi>state,</hi> to consider advisedly before hand, and to choose such a person with whom they may have this spiritual friendship, that is such a one, <hi>as truly fears God.</hi> There are many <hi>false ends of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage</hi> lookt upon in the world: some marry for <hi>Wealth,</hi> others for <hi>Beauty,</hi> and generally they are only worldly respects, that are at all considered; but certainly he that would Marry as he ought, should contrive to make his Marriage useful to those better ends, of serving God, and saving his own Soul; at least he must be sure it be no hindrance to them, and to that purpose the vertue of the

                  <p n="18">18. But above all things, let all take heed, that they make not such <hi>marriages,</hi> as may <note place="margin">Unlawful Marriages.</note> not only be ill in their effects, but are <hi>actual sins</hi> at the time; such are the marriages of those that were formerly <hi>promised to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in which case 'tis sure they rightly belong to those, to whom they past the <hi>first</hi> promise, and then for any other to marry them, during the life of that person, is to take the husband or wife of that other, which is <hi>direct adultery,</hi> as <hi>S. Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 3. The like unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness there is also in the marriage of those, who are <hi>within</hi> those <hi>degrees</hi> of kindred for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by God, the particulars whereof are set down in the 18. and 20. of <hi>Lev.</hi> and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever marries any that is within any of those degrees of neerness, either to himself, or to his deceased wife, which is as bad, commits that great sin of Incest, and so long as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to live with such his unlawful wife, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in that fearful guilt. This wariness in the choice of the person to be married, would prevent many sad effects, which we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see follow such rash or unlawful matches; it were well therefore if people would look on marriage, as our Church advises, as a thing not to be <hi>undertaken lightly, unadvisedly, or wantonly, to satisfie mens carnal lusts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly,
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:60285:172"/>
and in the fear of God;</hi> and in so doing no doubt a blessing would follow, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise there is little ground to expect. I have now done with this Relation between <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="19">19. The <hi>next</hi> is that between <hi>Friends;</hi> and <note place="margin">Friendship.</note> this Relation if it be rightly founded, it is of great neerness and usefulness, but there is none more generally mistaken in the world; men usually call them their friends, with whom they have an intimacy, and frequency of conversation, though that intimacy be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing but an agreement and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in sin. The <hi>Drunkard</hi> thinks him his friend that will keep him company, the <hi>Deceitful</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, him that will aid him in his cheats, the <hi>Proud</hi> man him that will flatter him: And so generally in all vices, they are look't on as friends, that advance and further us in them. But God knowes this is far from friendship; such a friend as this the <hi>Devil</hi> himself is in the highest degree, who is never backward in such offices. The true friendship is that of a direct contrary making; 'tis a concurrence and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in vertue, not in vice: in short, a true friend loves his friend so, that he is very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his good; and certainly he that is really so, will never be the instrument of bringing him to the greatest evil. The general duty of a <hi>Friend</hi> then must be resolved to be the industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <note place="margin">Its duties.</note> pursuit of his friends real advantages, in which there are several particulas contained.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. <hi>As first, faithfulness</hi> in all <hi>trusts</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <note place="margin">Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</note>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:60285:173"/>
to him by his friend, whether that of goods or secrets; he that betrayes the trust of a friend in either, is by all men lookt upon with abhorrence, it being one of the highest falsnesses and treacheries, and for such trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous wounds the Wise man tells us, <hi>Every friend will depart, Eccles.</hi> 22. 22.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'tis the duty of a <hi>Friend</hi> to <note place="margin">Assistance.</note> be <hi>assisting</hi> to his friend in all his outward needs; to counsel him, when he wants ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; to chear him, when he needs comfort; to give him, when he wants relief; and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour his rescue out of any trouble or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. An admirable example we have of this friendship in <hi>Jonathan</hi> to <hi>David, he loved him as his own soul;</hi> and we see he not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trives for his safety when he was in danger, but runs hazards himself to rescue and deliver his friend, draws his fathers anger upon him, to turn it from <hi>David,</hi> as you may read at large, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.</p>
                  <p n="22">22. The <hi>third</hi> and highest duty of a friend <note place="margin">Admonition.</note> is to be aiding and assisting to the soul of his friend, to endeavour to advance that in piety and vertue, by all means within his power, by <hi>exhortations</hi> and encouragements to all vertue by earnest and vehement disswasions from all sin, and not only thus in general, but by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to his particular wants, especially by plain and friendly reproofs, where he knowes or reasonably believes there is any fault com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. This is of all others the most peculiar duty of a friend, it being indeed that which
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:60285:173"/>
none else is qualified for. Such an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness there is in most men to hear of their faults, that those that undertake that work, had need have a great prepossession of their hearts, to make them patient of it: Nay, it is so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally acknowledged to be the proper work of a friend, that if he omit it, he <hi>betrayes</hi> the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender into security, his not reproving will be apt to make the other think he does nothing worthy of reproof, and so he tacitely acts that basest part of a <hi>flatterer,</hi> sooths and cherishes him in his sin; when yet farther it is conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red how great need all men have at some time or other, of being admonished, 'twill appear a most <hi>unfriendly,</hi> yea cruel thing to omit it; we have that natural partiality to our selves, that we cannot so readily discern our own mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cariages, as we do other mens, and therefore 'tis very necessary they should sometimes be shewed us by those, who see them more cleerly; and the doing this at the first may prevent the multiplying of more: whereas if we be suffered to go unreproved, it often comes to such a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit that reproofes will do no good. And then how shall that person be able to answer it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to God or himself, that has by his silence betrayed his friend to this greatest mischief. 'Tis the expression of God himself speaking of a friend, <hi>thy friend which is as thine own soul, Deut.</hi> 13. 6. And sure we should in this respect account our friends as our own souls, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same jealous tenderness and watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness over their souls, which we ought to have of our own. It will therefore be very fit for all
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:60285:174"/>
that have enter'd any strict friendship, to make this one special article in the agreement, that they shall mutually admonish and reprove each other; by which means it will become such an avowed part of their friendship, that it can never be mistaken by the reproved par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for censoriousness or unkindness.</p>
                  <p n="23">23. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> To these several parts of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness must be added that of <hi>Prayer,</hi> we must not <note place="margin">Prayer.</note> only assist our friends, our selves, in what we can, but we must call in the Almighty aid to them, recommending them earnestly to God for all his blessings, both temporal &amp; spiritual.</p>
                  <p n="24">24. <hi>Lastly,</hi> We must be <hi>Constant</hi> in our <note place="margin">Constancy.</note> 
                     <hi>Friendships,</hi> and not out of a Lightness of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour grow weary of a friend, only because we have had him long. This is great injustice to him, who if he have behaved himself well, ought the more to be valued, by how much the longer he has continued to do so: And it is great folly in our selves, for it is the casting away the greatest treasure of humane life, for such certainly is a tryed friend. The wisest of men gives warning of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. 16. <hi>Thine own friend and thy fathers friend forsake not.</hi> Nay farther 'tis not every light offence of a friend, that should make thee renounce his friendship, there must be some allowance made to the infirmities of men, and if thou hast occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to pardon him somewhat to day, perhaps thou mayest give him opportunity to requite thee to morrow; therefore nothing but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulness, or incorrigible vice should break this band.</p>
                  <p n="25">
                     <pb n="323" facs="tcp:60285:174"/>
25. The last relation is that between <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters</hi> and <hi>Servants,</hi> both which owe duty to each other: That of the <hi>Servant</hi> is first <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Servants owe to their Masters obedience.</note> to all lawful commands; this is expresly required by the Apostle, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. 6. <hi>Servants obey in all things your Masters,</hi> &amp;c. And this <hi>obedience</hi> must not be a grumbling and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling one, but ready and cheerful, as he there proceeds to exhort, ver. 7. <hi>with good will do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing service;</hi> and to help them herein, they are to consider that it is to the Lord, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men; God has commanded servants thus to obey their Masters; and therefore the <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> they pay is to God, which may well make them do it cheerfully, how harsh, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy soever the Master be, especially if what the Apostle farther urgeth, ver. 8. be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered <hi>that there is a reward to be expected from God for it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="26">26. The <hi>second duty</hi> of the <hi>Servant</hi> is <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> and that may be of two sorts; <hi>one</hi> as <note place="margin">Fidelity.</note> opposed to eye-service, the <hi>other</hi> to purloyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or defrauding. The <hi>first</hi> part of faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is the doing of all true service to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, not only when his eye is over him, and he expects punishment for the omission, but at all times, even when his Master is not likely to discern his failing, and that servant that doth not make conscience of this, is far from being a faithful servant; this <hi>eye service</hi> being by the Apostle set opposite to that <hi>singleness of heart,</hi> which he requires <hi>of servants, Eph.</hi> 6. 5. The <hi>second</hi> sort of <hi>faithfulness</hi> consists in
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:60285:175"/>
the honest managery of all things intrusted to him by his Master, the not <hi>wasting</hi> his goods (as the <hi>un ust Steward</hi> was accused to have done, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.) whether by careless embezelling of them, or by converting any of them to his own use without the allowance of his Master. This latter is that <hi>purloyning</hi> of which the Apostle warns servants, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 10. And is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed no better then arrant theft; of this kind are all those wayes, that the servant hath of gaining to himself by the loss and damage of his Master, as the being bribed to make ill bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains for him, and many the like: Nay, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this sort of unfaithfulness is worse then common theft, by how much there is a greater trust reposed, the betraying whereof adds to the crime. As for the <hi>other</hi> sort of unfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that of wasting, though without gain to themselves, it differs not much in effect from this, the Master may lose as much by the one as by the other, and then what odds is it to him, whether he be rob'd by the covetousness or negligence of his servant, and it is still the same breach of trust with the former, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Master is supposed to intrust his affairs as well to the care as the honesty of his servant: for 'twould be little advantage to the Master to be secured that his servant would not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self cheat him, whilest in the mean time he would by his carelesness give opportunity to others to do it; therefore he that does not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully look to his Masters profit, deceives his trust, as well as he that unjustly provides for his own.</p>
                  <p n="27">
                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:60285:175"/>
27. A <hi>third</hi> duty of a servant is patience and meekness under the <hi>reproofs</hi> of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, <hi>not answering again,</hi> as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts, <note place="margin">Submission to rebuke.</note> 
                     <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 9. That is, not making such surly and rude replyes, as may encrease the Masters displeasure: A thing too frequent among servants, even in the justest reprehensions, whereas <hi>S. Peter</hi> directs them patiently to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer even the most undeserved correction, even when they <hi>do well and suffer for it,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 20. But the patient suffering of rebuke is not all that is required of servants in this matter, they must also mend the fault they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked for, and not think they have done e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when they have (though never so du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully) given the Master the hearing.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. A <hi>fourth</hi> duty of a servant is <hi>diligence;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Diligence.</note> he must constantly attend to all those things, which are the duties of his place, and not give himself to idleness, and sloth, nor yet to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany keeping, gaming, or any other disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly course, which may take him off from his Masters business. All these are necessary duties of a servant, which they are carefully and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scionably to perform, not so much to escape the Masters anger as Gods, who will certainly call every one of them to an account, how they have behaved themselves towards their earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Masters.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Now on the other side, there are some things also owing from the <hi>Masters</hi> to their <note place="margin">Masters owe to their Servants Justice.</note> 
                     <hi>servants:</hi> As <hi>first</hi> the <hi>Master</hi> is bound to be <hi>just</hi> to them, in performing those conditions,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:60285:176"/>
on which they were hired, such are commonly the giving them food and wages, and that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster that with holds these, is an oppressour.</p>
                  <p n="30">30. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Master is to <hi>admonish</hi> and <note place="margin">Admonition.</note> reprove the <hi>servant</hi> in case of fault, and that not only in faults against them; wherein few <hi>Masters</hi> are backward, but also and more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in faults against God, whereat every Master ought to be more troubled then at those which tend only to his own loss, or inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; the dishonour of God and the hazard of the meanest mans soul, being infinitely more worthy our disquiet, then any thing of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kind can be. And therefore when Masters are presently <hi>on sire</hi> for any little negligence or fault of a servant towards themselves, and yet can without trouble see them run into the greatest sins against God, 'tis a signe they consider their own concernments too much, and Gods glory and their servants souls too little. This is too commonly the temper of Masters, they are generally careless how their servants behave themselves towards God, how disordered and profane their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are, and therefore never bestow any exhortation, or admonition, to perswade them to vertue, or draw them from vice; such Masters forget that they must one day give an account how they have governed their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. It is certainly the duty of every Ruler to endeavour to advance piety and godliness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all those that are under his charge, and that as well in this lesser dominion of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:60285:176"/>
as in the greater of a Realm or Nation. Of this <hi>David</hi> was so careful, that we see he professes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 101 7. <hi>That no deceitful per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son should dwell in his house, that he that told lyes should not tarry in his sight;</hi> so much he thought himself bound to provide that his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily might be a kind of Church, an Assembly of godly upright persons: And if all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters would endeavour to have theirs so, they would beside the eternal reward of it hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, finde a present benefit by it, their worldly business would thrive much the better; for if their servants were brought to make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their wayes, they would then not dare either to be negligent or false.</p>
                  <p n="31">31. But as it is the duty of <hi>Masters</hi> to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish and reprove their servants, so they must also look to do it in a <hi>due manner,</hi> that is so, as may be most likely to do good, not in passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rage, which can never work the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to any thing but the despising or hating him; but with such sober and grave speeches, as may convince him of his fault, and may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so assure him, that it is a kinde desire of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment (and not a willingness to wreck his own rage) which makes the Master thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke him.</p>
                  <p n="32">32. A <hi>third</hi> duty of the Master is to set <hi>good example</hi> of honesty and godliness to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, <note place="margin">Good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</note> without which 'tis not all the exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or reproofs he can use, will ever do good; or else he pulls down more with his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> then 'tis possible for him to build with
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:60285:177"/>
the other, and 'tis madness for a drunken, or profane Master to expect a sober and godly family.</p>
                  <p n="33">33. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> the <hi>Master</hi> is to provide that <note place="margin">Means of Instruction.</note> his servants may not want means of being <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed</hi> in their duty, as also that they may daily have constant times of worshipping God, publickly by having prayers in the family; but of this I have spoken before under the head of Prayer, and therefore shall here say no more of it.</p>
                  <p n="34">34. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The <hi>Master</hi> in all affairs of his <note place="margin">Moderation in Command</note> own, is to give reasonable and <hi>moderate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,</hi> not laying greater burdens on his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants then they are able to bear, particularly not requiring so much work, that they shall have no time to bestow on their souls, as on the other side he is not to permit them to live so idly as may make them either useless to him, or may betray themselves to any ill.</p>
                  <p n="35">35. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The <hi>Master</hi> is to give his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <note place="margin">Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in well doing.</note> 
                     <hi>encouragement</hi> in well doing, by using them with that bounty and kindness which their faithfulness and diligence and piety de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves: and finally in all his dealing with them, he is to remember that himself hath, as the Apostle saith, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6 9. <hi>A Master in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> to whom he must give an account of the usage of his meanest servant on earth. Thus have I briefly run through those several Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to which we owe particular Duty, and so have done with that <hi>first</hi> branch of Duty to our Neighbours; that of Justice.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>second</hi> branch of Duty to our <note place="margin">Charity.</note> 
                     <hi>Neighbours</hi> is <hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Love.</hi> This is the great Gospel duty so often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned us by Christ, the <hi>New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement</hi> as himself calls it, <hi>John</hi> 13 34. <hi>That ye love one another,</hi> and this is again repeated twice in one Chapter, <hi>John</hi> 15. 12. 17. and the first Epistle of <hi>S. John</hi> is almost wholly spent in the perswasion to this one duty, by which we may see 'tis no matter of indifference, but most strictly required of all that professe Christ. Indeed himself has given it as the badg and livery of his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 13. 35. <hi>By this shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye have love one to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Charity</hi> may be considered two wayes; <note place="margin">In the Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> 
                     <hi>first,</hi> in respect of the <hi>Affections; secondly,</hi> of the <hi>Actions.</hi> Charity in the <hi>affections</hi> is a sincere kindness, which disposes us to wish all good to others, and that in all their capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, in the same manner that justice obliged us to wish no hurt to any man, in respect ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Soul, his Body, his Goods, or his
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:60285:178"/>
Credit, so this first part of Charity bindes us to wish all good to them in all these.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>first,</hi> for the <hi>Soul.</hi> If we have any the least spark of Charity, we cannot but wish <note place="margin">To mens Souls.</note> all good to mens <hi>Soules;</hi> Those precious things which Christ thought worth the ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soming with his own blood, may surely well challenge our kindness, and good wishes; and therefore if we do not thus love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we are far from obeying that Command of loving, as he hath loved; for 'twas the Souls of men which he loved so tenderly, and both did and suffered so much for. Of this love of his to Souls there are two great and special effects: the <hi>first,</hi> the purifying them here by his grace, the <hi>second,</hi> the making them everlastingly happy in his glory; and both these we are so far to copy out in our kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as to be earnestly desirous that all men should arive to that purity, and holinese here, which may make them capable of eternall happiness hereafter. It were to be hoped, that none that himself <hi>carried a Soul about him,</hi> could be so cruel to that of another mans, as not sincerely to wish this, did not experience shew us there are some persons, whose malice is so divelish, as to reach even to the direct contrary; the wishing not only the sin, but the damnation of others. Thus may you have some, who in any injury, or oppression they suffer, make it their only comfort, that their enemies will <hi>damn</hi> themselves by it; when alas! that should to a Christian be much
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:60285:178"/>
more terrible, then any suffering they could bring upon him. He that is of this temper, is a disciple of Satans, not of Christ, it being directly contrary to the whole scope of that grand Christian precept, of <hi>loving our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as our selves.</hi> For 'tis sure, no man that believes there is such a thing <hi>as damnation,</hi> wishes it to himself; be he never so fond of the wayes that lead to it, yet he wishes that may not be his journeys end; and therefore by that rule of Charity should as much dread it for his Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> We are to wish all good to the <note place="margin">To their Bodies, Goods and Credit.</note> 
                     <hi>Bodies</hi> of men, all health and welfare, we are generally tender enough of our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, dread the least pain or ill, that can befal them: Now <hi>Charity,</hi> by vertue of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned precept, extends this tenderness to all others, and whatever we apprehend as grievous to our selves, we must be unwilling should befal another. The like is to be said of the other two, goods and credit, that as we wish our own thriving and reputation, so we should likewise that of others, or else we can never be said to <hi>love our neighbour as our selves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Charity of the <hi>affections,</hi> if it be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, <note place="margin">Effects of this Charity</note> will certainly have <hi>these</hi> several effects, which are so inseparable from it, that they are often in Scripture accounted as parts of the duty, and so most strictly required of us; <hi>First,</hi> it will keep the mind in a peaceable and <hi>meek</hi> temper towards others, so far from
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:60285:179"/>
seeking occasions of contentions, that no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation shall draw us to it; for where we have kindness we shall be unapt to quarrel, it being one of the special qualities of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that it is <hi>not easily provoked,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And therefore whoever is unpeaceble, shewes his heart is destitute of this <hi>Charity. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> it will breed compassion towards all the <hi>miseries</hi> of others, every mis-hap that befalls, where we wish well, is a kinde of defeat and disaster to our selves, and therefore if we wish well to all, we shall be thus concerned in the calamities of all, have a real grief, and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to see any in misery, and that according to the proportion of the suffering. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it will give us <hi>joy</hi> in the prosperities of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: <hi>Solomon</hi> observes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 19. That <hi>the desire accomplished is sweet to the Soul;</hi> and then whoever has this real desire of his neighbours welfare, his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ire is accomplished in their prosperity, and therefore he cannot but have contentment and satisfaction in it. Both these are together commanded by <hi>St. Paul,</hi> Rom. 12. 12. <hi>Rejoyce with them that rejoyce, weep with them that weep. Fourthly,</hi> it will excite and stir up our prayers for others: We are of our selves impotent, feeble creatures, unable to bestow blessings, where we most wish them, therefore if we do indeed desire the good of others, we must seek it on their behalf, from him, whence every <hi>good and perfect gift com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, Jam.</hi> 1. 17. This is so necessary a part of Charity, that without it our kindness is but an
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:60285:179"/>
unsignificant thing, a kinde of empty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. For how can he be believed to wish well in earnest, who will not thus put life and efficacy into his wishes by forming them into prayers which will otherwise be vain and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less. The Apostle thought not fit to leave men to their bare wishes, but exhorts that supplications, prayers and giving of thanks <hi>be made for all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1. which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all that have this true charity of the heart, will readily conform to. These severals are so naturally the fruits of this Charity that it is a deceit for any man to perswade himself he hath it, who cannot produce these fruits to evidence it by.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet a farther excellency of <note place="margin">It casts ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> Envy.</note> this grace, it guards the mind, and secures it from several great and dangerous vices; as <hi>first</hi> from <hi>Envie;</hi> This is by the Apostle taught us to be the property of Charity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. <hi>Charity envieth not;</hi> And indeed common reason may confirm this to us, for <hi>Envie</hi> is a sorrow at the prosperity of another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must needs be directly contrary to that desire of it, which we shewed before was the effect of love; so that if love bear sway in the heart, 'twill certainly chace out Envie. How vainly then do those pretend to this vertue, that are still grudging, and repining at every good hap of others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> It keeps down <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pride.</note> This is also taught us by the Apostle in the forementioned place, <hi>Charity vaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:60285:180"/>
not it self, is not pusfed up;</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly we finde, that where this vertue of love is commanded, there humility is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. Thus it is, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12, <hi>Put on there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bowels of Mercies, Kindness, Humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of minde,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Be kindly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned one towards another with brotherly love in honour preserring one another,</hi> where you see how close an attendant humility is of love. Indeed it naturally flowes from it, for love al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes sets a price and value upon the thing beloved, makes us esteem and prize it; thus we too constantly finde it in sel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> love, it makes us think highly of our selves, that we are much more excellent then other men. Now if love thus plac'd on our selves, beget pride, let us but divert the course, and turn this love on our brethren, and it will as surely beget humility, for then we should see and value those gifts and excellencies of theirs, which now our pride, or our hatred makes us to overlook and neglect, and not think it reasonable either to despise them, or vaunt and magnifie our selves upon such a comparison; we should certainly finde cause to put the Apostles exhortation in practice, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 4. That we should <hi>esteem others better then our selves.</hi> Whoever therefore is of so haughty a temper, as to vilisie and disdain others, may conclude, he hath not this charity rooted in his heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It casts out <hi>censoriousness</hi> and rash judging <hi>Charity,</hi> as the Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">ensorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ss.</note> 13. 5. <hi>Thinketh no evil,</hi> is not apt to entertain
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:60285:180"/>
ill conceits of others, but on the contrary as it followes, ver. 7. <hi>Believeth all things, hopeth all things;</hi> that is, it is forward to believe and hope the best of all men; and surely our own experience tells us the same, for where we love we are usually unapt to discern faults, be they never so gross (witness the great blindness we generally have towards our own) and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shall certainly not be likely to Create them, where they are not, or to aggravate them beyond their true size and degree. And then to what shall we impute those unmerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful censures and rash judgements of others, so frequent among men, but to the want of this Charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> It casts out <hi>Dissembling</hi> and feigned <note place="margin">Dissembling.</note> kindness; where this true and real love is, that false and counterfeit one flyes from before it, and this is the love we are commanded to have, such as <hi>is without dissimulation, Rom.</hi> 12. 9. Indeed where this is rooted in the heart, there can be no possible use of dissimulation: because this is in truth all that the false one would seem to be, and so is as far beyond it as Nature is beyond Art, nay indeed as a divine vertue is beyond a foul sin; for such is that hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical kindness, and yet tis to be feared that does too generally usurp the place of this real charity, the effects of it are too visible among us, there being nothing more common then to see men make large professions to those who as soon as their <hi>backs</hi> are turned they either deride or mischief.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:60285:181"/>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> It casts out all mercinariness, and <hi>self-seeking,</hi> 'tis of so noble and generous a temper, that it despises all projectings for gain or advantage, <hi>Love seeketh not her own,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Self-seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 5. And therefore that huckstering kind of love so much used in the world, which places it self only there, where it may fetch in benefit is very far from this charity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> It turns out of the heart all malice and desire of <hi>Revenge,</hi> which is so utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">Revenge.</note> to it, that it is impossible they should both dwell in the same breast; 'tis the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of love to <hi>bear all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 7. To endure the greatest injuries, without thought of making any other return to them then prayers and blessings, and therefore the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious revengeful person, is of all others the greatest stranger to this Charity.</p>
                  <p>'Tis true, if this vertue were to be exercised but towards some sort of persons, it might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist <note place="margin">This cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity io be extended even to enemies.</note> with malice to others, it being possible for a man that bitterly hates one to love another; but we are to take notice that this Charity must not be so confined, but must extend and stretch it self to all men in the world, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to <hi>Enemies,</hi> or else it is not that divine charity commended to us by Christ. The <hi>loving of friends</hi> and <hi>benefactors</hi> is so low a pitch that the <hi>very Publicans and sinners,</hi> the worst of men <hi>were able to attain to it, Matth.</hi> 5. 46. And therefore 'tis not counted rewardable in a Disciple of Christ; No, he expects we should soar higher, and therefore hath set us this
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:60285:181"/>
more spiritual and excellent precept of loving of enemies, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 44. <hi>I say unto you, love your enemies, blesse them that curse you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</hi> and whosoever does not thus, will never be owned by him for a Disciple. We are therefore to conclude, that all which hath been said concerning this <hi>Charity</hi> of the <hi>Affections,</hi> must be understood to belong as well to our spitefullest enemy, as our most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging friend. But because this is a duty to which the froward nature of man is apt to object much, 'twill not be amiss to insist a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on some considerations, which may inforce it on us.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>first</hi> consider what hath been already <note place="margin">Motives thereunto. Command of Christ.</note> toucht on, that it is the <hi>Command</hi> of Christ, both in the Text above mentioned, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of others, there being scarce any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept so often repeated in the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as this of loving and forgiving of our enemies. Thus <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 32. <hi>Be ye kinde one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another;</hi> And again, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 13. <hi>Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye.</hi> So also, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 3. 9. <hi>Not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring evil for evil, nor railing for railing, but contrarywise Blessing.</hi> A whole Volume of Texts might be brought to this purpose, but these are certainly enough to convince any man, that this is strictly required of us by Christ, and indeed I think, there are few that
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:60285:182"/>
ever heard of the Gospel, but know it is so. The more prodigiously strange is it, that men that call themselves Christians, should give no degree of obedience to it, nay, not onely so, but even publickly avow, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess the contrary, as we daily see they do, it being ordinary to have men resolve, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that they will not forgive such, or such a man, &amp; no consideration of Christs command can at all move them from their purpose. Certainly these men understand not what is meant by the very word <hi>Christian,</hi> which signifies a servant, and Disciple of Christ, and this Charity is the very badg of the one, the lesson of the other: and therefore 'tis the greatest absurdity, and contradiction, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess themselves Christians, and yet at the same time to resist this so express Command of that Christ, whom they own as their Master. <hi>If I be a Master,</hi> saith God, <hi>where is my fear?</hi> Mal. 1. 6. Obedience and reverence are so much the duties of servants, that no man is thought to look on him as a Master, to whom he payes them not. <hi>Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things that I say?</hi> saith Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 46. The whole world is divided into two great Families, <hi>Christs</hi> and <hi>Satans,</hi> and the obedience each man payes, signifies to which of these Masters he belongs, if he obey <hi>Christ,</hi> to <hi>Christ;</hi> if <hi>Satan,</hi> to <hi>Satan.</hi> Now this sin of malice, and revenge is so much the dictate of that wicked spirit, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be a more direct obeying of him,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:60285:182"/>
'tis the taking his livery on our backs, the proclamation whose servants we are; What ridiculous impudence is it then, for men that have thus entred themselves of Satans Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to pretend to be the Servants of Christ? Let such know assuredly, that they shal not be <hi>own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by him, but at the great day of accompt, be turned over to their proper Master, to receive their wages, in fire and brimstone.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>second</hi> consideration is the <hi>example</hi> of <note place="margin">Example of God.</note> 
                     <hi>God:</hi> this is an argument Christ himself thought fit to use, to impress this duty on us as you may see <hi>Luk.</hi> 6. 35. 36. Where after having given the Command of <hi>Loving Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> he encourages to the practise of it, by telling, that it is that which will make us the <hi>Children of the Highest</hi> (that is, 'twill give us a likeness and resemblance to him; as children have to their Parents) <hi>for he is kind to the unthankfull and the evil; And to the same purpose,</hi> you may read <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. <hi>He maketh his sin to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust;</hi> And sure this is a most forcible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration to excite us to this duty. God we know, is the fountain of perfection, and the being like to him, is the summe of all we can wish for, and though it was Lucifers fall, his ambition to be like the most high, yet had the likeness he affected been only that of Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and goodness, he might still have been an Angell of light; This desire of imitating our Heavenly Father is the especial mark of a

This is a huge de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of mercy and kindness, but the means he used for effecting this, is yet far beyond it; He <hi>sent his own Son</hi> from Heaven, to work it, and that not only by perswasions, but suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings also; So much did he prize us miserable crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:60285:184"/>
for though one may be (&amp; too many are) guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of unthankfulness towards men, yet because the greatest benefits that man can bestow, are infinitely short of those which God doth, the ingratitude cannot be neer so great as towards God it is. <hi>Lastly,</hi> there is the <hi>greatness</hi> and multitude of our <hi>sins</hi> against <hi>God,</hi> which do infinitely exceed all that the most injurious man can do against us, for we all sin much oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and more heinously against him then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man, be he never so malicious, can find op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of injuring his brethren. This ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality and disproportion our Saviour inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in <hi>the parable,</hi> Mat. 18. where our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences against God are noted by the <hi>ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand talents,</hi> whereas our brethrens against us are described by the <hi>hundred pence;</hi> a talent hugely out-weighs a penny, and ten thousand outnumbers a hundred, yet so and much more does the weight and number of our sins exceed all the offences of others against us: Much more might be said to shew the vast inequality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the faults which God forgives us, and those we can possibly have to forgive our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: But this I suppose may suffice to silence all the <hi>objections</hi> of cruel and revengefull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, against this kindness to <hi>enemies.</hi> They are apt to look upon it as an absur'd and <hi>unreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable</hi> thing, but since God himself acts it in so much a higher degree, who can without blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy say 'tis unreasonable? If this, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther spiritual duty appear so to us, we may learn the reason from the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14.

                     <hi>The carnal man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him;</hi> 'tis the carnality and fleshliness of our hearts, that makes it seem so, and therefore in stead of disputing against the duty, let us purge our hearts of that, and then we shall find that true which the spirituall Wisdom affirms of her Doctrines, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nay, this loving of enemies is not only a reasonable, but a <hi>pleasant</hi> duty, and that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose <note place="margin">Pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this Duty.</note> as a fourth consideration; there is a great deal of sweetness and delight to be found in it; of this I confess none can so well judge as those that have practised it, the nature even of earthly pleasures being such, that 'tis the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment only that can make a man truly know them: No man can so describe the taste of any delicious thing to another, as that by it he shal know the relish of it, he must first actually taste of it, and sure 'tis more so in spiritual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, and therefore he that would fully know the sweetness and pleasantness of this duty, let him set to the practise and then his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience will be the best informer: But in the mean time, how very unjust, yea, and foolish is it, to pronounce ill of it before tryal: for men to say this is irksome, and intolerable, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves so much as once offered to trie whether indeed it were so or no?

<pb n="344" facs="tcp:60285:185"/>
whereas in all justice the testimony of it should be taken only from those who have tryed it, and they would certainly give ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account of it.</p>
                  <p>But though the full knowledg hereof be to be had only by this neerer acquaintance, yet me thinks even those who look at it but at a distance may discern some what of <hi>amiableness</hi> in it, if no other way, yet at least by <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> it with the uneasiness of its contrary, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Revenge are the most restless, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting passions that can possess the mind of a man, they keep men in a perpetual study and care how to effect their mischievous purposes, it disturbs their very sleep, as <hi>Solomon</hi> observes <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>They sleep not except they have done mischief, and their sleep is taken away, except they cause some to fall:</hi> Yea, it imbitters all the good things they enjoy, so that they have no taste or relish of them; a remarkable example of this we have in <hi>Haman,</hi> who though he abounded in all the greatness and felicity of the world, yet the malice he had to a poor despisable man <hi>Mordecai,</hi> kept him from <hi>tasting contentment in all this,</hi> as you may see <hi>Esther</hi> 5. where after he had related to his friends all his prosperities, ver. 11. he concludes thus ver. 12. <hi>Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the kings gate.</hi> On the other side, the peaceable spirit, that can quietly pass by all injuries and affronts, enjoys a continual calm, and is above the malice of his enemies, for let

them do what they can, they cannot rob him of his quiet, he is firm as a <hi>rock,</hi> which no storms or windes can move, when the furious and revengeful man is like a <hi>wave,</hi> which the least blast tosses and tumbles from its place. But besides this inward disquiet of revengful men, they often bring many outward calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon themselves, they exasperate their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and provoke them to do them greater mischiefs, nay oftentimes they willingly run themselves upon the greatest miseries in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suit of their revenge, to which tis ordinary to see men sacrifice <hi>Goods, Ease, Credit, Life,</hi> nay <hi>soul</hi> it self, not caring what they suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so they may spite their enemy; so strangely does this wretched humour besot and blind men. On the contrary, the <hi>meek</hi> person he often melts his adversary, pacifics his anger; <hi>A soft answer turns away wrath,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 15. 1. And sure there is nothing can tend more to that end; but if it do hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that his enemy be so inhumane, that he miss of doing that, yet he is still a gainer by all he can suffer. For <hi>first,</hi> he gains an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of exercising that most Christian grace of charity and forgiveness: and so at once of obeying the command, and imitating the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of his Saviour, which is to a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian spirit a most valuable advantage; and then <hi>secondly,</hi> he gains an accession and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease to his reward hereafter.

For alas! what hurt is it possible for thee to do to another, which can bear any compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with that thou doest thy self, in losing the pardon of thy sins? which is so unspeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a mischief, that the <hi>Devil</hi> himself with all his malice cannot wish a greater, 'tis all he aims at, <hi>first,</hi> that we may sin, and then that those sins may never be pardoned, for then he knowes he has us sure enough, Hell, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation being certainly the portion of every unpardoned sinner, besides all other effects of Gods wrath in this life; consider this, and then tell me what thou hast got by the highest revenge thou ever actedst upon another. 'Tis a <hi>Divelish</hi> phrase in the mouth of men, <hi>that revenge is sweet:</hi> but is it possible there can be (even to the most distemperate palate) any such sweetness in it, as may recompense that everlasting <hi>bitterness</hi> that attends it?
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:60285:186"/>
'Tis certain, no man in his wits can upon sober judging, imagine there is. But alas! we give not our selves time to weigh things, but suffer our selves to be hurryed away with the heat of an angry humour, never <hi>considering</hi> how dear we must pay for it: like the silly <hi>Bee,</hi> that in anger leaves at once her sting &amp; her life behind her, the sting may perhaps give some short pain to the flesh it sticks in, but yet there is none but discerns the <hi>Bee</hi> has the worst of it, that pays her life for so poor a revenge; so it is in the greatest acts of our malice, we may perhaps leave our stings in others, put them to some present trouble, but that compared with the hurt redounds to our selves by it, is no more then that inconsiderable pain is to death; Nay not so much, because the mischiefs, that we bring upon our selves are eternal, to which no finite thing can bear any proportion. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> then, whensoever thou art contriving &amp; plotting a <hi>revenge,</hi> that thou quite mistakest the mark; thou thinkest to hit thy enemy, and alas! thou woundest thy self to death.

For he that is truth it self has assured us the contrary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 15. <hi>If ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</hi> And least we should forget the necessity of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he has inserted it into our daily Prayers, where we make it the condition, on which we

beg pardon from God; <hi>Forgive us our tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes, as we forgive them that trespass again<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t us.</hi> What a heavy curse then does every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengful person lay upon himself, when he sayes this Prayer? he does in effect beg God not to forgive him; and 'tis too sure that part of his prayer will be heard, he shall be forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven just as he forgives, that is not at all. This is yet farther set out to us in the parable of the <hi>Lord</hi> and the <hi>Servant, Matth.</hi> 18. the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant had obtained of his Lord the forgiveness of a vast debt, <hi>ten thousand talents,</hi> yet was so cruel to his fellow servant, as to exact a poor trifling sum of an <hi>hundred pence,</hi> upon which his Lord recalls his former forgiveness, and charges him again with the whole debt, and this <hi>Christ</hi> applies to our present purpose, ver. 35. <hi>So likewise shall my heavenly Father do unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every man his brother their trespasses.</hi> One such act of uncharitableness is able to forfeit us the pardon God hath granted us, and then all our sins return again upon us, and sink us to utter ruine. I suppose it needless to heap up more testimonies of Scripture, for the truth of this; these are so clear, as may surely serve to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any man, that acknowledges Scripture, of the great and fearful danger of this sin of uncharitableness. The <hi>Lord possess all our hearts with such a just sense of it as may make us avoid it.</hi>

to bring us into a capacity of that mercy and pardon from God: And shall we not then think our selves obliged to some returnes of thankfulness? If we will take the <hi>Apostles</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he tells us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 15. <hi>That since Christ dyed for us all, 'tis but reasonable that we should not henceforth live unto our selves, but unto him that dyed for us.</hi> Indeed were every moment of our life <hi>consecrated</hi> to his immediate Service, 'twere no more then common gratitude re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, &amp; far less then such inestimable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits deserve; what a shameful unthankfulness is it then to deny him so poor a satisfaction as this, the forgiving our brethren? Supose a man that were ransomed either from <hi>death</hi> or <hi>sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> by the bounty and sufferings of another, should upon his release be charged by him that so freed him in return of that kindness of his, to forgive some slight debt, which was owing him by some <hi>third</hi> person, would you not think him the unthankfullest wretch in the world, that should refuse this to so great a <hi>benefactor?</hi> yet such a wretch and much worse is every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengful person: Christ hath bought us out of eternal slavery, and that not with <hi>corruptible things, as silver and gold,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8. <hi>But with his own<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to any person whatsoever. Nay, farther this is not barely an unthankfulness, but there is also joyned with it a horrible contempt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising of him. This <hi>Peace</hi> &amp; unity of brethren was a thing so much prized &amp; valued by him, that when he was to leave the world, he thought it the most pretious thing he could bequeath, and therefore left it by way of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy to his Disciples, <hi>Jo.</hi> 14. 27. <hi>Peace I leave with you;</hi> we use to set a great value on the slightest bequests of our dead friends, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding careful not to lose them and therefore if we wilfully bangle away this so pretious a Legacy of Christ, 'tis a plain sign we want that Love and esteem of him, which we have of our earthly friends, and that we despise him as well as his Legacy.

As the Soul signifies the <hi>mind</hi> of a man, so we are to endeavour the comfort and refreshment of our brethren, desire to give them all true cause of joy, &amp; cheerfulnes, especially when we see any under any sadness or heaviness, then to bring out all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dialls we can procure, that is, to labour by all Christian and fit means to chear the troubled spirits of our brethren, to <hi>comfort them that are in any heaviness,</hi> as the Apostle speakes, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 4.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Soul</hi> in the spirituall sence is yet of greater concernment, and the securing of <note place="margin">His Soul.</note> that is a matter of much <hi>greater</hi> moment, then the refreshing of the <hi>mind</hi> only, in as much as the eternall sorrows and sadnesses of Hell exceed the deepest sorrows of this life; and therefore though we must not omit the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet on this we are to employ our most
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:60285:189"/>
zealous charities; Wherein we are not to content our selves with a bare wishing well to the Souls of our brethren, this alone is a slug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gish sort of kindness, unworthy of those who are to imitate the great Redeemer of Souls, who did and suffered so much in that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase: No, we must add also our endeavour to make them what we wish them, to this purpose, 'twere very reasonable to propound to our selves in all our conversings with <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> that one great designe of doing some good to their souls. If this purpose were fixt in our minds, we should then discern perhaps many opportunities, which now we overlook, of doing something towards it. The brutish <hi>ignorance</hi> of one would call upon thee to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour his instruction; the <hi>open sin</hi> of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to reprehend &amp; admonish him; the faint and <hi>weak</hi> vertue of another to confirm and incourage him. Every <hi>spirituall want</hi> of thy brother may give thee some occasion of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising some part of this Charity, or if the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances be such, that upon sober judging, thou think it vain to attempt any thing thy self, as if either thy meanness, or thy unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedness, or any the like impediment be like to render thy exhortations fruitless, yet if thou art industrious in thy Charity, thou mayest probably find out some other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument, by whom to do it more success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. There cannot be a <hi>nobler</hi> study then how to benefit mens Souls, and therefore where the direct means are improper, 'tis fit
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:60285:190"/>
we should whet our wits for attaining of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Indeed 'tis a shame, we should not as industriously contrive for this great spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall concernment of others, as we do for every worldly trifling interest of our own; yet in them we are unwearied, and trye one means after another, till we compass our end. But if after all our serious endeavours, the obstinacy of men do not suffer us, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves rather, to reap any fruit from them, if all our wooings and intreatings of men to have mercy on their own Souls will not work on them, yet be sure to continue still to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort by thy example; Let thy great care and tenderness of thy own Soul preach to them the value of theirs, and give not over thy compassions to them, but with the Prophet <hi>Jer.</hi> 13. 17. <hi>Let thy Soul weep in secret for them;</hi> and with the <hi>Psalmist, Let rivers of waters run down thy eyes, because they kept not Gods Law, Psal.</hi> 119. 136. Yea with Christ himself, weep over them, who will <hi>not know the things that belong to their peace, Luk,</hi> 11. 42. And when no importunities with them will work, yet even then cease not to importune God for them, that he will draw them to himself, Thus we see <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he could not diswade the people from that sinful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they were upon, yet he professes not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that he will not cease praying for them; nay, he lookt on it as so much a duty, that it would be sin to him to omit it, <hi>God forbid, sayes</hi> he, <hi>that I should sin against
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:60285:190"/>
the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 23. Nor shall we need to fear that our prayers will be quite lost, for if they prevail not for those for whom we pour them out, yet however they will return into our <hi>own bosomes,</hi> Psal. 35. 13, we shall be sure not to miss of the reward of that Charity.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>second</hi> place, we are to exercise this Active Charity towards the <hi>bodies</hi> of our <note place="margin">Charity in respect of the Body.</note> Neighbours; we are not only to compassio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their pains, and miseries, but also to do what we can for their ease and relief. The good Samaritan <hi>Luke.</hi> 10. had never been proposed as our pattern, had he not as well helped as pitied the wounded man. 'Tis not good wishes, no nor good words neither that avail in such cases, as St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, <hi>If a brother or sister be naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ye give him not those things that are need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for the body, what doth it profit?</hi> Jam. 2. 15. 16. No sure, it profits them nothing, in respect of their bodies, and it will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit thee as little in respect of thy Soul, it will never be reckoned to thee as a Charity. This <hi>releeving</hi> of the <hi>bodily wants</hi> of our brethren, is a thing so strictly required of us, that we find it set down <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. as the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciall thing we shall be <hi>tried</hi> by at the <hi>Last</hi> Day, on the omission whereof is grounded that dreadful sentence, ver. 41. <hi>Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:60285:191"/>
for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And if it shall now be asked, what are the particular acts of this kind which we are to perform? I think we cannot better inform our selves for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ordinary ones, then from this Chapter, where are set down these severals, <hi>the giving meat to the hungry, and drink to the thirtty, harbouring the stranger, clothing the naked, and visiting the sick and imprisoned;</hi> By which <hi>visiting</hi> is meant, not a bare coming to see them, but so coming as to comfort and relieve them; for otherwise it will be but like the <hi>Levite</hi> in the Gospel, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10. who came &amp; <hi>looked on the wounded man,</hi> but did no more, which will never be accepted by God. These are common and ordinary exercises of this charity, for which we cannot want frequent opportunities. But besides these there may sometimes by Gods especial providence fall into our hands, occasions of doing other good offices to the bodies of our neighbours; we may sometimes find a wounded man with the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and then 'tis our duty to do as he did; we may sometimes find an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son condemned to death, as <hi>Susanna</hi> was, and then are with <hi>Daniel</hi> to use all possible endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour for their deliverances: This case <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> seems to refer to, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. 11. <hi>If thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to deliver him that is drawn unto death, and them that are ready to be slain, if thou sayst behold we knew it not; doth not he that ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the heart consider? and he that keepeth thy s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="357" facs="tcp:60285:191"/>
to every man according to his deeds;</hi> we are not lightly to put off the matter with vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, but to remember that God, who knows our most secret thoughts, will severely exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether we have willingly omitted the performance of such a charity: sometimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain (nay God knowes, often now a dayes) we may see a man that by a course of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is in danger to destroy his health, to shorten his dayes, and then it is a due charity not only to the soul, but to the body also, to endeavour to draw him from it. It is impossible to set down <hi>all</hi> the possible <hi>acts</hi> of this corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charity, because there may sometimes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen such opportunities as none can foresee; we are therefore alwayes to carry about us a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious resolution of doing whatever good of this kind we shall at any time discern occasion for, &amp; then whenever that occasion is offered, we are to look on it as a call, as it were from heaven, to put that resolution in practice. <hi>This</hi> part of charity seems to be so much implanted in our natures, as we are <hi>men,</hi> that we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally account them not only unchristian, but <hi>inhumane,</hi> that are void of it, and therefore I hope there will not need much perswasion to it, since our very nature inclines us; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that very consideration wil serve huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to increase the guilt of those that are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it. For since this command is so agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able even to flesh and blood, our disobedience to it can proceed from nothing but a stubbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and resistance against God who gives it.</p>

                  <p>§ 1: THE <hi>third</hi> way of expressing this <hi>Charity</hi> is towards the <hi>goods</hi> or <hi>estate</hi> of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; we are to endeavour his thriving and prosperity in these outward <note place="margin">Charity in respect of the Goods.</note> good things; and to that end, be willing to assist and farther him in all honest wayes of improveing or preserving them, by any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly and friendly office. Opportunities of this do many times fall out: A man may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by his power or perswasion deliver his neighbours goods out of the hands of a thief, or oppressor; sometimes again by his advice and counsel, he may set him in a way of thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or turn him from some ruinous course; and many other occasions there may be of <note place="margin">Towards the rich.</note> doing good turns to another, without any loss or damage to our selves, and then we are to do them, even to our rich neighbours, those that are as wealthy (perhaps much more so)
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:60285:192"/>
as our selves; for though <hi>Charity</hi> do not bind us to give to those that want it lesse then our selves, yet whenever we can further their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, without less'ning our own store, it requires it of us: Nay, if the damage be but light to us in comparison of the advantage to him, it will become us rather to hazard that light damage, then lose him that greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But towards our <hi>poor</hi> brother, Charity tyes us to much more; we are there only to consider the supplying of his wants, and not <note place="margin">Towards the Poor.</note> to stick at parting with what is our own, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, but as far as we are able give freely what is necessary to him. This duty of <hi>Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> is perfectly necessary for the approving our love not only to men, but even to God himself, as St. <hi>John</hi> tels us, 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 17. <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so hath this worlds goods, and seeth his brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> 'Tis vain for him to pretend to love either God or man, who loves his mony so much better, that he will see his poor brother (who is a man, and bears the image of God) suffer all extremities, rather then part with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing to relieve him: On the other side, the performance of this duty is highly acceptable with God, as well as with men.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. 'Tis called, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 16. <hi>A sacrifice wherewith God is well pleased;</hi> and again, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 18. St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls their almes to him, <hi>a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice acceptable, wel-pleasing to God,</hi> and
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:60285:193"/>
the Church hath alwayes look't on it as such; and therefore joyned it with the soleumest part of worship, the holy Sacrament. But because even sacrifices themselves under the Law, were often made unacceptable by being maimed and blemished, it will here be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to enquire what are the due qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Of <hi>these</hi> there are some that respect the <note place="margin">Motives of Alms giving.</note> 
                     <hi>motive,</hi> some the <hi>manner</hi> of our giving. The motive may be <hi>threefold,</hi> respecting God, our neighbour and our selves. That which respects God is obedience and thankfulnesse to him: he has commanded we should give alms, and therefore one speciall end of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, must be the obeying that precept of his. And it is from his bounty alone that we receive all our plenty, and this is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way of expressing our thankfullness for it; for as the <hi>Psalmist</hi> saith, <hi>our goods extend not unto God, Psal.</hi> 16. 2. That tribute which we desire to pay out of our estates, we cannot pay to his person. 'Tis the poor, that are as it were his Proxey and receivers, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what ever we should by way of thankfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness give back again unto God, our alms is the way of doing it: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in respect of our neighbour, the motive must be a true love and compassion to him, a tender fellow-feeling of his wants, and desire of his comfort and relief: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> in respect of our selves, the motive is to be the hope of that eternall reward promised to this performance. This
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:60285:193"/>
Christ points out to us, when he bids us <hi>lay up our treasure in heaven, Mat.</hi> 6. 20. And to <hi>make us friends of the Mammon of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, that they may receive us into everlasting habitations, Luk.</hi> 16. 9. That is by a charitable dispencing of our temporall goods to the poor, to lay up a stock in heaven to gain a title to those endlesse felicities, which God hath promised to the charitable. That is the harvest we must expect of what we sowe in these works of mercy, which will be so rich as would abundantly recompence us, though we should as the Apostle speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow all our goods to feed the poor:</hi> But then we must be sure we make this our sole aim, and not instead of this propose to our selves the praise of men, as the motive of our cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for that will rob us of the other; this is expresly told us by Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. <hi>They that set their hearts on the credit,</hi> they shall gain with men, must take that as their portion, ver. 3. <hi>verily I say unto you, they have their reward;</hi> they chose, it seems, rather to have men their Pay-masters, then God, and to them they are turn'd off, that little airy praise they get from them, is all the reward they must expect: <hi>Ye have no reward of my Father which is in heaven,</hi> ver. 1. we have therefore need to watch our hearts narrowly, that this desire of vain glory steal not in, and befool us into that miserable exchange of a vain blast of mens breath for those substantial and eternal joyes of heaven.</p>

                     <pb n="362" facs="tcp:60285:194"/>
5. In the <hi>second</hi> place we must take care of our <hi>alms-giving,</hi> in respect of the manner; and in that, <hi>first,</hi> we must give cheerfully; men usually value a smal thing, that is given cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <note place="margin">Manner of Alms-giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and with a good heart, more then a much greater, that is wrung from a man with grudging and unwillingness; and God is of the same mind, he <hi>loves a cheerfull giver,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. Which the Apostle makes the reason of <note place="margin">Cheerfully.</note> the foregoing exhortation, of not <hi>giving grudgingly, or as of necessity,</hi> ver. 6. And sure 'tis no unreasonable thing, that is herein required of us, there being no duty that has to humane nature, more of pleasure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, unlesse it be where coveteousness or cruelty have quite work't out the man, &amp; put a ravenous beast in his stead. Is it not a most ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vishing pleasure to him that hath any bowels, to see the joy that a seasonable alms brings to a poor wretch? how it revives and puts new spirits in him, that was even sinking? certainly the most sensuall creature alive knows not how to bestow his mony on any thing, that shal bring him in so great a delight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me thinks it should be no hard matter to give not only without grudging, but even with a great deal of alacrity and cheerfulness, it being the fetching in of pleasure to our selves. <note place="margin">The fear of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. There is but <hi>one objection</hi> can be made against this, and that is, that the danger of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poverishing ones self</hi> by what one gives, may take off that pleasure, and make men either
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:60285:194"/>
not give at all, or not so cheerfully. To this I answer: That <hi>first</hi> were this hazard never so apparent, yet it being the command of God, that we shall thus give, we are yet to obey cheerfully, and be as well content to part with our good; in pursuance of this duty, as we are many times called to do upon some other. In which case <hi>Christ tels us, he that forsakes not all that he hath, cannot be his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. But <hi>secondly,</hi> this is sure a vain suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition: God having particularly promised, the contrary to the Charicable, that it shall bring blessings on them, even in these outward things. <hi>The liberal soul shall be made fat, and he that watereth shall be watered also himself,</hi> Prov. 11. 25. <hi>He that giveth to the poor shall not lack, Prov.</hi> 28. 27. And many the like texts there are, so that one may truely say, this objection is grounded in direct unbelief. The short of it is, we dare not trust God for this: giving to the poor is directly the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our wealth into his hands. <hi>He that give<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the poor lendeth unto the Lord, Prov.</hi> 19. 17. And that too on solemn promise of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment, as it follows in that verse, <hi>that which he hath given will he pay him again.</hi> It is amongst men thought a great disparagment, when we refuse to trust them; it shews we ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther think them not sufficient, or not honest: How vile an affront is it then to God thus to distrust him? nay indeed how horrid blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, to doubt the security of that, for which
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:60285:195"/>
he has thus expresly past his word, who is Lord of all, and therefore cannot be insufficient, and who is the God of truth, and therefore will not fail to make good his Promise? Let not then that <hi>infidel fear</hi> of future want, contract and shut up thy bowels from thy poor bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for though he be never likely to pay thee, yet God becomes his Surety, and enters bond with him, and will most assuredly pay thee with encrease. Therefore it is so far from being damage to thee, thus to give, that it is thy great advantage: Any man would rather choose to put his money in some sure hand, where he may both improve, and be certain of it at his need, then to let it lie unprofitably by him, especially if he be in danger of thieves, or other accidents, by which he may probably loose it: Now alas! all that we possess is in minutely <hi>danger of losing;</hi> innumerable acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents there are, which may in an instant bring a rich man to beggery; he that doubts this, let him but read the <hi>story</hi> of <hi>Job,</hi> and he will there finde an example of it: And therefore what so prudent course can we take for our wealth, as to put it out of the reach of those accidents, by thus lending it to God, where we may be sure to finde it ready at our greatest need and that too with improvement and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; in which respect it is that the Apostle compares <hi>Alms</hi> to <hi>Seed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 10. We know it is the nature of Seed that is sown, to multiply and encrease, and so does all our acts of mercy, they return nor single and naked to
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:60285:195"/>
us, but bring in their sheaves with them, a most plenteous &amp; bountiful harvest. God deals not with our <hi>alms,</hi> as we too often do with his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, wrap them <hi>up in a napkin,</hi> so that they shall never bring in any advantage to us, but makes us most rich returns: and therefore we have all reason most cheerfully, yea, joyfully to set to this duty, which we have such invitations to, as well in respect of our own interests, as our neighbours needs.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We must <hi>give seasonably:</hi> it is <note place="margin">Give sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably.</note> true indeed there are some so poor, that an Alms can never come <hi>unseasonably,</hi> because they alwayes want, yet even to them there may be some <hi>special</hi> seasons of doing it, to their greater advantage; for sometimes an Alms may not only deliver a poor man from some present extremity, but by the right <hi>time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of it, may set him in some way of a more comfortable subsistence afterward. And for the most, I presume it is a good <hi>Rule,</hi> to dispence what we intend to any, as <hi>soon</hi> as may be, for delays are hurtfull oftentimes both to them &amp; ourselves; <hi>first,</hi> as to them, it is sure, the longer we delay, the longer they groan under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent want, &amp; after we have designed them a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, it is in some degree a cruelty to defer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowing of it, for so long we prolong their suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings; you wil think him a hard hearted <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sician,</hi> that having a certain cure for a man in pain, should when he might presently apply it make unnecessary delays, &amp; so keep the poor man still in torture: and the same it is here; we
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:60285:196"/>
want of the due compassion, if we can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our poor brother should have one hour of unnecessary suffering, when we have present opportunity of relieving him, or if he be not in such an extremity of want, yet whatever we intend him for his greater comfort, he loses so much of it, as the time of the delay amounts to: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in respect of our selves; tis ill to defer, for thereby we give advantage to the temptations either of <hi>Satan</hi> or our own cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous humour, to disswade us from it. Thus it fares too often with many Christian duties; for want of a speedy execution, our purposes cool, and never come to act; so many resolve they will repent, but because they set not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly upon it, one delay succeeds another, and keeps them from ever doing it at all; and so 'tis very apt to fall out in this case, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally with men, who are of a covetous temper, and therefore they of all others should not trust themselves thus to delay.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We should take care to give <hi>prudently,</hi> that is to give most, where it is most <note place="margin">Prudently.</note> needed, and in such a manner, as may do the receiver most good: Charities do often miscarry for want of this care, for if we give at all adventures to all that seem to want, we may somtimes give more to those, whose sloth and lewdness is the cause of their want then to those who best deserve it, and so both encourage the one in their idlenesse, and disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selves from giving to the other. Yet I doubt not such may be the present wants e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:60285:196"/>
of the most unworthy, that we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, but where no such pressing need is, we shall do best to chuse out the fitter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of charity, such are those who either are <hi>not able</hi> to labour, or else have a <hi>greater charge</hi> then their labour can maintain, and to those our alms should be given also in such manner as may be most likely to do them good the manner of which may differ according to the circumstances of their condition; it may to some be best perhaps, to give them by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and little, to others the giving it all at once may tend more to their benefit; and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a <hi>seasonable loan</hi> may do as well as a gift, and that may be in the power sometimes of those who are able to give but little: But when we thus lend on charity, we must lend freely without Use, and also with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that if he should prove unable to pay, we will forgive so much of the principal as his needs require, and our abilities will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. They want much of this charity, who clap up <hi>poor debtors</hi> in prison, when they know they have nothing to answer the debt, which is a great cruelty to make another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable, when nothing is gained to our selves by it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We should give <hi>liberally,</hi> we must not be strait handed in our <hi>alms,</hi> and give by such pitiful scantlings, as will bring almost no relief to the receiver, for that is a kind of mockery; 'tis as if one should pretend to feed one that is almost famisht by giving him a
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:60285:197"/>
crumb of bread, such Doles as that would be most ridiculous, yet I fear 'tis too neer the proportion of some mens alms; such men are below those Disciples we read of, who knew only the Baptism of <hi>John,</hi> for 'tis to be observed, that <hi>John Baptist,</hi> who was but the fore-runner of Christ, makes it a special part of his Doctrine, that he <hi>that hath two coats should impart to him that hath none, Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He sayes not, he that hath some great Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>robe, but even he that hath <hi>but two coats</hi> must part with one of them; from whence we may gather that whatsoever is above (not our vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but) our need should thus be disposed of, when our brethrens necessity requires it. But if we look into the <hi>first</hi> time of the Gospel, we shall find Christianity far exceeded this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>Johns,</hi> the <hi>converts</hi> assigned not a part only, but frankly <hi>gave all to the use of the Brethren, Acts</hi> 4. and though that being upon an extraordinary occasion, will be no measure for our constant practise yet it may shew us how prime and fundamental a part of Christianity, this of Charity is, that at the very first founding of the Church, such vast degrees of it were practised; and if we farther consider what precepts of love are given us in the Gospel, even to the <hi>laying down our lives for the brethren,</hi> 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 16. We cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine our goods are in Gods account so much more precious then our lives, that he would command us to be prodigal of the one, and yet allow us to be sparing of the other.</p>

11. A multitude of Arguments might be brought to recommend this bounty to all that profess Christ; I shall mention onely two, which I find used by St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> on this occasion. The <hi>first</hi> is the example of Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 9. <hi>For ye know the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.</hi> Christ emptyed himself of all that glory and greatness, he enjoyed in Heaven with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and submitted himself to a life of much meaness and poverty, only to enrich us. And therefore for shame, let us not grudge to empty our Coffers, to lessen somewhat of our heaps, to relieve his poor members. The <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> is the expectation of reward, which will be more or less, according to the degrees of our Alms, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 6. <hi>He that soweth spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly shall reap sparingly, and he that soweth bountifully shall reap bountifully.</hi> We think him a very improvident husband-man, that to save a little seed at present, sowes so thin, as to spoil his crop; and the same folly 'twill be in us, if by the sparingness of our Alms, we make our selves a lank harvest hereafter, lose either all, or a great part of those rewards which God hath provided for the liberal Alms-Giver. What is the <hi>proportion</hi> which may be called a liberal giving, I shall not undertake to set down, there being degrees even in liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, one may give liberally, &amp; yet another give more liberally then he; besides, liberality is to
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:60285:198"/>
be measured, not so much by what is given as by the ability of the giver; A man of a mean estate may give less then one of a great, and yet be the more liberall person, because that little may be more out of his, then the greater is out of the others. Thus we see Christ pronounces the poor widow to <hi>have given more to the Treasury, then all the rich men,</hi> Luke. 21. 3. not that her <hi>two mites</hi> were more then their <hi>rich</hi> gifts, but that it was more for her, she having left nothing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, whereas they gave out of their abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance what they might easily spare. Every man must herein judg for himself; we see the Apostle, though he earnestly press the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to bounty, yet prescr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>bes not to them how much they shall give, but leaves that to their own brests, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 7. <hi>Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give.</hi> But let us still remember, that the more we give (provided we do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fail in the support of those, that most immediately depend on us) the more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it will be to God, and the more reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by him. And to secure the performance of the duty of Alms-giving (what ever the proportion be) we may do very well to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the advice St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in this matter, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <hi>Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store as God hath prospered him;</hi> If men would do thus, lay by somewhat <hi>weekly</hi> in store for this work of Charity, it were the
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:60285:198"/>
surest way not to be unprovided of somewhat to give, when an occasion offered it self, and by giving so by little and little, the expence would become less sensible, and so be a means to prevent those <hi>grudgings,</hi> and <hi>repinings,</hi> which are apt to attend men in greater dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursements; And sure this were in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects also a very proper course, for when a trades-man casts up his weekly account, and sees what his gains have been, 'tis of all others the most seasonable time to offer this tribute to God out of what he hath by his blessing gained; If any will say they cannot so well weekly reckon their gains, as by longer spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of time, I shall not contend with them for that precise time, let it be done monthly, or quarterly, so it be done: But that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what should still be laid by in bank for these uses rather then left loose to our sudden Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities is sure very expedient, and I doubt not, whoever will make tryal of it, will upon expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience acknowledge it to be so.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. The <hi>fourth</hi> exercise of our <hi>Charity</hi> is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the credit of our neighbour: and of <note place="margin">Charity in respect of the Credit.</note> this we may have many occasions; sometimes towards the innocent, and sometimes also towards the guilty. If one whom we know to be an innocent person, be slandered, and traduced, <hi>Charity</hi> bindes us to do what we may for the declaring his innocency, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering him from that false imputation, and that not only by witnessing when we are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it, but by a voluntary offering our te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:60285:199"/>
on his behalf, or if the accusation be not before a Court of Justice, and so there be no place for that our more solemn testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but that it be only a slander tost from one to another, yet even there we are to do what we can to clear him, by taking all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions publickly to declare what we know of his innocency. But even to the guilty there is some <hi>Charity</hi> of this kind to be performed, sometimes by concealing the fault, if it be such that no other part of <hi>Charity</hi> to others make it necessary to discover, or be it not so notorious, as that it will be sure to betray it self: The wounds of Reputation are of all others the most incurable, and therefore it may well become <hi>Christian Charity</hi> to prevent them, even where they have been deserved; and perhaps such a tenderness in hiding the fault may sooner bring the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Repentance,</hi> if it be seconded (as it ought to be) with all earnestness of private admonition: But if the fault be such, that it be not to be concealed, yet still there may be place for this <hi>Charity,</hi> in extenuating, and lessening it, as far as the circumstances will bear; As if it were done suddenly, and rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Charity</hi> will allow some abatement of the Censure, which would belong to a designed, and deliberate act; and so proportionably in other circumstances. But the most frequent exercises of this <hi>Charity</hi> happen towards those, of whose either innocency or guilt we have no knowledge, but are by some doubtful
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:60285:199"/>
actions brought under suspition: And here we must remember, that it is the property of love, <hi>not to think evil,</hi> to judge the best; and therefore we are both to abstain from uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable conclusions of them our selves, and as much as lyes in us, to keep others from them also, and so endeavour to preserve the credit of our neighbor, which is oftentimes as much shaken by unjust suspitions, as it would be by the truest accusation. To these cases, I suppose belongs that precept of Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 1. <hi>Judge not;</hi> and when we consider, how that is backt in the following words, <hi>That ye be not judged,</hi> we shall have cause to believe it no such light matter, as the world seems to account it; Our merciful judging of others will be paid home to us, in the strict, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judgement of God.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. I have now gone through this <hi>Active Charity,</hi> as it relates to the four several capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities of our brethren, many of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars <note place="margin">The acts of Charity in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects acts of Justice also.</note> whereof were before briefly mentioned, when we spake of <hi>Justice.</hi> If any think it improper, that the same acts should be made part of <hi>Justice,</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> too, I shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them to consider, that <hi>Charity</hi> being by Christs command become a debt to our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, all the parts of it may in that respect be ranked under the head of <hi>Justice,</hi> since 'tis sure paying of debts is a part of that: Yet because in our common use we do distinguish between the offices of <hi>Justice</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> I have chose to enlarge on them in particular
<pb facs="tcp:60285:200"/>
referenc to <hi>Charity.</hi> But I desire it may still be remembred, that whatsoever is under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, is so much a due from us, that we sin not only against <hi>Charity,</hi> but <hi>Justice</hi> too, if we neglect it; Which deserves to be considered, the more to stir up our care to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, and the rather, because there seems to be a common errour in this point; Men look upon their acts of mercy, as things purely voluntary, that they have no obligation to; and the effect of it is this, that they are apt to think very highly of themselves, when they have performed any, though never so mean, but never blame themselves, though they omit all: which is a very dangerous, but withall a very natural fruit of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer perswasion. If there be any Charities wherein Justice is not concerned, they are those which for the height and degrees of them are not made matter of strict duty, that is, are not in those degrees commanded by God, and even after these 'twill be very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable for us to labour; but that cannot be done without taking the lower and necessary degrees in our way; and therefore let our first care be for them.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. To help us wherein there will be no better means, then to keep before our eyes <note place="margin">The great rule of Charity.</note> that grand rule of <hi>Loving our Neighbours as our selves;</hi> This the Apostle makes the summe of our <hi>Whole duty to our Neighbours,</hi> Rom. 13. 9. let this therefore be the standard, whereby to measure all thy actions, which relate to
<pb facs="tcp:60285:200"/>
others; When ever any necessity of thy Neighbours presents it self to thee, ask thy self, whether if thou wert in the like case, thy love to thy self would not make thee indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strious for relief, and then resolve thy love to thy Neighbour must have the same effect for him. This is that <hi>Royal Law,</hi> as St. <hi>James</hi> calls it, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 8. which all that profess them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves subjects to Christ, must be ruled by; and whosoever is so will not fail of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Charities to others, because 'tis sure he would upon the like occasions have all such performed to himself. There is none, but wishes to have his good name defended, his poverty relieved, his bodily sufferings suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coured; Only it may be said, that in the spiritual wants, there are some so careless of themselves, that they wish no supply, they desire no reproofs, no instructions, nay, are angry when they are given them; it may therefore seem that such men are not by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of this rule tied to those sorts of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. To this I answer, that the <hi>love of our selves,</hi> which is here set as the measure of that to our Neighbour, is to be understood to be that reasonable love, which men ought to have, and therefore though a man fail of that due love he owes himself, yet his Neighbour hath not thereby forfeited his right, he has still a claim to such a degree of our love, as is answerable to that, which in right we should bear to our selves, and such I am sure is this care of our spiritual estate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:60285:201"/>
'tis not our despising our own Souls, that will absolve us from Charity to other mens, yet I shall not much press this duty in such men, it being neither likely that they will be perswaded to it, or do any good by it, their ill example will overwhelm all their good exhortations, and make them unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. There is yet one act of Charity behind, which does not properly fall under any one <note place="margin">Peace ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</note> of the former heads, &amp; yet may relate to them all, and that is, the <hi>Making peace,</hi> and amity among others; By doing whereof we may much benefit both the Souls, Bodies, Goods, and Credit of our brethren; for all these are in danger by strife and contention. The reconciling of enemies is a most blessed work, and brings a blessing on the actors: We have Christs word for it, <hi>Blessed are the Peace-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> Mat. 5. 9. and therefore we may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged diligently to lay hold of all oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of doing this office of Charity, to use all our Art, and endeavour to take up all grudges and quarrels we discern among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; Neither must we onely labour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store peace where it is lost, but to preserve it where it is: <hi>First,</hi> generally, by striving to beget in the heart of all we converse with a true value of that most pretious Jewel, Peace; <hi>Secondly,</hi> particularly, by a timely preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those jarres, and unkindnesses, we see likely to fall out. It may many times be in the power of a discreet friend or neighbour,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:60285:201"/>
to cure those mistakes, and misapprehensions, which are the first beginnings of quarrels and contentions; and it will be both more easy and more profitable, thus to prevent, then pacify strifes. 'Tis sure 'tis more easy, for when a quarrel is once broken out, 'tis like a violent flame, which cannot so soon be quencht, as it might have been, whilst it was but a smothering fire. And then 'tis also more profitable, for it prevents many sins, which in the progress of an open contention, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most sure to be committed. <hi>Solomon</hi> sayes, <hi>In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin,</hi> Prov. 10. 19. which cannot more truly be said of any sorts of words, then those that pass in anger, and then though the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel be afterwards composed, yet those sins will still remain on their account; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a great Charity to prevent them.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. But to fit a man for this so excellent an Office of <hi>Peace Making,</hi> 'Tis necessary that he be first remarkably peaceable himself; for <note place="margin">He that undertake it must be peaceable himself.</note> with what face canst thou perswade others to that which thou wilt not perform thy self? or how canst thou expect thy perswasions should work? 'twill be a ready reply in every mans mouth, <hi>Thou Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye,</hi> Matth. 7. 5. and therefore be sure thou qualify thy self for the work. There is one point of Peaceableness which seems to be little regarded among men, and that is in the case of <hi>Legal trespasses;</hi> Men think it nothing to go to <hi>Law</hi> about <note place="margin">Of going to Law.</note>
                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:60285:202"/>
every petty trifle, and as long as they have but Law on their side, never think they are to blame: but sure had we that true Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of spirit which we ought, we should be unwilling for such slight matters to trouble and disquiet our Neighbours. Not that all going to Law is utterly unchristian, but such kind of suits especially, as are upon contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, and stoutness of humour, to defend such an inconsiderable right, as the parting with will do us little or no harm, or which is yet worse, to avenge such a trespass. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in greater matters, he that shall part with somewhat of his Right for love of Peace, does surely the most Christianly, &amp; most agreeably to the advice of the Apostle, <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 7. rather to <hi>take wrong,</hi> and <hi>suffer our selves to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded.</hi> But if the damage be so unsuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that it is necessary for us to go to Law, yet even then we must take care of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving Peace; <hi>first,</hi> by carrying still a friendly, and Christian temper towards the party, not suffering our hearts to be at all estranged from him; <hi>secondly,</hi> by being will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to yield to any reasonable terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whenever they shall be offered; and truly if we carry not this temper of mind in our suits, I see not how they can be reconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with that peaceableness so strictly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of all Christians. Let those consider this who make it their pleasure themselves to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet their Neighbour, or their trade to stir up others to do it. This tender regard of
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:60285:202"/>
Peace both in ourselves, and others, is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary to be entertained of all those, who own themselves to be the servants of him, whose title it is to be the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> Isai. 9. 6.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. All that remains to be toucht on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <note place="margin">This cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the actions must reach to enemies.</note> this <hi>Charity</hi> of the Actions, is the extent of it, which must be as large as the former of the affections, even to the taking in not only strangers, and those of no rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, but even of our bitterest enemies. I have already spoken so much of the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation we are under to forgive them, that I shall not hear say any thing of that, but that being supposed a duty, 'twill sure then appear no unreasonable thing to proceed one step further, by doing them good turns; for when we have once forgiven them, we can then no longer account them enemies, and so 'twill be no hard matter even to flesh and blood to do all kinde things to them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is the way, by which we must trye the sincerity of our forgiveness: 'Tis easy to say, I forgive such a man, but if when an opportunity of doing him good is offered, thou declinest it, 'tis apparent there yet lurks the old malice in thy heart; Where there is a thorough forgiveness, there will be as great a readiness to benefit an enemy as a friend: nay perhaps in some respects a greater, a true charitable person looking upon it as an especial prize, when he has an opportunity of evidencing the truth of his reconciliation,
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:60285:203"/>
and obeying the precept of his Saviour, by <hi>doing good to them that hate him,</hi> Matth. 5. 44. Let us therefore resolve that all actions of kindness are to be performed to our enemies, for which we have not only the command, but also the example of Christ, who had not only some inward relentings towards us his obstinate, and most provoking enemies, but shewed it in acts, and those no cheap, or easy ones, but such as cost him his dearest bloud. And surely we can never pretend to be either obeyers of his command, or followers of his example, if we grudge to testifie our loves to our enemies by those so much cheaper wayes of feeding them in hunger, and the like, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to us by the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 20. But if we could perform these acts of kindness to enemies in such manner as might draw them from their enmitie, and win them to Peace, the Charity would be doubled: And this we should aim at, for that we see the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle sets as the end of the forementioned acts of feeding, &amp;c. that we may <hi>heap coals of fire on their heads,</hi> not coals to burn, but to melt them into all love and tenderness to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us; and this were indeed the most compleat way of <hi>imitating Christs example,</hi> who in all he did and suffered for us, designed the reconciling of us to himself.</p>

hearts that self love which so often possesses them, and that so wholly, that it leaves no room for Charity, nay, nor justice neither to our Neighbour. By this <hi>self-love</hi> I mean not that <hi>true love</hi> of our selves, which is the love and care of our Souls (for that would certainly help, not hinder us in this duty) but I mean that immoderate love of our own worldly interests, and advantages, which is apparently the root of all, both injustice and uncharitableness towards others. We finde this sin of <hi>self-love</hi> set by the Apostle in the head of a whole troop of sins, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 2. as if it were some principal officer in Satans camp, and certainly, not without reason, for it never goes without an accursed train of many other sins, which like the <hi>Dragons tail Rev.</hi> 12. 4. sweeps away all care of duty to others. We are by it made so vehement, and intent upon the pleasing our selves, that we have no regard to any body else, contrary to the direction of S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 15. 2. Which is <hi>not to please our selves, but every man to please his Neighbour for his good to edification;</hi> which he backs with the example of Christ, vers 3. <hi>For even Christ pleased not himself:</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have any sincere desire to have this vertue of charity rooted in our hearts, we must be careful to weed out this sin of self-love, for 'tis impossible they can prosper together.</p>

But then first that is to be charged only to our selves, for having got those ill customs, and thereby made that hard to us, which in it self is most pleasant, the duties are not to be accused for it.

There is such a force and vertue in the testimony of a good Conscience, as is able to change the greatest suffering into the greatest triumph, and that testimony we can never have more clear, and lively, then when we suffer for righteousnes sake; so that you see <hi>Christianity</hi> is very amiable even in its sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest

But then if we look forward to the crown of our victories, those eternal rewards in heaven, we can never think those tasks sad, though we had nothing at present to sweeten them, that have such recompences await them at the end, were our labours never so heavy, we could have no cause to faint under them: Let us therefore when ever we meet with any discouragements in our course, fix our eye on this rich prize, and then <hi>run with patience the race which is set before us,</hi> Heb. 12. 2. Follow the <hi>Captain of our salvation</hi> through the greatest suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yea even through the same red sea of blood which he hath waded, whenever our o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to him shall require it; for though our fidelity to him should bring us to death it self, we are sure to be no losers by it, for to such he hath promised a <hi>Crown of life,</hi> the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation whereof is able to keep a Christian more cheerful in his fetters and dungeon, then a worldling can be in the midst of his greatest prosperities.</p>

and the further he hath formerly gone out of his way, the more haste it concerns him to make to get into it, and to use the more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in walking in it. He that hath a long journey to go, and finds he hath lost a great part of his day in a wrong way, will not need much intreaty, either to turn into the right, or to quicken his pace in it. And this is the case of all those that have lived in any course of sin, they are in a wrong road, which will never bring them to the place they aim at; Nay, which will certainly bring them to the place they most fear and abhor; much of their day is spent, how much will be left to finish their journey in, none knowes, perhaps the next hour, the next minute the night of death may overtake them; what a madness is it then for them to defer one moment to turn out of that path which leads to certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, and to put themselves in that, which will bring them to bliss and glory? Yet so are men bewitched, and enchanted with the deceitfulness of sin, that no entreaty, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion can prevail with them, to make this so reasonable so necessary a change, not but that they acknowledge it needful to be done, but they are unwilling to do it yet, they would enjoy all the pleasures of sin as long as they live, &amp; then they hope at their death, or some little time before it, to do all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of their Souls; But, alass! Heaven is too high to be thus jumpt into, the way to it is a long and leasurely ascent, which requires

time to walk. The hazards of such deferring are more largely spoken of, in the Discourse of Repentance, I shall not here repeat them, but desire the Reader seriously to lay them to heart, and then surely he will think it sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable counsel that is given by the wise man, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Make no tarrying to turn to the Lord, and put not off from day to day.</hi>

                        <hi>AT</hi> NIGHT, <hi>when it draws towards the time of rest, bethink thy self, how thou hast passed the day, examine thine own heart, what sin either of Thought, Word, or Deed thou hast committed, what opportunity of doing good thou hast omitted, and what soever thou sindest to accuse thy self of, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess humbly and penitently to God, renew thy purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and resolutions of amendment, and beg his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in Christ, and this not slightly, and only as of course, but with all devout earnestness, and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as thou wouldest do, if thou were sure thy death were as near approaching, as thy sleep, which for ought thou knowest may be so indeed, and therefore thou shouldest no more venture to sleep unreconciled to God, then thou wouldest dare to die so. In the next place, consider what special and extraordinary mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies thou hast that day received, as if thou hast had any great deliverance, either in thy inward man, from some dangerous temptations, or in thy outward, from any great and apparent danger, and offer to God thy hearty and devout praise for the same; or
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:60285:211"/>
if nothing extraordinary have so happened, and thou hast been kept even from the approach of danger, thou hast not the less, but the greater cause to magnifie God, who hath by his protection so guarded thee, that not so much as the fear of evil hath assaulted thee. And therefore omit not to pay him the tribute of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thankfulness, as well for his usual and dayly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, as his more extraordinary deliverances. And above all, endeavour still by the considerations of his mercies to have thy heart the more closely knit to him, remembring that every favour received from him is a new engagement upon thee, to love and obey him.</hi>

I am defiled in my very nature, having a backwardness to all good, and a readiness to all evil; but I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed my self yet much worse by my own actual sins and wicked customes; I have transgrest my

duty to thee, my neighbour, and my self, and that both in thought, in word, in deed, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those things which thou hast expresly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and by neglecting to do those things thou hast commanded me. And this not only through ignorance and frailty, but knowingly, and wilfully, against the motions of thy Spirit, and the checks of my own conscience to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And to make all these out of measure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, I have gone on in a dayly course of repeating these provocations against thee, notwithstanding all thy calls to, and my own purposes and vows of amendment; yea, this very day I have not ceased to adde new sins to all my former guilts. <hi>[Here name the Particulars.]</hi> And now, O Lord, what shall I say, or how shall I open my mouth, seeing I have done these things? I know that the wages of these sins is death; but O thou who wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest not the death of a sinner, have mercy upon me; work in me, I beseech thee, a sincere con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and a perfect hatred of my sins, and let me not dayly confess, and yet as dayly renew them, but grant; O Lord, that from this instant I may give a bill of Divorce to all my most beloved lusts, and then be thou pleased to marry me to thy self in truth, in righteousness and holiness. And for all my past sins, O Lord, receive a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation; accept of that ransome thy blessed Son hath paid for me, and for his sake whom thou hast set forth as a propitiation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> pardon all my of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, and receive me to thy favour.

                        <hi>IN the</hi> ANTIENT CHURCH <hi>there were besides morning and night four other times every day which were called</hi> HOURS OF PRAYER, <hi>and the zeal of those first Christians was such as made them constantly observed.

But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the Character of a Christian,</hi> Phil. 3. 20.

And for this sort of devotion no man can want leisure, for it may be performed in the midst of business; the Artisicer at his work, the Husbandman at his Plough may practice it.

                     <p>OMost merciful God, who hast in thy great goodness prepared this spiritual feast for sick and famished Souls, make my desires and gaspings after it, answerable to my needs of it. I have with the prodigal wasted that portion of grace thou bestowedst upon me, and therefore do infinitely want a supply out of this treasury: But, O Lord, how shall such a wretch as I dare to approach this holy Table? I am a dog, how shall I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to take the childrens bread? Or how shall this spiritual Manna, this food of Angels be given to one who hath chosen to feed on husks with swine, nay to one who hath already so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten trampled these precious things under foot, either carelesly neglecting, or unworthily recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving these holy mysteries? O Lord, my horrible guiltiness makes me tremble to come, and yet makes me not dare to keep away, for where, O Lord, shall my polluted soul be washed if not in this fountain which thou hast opened for sin and for uncleanness? Hither therefore I come, and thou hast promised that him that cometh to thee thou wilt in no wise cast out: This is, O Lord, the blood of the New Testament, grant
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:60285:231"/>
me so to receive it, that it may be to me for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of Sins. And though I have so often and so wretchedly broken my part of that Covenant, whereof this Sacrament is a seal, yet be thou gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously pleased to make good thine, to be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to my unrighteousness, and to remember my sins and my iniquities no more; and not only so, but to put thy laws into my heart, and to write them in my mind, and by the power of thy grace dispose my soul to such a sincere and constant o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that I may never again provoke thee; Lord, grant that in these holy mysteries I may not only commemorate, but effectually receive my blessed Saviour, and all the benefits of his Passion: and to that end give me such a preparation of soul as may qualifie me for it, give me a deep sense of my sins and unworthiness, that being weary and heavy laden, I may be capable of his refreshings, and by being suppled in my own tears, I may be the fitter to be washed in his blood, raise up my dull and earthly mind from groveling here below, and inspire it with a holy zeal, that I may with spiritual affection approach this spiritual feast; and let, O Lord, that infinite love of Christ in dying for so wretched a sinner inflame my fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen benummed soul, and kindle in me that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred fire of love to him, and that so vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that no waters may quench, no floods drown it, such as may burn up all my drosse, not leave one unmortified lust in my soul, and such as may also extend it selfe to all whom thou hast given me command and example to love, even enemies as well as friends. Finally,

O Lord, I beseech thee to cloath me in the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment, and make me though of my self a most unworthy, yet by thy mercy an acceptable guest at this holy Table, that I may not eat and drink my own condemnation, but may have my pardon sealed, my weakness repaired, my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions subdued, and my soul so inseparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thee that no temptations may ever be able to dissolve the union, but that being begun here in grace it may be consummated in glory.

O Lord, I have abundant need of thee, but am so clog'd with guilt, so holden with the cords of my sins, that I am not able to move towards thee, O loose me from this band, wherewith Satan and my own lusts have bound me, and draw me that I may run after thee. Lord, thou seest dayly how eagerly I pursue the paths that lead to death, but when thou invitest me to life and glory, I turn my back and forsake my own mercy. How often hath this feast been prepared, and I have with fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous excuses absented my self, or if I have come, it hath been rather to defie then to adore thee. I

have brought such troops of thy professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, unrepented sins along with me, as if I came not to commemorate, but renew thy passion, crucifying thee afresh, and putting thee to open shame: and now of what punishment shall I be thought worthy, who have thus trampled under foot the Son of God, and counted the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing! Yet O merciful Jesu, this blood is my only refuge, O let this make my atonement or I perish eternally? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore didst thou shed it, but to save sinners? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can the merit of it be overwhelmed either by the greatness or number of sins. I am a sinner, a great one, O let me find its saving efficacy. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful to me for my soul trusteth in thee, and in the clefts of thy wounds shall be my refuge untill thy fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation be overpast. O thou, who hast as my high Priest, sacrificed for me, intercede for me also, and plead thy meritorious sufferings on my behalf, and suffer not, O my Redeemer, the price of thy blood to be utterly lost: And grant, O Lord, that as the sins I have to be forgiven are many, so I may love much.

Be not wroth very sore, O Lord, neither remember iniquity for ever, but though our backslidings are many, and we have grievously rebelled, yet according to all thy goodness let thy anger and thy fury be turned away, and cause thy face to shine upon thy Sanctuary which is desolate, for the Lords sake; and so separate between us and our sins, that they may no longer separate between us and our God. Save and defend all Christian Kings, Princes and Governours, especially those to whom we owe subjection, plead thou their cause.

Heal my soul, O Lord, which hath sinned against thee, and then if it be thy blessed will, heal my body also, restore the voice of joy &amp; health unto my dwelling, that I may live to praise thee, and to bring forth fruits of repentance. But if in thy wisdom thou hast otherwise disposed, if thou have determined that this sickness shall be unto death, I beseech thee to fit &amp; prepare me for it, give me that sincere and earnest repentance, to which thou hast promised mercy and pardon; wean my heart from the world, and all its fading vanities, and make me to gasp and pant after those more excellent and durable joys which are at thy right hand for ever. Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon me, and in all the pains of my body, in all the agonies of my spirit, let thy comforts refresh my soul, and enable me patiently to wait till my change come. And grant, O Lord, that when my earthly house of this Tabernacle is dissolved I may have a building of God, an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens. And that for his sake who by his precious blood hath purchased it for me, even Jesus Christ.</p>

                        <head>A THANKSGIVING <hi>for</hi> RECOVERY.</head>
                        <p>O GRACIOUS Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, in whose hand my time is, I praise and magnifie thee that thou hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored me to health again; it is thou alone, O Lord, that hast preserved my life from destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thou hast chastned and corrected me, but thou hast not given me over unto death; O let this life which thou hast thus graciously spared be wholy consecrated to thee. Behold, O Lord, I am by thy mercy made whole, O make me strictly careful to sin no more least a worse thing come unto me. Lord, let not this reprieve thou hast now given me, make me secure, as thinking that my Lord delayeth his coming, but grant me I beseech thee to make a right use of this long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of thine, and so to imploy every minute of that time thou shalt allow me, that when thou shalt appear I may have confidence and not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed before thee at thy coming. Lord, I have found by this approach towards death, how dreadful a thing it is to be taken unprepared. O let it be a perpetual admonition to me to watch for my Masters Coming. And when the pleasures of sin shall present themselves to entice me, O make me to remember how bitter they will be at the last. O Lord hear me, and as thou hast in much mercy afforded me time, so grant me also grace to work out my own salvation, to provide oil in my lamp, that when the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60285:240"/>
cometh I may go in with him to the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Grant this I beseech thee for thy dear Sons sake.</p>

                        <head>A Prayer at the approach of Death.</head>
                        <p>O ETERNAL and everliving God, who first breathedst into man the breath of life, and when thou takest away that breath he dies and is turned again to his dust, look with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion on me thy poor creature who am now drawing near the gates of death, and which is infinitely more terrible, the bar of Judgement. Lord my own heart condemns me, and thou art infinitely greater then my heart, and knowest all things. The sins I know and remember, fill me with horrour; but there are also multitudes of others, which I either observed not at the time, or have since carelesly forgot, which are all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to thee. Thou settest my misdeeds before thee, and my secret sins in the light of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and to what a mountainous heap must the minutely provocations of so many years arise? How shall one so ungodly stand in thy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or such a sinner in the Congregation of the Righteous? And to adde yet more to my ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, my very repentance I fear will not abide the trial; my frequent relapses heretofore have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently witnessed the unsincerity of my past reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions. And then, O Lord, what can secure me that my present dislikes of my sins are not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the effects of my amazing danger then of any real change? And, O Lord, I know thou art
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60285:241"/>
not mocked, nor wilt accept of any thing that is not perfectly sincere. O Lord, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider this, fearfulness and trembling comes upon me, and an horrible dread overwhelmeth me, my flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and my heart is wounded within me. But, O Lord, one deep calleth upon another, the depth of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery upon the depth of thy mercy; Lord, save now or I perish eternally. O thou who willest not that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance, bring me, I beseech thee, though thus late, to a sincere Repentance, such as thou wilt accept, who triest the heart. Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in me, O God, a clean heart, and renew a right spirit within me: Lord, one day is with thee as a thousand years, O let thy mighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit work in me now in this my last day, whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou seest wanting to fit me for thy mercy and acceptation. Give me a perfect and entire hatred of my sins, and enable me to present thee with that sacrifice of a broken and contrite heart, which thou hast promised not to despise; that by this I may be made capable of that attonement which thy dear Son hath by the more excellent oblation of himself made for all repenting sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. He is the propitiation for our sins, he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities, the chastisement of our peace was on him, O heal me by his stripes, and let the cry of his blood drown the clamour of my sins. I am indeed a childe of wrath, but he is the Son of thy loue, for his sake spare me, O Lord, spare thy creature whom he hath redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60285:241"/>
with his most precious blood, and be not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with me for ever. In his wounds O Lord, I take Sanctuary, O let not thy vengeance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue me to this city of refuge: my Soul hangeth upon him, O let me not perish with a Jesus, with a Saviour in my arms. But by his Agony and bloody Sweat, by his Cross and Passion, by all that he did and suffered for sinners, good Lord deliver me; deliver me, I beseech thee, from the wages of my sins, thy wrath and everlasting damnation, in this time of my tribulation, in the hour of death, and in the day of Judgement. Hear me, O Lord, hear me, and do not now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay my former neglects of thy calls, by refusing to answer me in this time of my greatest need. Lord, there is but a step between me and death, O let not my sun go down upon thy wrath, but seal my pard on before I go hence and be no more seen. Thy loving kindness is better then the life it self, O let me have that in exchange, and I shall most gladly lay down this mortal life. Lord thou knowest all my desire, and my groaning is not hid from thee; deal thou with me, O Lord, according to thy Name, for sweet is thy mercy; take away the sting of death, the guilt of my sins, and then though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil, I will lay me down in peace, and Lord when I awake up, let me be satisfied with thy presence in thy glory. Grant this merciful God for his sake who is both the Redeemer and Mediator of sinners, even Jesus Christ.</p>

                        <p>O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth, I desire humbly to confess before thee, both on my own behalf, and that of this Nation, that these many years of calamity we have groaned under, are but the just, (yea mild) returns of those many more years of our provocations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst thee, and that thy present which is but the due punishment of thy abused mercy. O Lord, thou hast formerly abounded to us in blessings above all people of the earth. Thy candle shined
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60285:246"/>
upon our heads, and we delighted our selves in thy great goodness, peace was within our walls, and plenteousness within our palaces, there was no decay, no leading into captivity and no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining in our streets: but we turned this grace into wantonness, we abused our peace to security, our plenty to riot and Luxury, and made those good things which should have endeared our hearts to thee, the occasions of estranging them from thee; Nay, O Lord, thou gavest us yet more precious mercies, thou wert pleased thy self to pitch thy Tabernacle with us, to establish a pure and glorious Church among us, and give us thy word to be a lamp unto our feet, and a light unto our paths; but O Lord, we have made no other use of that light, then to conduct us to the chambers of death, we have dealt proudly, and not hearkened to thy comandments, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belling against the light, have purchased to our selves so much the heavier portion in the outer darkness. And now, O Lord, had the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of thy vengeance been answerable to that of our sin, we had long since been swept away with a swift destruction, and there had been none of us alive at this day to implore thy mercy. But thou art a gracious God, slow to anger, and hast proceeded with us with much patience and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, thou hast sent thy judgements to awake us to repentance, and hast also allowed us space for it: But alas we have perverted this mercy of thine beyond all the former, we return not to him that smiteth us, neither do we seek the Lord, we are slidden back by a perpetual backfliding, no

'Tis true indeed we fear the rod (we dread every suffering, so that we are ready to buy it off with the foulest sin) but we fear not him that hath appointed it, but by a wretched obstinacy harden our necks against thee, and refuse to return. And now, O God, what balm is there in <hi>Gilead</hi> that can cure us; who when thou wouldest heal us, will not be healed, we know thou hast pronounced that there is no peace to the wicked, and how shall we then pray for peace, that still retain our wickedness? This this, O Lord, is our sorest disease, O Give us Medicines to heal this sickness, heal our souls, and then we know thou canst soon heal our land. Lord, thou hast long spoken by thy word to our ears, by thy judgments even to all our senses, but unless thou speak by thy Spirit to our hearts, all other calls will still be uneffectual. O send out this voice, and that a mighty voice, such as may awake us out of this Lethargy: thou that didst call <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave, O be pleased to call us who are dead, yea, putrified in tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and sins, and make us to awake to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. And though, O Lord, our frequent resistances even of those inward calls, have justly provoked thee to give us up to the lusts of our own heart; yet, O thou boundless ocean of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, who art good not only beyond what we can deserve, but what we can wish, do not withdraw the influence of thy grace, and take not thy holy spirit from us. Thou wert found of those that sought thee not, O let that act of mercy be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated

to us who are so desperately, yet so insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly sick, that we cannot so much as look after the Physitian, and by how much our case is the more dangerous, so much the more sovereign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies do thou apply; Lord help us, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not so much our unworthiness of thy aid, as our irremediable ruine if we want it; save Lord, or we perish eternally. To this end dispense to us in our temporal interest what thou seest may best secure our spiritual; if a greater degree of outward misery will tend to the curing our inward, Lord, spare not thy rod, but strike yet more sharply; cast out this devil, though with never so much foaming &amp; tearing. But if thou seest that some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of mercy may be most likely to melt us, O be pleased so far to condescend to our wretchedness as to afford us that, and whether by thy sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or thy gentler methods, bring us home to thy self. And then, O Lord, we know thy hand is not shortned, that it cannot save, when thou hast delivered us from our sins, thou canst and wilt deliver us from our troubles, O shew us thy mercy and grant us thy salvation, that being redeemed both in our bodies and spirits, we may glorifie thee in both, in a chearful obedience, and praise the Name of our God, that hath dealt wonderfully with us, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>

O Lord, what could have been done to thy vineyard that thou hast not done in it, and since it hath brought forth nothing but wilde grapes, it is perfectly just with thee to take away the hedge thereof, and let it be eaten up. But O Lord, though our iniquities testifie against us, yet do thou it for thy Names sake, for our back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slidings are many, we have sinned against thee. O the hope of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldst thou be as a stranger in the land, as a wayfaring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? Why shouldst thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save? Yet thou, O Lord, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy Name, leave us not; deprive us of what outward enjoyment thou pleasest, take from us the opportunities of our luxury and it may be a mercy, but O take not from us the means of our reformation, for that is the most direful expression of thy wrath. And though we have hated the light because our deeds were evil, yet, O Lord, do not by withdrawing it condemn us to walk on still in darkness, but let it continue to shine till it have guided our feet into the way of peace. O Lord, arise, stir up thy strength &amp; come &amp; help us, and deliver not the soul of thy Turtle Dove <hi>(this disconsolate Church)</hi> unto the multitude of the enemy, but help her, O God, and that right early. But if, O Lord, our rebellions

                        <p>LORD Jesus Christ, which of thine Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness madest all creatures both visible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, which of thy godly wisdome governest and settest all things in most goodly order, which of thine unspeakable goodness keepest, defendest and furtherest all thing, which of thy deep mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy restorest the decayed, renewest the fallen, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest the dead; vouchsafe, we pray thee at last, to cast down thy countenance upon thy well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Spouse <hi>the Church,</hi> but let it be that ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and merciful countenance wherewith thou pacifiest all things in heaven, in earth, and whatsoever is above heaven and under the earth:
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60285:248"/>
vouchsafe to cast upon us those tender and pitiful eyes with which thou didst once behold <hi>Peter</hi> that great Shepherd of thy Church, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he remembred himself and repented; with which eyes thou once didst view the scattered multitude and wert moved with compassion, that for lack of a good Shepherd they wandered as sheep dispersed and strayed a sunder. Thou seest (O good <hi>Shepherd)</hi> what sundry sorts of Wolves have broken into thy sheep cotes: so that if it were possible the very perfect persons should be brought into error: thou seest with what winds, with what waves, with what storms thy silly ship is tosl d, thy ship wherein thy lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle flock is in peril to be drowned. And what is now left but that it utterly sink and we all perish? Of this tempest and storm we may thank our own wickedness and sinful living, we discern it well and confess it, we discern thy righteousness, and we bewail our unrighteousness: but we appeal to thy <hi>Mercy,</hi> which <hi>surmounteth all thy works;</hi> we have now suffered much punishment, being scourged with so many wars, consumed with such losses of goods, shaken with so many floods, and yet appears there no where any Haven or Port unto us, being thus tired and forlorn among so strange evils, but still every day more grievous punishments, and more seem to hang over our heads. We complain not of thy sharpness, most tender Saviour, but we discern here also thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, forasmuch as much grievouser plagues we have deserved. But O most merciful <hi>Jesus,</hi> we beseech thee that thou wilt not consider nor
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:60285:249"/>
weigh what is due for our deservings, but rather what becometh thy mercy, without which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Angels in heaven can stand sure before thee, much less we silly vessels of clay. Have mercy on us, O Redeemer, which art easie to be intreated, not that we be worthy of thy mercy, but give thou this glory unto <hi>thine own Name.</hi> Suffer not those which either have not known thee or do envy thy glory, continually to triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us, and say, Where is their God, where is their Redeemer, where is their <hi>Saviour,</hi> where is their Bridegroom that they thus boast on? These opprobrious words redound unto thee. O Lord, while by our evils men weigh and esteem thy goodness, they think we be forsaken whom they see not amended. Once when thou sleptst in the ship, and a tempest suddenly arising threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned death to all in the Ship, thou awokest at the outcry of a <hi>few Disciples</hi> and straightway at thine Almighty word the waters couched, the winds fell, the storm was suddenly turned into a great calm; the dumb waters knew their makers voice. Now in this far greater tempest, wherein not a few mens bodies be in danger, but innumerable souls: we beseech thee at the cry of thy holy <hi>Church,</hi> which is in danger of drowning, that thou wilt awake. So many thousands of men do cry, <hi>Lord save us, we perish,</hi> the tempest is past mans power; it is thy word that must do the deed, Lord Jesu, Only say thou with a word of thy mouth, <hi>Cease, O tempest, and forthwith shall the desired calm appear.</hi> Thou wouldst have spared so many thousands of most wicked men,

Shalt thou not with thy heavenly policy turn our folly into thy glory? Shalt thou not turn the wicked mens evils into thy Churches good? For thy mercy is wont then most of all to succour, when the thing is with us past remedy, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the might nor wisdome of men can help it. Thou alone bringest things that be never so out of order into order again, which art the only Author and maintainer of peace. Thou framedst that old confusion wherein without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, without fashion confusedly lay the discor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant seeds of things, and with a wonderful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the things that of nature fought together thou didst ally and knit in a perpetual band. But how much greater confusion is this, where is no charity, no fidelity no bonds of love, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence neither of Laws nor yet of Rulers, no agreement of opinions, but as it were in a misor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered quire, every man singeth a contrary note. Among the heavenly <hi>Planets</hi> is no dissention, the Elements keep their place, every one do the office whereunto they be appointed: And wilt thou suffer thy <hi>Spouse,</hi> for whose sake all things were made, thus by continual discords to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish? Shalt thou suffer the <hi>wicked Spirits,</hi> which be authors and workers of discord, to bear such a swing in thy Kingedome

unchecked? Shalt thou suffer the strong Captain of mischief, whom thou once overthrewest, again to inuade thy tents, and to spoil thy Souldiers? When thou wert here a man conversant among men, at thy voice fled the Divels. Send forth, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy Spirit, which may drive away out of the brests of all them that profess thy Name, the wicked Spirits, masters of riot, of covetousness, of vain-glory, of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal lust, of mischief and discord. <hi>Create in us, O our God and King, a clean heart, and renew thy holy Spirit in our brests, pluck not from us thy holy Ghost. Render unto us the joy of thy saving health, and with thy principal Spirit, strengthen thy Spouse and the Heardmen thereof.</hi> By this <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> thou reconciledst the earthly to the heavenly: by this thou didst frame and reduce so many tongues, so many nations, so many sundry sorts of men into one body of a <hi>Church,</hi> which body by the same Spirit is knit to thee their Head. This Spirit if thou wilt vouchsafe to renew in all mens hearts, then shall all these forreign miseries cease or if they cease not, they shall turn to the profit and avail of them which love thee. Stay this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion, set in order this horrible Chaos (O Lord Jesus) let thy Spirit stretch out it self upon these waters of evil wavering opinions. And because thy Spirit, which according to thy Prophets say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>containeth all things,</hi> hath also the science of speaking; make that like as unto all them which be of thy house, is one Light, one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, one God, one Hope, one Spirit; so they may also have one voice, one note, one song,

professing one Catholick truth. When thou didst mount up to heaven triumphantly, thou threwest out from above thy precious things, thou gavest gifts amongst men, thou dealtest sundry rewards of thy Spirit. Renew again from above thy old bountifulness, give that thing to thy <hi>Church,</hi> now fainting and growing downward, that thou gavest unto her shooting up, at her first begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Give unto <hi>Princes</hi> and Rulers the grace so to stand in awe of thee, that they so may guide the Common-weal, as they should shortly render accompt unto thee that art the King of Kings. Give wisdom to be always assistant unto them, that whatsoever is best to be done, they may espy it in their minds, and pursue the same in their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Give to the <hi>Bishops</hi> the gift of prophecy, that they may declare and interpret holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not of their own brain, but of thine inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Give them the threefold charity which thou once demandest of <hi>Peter,</hi> what time thou didst betake unto him the charge of thy sheep. Give to the <hi>Priests</hi> the love of soberness, and of chastity. Give to thy people a good will to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thy Commandments, and a readiness to obey such persons as thou hast appointed over them. So shall it come to pass; if through thy gift thy <hi>Princes</hi> shall command that thou requirest, if thy Pastors and Herdmen shall teach the same, and thy people obey them both, that the old dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and tranquility of the <hi>Church</hi> shall return a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with a goodly order unto the glory of thy Name.
