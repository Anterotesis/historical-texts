         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. The State of Man in the Creation.</head>
            <p>THe Lord God of Life and Power, who is from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting to Everlasting, according to the good pleasure of his own Will, and after the Counsel of his own Heart, he brought forth a <hi>Pure Creation</hi> in his Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and by his Eternal living Word he divided and separated the <hi>Mater,</hi> which in the <hi>Chaos</hi> was in a heap of Confusion, and what he commanded by his Word, it came to passe, and as he said it should be, so it was done; and in his Wisdom a <hi>Pure Creation</hi> was finished, as he commanded; and when he had stretched forth the Heavens, and placed the Lights in them; and when he had laid the Foundation of the Earth, and brought forth the Herbs and Trees therein; and when he divided the Waters, and the Fish multiplied in them; when the Fowls of the Heavens had their flight in the Air, and four-footed Beasts, and creeping things, had their way upon the Earth; then did the Eternal Word in the Wisdom, make Man in his own Image, and breathed into him the Breath of Life, and he became a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Soul, and the Lord God filled him with Wisdom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, and gave him Dominion over all the Works of his Hands; and Man in the Wisdom of God ruled over them all, he stood in the Wisdom, and received Counsel, and had his Way in the Holy Life; he walked in the Paradise of Pleasure, and fed upon the Tree of Life; he lived in still communion with his God, and his living Soul stood in his living Virtue; and the Breath of Life was alwayes reaching to it; he was in the <hi>pure Oneness</hi> with God that made him, and the Image of the Holy Life was upon him, and he was in the Power, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Strength of God, and bare the Image in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and true Holiness, without any mixture; and all things stood clear in the Separation as they were created, and there was no mixture to defile: Then did the Wisdom behold his Work, and lo, it was very good in his sight, and he had great

            <p>MAn being drawn into Disobedience through the subtil working of the Prince of Darkness, he became a Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressor of the <hi>Pure Power</hi> and <hi>Wisdom</hi> of the Creator, and so went out of the <hi>Good,</hi> in which he was created, and went into the <hi>Evil,</hi> by obeying the Tempter, and then did eat of the Mixture into which he fell, and the Imaginations of his heart became evil continually; and the <hi>Evil</hi> wrought more and more to get dominion over the <hi>Good;</hi> and Man being into the Mixture fallen, the <hi>Evil</hi> prevailed, and Sin entred, and Death by Sin; so as all have sinned, and are deprived of the Glory,

and alienated from the <hi>Holy Life;</hi> yet did the Seed retain its own pure holy quality and property, without any mixture, and it was not extinguished in the Fall, but kept its purity, though Man went from it, and did not abide in it, and the <hi>pure Light</hi> in its own quality did shine in Mans Conscience, and was made manifest in the Eternal Love, to convince Man of all his evil wayes and works which he was fallen into, and it did shine in Darkness, and discovered the deeds of Darkness, and convinced Man of the <hi>Evil</hi> of them; so was <hi>Adam</hi> convinced that he had transgressed, and he did himself: <hi>Cain</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he had murdered, and he cryed because of his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: <hi>Saul</hi> was convinced of his Cruelty, and he said to <hi>David, Thou art more righteous than I:</hi> and the Light of this Holy Seed of Life shines forth in the Love, and is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in the Conscience of <hi>fallen Man,</hi> and is freely given of God unto him to seek him in his <hi>fallen Estate,</hi> and it hath its course through the properties of the visible Creation, and sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth out Mans Life and Treasure; and whatsoever the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty hath drawn Mans Mind into, and begotten a Life in it, the Light searcheth to him, and convinceth and reproveth him in his own Conscience, so that Man cannot hide his secrets, but still he is found out with the searching Light; for it shines in Darkness, though Darknesse comprehend it not, and with its pure brightness it doth discover the deeds of Darkness, and also the Prince of Darkness, and makes manifest his secret workings, and lets Man see that he is a Stranger unto God, and an Alien from his <hi>pure Life,</hi> and is serving that spirit that is at enmity with God; and it lets him see the evil works that he commits, and in which he is an Enemy unto God: So hath the Love of God been made manifest in the Light of the Seed of Life, which through all Generations hath been the same, and with its <hi>pure quality</hi> it hath found out the Enmity of Mans deceitful heart, with all deceitful workings, and hath brought hidden things to light, whereby Man hath come to see how his mind hath been exercised, and after what it hath enclined, and after what his heart hath lusted; and as at any time the Lust hath pressed unto <hi>Evil,</hi> and to follow <hi>the things that are Evil,</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> hath been near to <hi>convince</hi> Man of

            <head>CHAP. VI. How Man standeth in a Convinced state, and also the Serpents Working.</head>
            <p>VVHen Man in the Fall is overcome of Evil, and that his deceitful heart brings forth a birth of the Serpents begetting; the <hi>pure Light,</hi> which hath its course through the <hi>fallen properties,</hi> comes to him with a Convincement, and lets him see that he is an Evil-doer, and that he is not exercised in the thing that is good; and when the Light hath thus found him out, and convinced him, it doth also truly and plainly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover unto him, that his way is not right, neither is his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings approved of God; and if he go on without Repentance, he must perish: and in the Light Man sees his Conscience defiled, that there is uncleanness upon him, and that his heart is not upright, but deceitful; and Man will acknowledge this in words, and say he hath a deceitful heart, and many evil things proceed out of it, and he is sensible of them; and as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:53638:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they are conceived and generated in his heart; they are made manifest unto him, and he in his Conscience is convinced that they are exceeding sinful: Many Man in his Wickedness will thus confess, though he be wholly in the <hi>fallen properties</hi> where the Devil ruleth over him, and acteth and ordereth his mind at his will, yet the Light reacheth to him, and so far convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth him, as to confess he is an Evil-doer, and a sinful man; and this Confession will the Drunkard make, and the Lyar and Swearer: And whatever Man is acted in by the Serpents Subtilty, the Light doth convince him of it, and brings him at some time to confess his Wickedness; so that every Man is left without excuse before the <hi>Pure God,</hi> in that he sees his Evil with the true Light of Christ, the Seed of God, which passeth through all the Properties of the visible Creation, and doth make the way of Darkness manifest: And this Light hath been within Man ever since the Breath of Life was breathed into him; and though the Fall came upon Man in the Subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that he fell into the Mixture of the Properties of the visible Creation, yet the Light which was breathed in the Life, whereby Man became a <hi>Living Soul,</hi> it was not extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by the Fall, neither was its Property changed by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Mixture, but it did retain its <hi>pure holy Nature,</hi> though Man was enticed from it into the Mixture, where he entred into the Evil; and this <hi>pure Light of Life</hi> hath tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row all Generations been the same, and with its searching quality it hath found out all the Evil that Man hath or doth commit, and hath and doth convince him of it; and what it was in the beginning, it hath never been changed in its Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Quality, but hath continued <hi>pure, holy, righteous</hi> and <hi>meek,</hi> as it is at this day; and what is come into Man since the beginning, that is not of its nature, but is contrary to it, <hi>that</hi> it convinceth Man of, and testifieth against; and all the Devils works which he hath begotten in Man since the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, with the Light which was in the beginning they are made manifest; and the Light was before Sin entred, and with it is all Sin and Evil, which is the Devils work in Man, discovered and reproved; And as the Serpent hath got domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over Man, and begets his evil deeds in him; even so
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:53638:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
doth the Light discover them, and lets Man in his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science see them, and the Light is in his own Conscience made manifest to bruise the Serpents head, and to destroy his work: And this Testimony is sure, though the Subtilty cannot receive it; and all that ever came to be acquainted with the holy Seed of Life, they never testified of another thing, nor ever preached another Gospel; so that the same Gospel that was preached unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> hath been and is the same through all Generations; and this <hi>pure quality</hi> of the holy Seed doth not cease from searching after Man, who into the Mixture of the Properties is fallen, and there it doth strive with him, by convincing and reproving, that he might not there abide, but that he might arise and follow it, and come to inherit the Life in which he was created good; and this is the Love of God, <hi>which was, and is, and is to come; who would not have any to perish, but rather that they would turn and live;</hi> and though his Love be so freely made manifest, and hath an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal course through all the <hi>fallen properties,</hi> to find out Man who is there in the disorder, and walking in his disorderly and unruly affections, which the Devil hath begotten and exerciseth him in; yet doth not Man receive his Love in the tender of it, neither turns at the reproof of the Light which from the Love is made manifest; but he loveth his evil deeds more than he loveth the Light; so doth not come to the Life, but is held with the Serpents Subtilty in the Mixture of the <hi>fallen properties,</hi> and there his delight is in <hi>Evil</hi> more than <hi>Good,</hi> for which the Light condemns him, &amp; the Evil-doer can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not escape the Convincement of the Light for his Evil deeds, but what-ever it is that he lusteth after, and hath a life in, with the <hi>Light</hi> he is found out; and if it be never so secret, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hide it from the Light; and though the Serpent do beget and generate many Evil things, and provokes unto Evil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence, and exerciseth Mans mind therein, yet the Light doth not cease to bear Testimony against Man in the Evil, and to convince him of his Evil deeds: Hence it is that Man stands in the Acknowledgement of his Sin and Evil, but not turning to the Light when he is convinced by it, and doth see his Evil in it, he still abides in the Evil, which he sees to

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:53638:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
come he shall be saved: So the Serpents faith puts the day of Salvation afar off, and draws Mans mind into disobedience and unbelief to the <hi>pure Light of Christ in his own Conscience, which is Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, unto all that believe in it;</hi> and it doth search after Man, and convince him of his Evil, that he might turn and live; but Man not obeying, he comes not to know the Life and Vertue that is in it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to partake of the benefit of it, So knows not the Man Christ that dyed at <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> nor his Life and Salvation, his Mediation and Intercession, but abides in the Mixture of the <hi>fallen properties,</hi> where he is a Corruptible Earthly Man, without any Change wrought in him by the Power of Christ, whose <hi>pure Light</hi> is <hi>Incorruptible:</hi> and here Man stands convinced with the Light, and sees the things that are Evil; but not believing in the Light, which makes Evil manifest, he still abides in the Evil, and is not converted.</p>

and much weight taken off and removed, which had been upon him, and a sore burden unto him; and something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to spring in the Deliverance that cryed for it; and when the Light hath thus found Man, and Man is turned unto it, and that he cannot abide any longer, either in Prophaness, or seeming shew of Godliness; but presseth in the Light to come wholly out of the Mixtures of the <hi>fallen properties,</hi> to come into the <hi>holy Order</hi> of the <hi>pure Creation;</hi> then doth the Serpent strive in his Subtilty to hold Man in some part of the Mixture, that so he may in something yet keep dominion over him, and that he may not be set wholly free, but may serve him still in something, though he have truly denyed many things: And hence it is that many stick in the Birth, who are convinced what is Truth, and also in many things converted, and yet feel not true Freedom wrought, but are sensible of a Travel that cryes after a day of Deliverance; and here hath the Serpent deceived many, who have been convinced, and have had true openings and clear discoveries in the manifestation of the Light, and not being watchful, the Serpent hath stepped in, and with his deceitful working he hath beguiled Man, as he beguiled <hi>Eve,</hi> and with the same fruit hath tempted, and over many hath prevailed, and hath drawn many minds in the openings to reach forth in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerness to satisfie his lustful desire in the knowledge of Gods Truth; and this hath shut the Womb upon the Babe that tryes for deliverance, and so the Judgment hath been fled, and the Crosse hath been denyed, and a false liberty out of the fear hath got up, and it hath gendered unto sore bondage; and though the Truth be confessed unto, and professed in practice, yet doth the Seed lye in bondage under the puffed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up mind, that the Serpent hath filled with knowledge, in which he hath generated a Body, and brought forth a false Birth, whose neck is stiff, and the heart hard, and will not bow unto the Lord, nor be subject to his Power, but in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge stands exalted, under which the <hi>true Birth</hi> is oppressed, and the beauty of it marred by the <hi>false Generation</hi> of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents begetting, which rises out of the Mixture and receives its body from the Earthly part of the <hi>fallen properties;</hi> and

Man having seen the Truth in the <hi>Openings,</hi> and the vain mind being filled with the knowledge of it, he takes root in the Earthly, and in the Earthly he begins to grow and spread forth his branches with a fair and flourishing shew; and this Earthly body that is thus conceived and generated, and likewise nourished in the Mixture of the <hi>fallen proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> gets a tincture of Truth upon it in the <hi>Openings,</hi> as Lead may be covered or tinn'd with pure Gold; and this Body beareth a fair shew, and appears exceeding glorious, <hi>but is not the Glory of the only Begotten;</hi> and when this is brought forth through the deceitful working of the old Serpent, then he labours to nourish it that it may grow in strength, and be a tall man, and a strong man, and be renownable; and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desirable, it hath been eagerly pursued, and knowledge hath encreased, and a great growth there hath been in it; and Man hath waxed into a high stature of it, and hath sprung up in height like a Cedar in <hi>Labanan,</hi> and hath grown in the body of knowledge like an Oak in <hi>Bashan;</hi> and under this high and mighty growth of knowledge, hath the little brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Innocency been strangled, and sore burdened and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, and hath still been striving underneath in the <hi>meck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> and <hi>humbleness,</hi> and hath oft reached the tall Cedar to bring it down, and to the strong Oak, to make it bend; but the Cedar would not lose its glory, nor the Oak part with its strength, but stoutly have stood, yea, and stubbornly resisted the tender Innocency, and have cast off the Word of its Reproof; and the tall Cedar hath been lifted up, and hath said, who shall rule over me? and the Oak it hath been stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, and hath said, Who shall cause me to bow? And so they have trampled over Innocency, as a thing of no esteem; and the Gold hath been kept in the Mixture, and the clean Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hath not been made, but the Subtilty hath wrought over it, and hath kept the Dross and Tinn above it, and Man hath not liked the Furnace, neither hath been willing to abide the Day of his Coming in that Manifestation, but hath saved his Life in the Mixture, in which the Serpents Dominion standeth, who in his Subtility hath ever wrought secretly against the Seed of Life, which is made manifest to bruise

will know his Redeemer liveth, and Salvation he will feel in the Light, which doth condemn his sin in the flesh: and here Drunkard is redeemed out of Drunkenness, a Swearer from Swearing, a Lyar from Lying, a Covetous Man from Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousness, an Angry man from Anger; and so out of all Vain Pleasures, Sports, Jesting, Headiness, Wildness, Customs, Fashions and Traditions that are in the World through Lust; With the <hi>Light</hi> Man is redeemed through its Righteous Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for with its <hi>pure searching quality</hi> it finds out every se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thing of the old lustful nature, and proceeds against it in Judgment; so that the Serpent cannot escape the Light, but with all his Subtilty he is found out; and as Man believes in the Light, so doth the Judgment fall upon the Serpents head; and though it be long before Man can give up himself truly, to deny all things that he is convinced of to be evil, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he can get clearly thorow, or to the end of much that he is turning from; or before he can witness a perfect Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through <hi>the fire of cleansing;</hi> yet, as Man in the Light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves and follows it, the Work is going on and prospering, and the Lusts and evil deeds are dying, and the Serpent he is weakning, and doth not come upon Man so furiously and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly as formerly, but his Temptations are weaker, and Man in the Light he is stronger, and stands with courage to resist him; and as Man feels at any time dominion over the Serpent, and that he is able, as he abides in the Light, to resist him; so doth his strength and courage encrease, and he stands boldly in the battel, and yeelds not when temptations come, but brings them under, and treads them down; and as the Serpent comes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Man, and appears to tempt him into that Lust which Man is making war against; Man stands prepared unto battel, and is strong and of a good courage, and goes forth against him in his first appearance, and in the power of the Light placeth true Judgment upon his head, and bruiseth him, and so Man is preserved from him, and abstains from Evil in the appearance of it; and this is the Serpents great design to keep Man alive to himself, and to delight in his hearts lusts, whereby he ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth over him, and takes him captive at his will, and he is not willing to let him go if all his subtilty can hold him; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:53638:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many Temptations come upon Man after he is convinced and comes to own the Truth of God; and as he converts and turns unto the Lord, he is many times sorely beset in his way, and often ready to be driven quite back again: and hence it is that Man finds such a strong Warfare in his Spiritual Travel, and finds it such a hard work to come into the <hi>Regenerated State,</hi> because there he must deny himself, and forsake all his hearts Lusts, and lay down his Life in the Judgment, and abide the Fire of Refinement; and as Man in the Light begins to approach near unto this great Work, then the Serpent strives in his subtilty to withhold him and keep him back, and so the two in their contrary natures are felt in the strife; and this <hi>Gate is strait, and few there be that find it;</hi> And as Man stands faithful and abides in the Light, he will feel strength to support him when the Enemy thus violently pursues him, and he will stand a Conqueror over those Lusts that have had dominion over him; and when the Serpent finds that he cannor keep Man in the Inordinate Affection, and lead him forth to satisfie his Lust to the full, as he had wont to do; then in his subtilty he abates his Temptation, and perswades Man that he may use things moderately, and keep out of Excess, for it is the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess</hi> that makes it to become <hi>Evil,</hi> and so to be condemned; but if he cease from <hi>Excess,</hi> the moderate use will not bring Condemnation: so he tells the Drunkard, if he keep himself from being drunk, he may moderately keep his Friend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and he may <hi>be merry</hi> with him: and he tells the Proud in heart, if they use not Excess in their Apparrel, they may go decently according to their quality; and the like Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for other Lusts he hath; and he tells Man, the moderate use of them will not bring Condemnation: but here some have found him a Lyar, as he is, who came to abstain and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain from the Excess of many things, which once they were serving their Lusts in, and caine down to that which the Devil called <hi>Moderation,</hi> but found it was in the hearts lusts still, and with the Light was still condemned and judged, and no rest nor peace could be found, until the Devil was wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and the hearts Lusts given up to the Crosse, and there crucified, and thereby Redemption perfectly wrought in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:53638:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Power of Christ, and then comes the right use to be made of ill things in their place with <hi>true moderation;</hi> and in the use of them in the Redeemed state there is no Condemnation, for they are received and used in the fear of the Lord, and what is useful and no more; and there is no Lust abiding that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth forth beyond the present need, and there is the Blessing felt; but Man that hearkens to the Serpent, and takes that for Moderation that he calls so, he is deceived; and though he lessen the use of that which the Light reproves him for in the Inordinate Affection, yet will the Light still condemn him, and judge him in his own Conscience, until he come to the Power, and there have his Lust truly Crucified: So the Serpent tells the Drunkard, he may drink moderately, and be merry with his Friend: he tells the Proud, he may put on such Garments as are suitable to his quality amongst men, so that he keep within the bounds of Moderation: And many have here denied common Drunkenness, and yet satisfying the old lust in the Excess: And many that cannot wear so many Rib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, nor great Cuffs, as sometimes they could, yet they must have some bunches of Ribbands, and little Cuffs; Then saith the Devil, thou art now in the Moderation, and dost no more, or hardly so much as becomes thy quality. And now to give one true and faithful Experience, though many in these things might be truly demonstrated: I know a Man who once was alive to himself, and served his Lusts, <hi>and loved Pleasures more than God,</hi> and in one thing the Serpent had sealed his life more than in many others, and his delight was chiefly in it; and after he came to obey the Light of Christ in his Conscience, it was clearly discovered unto him to be exceeding Evil; and though he minded the Light, and stood in the Crosse to his lustful desire, yet the Devil did not cease to provoke eagerly, still to satisfie the Lust, though he could not do the thing as he had done in the use of it, the Terror of the Lord was upon him, and his Righteous Judgment reached unto him, and many sore stripes he bore: then saith the Serpent, <hi>Lessen thy Inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Affection, and it will not be so with thee:</hi> then he came from the use of much, to the use of lesse; but the Judgment still pursued him, and the Terror encreased upon him, and though

the use of it was in the end so much lessened, as it was hardly used at all; yet when it was used, the Judgment ceased not, but Plagues were forthwith poured, and it was just with the Holy God so to do, and he could find no Peace, until he gave up his Life in the Lust, and stood upon his Watch, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Serpent approached with that Temptation, he placed Judgment upon his head, and so walked in the daily Crosse, until he was Crucified unto the Lust, and the Lust Crucified unto him, which now is as dead as if it had never been. <hi>Unto Him be Glory for evermore; who undertook the Cause, and perfected his own Work.</hi> Now Man that comes not to know the Lust crucified in the <hi>ground,</hi> he is betrayed into a <hi>false Moderation,</hi> and as he there standeth, he looketh at himself to be above many others, who yet abide in the <hi>Inordinate Affection;</hi> and so the Serpent worketh deceivably, to keep Man out of the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, and to lead him afar off from Judgment; and though the <hi>Inordinate Affection</hi> may be abated, yet the <hi>Lust</hi> is not crucified, but the life in it is saved, and Man here flies for his life, that when he should deny himself and take up the Crosse, he denies the Crosse and saves himself, and slies the Judgment, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide that day; but as Man keeps to the Light, this way will be made easie, and he will be able to tread thorow it, and come to the end of it, and conquer the Serpent who works against him; and as Man follows the Light faithfully, it brings him to the Judgment and keeps him in the Judgment, and there he waits and abides until Judgment be brought forth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Victory; and he, as a willing man, walks in the daily Cross, and chearfully gives up all his hearts Lusts to be crucified, and then he feels the Enmity slain, that hath begotten and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished the Lust; and so Man comes truly through the Furnace, and abides the Fire of Refinement, in which the <hi>Separation</hi> is made, and the <hi>Corruptible</hi> is burned and destroyed; then the <hi>Holy Seed of Life</hi> appears without any Mixture, and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is delivered out of travel and pain, and in this <hi>Fiery Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> is Man regenerated, where the <hi>Old man</hi> is destroyed, his hearts Lusts crucified, the body of Sin consumed, the Dross and Tin purged, the Gold clearly separated, and brought forth in its own pure property and quality; and through this <hi>living

eternal operation</hi> is Man recovered out of the Fall, and the <hi>Pure Creation</hi> is again restored into its <hi>holy Order,</hi> in which it was very good, and Man is then redeemed out of the <hi>fallen proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> where he hath been lusting after evil, and comes again into the Paradise of Pleasure, and hath his course unto the Tree of Life, and the flaming Sword doth not now fence it from him; and this is the Regeneration which Man must come to know in the Fire of Refinement, where he must part with all that is his own, whether <hi>Filthiness</hi> or <hi>Right cousness,</hi> and come thorow without any unclean thing; or he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God; and Man must put off the Corruptible part of the Earthly, where he is in the <hi>Degeneration,</hi> before he can be brought into the <hi>Holy Order</hi> of the <hi>Pure Creation;</hi> and as the <hi>Old</hi> he puts off in the Fire of Refinement, and abides in the Work of Regeneration, he comes to the <hi>New,</hi> and receives the <hi>New,</hi> and it is born in him, and thereby his, Change is wrought, and he is redeemed out of the <hi>fallen Properties</hi> into the <hi>Holy Order</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> and he is now no more his own, neither can he satisfie Lust any longer, but is truly dead unto it, and his Life is renewed in the Birth of the holy Seed, of which he is born, and in which he is a <hi>New man,</hi> and so puts off Drunkenness, and dyes to that Lust, and puts on Sobriety, and lives in that Vertue; he puts off Anger, and dyes to that Lust, he puts on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE Lord God of Eternal Glory, searches after Man in his fallen and degenerated state, and with his pure Light he finds him afar of, with his feet walking in dark paths, and his way in the Land of Desolation, and there doth he visit him in his poor and low degree; for Man is fallen from God, and departed from his Maker, the Serpent hath deceived him, and with his subtilty hath drawn him out of the <hi>holy Order,</hi> and hath enticed his mind into the <hi>fallen Properties</hi> of the visible part of the Earthly, where he is a servant to the subtil Worker, and satisfies his own hearts lusts that is fleshly, and is a sinner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the holy God, and in the disorder of the <hi>unruly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> where the pure Creation is in Bondage, and travelleth in sore pain, and the old Heavens, and the old Earth moves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, and heavily oppresses it; and man in the <hi>fallen Estate</hi> is never at <hi>Rest,</hi> nor his heart satisfied with lusting; and in this Separation from the God of Mercy, is Man plunging in the depth of Misery; a sinner he is, and Death reigns over him, and wrath is upon him, and in the disorder of the <hi>unruly affections,</hi> his life is driven about and tossed, and there is no stedfastness in him; and in this troubled state, there is a cry unto the Lord, and a breathing goes forth that would be in rest, and the Lord hath respect, and hears, and in bowels of pitty he arises to help, he stretcheth forth his Arm, and brings the Mountains down; he comes forth in power and makes the Hills to melt; he utters his voyce, and the Earth trembles, he kindles a fire and consumes it into Ashes; he brings Man into the <hi>Nothingness,</hi> and dissolves the old Birth into its dust; he causes the old Heavens to pass away with a noise, and he melts the Elements with fervent heat; and Man no longer lives therein, but his life is taken away, and he lies slain and dead, and there is no motion in him, until the Spirit of Life from God come into him, and create him new into the holy <hi>Order of Life,</hi> and so gives him breath and being
