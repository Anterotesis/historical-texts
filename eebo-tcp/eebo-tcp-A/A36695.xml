            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MBITION is so far from being a Vice in Poets, that tis almost impossible for them to succeed without it. Imagination must be rais'd, by a desire of Fame, to a desire of Pleasing: And they whom in all Ages Poets have endeavour'd most to please, have been the Beautiful and the Great. Beauty is their Deity to which they Sacrifice, and Greatness is their Guardian-Angel which protects them. Both these are so eminently join'd in the Person of Your Royal Highness, that it were not easie for any, but a Poet, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb facs="tcp:48505:3"/>
which of them out-shines the other. But I confess, <hi>MADAM,</hi> I am already byass'd in my choice: I can easily resign to others the Praise of Your Illustrious Family, and that Glory which You derive from a long-continu'd Race of Princes, famous for their Actions both in Peace and War: I can give up to the Historians of Your Country, the Names of so many Generals and Heroes which croud their Annals; and to our own, the hopes of those which You are to produce for the <hi>British</hi> Chronicle. I can yield, without envy, to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Poets, the Family of <hi>Este</hi> to which <hi>Ariosto</hi> and <hi>Tasso</hi> have ow'd their Patronage; and to which the World has ow'd their Poems: But I could not without extream reluctance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign the Theme of Your Beauty to another Hand. Give me leave, <hi>MADAM,</hi> to acquaint the World that I am Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of this Subject; and let it be no dishonour to You, that after having rais'd the Admiration of Mankind, You have inspir'd one Man to give it voice. But with whatsoever Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity this new Honour of being Your Poet has fill'd my mind, I confess my self too weak for the Inspiration; the Priest was always unequal to the Oracle: The God within him was too mighty for his Breast: He labour'd with the Sacred Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there was more of the Mystery left behind than Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity it self could inable him to express. I can but discover a part of Your Excellencies to the World; and that too ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the measure of my own weakness. Like those who have survey'd the Moon by Glasses, I can only tell of a new and shining World above us, but not relate the Riches and Glories of the Place. 'Tis therefore that I have already wav'd the Subject of Your Greatness, to resign my self to the Contemplation of what is more peculiarly Yours. Greatness is indeed communicated to some few of both Sexes; but Beauty is confin'd to a more narrow compass: 'Tis only in Your Sex, 'tis not shar'd by many, and its Supreme Perfection is in You alone. And here, <hi>MADAM,</hi> I am proud that I cannot flatter: You have reconcil'd the differing Judgments of Mankind: for all Men are equal in their Judgment of what is eminently best. The Prize of Beauty was disputed
<pb facs="tcp:48505:3"/>
only till You were seen; but now all Pretenders have with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn their Claims: There is no Competition but for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place. Even the fairest of our Island (which is fam'd for Beauties) not daring to commit their Cause against You, to the Suffrage of those who most partially adore them. Fortune has, indeed, but render'd Justice to so much Excellence, in setting it so high to publick view: or rather Providence has done Justice to it self, in placing the most perfect Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Heaven, where it may be admir'd by all Beholders. Had the Sun and Stars been seated lower, their Glory had not been communicated to all at once; and the Creator had want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so much of His Praise, as He had made Your condition more obscure. But He has plac'd You so near a Crown, that You add a Lustre to it by Your Beauty. You are join'd to a Prince who only could deserve You: whose Conduct, Courage, and Success in War, whose Fidelity to His Royal Brother, whose Love for His Country, whose Constancy to His Friends, whose Bounty to His Servants, whose Justice to Merit, whose Invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable Truth, and whose Magnanimity in all His Actions, seem to have been rewarded by Heaven by the gift of You. You are never seen but You are blest: and I am sure You bless all those who see You. We think not the Day is long enough when we behold You: And You are so much the business of our Souls, that while You are in sight, we can neither look nor think on any else. There are no Eyes for other Beauties: You only are present, and the rest of Your Sex are but the unregarded parts that fill Your Triumph. Our sight is so intent on the Object of its Admiration, that our Tongues have not leisure even to praise you: for Language seems too low a thing to express your Excellence; and our Souls are speaking so much within, that they despise all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign conversation. Every man, even the dullest, is think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than the most Eloquent can teach him how to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Thus <hi>MADAM,</hi> in the midst of Crouds you Reign in Solitude; and are ador'd with the deepest Veneration, that of Silence. 'Tis true, you are above all mortal wishes: no man desires impossibilities, because they are beyond the reach of
<pb facs="tcp:48505:4"/>
Nature: To hope to be a God, is folly exalted into mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: but by the Laws of our Creation we are oblig'd to Adore him; and are permitted to love him too, at Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane distance. 'Tis the nature of Perfection to be attractive; but the Excellency of the object refines the nature of the love. It strikes an impression of awful reverence; 'tis indeed that Love which is more properly a Zeal than Passion. 'Tis the rapture which Anchorites find in Prayer, when a Beam of the Divinity shines upon them: that which makes them despise all worldly objects, and yet 'tis all but contemplation. They are seldom visited from above; but a single vision so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them, that it makes up the happiness of their lives. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality cannot bear it often: it finds them in the eagerness and height of their Devotion, they are speechless for the time that it continues, and prostrate and dead when it departs. That extasie had need be strong, which without any end, but that of Admiration, has power enough to destroy all other Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. You render Mankind insensible to other Beauties: and have destroy'd the Empire of Love in a Court which was the seat of his Dominion. You have subverted (may I dare to accuse you of it) even our Fundamental Laws; and Reign absolute over the hearts of a stubborn and Free-born people tenacious almost to madness of their Liberty. The brightest and most victorious of our Ladies make daily complaints of revolted Subjects: if they may be said to be revolted, whose servitude is not accepted: for your Royal Highness is too Great, and too Just a Monarch, either to want or to receive the Homage of Rebellious Fugitives. Yet if some few among the multitude, continue stedfast to their first preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, 'tis an Obedience so luke-warm and languishing, that it merits not the name of Passion: their addresses are so faint, and their vows so hollow to their Sovereigns, that they seem only to maintain their Faith; out of a sence of Honor: they are asham'd to defist, and yet grow careless to obtain. Like despairing Combatants they strive against you as if they had beheld unveil'd, the Magical Shield of your <hi>Ariosto,</hi> which dazled the Beholders with too much bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:
<pb facs="tcp:48505:4"/>
they can no longer hold up their Arms, they have read their destiny in your Eyes.
<q>
                  <l>Splende lo Scudo a guisa di Piropo;</l>
                  <l>E Luce altra non é tanto lucente:</l>
                  <l>Cader in terra a lo splendor fu d'vopo,</l>
                  <l>Con gli occhi abbacinati, esenza mente.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, Madam, if I could find in my self the power to leave this argument of your incomparable Beauty, I might turn to one which would equally oppress me with its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. For your Conjugal Virtues have deserv'd to be set as an example, to a less-degenerate, less-tainted Age. They ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach so near to Singularity in Ours,, that I can scarcely make a Panegyric to your Royal Highness, without a Satyr on many others: but your Person is a Paradice, and your Soul a Cherubin within to guard it. If the excellence of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side invite the Beholders, the Majesty of your Mind deters them from too bold approaches; and turns their Admiration into Religion. Moral perfections are rais'd higher by you in the softer Sex: as if Men were of too course a mould for Heaven to work on, and that the Image of Divinity could not be cast to likeness in so harsh a Metall. Your Person is so admirable, that it can scarce receive addition, when it shall be glorify'd: and your Soul, which shines thorough it, finds it of a substance so near her own, that she will be pleas'd to pass an Age within it, and to be confin'd to such a Palace.</p>
            <p>I know not how I am hurried back to my former Theme: I ought, and purpos'd to have celebrated those indowments and qualities of your Mind, which were sufficient, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Graces of your Person, to render you, as you are, the Ornament of the Court, and the object of Wonder to three Kingdoms: but all my praises are but as a Bull-rush cast upon a stream, if they sink not, 'tis because they are born up by the strength of the Current, which supports their light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; but they are carry'd round again, and return on the Eddy where they first began. I can proceed no farther than your
<pb facs="tcp:48505:5"/>
Beauty: and even on that too; I have said so little confider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatness of the Subject; that, like him, who would lodge a Bowl upon a Precipice, either my praise falls back, by the weakness of the delivery, or staies not on the top, but rowls over, and is lost on the other side. I intended this a Dedication, but how can I consider what belongs to my self, when I have been so long contemplating on you! Be pleas'd then, Madam, to receive this Poem, without Intituling so much Excellency as yours, to the faults and imperfections of so mean a Writer: And instead of being favourable to the Piece, which merits nothing, forgive the presumption of the Author; who is, with all possible veneration,</p>

            <l>For <hi>Milton</hi> did the Wealthy Mine disclose,</l>

            <l>He first beheld the beauteous rustic Maid,</l>
            <l>And to a place of strength the prize convey'd;</l>
            <l>You took her thence: to Court this Virgin brought</l>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O satisfie the Curiosity of those who will give themselves the trouble of reading the ensuing POEM, I think my self oblig'd to render them a Reason, why I publish an <hi>OPERA</hi> which was never acted. In the first place I shall not be asham'd to own, that my chiefest Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, was the Ambition which I acknowledg'd in the Epistle. I was desirous to lay at the feet of so Beautiful and Excellent a Princess, a Work which I confess was unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy her, but which I hope she will have the goodness to forgive. I was also induc'd to it in my own defence: many hundred Copies of it being dispers'd, abroad without my knowledge or consent: so that every one gathering new faults, it became at length a Libel against me; and I saw, with some disdain, more nonsence than either I, or as bad a Poet, could have cram'd into it, at a Months warning, in which time 'twas wholly Written, and not since Revis'd. After this, I cannot without injury to the deceas'd Author of <hi>Paradice Lost,</hi> but acknowledge that this POEM has receiv'd its entire Foundation, part of the Design, and many of the Ornaments, from him. What I have borrow'd, will be so easily discern'd from my mean Productions, that I shall not need to point the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the places: And, truly, I should be sorry, for my own sake, that any one should take the pains to compare them together: The Original being undoubtedly, one of the greatest, most noble, and most sublime POEMS, which either this Age or Nation has produc'd. And though I could not refuse the partiality of my Friend, who is pleased to commend me in his Verses, I hope they will rather be esteem'd the effect of his love to me, than of his deliberate and sober judgment. His Genius is able to make
<pb facs="tcp:48505:7"/>
beautiful what he pleases: Yet, as he has been too favorable to me, I doubt not but he will hear of his kindness from many of our Contemporaries. For, we are fallen into an Age of Illiterate, Censorious, and Detracting people, who thus qualified, set up for Critiques.</p>
            <p>In the first place I must take leave to tell them, that they whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mistake the Nature of Criticism, who think its business is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to find fault. Criticism, as it was first instituted by <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> was meant a Standard of judging well. The chiefest part of which is to observe those Excellencies which should delight a reasonable Reader. If the Design, the Conduct, the Thoughts, and the Expressions of a POEM, be generally such as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from a true Genius of Poetry, the Critique ought to pass his judgement in favor of the Author. 'Tis malicious and unmanly to snarl at the little lapses of a Pen, from which <hi>Virgil</hi> himself stands not exempted. <hi>Horace</hi> acknowledges that honest <hi>Homer</hi> nods sometimes: He is not equally awake in every Line: But he leaves it also as a standing Measure for our judgments,

            <p>And <hi>Longinus,</hi> who was undoubtedly, after <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Critique amongst the <hi>Greeks,</hi> in his twenty seventh Chapter <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, has judiciously preferr'd the sublime Genius that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times erres, to the midling or indifferent one which makes few faults, but seldome or never rises to any Excellence. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the first to a Man of large possessions, who has not leisure to consider of every slight expence, will not debase himself to the management of every trifle: particular summs are not layd out or spar'd to the greatest advantage in his Oeconomy: but are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times suffer'd to run to waste, while he is only careful of the Main. On the other side, he likens the Mediocrity of Wit, to one of a mean fortune, who manages his store with extream frugality, or rather parsimony: but who with fear of running into profuseness,
<pb facs="tcp:48505:7"/>
never arrives to the magnificence of living. This kind of Genius writes, indeed correctly. A wary man he is in Grammar; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry nice as to Solaecism or Barbarism, judges to a hair of little decencies, knows better than any Man what is not to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten: and never hazards himself so far as to fall: but plods on deliberately, and, as a grave Man ought, is sure to put his staff before him; in short, he sets his heart upon it; and with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful care makes his business sure: that is, in plain English, neither to be blam'd, nor prais'd.—I could, sayes my Author, find out some blemishes in <hi>Homer:</hi> and am perhaps, as naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd to be disgusted at a fault as another Man: But, after all, to speak impartially, his faillings are such, as are only marks of humane frailty: they are little Mistakes, or rather Negligences, which have escap'd his pen in the fervor of his writing; the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limity of his spirit carries it with me against his carelesness: And though <hi>Apollonius</hi> his <hi>Argonautes,</hi> and <hi>Theocritus,</hi> his <hi>Eidul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> are more free from Errors, there is not any Man of so false a judgment, who would choose rather to have been <hi>Apollonius</hi> or <hi>Theocritus,</hi> than <hi>Homer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis worth our consideration, a little to examine how much these <hi>Hypercritiques</hi> of English Poetry, differ from the opinion of the Greek and Latine Judges of Antiquity: from the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> who have succeeded them; and, indeed, from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral tast and approbation of all Ages. Heroique Poetry, which they contemn, has ever been esteem'd, and ever will be, the greatest work of humane Nature: In that rank has <hi>Aristotle</hi> plac'd it, and <hi>Longinus</hi> is so full of the like expressions, that he abundantly confirms the others Testimony. <hi>Horace</hi> as plainly delivers his opinion, and particularly praises <hi>Homer</hi> in these Verses.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Quotations are superfluous in an establish'd truth: othern ise I could reckon up amongst the Moderns, all the <hi>Italian</hi> Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators on <hi>Aristotle's</hi> Book of Poetry; and amongst the <hi>French,</hi> the greatest of this Age, <hi>Boileau</hi> and <hi>Rapin:</hi> the latter of which is alone sufficient, were all other Critiques lost, to teach anew the rules of writing. Any Man who will seriously consider the nature of an Epique Poem, how it agrees with that of Poetry in general, which is to instruct and to delight; what actions it describes, and what persons they are chiefly whom it insorms, will find it a work which indeed is full of difficulty in the attempt, but admirable when 'tis well performed. I write not this with the least intention to undervalue the other parts of Poetry: for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is both excellently instructive, and extreamly pleasant: Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre lashes Vice into Reformation, and humor represents folly, so as to render it ridiculous. Many of our present Writers are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in both these kinds; and particularly the Author of the <hi>Plain Dealer,</hi> whom I am proud to call my Friend, has oblig'd all honest and vertuous Men, by one of the most bold, most general, and most useful Satyres which has ever been presented on the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Theater. I do not dispute the preference of Tragedy; let every Man enjoy his tast: but 'tis unjust, that they who have not the least notion of Heroique writing, should therefore condemn the pleasure which others receive from it, because they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it. Let them please their appetites in eating what they like: but let them not force their dish on all the Table. They who would combat general Authority, with particular Opinion, must first establish themselves a reputation of understanding better, than other men. Are all the flights of Heroique Poetry, to be concluded bombast, unnatural, and meer madness, because they
<pb facs="tcp:48505:8"/>
are not affected with their Excellencies? 'Tis just as reasonable as to conclude there is no day, because a blind Man cannot distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish of Light and Colours? ought they not rather, in modesty, to doubt of their own judgments, when they think this or that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in <hi>Homer, Virgil, Tasso,</hi> or <hi>Milton's Paradice,</hi> to be too far strain'd, than positively to conclude, that 'tis all fustian, and meer nonsence? 'Tis true, there are limits to be set betwixt the boldness and rashness of a Poet; but he must understand those limits who pretends to judge, as well as he who undertakes to write: and he who has no liking to the whole, ought in reason to be excluded from censuring of the parts. He must be a Lawyer before he mounts the Tribunal: and the Judicature of one Court too, does not qualifie a man to preside in another. He may be an excellent Pleader in the <hi>Chancery,</hi> who is not fit to rule the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi> But I will presume for once to tell them, that the boldest strokes of Poetry, when they are manag'd Art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, are those which most delight the Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> the severest Writers of the severest Age, have made frequent use of the hardest Metaphors, and of the strongest Hyperboles: And in this case the best Authority is the best Argument. For generally to have pleas'd, and through all ages, must bear the force of Universal Tradition. And if you would appeal from thence to right Reason, you will gain no more by it in effect, than First, to set up your Reason against those Authors; and Secondly, against all those who have admir'd them. You must prove why that ought not to have pleas'd, which has pleas'd the most Learn'd, and the most Judicious: and to be thought knowing, you must first put the fool upon all Mankind. If you can enter more deeply, than they have done, into the Causes and Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts of that which moves pleasure in a Reader, the Field is open, you may be heard: but those Springs of humane Nature are not so easily discover'd by ever superficial Judge: It requires Philosophy as well as Poetry, to sound the depth of all the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; what they are in themselves, and how they are to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok'd: and in this Science the best Poets have excell'd. <hi>Aristotle</hi> rais'd the Fabrique of his Poetry, from observation of those
<pb facs="tcp:48505:9"/>
things, in which <hi>Euripides, Sophocles,</hi> and <hi>AEschylus</hi> pleas'd: He consider'd how they rais'd the Passions, and thence has drawn rules for our Imitation. From hence have sprung the Tropes and Figures, for which they wanted a name, who first practis'd them, and succeeded in them, Thus I grant you, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Nature was the Original Rule; and that all Poets ought to study her; as well as <hi>Aristotle</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> her Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretors. But then this also undeniably follows, that those things which delight all Ages, must have been an imitation of Nature; which is all I contend. Therefore is Rhetorick made an Art: therefore the Names of so many Tropes and Figures were invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: because it was observ'd they had such and such an effect upon the Audience. Therefore <hi>Catachreses</hi> and <hi>Hyperboles</hi> have found their place amongst them; not that they were to be avoided, but to be us'd judiciously, and plac'd in Poetry, as heightnings and shadows are in Painting, to make the Figure bolder, and cause it to stand off to sight.</p>

            <p>Will you arraign your Master <hi>Horace,</hi> for his hardness of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, when he describes the death of <hi>Cleopatra?</hi> and sayes she did <hi>Asperos tractare serpentes, ut atrum corpore combibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret venenum?</hi> because the Body in that action, performs what is proper to the mouth?</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> I will neither quote <hi>Lucan,</hi> nor <hi>Statius,</hi> Men of an unbounded imagination, but who often wanted the
<pb facs="tcp:48505:9"/>
Poyze of Judgement. The Divine <hi>Virgil</hi> was not liable to that exception; and yet he describes <hi>Polyphemus</hi> thus:
<q>
                  <l>—Graditurque per aequor</l>
                  <l>Jam medium; nec dum fluctus latera ardua tingit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In imitation of this place, our Admirable <hi>Cowley</hi> thus paints <hi>Goliah.</hi>

                  <l>The Valley, now, this Monster seem'd to fill;</l>
                  <l>And we, methought, look'd up to him from our Hill.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Where the two words seem'd, and methought, have mollify'd the Figure: and yet if they had not been there, the fright of the <hi>Israelites</hi> might have excus'd their belief of the Giants Stature.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>8th</hi> of the <hi>AEneids, Virgil</hi> paints the swiftness of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milla</hi> thus:
<q>
                  <l>Illa vel intactae segetis per summa volaret</l>
                  <l>Gramina, nec teneras cursu laesisset aristas;</l>
                  <l>Vel Mare per medium, fluctu suspensa tumenti,</l>
                  <l>Ferret iter, celeres nec tingeret aequore plantas.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>You are not oblig'd, as in History, to a literal belief of what the Poet says; but you are pleas'd with the Image, without being couzen'd by the Fiction.</p>
            <p>Yet even in History, <hi>Longinus</hi> quotes <hi>Herodotus</hi> on this occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Hyperboles.</hi> The <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> sayes he, at the straights of <hi>Thermopylae,</hi> defended themselves to the last extremity: and when their Arms fail'd them, fought it out with their Nails and Teeth: till at length, (the <hi>Persians</hi> shooting continually upon them) they lay buried under the Arrows of their enemies. It is not reasonable, (continues the <hi>Critique</hi>) to believe that Men could defend themselves with their Nails and Teeth from an arm'd multitude: nor that they lay buried under a pile of Darts and Arrows; and yet there wants not probability for the Figure:
<pb facs="tcp:48505:10"/>
because the <hi>Hyperbole</hi> seems not to have been made for the sake of the description; but rather to have been produc'd from the occasion.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the boldness of the Figures are to be hidden, sometimes by the address of the Poet; that they may work their effect upon the Mind, without discovering the Art which caus'd it. And therefore they are principally to be us'd in passion; when we speak more warmly, and with more precipitation than at other times: for then, <hi>Si vis me flere dolendum est primùm ipsi tibi;</hi> the Poet must put on the Passion he endeavours to represent: A man in such an occasion is not cool enough, either to reason rightly, or to talk calmly. Aggravations are then in their proper places, Interoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Exclamations, Hyperbata, or a disorder'd connection of discourse, are graceful there, because they are Natural. The summ of all depends on what before I hinted, that this boldness of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression is not to be blam'd; if if be manag'd by the coolness and discretion, which is necessary to a Poet.</p>
            <p>Yet before I leave this subject, I cannot but take notice how dis-ingenuous our Adversaries appear: All that is dull, insipid, languishing and without sinews in a Poem, they call an imitation of Nature: they onely offend our most equitable Judges, who think beyond them; and lively Images and Elocution, are never to be forgiven.</p>
            <p>What Fustian, as they call it, have I heard these Gentlemen find out in Mr. <hi>Cowley'</hi>s <hi>Odes?</hi> I acknowledge my self unworthy to defend so excellent an Author; neither have I room to do it here: onely in general I will say, that nothing can appear more beautiful to me, than the strength of those Images which they condemn.</p>
            <p>Imaging is, in it self, the very heighth and life of Poetry. 'Tis, as <hi>Loginus</hi> describes it, a Discourse, which, by a kind of Enthusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asm, or extraordinary emotion of the Soul, makes it seem to us, that we behold those things which the Poet paints, so as to be pleas'd with them, and to admire them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48505:10"/>If Poetry be imitation, that part of it must needs be best, which describes most lively our Actions and Passions; our Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and our Vices; our Follies and our Humors: for neither is Comedy without its part of Imaging: and they who do it best, are certainly the most excellent in their kind. This is too plainly prov'd to be denied: but how are Poetical Fictions, how are Hippocentaures and Chymaeras, or how are Angels and immaterial Substances to be Imag'd? which some of them are things quite out of Nature: others, such whereof we can have no notion? this is the last refuge of our Adversaries; and more than any of them have yet had the wit to object against us. The answer is easie to the first part of it. The fiction of some Beings which are not in Nature, (second Notions as the Logicians call them) has been founded on the conjunction of two Natures, which have a real separate Being. So <hi>Hippocentaures</hi> were imagin'd, by joyning the Natures of a Man and Horse together; as <hi>Lucretius</hi> tells us, who has us'd this word of Image oftner than any of the Poets.
<q>
                  <l>Nam certé ex vivo, Centauri non fit Imago,</l>
                  <l>Nulla fuit quoniam talis natura animai:</l>
                  <l>Verùm ubi equiatque hominis, casu, convenit imago,</l>
                  <l>Haerescit facilè extemplò, &amp;c.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The same reason may also be alledg'd for <hi>Chymaera's</hi> and the rest. And Poets may be allow'd the like liberty, for describing things which really exist not, if they are founded on popular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: of this nature are Fairies, Pigmies, and the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effects of Magick: for 'tis still an imitation, though of other mens fancies: and thus are <hi>Shakespeare's Tempest,</hi> his <hi>Midsum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer nights Dream,</hi> and <hi>Ben. Johnson's Masque of Witches</hi> to be defended. For Immaterial Substances we are authoriz'd by Scripture in their description: and herein the Text accommodates it self to vulgar apprehension, in giving Angels the likeness of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful young men. Thus, after the Pagan Divinity, has <hi>Homer</hi> drawn his Gods with humane Faces: and thus we have notions of things
<pb facs="tcp:48505:11"/>
above us, by describing them like other beings more within our knowledge.</p>
            <p>I wish I could produce any one example of excellent imaging in all this Poem: perhaps I cannot: but that which comes nearest it, is in these four lines, which have been sufficiently canvas'd by my well-natur'd Censors.

He might have Burlesqu'd <hi>Virgil</hi> too, from whom I took the Image. <hi>Invadunt urbem, somno vinoque sepultam.</hi> A Cities being buried is just as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per an occasion, us an Angels being dissolv'd in Ease, and Songs of Triumph. Mr. <hi>Cowley</hi> lies as open too in many places:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there vast Courts the Mother Waters keep,</hi> &amp;c. for if the mass of Waters be the Mothers, then their Daughters, the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle streams, are bound in all good manners, to make Court'sie to them, and ask them Blessing. How easie 'tis to turn into ridicule, the best descriptions, when once a man is in the humor of laughing, till he wheezes at his own dull jest! but an Image which is strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and beautifully set before the eyes of the Reader, will still be Poetry, when the merry fit is over: and last when the other is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p>I promis'd to say somewhat of <hi>Poetique Licence,</hi> but have in part anticipated my discourse already. <hi>Poetique Licence</hi> I take to be the Liberty, which Poets have assum'd to themselves in all ages, of speaking things in Verse, which are beyond the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity
<pb facs="tcp:48505:11"/>
of Prose. 'Tis that particular character, which distinguishes and sets the bounds betwixt <hi>Oratio soluta,</hi> and <hi>Poetry.</hi> This, as to what regards the thought, or imagination of a Poet, consists in Fiction: but then those thoughts must be express'd; and here arise two other branches of it: for if this <hi>Licence</hi> be included in a single word, it admits of Tropes: if in a Sentence or Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, of Figures: bath which are of a much larger extent, and more forcibly to be us'd in Verse than Prose. This is that Birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right which is deriv'd to us from our great Forefathers, even from <hi>Homer</hi> down to <hi>Ben.</hi> and they who would deny it to us, have, in plain terms, the Foxes quarrel to the Grapes; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reach it.</p>
            <p>How far these Liberties are to be extended, I will not presume to determine here, since <hi>Horace</hi> does not. But it is certain that they are to be varied, according to the Language and Age in which an Author writes. That which would be allow'd to a <hi>Grecian</hi> Poet, <hi>Martial</hi> tells you, would not be suffer'd in a <hi>Roman.</hi> And 'tis evident that the <hi>English,</hi> does more nearly follow the strictness of the latter, than the freedoms of the former. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of Epithetes, or the conjunction of two words in one, are frequent and elegant in the <hi>Greek,</hi> which yet Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> and the Translator of <hi>Du Bartas,</hi> have unluckily attempted in the <hi>English;</hi> though this I confess, is not so proper an Instance of <hi>Poetique Licence,</hi> as it is of variety of <hi>Idiom</hi> in Languages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horace</hi> a little explains himself on this subject of <hi>Licentia Poetica;</hi> in these Verses,
<q>
                  <l>—Pictoribus atque Poetis</l>
                  <l>Quidlibet audendi, semper fuit aequa potestas:</l>
                  <l>Sed non, ut placidis coeant immitia, non ut</l>
                  <l>Serpentes avibus geminentur, Tygribus Haedi.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He would have a Poem of a piece: not to begin with one thing and end with another: he restrains it so far, that Thoughts of an unlike Nature, ought not to be joyn'd together: That were indeed
<pb facs="tcp:48505:12"/>
to make a Chaos. He tax'd not <hi>Homer,</hi> nor the Divine <hi>Virgil,</hi> for interessing their gods in the Wars of <hi>Troy</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he now liv'd, would he have tax'd <hi>Milton,</hi> as our false Critiques have presum'd to do, for his choice of a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Argument: but he would have blam'd my Author, who was a <hi>Christian,</hi> had he introduc'd into his Poem Heathen Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as <hi>Tasso</hi> is condemn'd by, <hi>Rapin</hi> on the like occasion: and as <hi>Camoens,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Lusiads,</hi> ought to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd by all his Readers, when he brings in <hi>Bacchus</hi> and Christ into the same Adventure of his Fable. From that which has been said, it may be collected, that the definition of Wit (which has been so often attempted, and ever unsuccessfully by many Poets,) is only this: That it is a propriety of Thoughts and Words; or in other terms, Thought and Words, elegantly adapted to the Subject. If our Critiques will joyn issue on this Definition, that we may <hi>convenire in aliquo tertio;</hi> if they will take it as a granted Principle, 'twill be easie to put an end to this dispute: No man will disagree from anothers judgement, concerning the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Style, in Heroique Poetry: but all reasonable Men will conclude it necessary, that sublime Subjects ought to be adorn'd with the sublimest, and (consequently often) with the most figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive expressions. In the mean time I will not run into their fault of imposing my opinions on other men, any more than I would my Writings on their tast: I have onely laid down, and that superficially enough, my present thoughts; and shall be glad to be taught better, by those who pretend to reform our Poetry.</p>

            <stage>The first Scene represents a Chaos, or a confus'd Mass of Matter; the Stage is almost wholly dark: A symphony of Warlike Music is heard for some time; then from the Heavens, (which are opened) fall the rebellious Angels wheeling in the Air, and seeming transfix'd with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts: The bottom of the Stage being opened, receives the Angels, who fall out of sight. Tunes of Victory are play'd, and an Hymn sung; Angels discover'd above, brandishing their Swords: The Music ceasing, and the Heavens being clos'd, the Scene shifts, and on a sudden represents Hell: Part of the Scene is a Lake of Brimstone or rowling Fire; the Earth of a burnt colour: The fall'n Angels appear on the Lake, lying prostrate; a Tune of Horrour and Lamentation is heard.</stage>

                     <l>Farewell, you flow'rs, whose buds, with early care,</l>
                     <l>I watch'd, and to the chearful sun did rear:</l>
                     <l>Who now shall bind your stems? or, when you fall,</l>
                     <l>With fountain streams, your fainting souls recall?</l>
                     <l>A long farewell to thee, my nuptial bow'r,</l>
                     <l>Adorn'd with ev'ry fair and flagrant flow'r.</l>
                     <l>And last, farewell, farewell my place of birth;</l>
                     <l>I go to wander in the lower earth,</l>
                     <l>As distant as I can; for, disposest,</l>
                     <l>Farthest from what I once enjoy'd, is best.</l>
