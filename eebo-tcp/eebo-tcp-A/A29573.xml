            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the firſt, the Motives of <hi>Honour, Loyalty,</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> are ſet down, which <hi>deterred</hi> my Conſcience from <hi>taking Armes againſt the King</hi>: In the ſecond, I endeavour a Vindication of my <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Innocency</hi> from that <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>injurious</hi> Sentence <hi>of Exception</hi> of the Houſes, whereby they have declared me a Delinquent, that muſt not expect <hi>Pardon</hi> or <hi>Mercy,</hi> either in point of <hi>Fortune,</hi> or of <hi>Life,</hi> which muſt of neceſſity inſinuate me unto the World, and unto Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, to have been a Malefactor of a <hi>more h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I wiſh you and they may have as much Comfort in the reading of it, as I had in the writing of it, which I believe to have been greater (notwithſtanding my <hi>Baniſhment</hi> and <hi>Want</hi> in my old Age) than hath remained in the Breaſt of any of thoſe that have made us ſo miſerable.</p>

            <p>The laſt requeſt you made unto me with Tears, when I departed from you, and left the kingdom, was, That I would ſet down in writing mine own Proceeding, and the unavoidableneſs and Iuſtifiableneſs of the Cauſe, for which we have ſuffered, and whereof I had ſo often diſcourſed unto you. And truly, ſuch hath been in all kinds your great Deſerving from me, That I have taken this pains chiefly for your Satisfaction, as I ſhould do much more in any thing that I ſhould judge might be to your Comfort, and that might remain as a Teſtimony of my Kindneſs, Affection, and Value of you.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 1. The Introduction and Motives of writing this Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> NEVER more unwillingly took pen in hand than at preſent to ſet down the ſubſequent Diſcourſe, for mine own Vindication againſt ſo many unjuſt and untrue aſperſions as have been caſt upon me, and ſo great ſeverities as have been uſed towards me. For it was in my hopes that rather ſome publique and legal Tryal ſhould have given me the means of clearing my ſelf to the World, than my pen. Neither could I but in reaſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that whether by Treaty, or by Force this unatural War ſhould be extinguiſhed, ſuch only as had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of illegal Oppreſsions, or ſuch as had been the Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to ſet on foot, or the Inſtruments to act thoſe things which were the cauſe of thoſe unhappy miſ-underſtandings and diviſions betwixt the King and the People, ſhould have been reſerved to the higheſt and ſevereſt puniſhments. But that others, who neither were, nor could be, charged with any other Crime, but their adherence to either party, according as they were guided by their Conſciences, might (after ſome ſuch moderate ſufferings as the leſs ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full party are uſually liable unto, or after ſome legal Trial) have been admitted to an Act of Oblivion, whereby thoſe general animoſities which this War hath raiſed might have been allayed, and by little and little have grown to be forgotten, and thoſe naturall and near relations betwixt man and wife, parents and children, friend and friend, which this War by difference in opinion and part-taking
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95489:5"/>
hath deſtroyed, might (together with the peace of the Kingdom) have been reſtored.</p>
            <p>And in expectation of ſome ſuch happy accord, or ſome moderate reducement when that all mens Caſes might have been calmly conſidered of, and that the great Succeſſes of the Houſes in their war would have been ſeconded by their Acts of the greater and clearer Iuſtice, And that ſuch as had made their humble addreſſes unto them, ſhould have been admitted to the means of informing them, and not to be cenſured or condemned unheard, eſpecially ſuch as Petitioned for, and ſubmitted to the Juſtice of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Upon this hope and expectation I paſſed by more than twenty printed aſperſions, full of infamy, bitterneſs and detraction, but void of all Truth. Theſe I neglected, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſaw the operation they had of raiſing a hatred and deteſtation in the People, who fetched their intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from them, and grounded their opinions of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice upon them.</p>
            <p>But that which I was far from neglecting, but lay'd to my heart, with great ſadneſs and grief of mind, was. The ſevere Cenſures of the Houſes in their Propoſitions to the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> when (without Summons, Hearing, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction) I was cenſured to be made incapable of holding of any place or imployment in the Kingdom, or to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Verge of the Court, without laying the leaſt Crime or Delinquency to my charge; and ſince in the Propoſitions at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> (their ſeverity increaſing towards me) they added much to their former Cenſure; I am ſure without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further Crime or Provocation on my part, having before that time (with the Kings leave) retired my ſelf from the Court, with intention to have paſſed the reſt of mine age in a private life, which (the War not permitting me at my Houſe at <hi>Sherbone</hi>) I did at <hi>Exeter,</hi> for the ſpace of more than 2 years, with as much privacy, as was poſsible for me. Yet was I ſo unfortunate, that (although their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of my being removed from Court were accompliſhed by my voluntary Act neither time did allay their diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95489:5"/>
nor my abſence from Court reſtrain their further ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie towards me. But I was voted in thoſe Propoſitions prepared to be offered to his <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and afterwards ſent unto him, to be in the number of the moſt high and capital Offenders, who were not to expect Pardon or Mercy either concerning Life or Fortune.</p>
            <p>Yet herewith was not my Patience and reſolution of Silence overborn, conceiving this <hi>Exception</hi> could ſignifie nothing more than that ſuch Excepted Perſons, upon whom the diſpleaſure of the Houſes was highly fallen, ſhould not be admitted to that general Pardon of Courſe, which, joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome <hi>pecuniary Mulct or Compoſition,</hi> ſhould be a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and indempnity to others that had born Armes, without further Tryal or Impeachment; But that the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be reſerved to a particular ſtrict Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Tryal, and being after a fair hearing legally convicted of thoſe preſuppoſed, hainous and foul Crimes (the ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereof induced the Houſes to lay this heavy mark of Diſtinction upon them) They being ſo condemned ſhould have the ſeverity of Law and Juſtice to paſs upon them, and be excepted from Pardon, as far as lay in the houſes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept them. But I did not conceive that the intention of the Houſes was or could be, to except them from a legal Tryal, or fair Hearing, nor from being acquitted or clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they were innocent. For no man could entertain ſo hard or prejudiced an opinion of the two Houſes, or of the Scotiſh Commiſſioners who concurred and aſſented to the Propoſitions, and the Exception, that they ſhould, upon the transferring of ſuch Perſons as the Houſe of Peers ſhould nominate of their Body, or the Houſe of Commons of their Members, or of the Body of the Commons, or the Scotiſh Commiſſioners of their Kingdom, condemn im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely, or <hi>Proſcribe</hi> (in compliance one to the other, without diſtinct knowledge of the Perſon or the Crimes) ſo many noble Perſonages and Families to totall ruine and deſtruction, without hearing or due proceſſe of Law.</p>
            <p>Beſides their demanding of the Kings aſſent to paſs their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95489:6"/>
Condemnations and Incapacities by Act of Parliament, muſt needs imply a due preceding Tryal and Conviction to be intended for the ſatisfying of the King of the Crimes and guilt of the Perſons, For it cannot be preſuppoſed of the Houſes, that (either in regard of piety or reaſon) they could expect, that the King ſhould involve himſelf in ſo mercileſs a ſentence of ſhedding ſo many mens blood, and deſtroying ſo many good Families (implicitely upon truſt of other men) without diſtinct information and ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his own Conſcience, And this, againſt Perſons who have been moſt Loyal, and their Crime and Delinquencie only for having faithfully adhered to him, according to the Law and their Oaths.</p>
            <p>So that my Opinion then was, That the intention of the Houſes could be no other, but that whereas ſome were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a pecuniary Compoſition for their pretended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquency, the <hi>Excepted Perſons</hi> ſhould not be admitted thereunto, but be reſerved to the ſeverity of Juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mercy, but firſt be admitted to a legal Tryal.</p>
            <p>And herein I was further confirmed by divers Treaties made with their General upon the laying down of Armes, and the ſurrendring of Cities unto them, and particularly of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> where I was, and was to have injoyed the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of thoſe Articles, by which it was permitted unto me, and unto all other <hi>Excepted Perſons,</hi> to endeavour by the ſpace of four moneths to make our Peace and Compoſition, And this would never have been condeſcended unto by their General, and ratified by the Votes of both Houſes, if they intended their Vote of Exception as a final Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, irrevocable, and unalterable, which they have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by their own Acts declared to be otherwiſe: For that upon mediation, and further information, they have been pleaſed, to ſeveral Perſons to remit the ſeverity of the Vote of Exceptions, and have admitted them to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>Upon all theſe preceding Reaſons, being confident that ſome ſuch fitting ſeaſon would be offered, either by way of Petition, or by way of being called to a fair and Legal
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95489:6"/>
Trial, That I ſhould be heard, and (after a particular Charge of all ſuch Crimes as could be laid againſt me) I ſhould be admitted to a juſt defence, Upon this ground I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto remained ſilent, and made no Anſwer to thoſe ſo many moſt unjuſt and untrue Calumnies and Aſperſions which have been caſt upon me both in Print and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>And now by the ſaid Treatie of <hi>Exceſter</hi> I ſuppoſed a fair opportunitie given me, to addreſs my ſelf unto the Houſes to attain that which was ever in my deſires, which was to be admitted unto an Hearing, That they might judge di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly of my Caſe, after a full Information of all that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned me; And thereupon I addreſſed my humble Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Houſe of Peers, That I might receive ſo much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Juſtice from them, That (ſince I was by the Treaty admitted to uſe my beſt indeavours ſo far to ſatisfie the Houſes, that I might be left in the Condition of other men that had ſerved the King) I might be heard by them, And in caſe I ſhould not upon hearing give the Houſes ſatisfaction of not deſerving to be a Perſon Excepted, I would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline any thing whatſoever the Houſes ſhould order con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me. And in Caſe that it ſhould not be ſeaſonable, in regard of their many great Affairs at that time, to afford me ſuch a Tryal, That I might remain privately at mine Houſe, ingaging my ſelf to do nothing to the prejudice of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes either by Act or Correſpondence; And to make my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance whenſoever I ſhould be ſummoned, and to abide their Order. This Petition had likewiſe an humble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt unto the Lords, That the ſaid Petition might be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with the Houſe of Commons in ſuch ſort as their Lordſhips in their wiſdom ſhould think fit; For I might not (being a Peer) make my addreſſes but by them, or their particular leave: Yet knowing that the Propoſition of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions was by the joint Vote of both Houſes, and that no Proceeding therein could be but by joint concurrence of both Houſes, I judged this the moſt proper Expedient of making my addreſſes unto them both.</p>
            <p>I accompanied this my Petition with a letter of much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95489:7"/>
Reſpect unto the Speaker of the Houſe of Peers, with many Motives to induce them to condeſcend to my Petition. I received Anſwer by letter bearing date the 10. day of <hi>Iune</hi> 1646. from the <hi>Earl of Mancheſter</hi> (Speaker <hi>pro tempore</hi>) in the name of the Houſe, as followeth. <hi>My Lord, The Houſe of Peers have received your Letter, and have commanded me to return your Lordſhip this Anſwer, That they leave your Lordſhip to take the benefit of the Articles of</hi> Exceſter, <hi>which they will carefully obſerve, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hereupon, (having the Articles of <hi>Exceſter</hi> confirmed) I came up in perſon unto <hi>London,</hi> and exhibited my ſecond Petition to the Houſe of Peers, with the ſame Requeſt I had formerly made, That it might be communicated with the Houſe of Commons; And by a letter ſignified unto the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons my being come to <hi>London</hi> upon the publique faith of the Treatie of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> The particular ſafe-Conduct of their General under his Hand and Seal, and his letter to the Speaker of the Houſe of Commons, and the aſſurance of the Houſe of Peers, That the ſaid Articles ſhould be carefully obſerved by them.</p>
            <p>My ſecond Petition was, That I might without offence ſollicit my Cauſe, and uſe my indeavours to give ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Houſes. I received Anſwer by the <hi>Earl of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, That the Lords thought it reaſonable that I might take the full benefit of the Articles, and uſe my beſt indeavours in ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciting my Cauſe in Perſon, to my best advantage.</hi> But the next day after I had received this permiſſion from the Lords to follow my Cauſe, I was notified and ſerved with an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by the Serjeant at Armes of the Houſe of Commons, <hi>That notwithſtanding it was agreed by the Articles for Rendring up of</hi> Exceſter, Oxford, <hi>&amp;c. That the Excepted Perſons might come to</hi> London <hi>to endeavour to make their Peace and Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition with the Parliament, the Houſe of Commons was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to admit them to no Compoſition, notwithſtanding the ſaid Articles, And therefore it being to no purpoſe for them to uſe any further indeavours in that kind, the Serjeant at Arms of that Houſe was from time to time to give notice unto all ſuch Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Perſons, That they ſhould immediately depart without the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95489:7"/>
Line of Communication and Parts adjacent, and not to return, &amp;c.</hi> I conceived this very derogatorie to the Houſe of Peers, that I ſhould be ordered by the Houſe of Commons without the Concurrence of the Lords, eſpecially in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wherein the Lords had declared themſelves before.</p>
            <p>Herein I thought it fit to have recourſe unto the Lords, and ſent the Copie of the ſaid Order unto divers of them, who ſeemed to find it very ſtrange, and wiſhed it might be offered unto the Houſe the next morning, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done; But having been read, (after ſome time of a general ſilence) another buſineſs was ſet on foot, and this laid by, ſo that I found little relief was to be had where I might ſo juſtly have expected it.</p>
            <p>But (in regard the Serjeant at Arms had told me, He could return no Anſwer to the Houſe of Commons, but his dutie was only to notifie the Order, and to give an accompt if obedience were not given to it) I wrote a letter unto the Speaker, conteining ſome few modeſt and neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. But nothing would be heard concerning me, but that I was to depart the Kingdom within the limited time by the Articles of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> which being within very few daies to be elapſed, I was conſtrained to make all the haſte I could to the ſea ſide, and there to imbarque my Self and Companie, and horſes, in a ſmall boat, with three Mariners only and one Boy, having uſed all poſſible means to have my time enlarged only for ſome few daies, for the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of fitting Tranſportation, but could not obtain it: ſo that two daies before the expiration of the time limited by the Articles of <hi>Excester,</hi> I imbarqued at <hi>Weymouth,</hi> and paſſed into <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon of my leaving the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> was Firſt, for that I was aſſured that the time of the Treatie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expired, I ſhould be ſeized as a Priſoner of War, and ſo I might have been proceeded againſt by Marſhal law, or an Arbitrarie Power, inſtead of a legal Tryal according to the law; which neither then I did, nor will at any time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline. The ſecond was, That notwitſtanding by the 21. Article for the ſurrendring of <hi>Exceſter,</hi> it was agreed, That
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95489:8"/>
no Oath, Covenant, Proteſtation or Subſcription, ſhould be impoſed upon any Perſon whatſoever, compriſed in the ſaid Articles; Yet the Houſe of Commons ordered 2 of <hi>June</hi> 1646. That no Perſon ſhould come to reſide in the Parliament Quarters, (which was then all <hi>England</hi>) but he ſhould take the National League and Covenant, and the Negative Oath, notwithſtanding any Articles that had been or ſhould be made by the Army; neither of which I thought could ſtand with my Loyaltie, or the Oaths or Proteſtation which I had formerly taken: Beſides, I did conceive, that no Perſon could live with comfort or ſafetie under ſuch a Power, that ſo avowedlie broke the Publique Faith of their own Armie and General, whom though I found very deſirous to have his Capitulations punctually performed, yet were they in all things broken by the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or their Committees, whenſoever it was for their bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: For the General having given me his Letters, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection under his hand and ſeal for the injoying and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of my goods for the ſpace of four months according to the Articles; yet the Committees of <hi>Dorſet-ſhire</hi> ſlighted the ſaid Articles and Generals latters, being both ſhewed unto them, and ſold the ſaid good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for a third parr of their value, for their own or friends advantage.</p>
            <p>By this manner of proceeding, I (having fallen from all hope or poſſibilitie of clearing my ſelf by being brought to a legal Trial, or publick Hearing, And being loath to go to my grave (from whence I cannot be far) branded with that black Mark of not being capable of Pardon or Mercie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Life nor Fortunes, which muſt inſinuate me to the world to be ſome horrid, pernicious and wicked Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor) find my ſelf obliged in that I owe to my ſelf, in Vindication of mine Honor and Innocencie, as likewiſe to my Familie and Poſteritie, who will find themſelves left to want and miſery, to let them ſee that it hath been an inevitable neceſſity and adhering to my Loyalty and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that hath involved me in that general Calamitie that hath be fallen the Kings overborn Partie, and the particular indignation of others, and no particular wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95489:8"/>
or demerit of mine, that hath aſſigned and ſevered me to that ſevere and mercileſs Sentence of Unpardonable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>If I could have had any hope of being admitted to a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or Legal Proceeding, I ſhould never have betaken me to any other way of clearing my ſelf, although I am not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, upon how great diſadvantage and hazard any man is brought to a Tryal upon the Impeachment and purſuit of the Houſes: Neither had I any reaſon to ſlatter my ſelf with any indulgency towards we: Yet withall, I had, and have, ſo great confidence of my own clear Innocency, in point of not meriting to be excepted from the ſame courſe of proceeding afforded others, That I was never more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to attain any thing, than I was, and am, to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to an equal and fair Hearing, and Legal Tryal.</p>
            <p>As for the point of having ſerved and adhered to the King, I ſhall neither deny or evade it; but my Caſe is in that, the ſame with many Thouſands; and I ſhould be too indulgent to my ſelf, not to expect the ſame misfortunes and ſuffering with others: But now almoſt deſpairing of ever to be ſo happy as to ſee mine own Country again, in regard of my Age and Infirmities, and in leſs hopes of ever being admitted to a fair Hearing, ſince the very ways of Addreſſes or Petitions unto them are debarred me, and the uſing of any further indeavour to ſatisfie them is voted down, And ſince their Sentence is already (before either Examination, Tryal or Conviction) put in execution, (in as much as concerneth Fortunes or Eſtates) by their actual poſſeſſing and diſpoſing of them: So that (having nothing left unto me but an exiled Life, preſent wants, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of greater poverty) I ſhall indeavour to bear thoſe heavy viſitations which God hath been pleaſed to ſend upon me and my Family, with that Conſtancy of mind, and pious ſubmiſſion to Gods holy will, as befitteth a good Chriſtian; and leave unto my Family and Poſterity the ſubſequent Diſcourſe: where, in the firſt place I ſhall ſet down thoſe Reaſons that induced me to adhere unto the King, being (as I conceive) thereunto bound, in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95489:9"/>
Honour and Conſcience, by the Law of God and of the Land, by many ſolemn Oaths, by natural Allegiance as a Subject, and by Honeſty and Gratitude, as a ſworn Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant both to his Father and to himſelf; Of which ſeveral Obligations I ſhall ſpeak in the firſt part of this Diſcourſe: And in the ſecond part I ſhall make ſo true and faithfull a Narration of my Proceedings, as I doubt not But to appear to have been a Faithfull, Loyal, and Affectionate Servant to the King my Soveraign and Maſter, But to have had no hand in any of thoſe Exorbitancies which cauſed thoſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings betwixt the King and his People; To have been no Incendiary betwixt the King and the Houſes;<note place="margin">

            <head>CHAP. II. The particular Reaſons of adhering unto the King in this Cauſe, and the method obſerved in this Diſcourſe.</head>
            <p>MY intention is not in this Diſcourſe (wherein the Vindication of mine own Honour and Innocency, and the ſetting down of thoſe Reaſons which deterred my Conſcience from taking Armes againſt my King, is the main ſcope) to write a defence of the Cauſe in general, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Queſtion of Subjects taking Armes againſt their Soveraign; It will require a large and elaborate Tract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parr, which may not be interrupted by any thing of the proceedings of a particular man: Neither will I cenſure or judge other men, nor fix upon others (though of a contrary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95489:9"/>
way) any thing that may ſeem opprobrious, notwithſtanding the Stile of Traitor and notorious Traitor hath often been my Title in Print; although that deteſtable name in this Caſe doth not make me bluſh. I know mens Conſciences may by different Principles, be carried different waies: Neither will I cenſure ſo many men of all Qualities and Conditions, and religious Profeſſions, of ſo much Impietie, as to have broken through all Tyes of Allegiance and Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie, and ſo many Oaths, their Conſciences unconſulted, and without conceiving they had found ſomething to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance their Judgements againſt ſo many preciſe and clear Duties. I ſhall only ſet down the motives and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mine own Conſcience; which ought to be to each Chriſtian his Guide; againſt which, as he can do nothing well; ſo even good Actions become evil, if they be done with an unſatisfied or dubious conſcience. The Rules of Scripture being, <hi>That we be fully perſwaded in our minds,</hi> Rom. 14.5. <hi>That he is happy that condemneth not himſelf in the thing he alloweth,</hi> verſ. 22. <hi>That he that doubteth is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, And that all things that are not of faith are Sin,</hi> ver. 23. So that as it will be eaſily agreed, That to all Chriſtian men, Conſcience ought to be the ſtrongeſt and moſt unreſiſtable guide, and of ſo great and binding authoritie with us, That it ſhould over-rule all conſiderations of Safetie, Profit, Ambition, Revenge, or other Intereſt whatſoever: So it behooveth each Chriſtian man to ſeek out the beſt and moſt unfallible marks and directions for the guiding of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the right way. And this I may with truth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare (and take God to my witneſs in it) That when I did ſee, that no Induſtry (wherein I omitted nothing that was in my power, for the ſtopping, allaying, or reconciling of thoſe differences and violences, which (breaking in like a floud) prevailed over mine, and all other peaceable min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mens indeavours) could produce any good effect, (And that there was now nothing left to any man, but (in an unevitable War) to make choice of the juſter ſide, as his Conſcience towards God in the firſt place, and his other civil duties and obligations ſhould dictate unto
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95489:10"/>
him) I did, (after many Conferences with learned men of the other way, much ſtudie, and reading of all that I could find to have written in favour or excuſe of Subjects taking Arms againſt their King) reſolve (contrary to all worldy or prudential Intereſts of my own) to adhere to the King, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as my Conſcience was ſatisfied I was bound to do, By the law of God, By the doctrine and practice of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Churches, and in all times, By many Oathes, By the laws of the Kingdom, By my natural Allegiance as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, And by Gratitude and Fidelity, as a ſworn Servant, both to his Father and Himſelf: Of each which ſeveral Obligations, I ſhall ſpeak in the ſubſequent Diſcourſe in the order that is here ſet down.</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Reaſons deduced from Scripture.</head>
            <p>AS it will be eaſily aſſented unto, that Conſcience ought to be the guide of our Actions: ſo the moſt infallible Rule whereby to guide Conſcience to a Chriſtian, ought to be, the Principles of Religion; and thoſe Principles are, (above all other) binding and obliging which are deduced from the word of God. I ſhall therefore firſt begin with thoſe religious and pious Motives which have in Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reſtrained me from taking Arms againſt the King, or making to him any hoſtile Reſiſtance: For I deſire it to be underſtood, that when I ſpeak of Reſiſtance, I alwaies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Actual and Hoſtile Reſiſtance:</hi> For I well know, that in things in themſelves ſinfull, <hi>mala in ſe,</hi> I ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to obey God than Men, And in ſuch Caſes, ſuffering is a full performance of our Duty of Obedience; Nay in Caſes only illegal, <hi>non illicita,</hi> but <hi>illegalia,</hi> againſt publique or private Right, as if a Prince ſhall infringe the known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Prilileges of the Kingdom or of Parliament, or command that which is deſtructive unto them, The Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of our Reſiſtance ought to be <hi>Replyes, Petitions, Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances,</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:95489:10"/>
Nay we may withold our free-will-Offerings, though not our Tributes of Dutie, we may ſtop our vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarie ſupplies of giving Subſidies, we may make a ſtand in the tranſactions of affairs, untill the King condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to do us Right, as hath been often practiſed, As it was in the Caſe of the <hi>Earl of Arundel,</hi> who being reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kept from ſitting in Parliament in the year 1626. by the King, without cauſe ſhewn, The Houſe of Peers ſate many daies ſilent without debating or tranſacting any Buſineſs untill he ſhould be reſtored to his libertie, and place in Parliament, or cauſe ſhewed for his detention: But to take Arms, or to uſe Acts of force, this is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which ought not to be uſed, and is neither juſtifiable by the Laws of God, nor of the Kingdom, And this Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I am far from being ſatisfied in my Conſcience may be uſed by any ſubjects againſt their lawfull and undoubted Soveraign.</p>
            <p>The places in Scripture, both in the old and new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment commanding (by poſitive precept) our obedience, and forbidding Reſiſtance to the Powers ordeined over us by God, are many; But the Arguments of neceſſary deducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are infinite, whereas Reſiſtance is no where command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or allowed; And the Arguments by way of Deduction which are made uſe of to tollerate the Subjects taking of Arms againſt their Soveraign, are by putting ſome places of Scripture upon wrack and torture to make them ſpeak their ſenſe; whereas it is an undeniable Rule in Schools, That <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences and deductions cannot justifie the breach of plain duties injoyned by any one poſitive precept of Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the old Teſtament it was death to diſobey (much more hoſtilely to reſiſt) the ſupream Authority,<note place="margin">

               </note> by poſitive precept, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.10. <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1.18. So it was to reſiſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. And certainly in States and Common-wealths, <hi>tam Pater Nemohe</hi> is <hi>Pater patriae,</hi> and all the civill power that was of old in Paternall Iuriſdiction, is now by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Common Agreement of the People placed in the ſupream power of a State, and the ſame obedience is due to it, and reſiſtance to it as unjuſtifiable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:95489:11"/>And ſuch as will indulge to the People, a freedome to reſume their firſt Original Power, grounded upon that Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, <hi>Omnis homo naſcitur liber,</hi> every man is born free, ſeduce them by ſo falſe a Principle, that the contrary of it is the truth, <hi>Nullus homo naſcitur liber,</hi> no man is born free. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was there ever yet in this world, anyone man born free. It is true, there was one man created free, our firſt father <hi>Adam,</hi> But all his Children, and all his Deſcent after him, were born under Paternall Iuriſdiction; Nay our bleſſed Saviour (ſpeaking of him as a Man, and Son to the bleſſed Virgin) was born under this Paternal Juriſdiction and fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Obedience, whereunto he ſubmitted himſelf as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet down Scripture, <hi>Luke</hi> the 2.51. where it is ſaid, <hi>He went with Joſeph and his Mother, and was ſubject unto them.</hi> Now this Paternal Juriſdiction, which was at firſt the ſole Soveraignty which governed the world, By reaſon of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in Parents, Oppreſſion by ſuch as were the ſtrongeſt, and a multitude of inconveniences and confuſions when the World was become numerous, and full of People, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very family become a Realm, As it was too narrow, ſo it grew to be ſo hurtful unto Mankind, That men were forced for their own preſervation, Common Juſtice, and comfort of life, to transfer this paternal Jurisdiction, (all but fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial and perſonal Duty of honoring and obeying Parents) into Magiſtracy, and willingly diveſted themſelves (for their own good) of that Native Libertie which they had before, And as the right power of Government is the ſame, which it was in paternall Iuriſdiction, only by the Conſent of the People changed into another hand: So the Obedience unto it ought to be the ſame, And the fifth Commandement of obeying Parents, is by all underſtood to extend unto the Magiſtrate, to whom the people having by conſent tranferred the power of paternal Jurisction, are likewiſe by Divine Precept bound to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and the People cannot ſtill retein unto themſelves, that, which by common conſent they have diveſted themſelves of, and transferred to others.

people had transferred all their power to the Emperour, they were not to reſiſt, And it was to thoſe Emperours, to whom our Saviour and his Apoſtles injoined Obedience, not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience ſake, and not unto the good only, but unto the froward.</p>

               <hi>David</hi> was purſued by <hi>Saul</hi> unjuſtly, his life ſought by him; yet his Conſcience check'd him when he had only cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.5, 6.

Nay, when he might have ſlain <hi>Saul,</hi> and he was deſired by <hi>Abiſhai</hi> that he might ſtrike him to the ground, he did not only forbid him, but called unto <hi>Abner,</hi> telling him he deſerved to die, that he had not more carefully kept and guarded his Maſter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16. which ſheweth, that not only not to hurt, but to preſerve, is our Duty. And truly, if I ſhould have lift up my hand, or drawn my Sword againſt the King, I fear I ſhould not have been ſo happy, as divers have been that have gone the other way, in finding out ſuch ſatisfactory Arguments or diſtinctions as would have rid or cured me of that horrour of Conſcience which would have made me moſt miſerable in the height of all proſperitie and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
            <p>All the whole context of the old Teſtament incite to the obedience, to the honouring, fearing and reverencing of the King; And all the Attempts that have been made upon the perſons of Kings, or their Government, are either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as wicked, or elſe were by the extraordinary and eſpecial Commandement of God, making uſe of wicked men to be the Executioners of his juſt Judgments; Beſides, the Government of the Jewiſh Commonwealth was a <hi>Theocratia,</hi> an immediate Government of God himſelf, and by the Conſent of all Divines, Gods extraordinary Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not to be made Rules or Patterns of ordinary Government.

The Caſes of <hi>Eglon, Zimri, Jehu,</hi> &amp;c. are juſtified by Gods being the Commander of them; and Sin is nothing but an Obliquitie from Gods will: But it is Gods revealed and declared Will which is to be our rule.

            <head>CHAP. IV. The Doctrine and Practice of the Primitive Church, of not reſiſting their Princes, notwithſtanding they were Heathens or Apoſtates.</head>
            <p>I Well know that the Authority of Scripture needeth not any humane or forein ſupport; But becauſe the Parties of ſeveral, yea, contrary wayes, will both pretend to have the Scriptures in their favour, and from them to draw the rule of their Conſciences alike, to me it ſeemed that nothing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:95489:14"/>
ought to be of greater Authority (under Scripture) or like rightly to interpret Scripture, than the unanimous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice of the Primitive times, and of thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and learned men, who as they were nearer to the times of our Saviour, and of the Apoſtles, and of thoſe Pen-men of God, ſo doubtleſs they ſaw by clearer light than we do now at a greater diſtance. And really by what I could e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read or be inſtructed in from others, I could never find any thing, either allowing or countenancing the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects taking Arms againſt their Soveraign, although it were in the higheſt and moſt bloody perſecution, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the worſt of Princes, many of them being Heathens, Tyrants and Apoſtates; And yet it was to theſe wicked Perſecutors, to whom our Saviout and his Apoſtles in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined Obedience; And the primitive Fathers practiſed it in their ſufferings and Martyrdoms.</p>
            <p>But I muſt confeſs I have met with a moſt untrue Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and moſt injurious to Chriſtian innocency. <hi>That the reaſon of the Chriſtians bearing ſo many wrongs and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, was, becauſe they had not then power and means to do otherwiſe, or right themſelves.</hi> The untruth of this Allega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will appear by the writings of thoſe Fathers whoſe profeſsion it was to bear and ſuffer,<note place="margin">

And many of their books are full of paſſages of this ſtrain.

But the truth is, That unto theſe Primitive men (treading in the ſteps of the Apoſtles) their ſufferings were their Glory, their Rejoycing, and their Advantage. And divers of the Fathers, by way of prevention (as it were) foreſeeing that this Scandal might be caſt upon their Innocency and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Patience (<hi>That it was want of means and power, and nor of will that they reſiſted not</hi>) do clearly declare, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Numbers, Armes,</hi> or <hi>Courage,</hi> were wanting to them wherewith they might defend themſelves; nor <hi>Injuries, Oppreſſions,</hi> and <hi>Perſecutions</hi> wanting that might provoke them thereunto: But it was the Example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſufferings, and their holy Doctrine and Precepts commanding Obedience, that ſuffered not their hands to fight againſt the Powers ordained by God over them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they uſed both hands and armes with remarkable Valour and Succeſs againſt the Enemies of their Princes, notwithſtanding the ſaid Princes were Heathen, and Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors of the Church of God.</p>
            <p>But this Doctrine of not Reſiſting, ſome of our new Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines (who cannot but acknowledge it to be both the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and practice of the Apoſtles and Primitive Times) do now ſay, <hi>That God was not then pleaſed to reveal the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Reſiſtance, But that Martyrdoms and ſufferings were the way, by which he thought it then ſit no plant the Church, which he is now pleaſed ſhould be protected by Reſiſtance, and enlarged by power.</hi> Wherein they have miſtaken the Text, For that, that Doctrine (inſtead of the Bible) is taken out of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> where <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſaith, <hi>That God had ſent Chriſt in the Spirit of meekneſs to eſtabliſh his Law: But now by him he would have his Law ſetled and eſtabliſhed by the power of the Sword and Conqueſt.</hi> And if prevailing or ſucceſs might ſtand for Arguments, it will be hard convincing this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan

Doctrine.</hi> But certainly the general and univerſa Tenent of all the Churches of Chriſtendom were, and I conceive are ſtill, <hi>That as Religion ought not to be planted by force or conſtraint: So Chriſtian Subjects ought not to make Religion the ground of their Reſiſtance or taking Armes againſt their Prince.</hi>

We are ready to expoſe our lives for the defence of our Kings, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whomſoever it be, although of our own Religion, And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould do otherwiſe, ſhould not defend Religion, but ſerve his own ambition, and would draw a great reproach upon the truth of the Goſpel.</hi>

            <p>The <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> eſpecially the Doctors of the <hi>Sorbons</hi> have written Volumes againſt it, and never fail to cenſure all books that maintain that Doctrine, to the fire. And the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> in their publiſhed Cenſure of the 4. of <hi>June</hi> 1610. declare, that <hi>Seditioſum, impium, &amp; hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticum est, quocunque quaeſito colore à quocunque Subdito, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallo aut Extraneo, ſacris Regum aut Principum perſonis vim habere, That it is a ſeditious, impious and heretical thing for any Subject, Vaſſal, or Foreiner, upon what pretence or colour ſoever, to offer violence to the ſacred perſons of Kings or Princes.</hi> So that both <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> declaring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, (that is, in the general received and approved Tenents and Opinions of their ſeveral Churches) of how little Authority ought the private Opinion of ſome few <hi>hot-headed Men</hi> to be, who (ſeeking to get themſelves a name by being the Authors of ſome new and bolder Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) ſhall upon their own fancies, or ſome witty or ſubtle Inferences and Deductions (contradict the unanimous and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95489:16"/>
univerſally received Opinions of all Chriſtian Churches, and the Practice and Examples of ſo many <hi>Holy Martyrs</hi> from the very times of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> even unto our days. Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his Book of <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> ſpecifieth many, even to their death, exhorting to Obedience to their Prince. I ſhall only ſet down one inſtance of many.</p>
            <p>Thoſe famous Sufferers in <hi>Queen Martes</hi> dayes, although the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> being newly planted, was likely by <hi>Perſecution</hi> to be extirpate, and that ſome more hot and zealous ſeemed to have an Inclination to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Religion by way of Force (for at that time their power was great) Twelve of the moſt eminent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them for Learning and Piety agreed to the ſetting forth a <hi>Declaration of their Faith and Doctrine,</hi> in which they ſet down their Hatred to any ſuch Inclination, and exhort with great earneſtneſs of Spirit, and beſeech in the bowels of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> all ſuch as fear God, to behave themſelves as obedient Subjects to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and to the <hi>Superiour Powers</hi> ordained of God under her, and rather (after their Example) to give their heads to the Block, than in any ſort to <hi>Rebell,</hi> or to <hi>Mutter</hi> againſt the <hi>Queen, the Lords a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed:</hi> And towards the end of this their <hi>Declaration,</hi> they renew their <hi>Exhortation,</hi> humbly praying all men <hi>to be in no point conſenting to any kind of Rebellion, or Sedition againſt the Queen, But where they cannot obey, but they muſt diſobey God, their to ſubmit themſelves with all patience and humility to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer as the Will and Pleaſure of the Higher Powers ſhould ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge, as they themſelves were ready to do, rather than to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any Doctrine contrary to that Confeſſion which they had made in the ſaid Declaration.</hi> And moſt of all theſe men ſealed this their Doctrine with their blood, being burnt in ſeveral places of the Kingdom, ſome in <hi>Smithfield,</hi> ſome at <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> ſome at <hi>Coventry,</hi> as is ſet down particularly in the ſaid Story, page. 1470. So that both the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholiques,</hi> in their publiſhed and avowed Doctrine, diſclaiming and cenſuring this Doctrine of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtile Reſiſtance</hi> as Impious and Heretical (as is aboveſaid) of what Authority can the private Opinions of a few men
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95489:16"/>
(condemned by their own Churches) be, for the ſetling and ſatisfying for any ſober and uningaged mans Conſcience; againſt the Doctrine and practice of the whole Chriſtian World and in all times? It is true, that a ſtrong fancie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any thing, makes us hardly to be perſwaded to it. But we eaſily believe that which we earneſtly wiſh. And it is as true, that all times have brought forth ſome great and able wits that have ever affected to be the Authors of new Opinions, and the Arch-Heretiques have ever been noted to have been Men of parts, though of ſtronger fancy than ſolid Judgement. Many of theſe new Men (if not all of them) have (by learned anſwers of particular men) been confuted, as well as by publique Cenſures been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, as Impious and hereticall; as <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi> by <hi>Baricane</hi> Dr. in Divinity and Canon of the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Tholouſe, Anno</hi> 1614. This <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi> is an aſſumed and counterfeited name, the author of it (as it ſhould ſeem) being unwilling to avow the Doctrine, and was publiſhed firſt in <hi>Latin,</hi> and afterwards ſet out in <hi>French Anno</hi> 1611. by <hi>Lewis Mayerne Turquet.</hi> It laid the ground of ſuch Maxims and Tenents, as the Authors that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten againſt them do not content themſelves with ſhew<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing their Opinions to be falſe and erroneous, but they in veigh againſt them as deteſtable and execrable. And i is far from my Intention, in this Diſcourſe, the ſcope wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is only to ſet down faithfully mine own proceeding in matters of Fact, and in matters of Opinion to ſhew thoſe Grounds and Reaſons which have deterred my private conſcience from having any part in lifting up my hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the King,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Admitting all the Poſitions either by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants or Papiſts were true, which allow Subjects to take Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their Princes, yet they agree not with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe.</hi>

Thus far I have, and ſhall make uſe of them, which is to ſhew, That (admitting all their bold and new Poſitions were true, I ſay, <hi>poſito non conceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,</hi>) yet by their own Maxims and Principles I could find nothing that could warrant me in point of Conſcience to <hi>Hoſtile Reſiſtance,</hi> for that the matter of Fact in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:95489:17"/>
Caſe, neither is, nor can be, with any truth or colour of truth applicable to their Tenents and Poſitions, which I ſhall endeavour to make clear by that which followeth.</p>
            <p>All the Roman Catholiques which have written in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of reſiſting Princes in ſome Caſes, lay for their ground a ſuppoſed <hi>Supremacy</hi> in the <hi>Pope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Shewing that the Tenents of Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques are not applicable to the preſent Caſe.</hi>
               </note> in matters ſpiritual, and thereby erect a ſuperior Juriſdiction over <hi>Princes,</hi> which muſt of neceſſity be preſuppoſed, before they can pretend to <hi>cenſure</hi> or <hi>puniſh</hi>: for <hi>par in parem non habet imperium,</hi> and that is the true and unanſwerable Reaſon why Kings cannot be puniſhed but only by <hi>God,</hi> becauſe there is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them no other ſuperiour Juriſdiction on earth; but the <hi>Pope</hi> pretendeth over all Chriſtian <hi>Princes,</hi> aſwell as other Men, a direct ſuperiour Iuriſdiction, <hi>in ſpiritualibus, in matters ſpiritual,</hi> and an indirect Power, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia, in temporalibus, in matters temporal.</hi> And upon this ground, the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> affirm, That in ſuch caſes, viz. <hi>If they be Heretiques with obſtinacy, Perſecutors of the Church of God, Incorrigibly Diſobedient, or Apoſtates, The Pope may then (ſay they) diſcharge their Subjects of their Obedience, and they may lawfully reſiſt their Soveraign.</hi> But this Tenent is to me, and to all other <hi>Protestants of England,</hi> of no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, who eject this Doctrin as erroneous, and have ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſworn the Contrary. But that is not the point that is now to be proved, my Aſſertion being, That (admitting this their Tenent were true) yet it is no way applicable to the Kings preſent Caſe in matter of Fact: For thoſe that give unto the <hi>Pope,</hi> power of cenſuring and puniſhing of <hi>Kings,</hi> firſt preſuppoſe the Crimes of <hi>Apoſtacy, Hereſie, Perſecution, &amp;c.</hi> and them to be duly and ſufficiently proved, There muſt go out <hi>Citations</hi> to the party ſuppoſed to be the <hi>Delinquent,</hi> there muſt be <hi>Hearing, Conviction,</hi> and <hi>Sentence.</hi> Further, before any execution of Sentence, there muſt be Admonition, and a <hi>Return of Obſtinacy,</hi> And after this there doth precede <hi>Excommunication</hi> before <hi>Depoſition</hi> or <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of power to any other,</hi> either to execute the <hi>Sentence,</hi> or to diſcharge Subjects of their <hi>Obedience.</hi> And this will be ſeen in all their Writings, and in their Practices, and particularly in the Caſe of the King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> But
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95489:17"/>
it is impertinent to inſiſt further thereon, and to fight againſt the Air, when no man will have the Folly or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to attempt the application to our preſent Caſe. The uſe that I only make thereof, is, to aſsert what I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly ſaid, That (admitting the falſe poſitions of the <hi>new Doctors</hi> that have written in favour of Subjects making Hoſtile Reſiſtance againſt their <hi>Prince</hi> were true) yet the preſent Caſe againſt the <hi>King</hi> can neither be juſtified or maintained by any of their Principles.</p>
            <p>Having inſtanced with thoſe of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, I ſhall examine the Tenents and Principles of other Profeſſions, though I know not in what Church Communion to place them, ſince no <hi>Proteſtant</hi> or <hi>reformed Church</hi> doth avow, (as before is ſhewed) their Principles. And becauſe <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Brutus,</hi> is, as it were, the Ground-work and Text of all theſe new Opinions, I ſhall faithfully ſet down what his Opinions and Tenents are, And how they are appliable to the preſent Caſe. He is forced as well as the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> to Conſtitute a Superior Juriſdiction above <hi>Kings</hi> (for hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they both agree) which as they place it in the <hi>Pope,</hi> ſo he placeth it in the people, deriving the power of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces originally from them, and from that Maxime of <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid efficit tale est magistale,</hi> he maketh the People above the King, and that although the King be <hi>Major ſingulis,</hi> he is <hi>Minor univerſis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having laid this as his Foundation he deſcended to ſet down upon what kind of Soveraigns, and in what Caſes this their Power may be lawfully exerciſed, which he ſaith may be only againſt <hi>Tyrants</hi>; of which he ſaith there are two ſorts; <hi>Tyrants of Uſurpation</hi> without any juſt Title,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Sheweth that the opinions of ſuch Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants as allow in ſome caſes of ſubjects ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of arms againſt their Prince, if they were true, yet are not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the preſent caſe.</hi>
               </note> and <hi>Tyrants in Government,</hi> which (although they may have a juſt Title) yet they become Tyrants in <hi>Regimine, Tyrants in point of their government.</hi> For his firſt ſort of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> it will be impertinent to ſpeak of them, for that all men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Kings Title to be juſt, and we have all ſworn it, and ſubmitted unto it as our Anceſtors have done unto his Anceſtors, by the ſpace of many hundreds of years, So have we particularly unto himſelf for the ſpace of theſe twenty years and more. But for his
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95489:18"/>
ſecond ſort of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> who from legitimate and rightfull Princes, become Tyrants by their wicked and lawleſſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and thereby (in his opinion) make the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects taking of arms againſt them lawfull, and juſtfiable, The beſt way to apply his Doctrine unto this Caſe, is, to ſet down in his own words whom he would have to be ſo qualified and conditioned, as may be eſteemed ſuch a <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,</hi> and ſo conſequently (by his Doctrine) may be hoſtilely reſiſted: his words are, <hi>If a Prince of deliberate purpoſe do ruine the State; If audaciouſlie he overthroweth all Laws and Duties; If he no waies care to keep his faith; If he have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to Convention, Juſtice or pietie. If he be an Enemie to his Subjects; briefly, If he practiſe all theſe wickedneſſes which we have specified, or the principal of them, Then certainlie he may be judged a Tyrant, that is to ſay, an Enemie to God and Man. So that the queſtion is not here of the Prince that is none of the beſt, nor of the wiſeſt, nor of one that doth the beſt Juſtice, nor of the moſt valiant, But of a Prince that is most Wicked, Malicious and Treacherous, a Contemner of the Laws, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy of the People, and Deſtroyer of the Realm.</hi> And in the Page before, he ſaith, <hi>We muſt not expect to have Princes in whom there is no fault to be found, but rather eſteem that all goeth well with us, if thoſe that govern us are midlinglie good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now although the Doctrine be wicked and falſe (for if any ſuch <hi>Chimera</hi> or <hi>Fantaſm</hi> as he hath made his Tyrant, were to be found, The People ought not (<hi>quocunque quae ſito colore, upon no pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>se whatſoever</hi> to take arms againſt their lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign) yet (taking it for good and Orthodox Divinity) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there needeth no other Argument but the reciting of his <hi>Tyrant</hi> to make good my <hi>Aſſertion</hi> that the Caſe would no way concern the King. But the Wickedneſſe, Malice and Danger of this Tenent (beſides the falſeneſs of ir) is, That (having once conſtituted a Poſition, <hi>That by the people the Prince may be hoſtilelie reſisted in ſuch and ſuch Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and <hi>being in ſuch and ſuch a degree wicked, and the people likewiſe therof to be the Judges</hi>) there is a latitude left to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Sect,</hi> to every mans <hi>Paſsion,</hi> or to every mans <hi>Intereſt</hi> to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95489:18"/>
               <hi>fancy</hi> to himſelf, that what diſliketh him, is <hi>Impiety, Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie,</hi> or <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> And to judge of the meaſure of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wickedneſs; or if he be not wicked enough, yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him by way of prevention, leſt he ſhould become ſuch: For he ſaith not long after, <hi>That Tyranny is like an Hectique Feaver, which at the beginning is eaſie to cure, but hard to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; but afterward is eaſily known, but is become incurable, and therefore muſt be timely prevented.</hi> But leaving the <hi>wickedneſs, danger,</hi> and <hi>falſeneſſe</hi> of this Doctrine to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered of (admitting it were good and true, as is before ſaid) let us examin how it is applicable to our preſent Caſe. He ſuppoſeth his <hi>Tyrant to be an Enemy to God and Man, with ſo many other Attributes of wickedneſs and impiety,</hi> That <hi>Nero, Caligula, Domitian, Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apoſtate, Phala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> may well be ranked in his middle number of Princes, that were not of the worſt, And I conceive that <hi>Treaſon</hi> and <hi>Malice</hi> it ſelf will abhor the applicarion, in any ſort, of his deſcription of a <hi>Tyrant</hi> unto the <hi>King,</hi> and ſo conſequently of this new Doctrine, to our preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p>For my ſelf, I muſt avow it, that by what I have read in the above-cited Author, in <hi>Buchanan,</hi> in <hi>Suarez</hi> and <hi>Maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and what our Countryman Biſhop <hi>Bilſon</hi> hath written, I was much confirmed in my Opinion of the unlawfulneſs of taking Armes againſt the King: <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Exceptio fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat Regulam in non excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis.</hi>
               </note> For <hi>all rules with Exception confirm in all things but in the things excepted.</hi> And all theſe Authors write with great ſtrength, againſt Reſiſtance and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Armes againſt the Prinre, but only in the Caſe of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,</hi> and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in caſe of the Popes depoſing of them; The latter whereof (neither being, nor admitted if it were) I ſhall lay aſide, And ſhall only ſhew how far the King is from any of theſe Wickedneſſes and Impieties, of which they compoſe their Tyrant.</p>
            <p>I well know that Kings are Men made of the ſame Paſte of fleſh and blood with others, and ſubject to the ſame weakneſſes, and to the ſame paſſions, And (as <hi>Brutus</hi> ſaith) our reaſon can no more be ſevered from our ſaid paſſions and infirmities, than the ſoul can be from the Body, whilſt the man is yet living, And thereupon ſaith, <hi>We muſt not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95489:19"/>
to have Princes againſt whom nothing can be ſaid, but we must think that all goeth well with us, if they be, moyennement bons, Middlingly good.</hi> And <hi>Commines</hi> ſaith, <hi>That a Prince whoſe virtues exceed his vices, ought to be eſteemed and ſtiled a good Prince.</hi> And of Princes it is a good rule, <hi>Optimus eſt qui minimis urgetur, He is beſt that hath the feweſt faults</hi>; for ſome faults, being Men, they will all have. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whoſoever ſhall rightly know the King, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his irreprovable Courſe of life, his conſtant and dayly practice of devotions of Piety, will not deny him the Title of a <hi>right good Prince,</hi> And ſo (notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his misfortunes, and the unſucceſsfullneſs of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs) he will be eſteemed when he ſhall be rightly known, and conſidered without prejudice, as he is unto me, by reaſon of my long and near attendance about his Perſon, and of whom I will be bold to ſay without flattery, That (having by the ſpace of almoſt Forty years been converſant in moſt of the Courts of the <hi>Princes of Chriſtendom,</hi> as a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Miniſter, and been no uncurious obſerver of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portments of the <hi>Princes</hi> of my time) I never knew any Prince, or ſcarcely any private man, in whoſe life there hath been leſs reproveable: And what is here ſaid, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive will be abundantly ſufficient to ſhew, that, if this new Doctrine of <hi>hostile Reſiſtance</hi> were admitted for good, it would in no kind juſtifie it in this preſent Caſe; It being only applicable to the worſt of men, when here it muſt be made uſe of, againſt an <hi>exemplary good Man,</hi> and who may be juſtly numbred amongſt the <hi>beſt of Princes,</hi> As I doubt not but it will clearly appear, when the truth of many things which have been ſuggeſted againſt him, ſhall be faithfully ſet down, As there will be occaſion to do in the following Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>And ſo I ſhall paſs to the next religious Obligation, whereby my Conſcience hath been reſtrained from taking armes againſt the King, which is the ſacred Tye of the late <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and of ſo many ſolemn <hi>Oaths,</hi> whereby I have engaged my ſelf before God <hi>to bear him true Faith, and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageance, and to defend his Perſon, and all his just Rights and Dignities.</hi>

            <p>IT will be eaſily aſſented unto by all ſorts of Chriſtians, that Solemn Oaths eſtabliſhed by lawful Authority, and legally adminiſtred, and in a matter that is not <hi>Malum in ſe, abſolutely wicked,</hi> are the higheſt and ſtrongeſt Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that can paſs from Man to God, from Nation to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from Subjects to their Prince, or Prince to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or from Man to Man, And this is not only ſo declared in Scripture, but was undoubtedly part of that Natural and Moral Law which was by God planted in the heart of Man even from the Creation. For we find it in practice before any written Law, and by all Nations, Heathens and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civiliz'd, and altogether ignorant of the Precepts, either of the old or new Teſtament: yet by the light of Nature,<note place="margin">

            <p>Now the Oaths that I and the reſt of the Kings Subjects have taken unto him <hi>for the ſerving of him with Loyalty, with true Faith and Alleageance, for the Adhering to him againſt all Perſons, for the defending of his Royal Perſon, for the Maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Upholding of all Rights, Dignities and Prerogatives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him or annexed to his Imperial Crown,</hi> will be clearly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt expreſt, by ſetting down the Oaths themſelves <hi>in termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> which ſhal be annexed hereunto, for not interrupting too long the ſeries of this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Beſides the Oaths formerly eſtabliſhed by Law, at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Parliament, There was a ſolemn <hi>Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> propounded by the Houſes of Parliament, to be taken by themſelves, and ſo through the whole Kingdom, And was allowed of by the King; And this <hi>Proteſtation</hi> was by my ſelf taken in the Houſe of Peers and ſubſcribed by me,

            <p>It is further to be obſerveed, That beſides the legal pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties that may be injoyned for the refuſing or breaking of rheſe Oaths, they contain ſomething further than tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Puniſhment can reach unto, they carry with them, <hi>The heavy Iudgement of God declared in Scripture againſt the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of ſolemn Oathes</hi>; And in this Caſe, there is yet much more added, for we accompany the breach of them <hi>with the moſt horrid and fearfull Execration that any Chriſtians can draw upon themſelves, renouncing the Help and Protection of God Almighty, and the Benefit of our Reemption contained in the Holy Goſpel, if we fail in the performance of them</hi>; which I underſtand to be <hi>quantum in nobis eſt, if we do not indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to do the utmoſt in our power to keep them.</hi> But volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily for Fear or Intereſt, not only to break them, but to do that, which by the very plain words, is contrary to the ſaid Oaths, and is contrary to that ſence in which I took them, (as I underſtand the taking of armes againſt the King to be) with many other things of neceſſity following thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

            <head>CHAP. VI. Setting down the unlawfulneſs of Hoſtile Reſiſtance drawn from Humane Laws.</head>
            <p>HAving thus ſet down thoſe Reaſons which deterred my Conſcience from making <hi>Hostile Reſiſtance</hi> unto the <hi>King,</hi> which have been deduced out of the Word of God, the Doctrine and Practice of holy Men, and the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſacred Oaths, I ſhall now propoſe my Scruples drawn from humane Laws, but eſpecially from the Laws of our Kingdom.</p>
            <p>By the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> many things were Treaſon; But becauſe the Common Law is not compoſed in one intire body or Text, and it was difficult for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned and Lay-People to inform themſelves exactly and diſtinctly what was Treaſon, and what was not, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the King, and the wiſedom of the Parliament, in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. was ſuch, that for the avoiding of the inſnaring of the People in ſo high a Penalty and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction as followeth the being convicted of Treaſon, It was thought fit that all thoſe things which for the future ſhould be eſteemed or adjudged Treaſon, ſhould be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and diſtinctly ſet down in one Law, and excluſively to all things elſe; which was accordingly done in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. And in caſe it ſhould ſo fall out, that any matter ſhould ariſe, beſides thoſe particulars ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſaid Statute, No judgement ſhould paſſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but it ſhould be reſerved till the next Parliament, But for thoſe Caſes in the ſaid Statute expreſſed they were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be <hi>Treaſon,</hi> and ſo to be adjudged by the ordinary courſe of Iuſtice.</p>
            <p>And in regard that in the troubleſome and diſorderly time of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. the prevailing party (which ſtill ſwayed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95489:21"/>
the Parliament) had made and unmade many ſeveral Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as ſuited to the Deſigns and Intereſts of thoſe that had the Power: In the firſt year of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 4. all thoſe new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprung-up Treaſons were revoked and aboliſhed, and Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon again reduced to the Statute of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. The like inconveniences growing in the Wars betwixt the Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and afterwards by the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. who upon the alterations he had made in Religion, had ſo inſnared the Subject that the <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> of the reformed Religion could not (by reaſon of the ſix Atticles) eſcape the Fire, nor the <hi>Roman Catholiques</hi> (by reaſon of the Oath of Supremacy) the Halter; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it was again deſired by the Houſes, that <hi>Treaſon</hi> might be reduced into a certainty, according to the Statute of the 25 of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. which was accordingly ſo enacted the 2. of <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Ma.</hi> And all theſe three Statutes, 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

they had loſt the day, if the Accuſed ſhould be acquitted) ſtretch the litteral Text beyond what it can rationally or honeſtly bear, and ſpeaking (as they ſay) for the King, no man dares reprove or reſtrain them. But to ſuppoſe that any Allegation of Conſcience, or the Opinion of learned Authors (nay if it were Texts out of Scripture againſt the explicite letter of the Law, would be heard or admitted) were a great Ignorance. But he would be told, as I know ſome have been, That all other things were <hi>Matters dehors, Nothing to the purpoſe</hi>; The iſſue was only <hi>factum</hi> or <hi>non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum,</hi> And truly wofull experience had taught me to be wary in humane prudence, not to imbarque my ſelf in a Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs wherin my Conſcience was not only altogether unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but if I ſhould ever be brought to a legal Tryal upon it, mine own Judgment told me, I could have nothing to ſay in mine own Defence of Juſtification; or that could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my Self and Poſterity from total Ruine and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction but Prevailing and Victory. Which at the moſt, could but <hi>protect,</hi> but could not make a bad Cauſe good.</p>
            <p>But beſides humane Prudence and fear of Puniſhment, there is a Conſcientious Tye of <hi>obeying the Law,</hi> we being taught to <hi>obey, not only for wrath but for Conſcience ſake.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That if there had been no Law, there had been no ſinne</hi>;<note place="margin">
                  <hi>If all ſin be the tranſgreſſion of ſome Law, I would be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied how men are become De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents that have tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt no law.</hi>
               </note> which ſheweth, That the <hi>breaking</hi> of juſt Laws and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally eſtabliſhed, is <hi>ſin.</hi> For the ſupream Powers therein are chiefly diſobeyed who are ſuppoſed to command more Authoritatively by their <hi>Laws,</hi> than by their <hi>Verbal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, as the Laws are ſo poſitive againſt <hi>Reſistance</hi> and <hi>taking Arms againſt the King</hi>: ſo likewiſe have the Laws been as carefull to <hi>Protect</hi> and thereby to <hi>Incourage</hi> the Subject to adhore unto their King: for it is provided by the Stat. 11 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. Cap. 1. <hi>That from henceforth no manner of perſon or perſons whatſoever he or they be that attend upon the King and Soveraign Lord of this Land for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his Perſon, and do him true and faithfull ſervice of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gience in the ſame, or be in other places by his Commandement in his Wars within this Land or without: That for the ſaid deed

true duty of Allegeance he or they be no wiſe Convict or Attaint of high Treaſon, nor of other offences for that Cauſe, by Act of Parliament, or otherwiſe, by any Proceſs of Law, whereby he or any of them ſhall loſe or forfeit Life, Land, Tenements, Rents, Poſſeſſions, Hereditaments, Goods, Chattels, or any other things, but to be for that deed and ſervice utterly diſcharged of any Vexation, Trouble or Loſſe. And if any Act or Acts, or other Proceſs of the Law, hereafter thereupon for the ſame happen to be made contrary to this Ordinance, That then that Act or Acts, or other Proceſs of the Law, whatſoever they ſhall be, ſtand and be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly void. Provided alwaies That no Perſon or Perſons, ſhall take any benefit or advantage by this Ast, which ſhall hereafter decline from his or their ſaid Allegeance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if they that have ſerved the King with Fidelity according to the Law, ſhall by their prevailing fellow-Subjects be <hi>attainted,</hi> and their Eſtates <hi>forfeited</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> of at their pleaſure, It muſt be by ſome ſuch <hi>Tranſcendent Power,</hi> as muſt be above all Laws: For as by the Law, <hi>no Subject ought either to be attainted, or loſe his Eſtate, for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the King in his Wars</hi>; ſo can no Confiſcations, by the Law belong to any, but unto the King, or ſuch as derive their Right from him. It is true, in the Heat and Conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of War, it is uſual, that whatſoever Goods or Wealth, the ſouldier can lay hands upon, is (<hi>de facto</hi>) eſteemed good Purchaſe; But after the War is ended, the Law uſeth then to recover her Force. And ſetled Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances in all former Civill Wars in <hi>England,</hi> have never been diſpoſed of by the Arbitrary Power of the prevailing Party, although they were <hi>Kings</hi> claiming the Crown by Title and might have Right to Confiſcations, but by legal Convictions and due courſe of Law; much more in the Caſe of <hi>Subjects taking Arms againſt their King,</hi> which is alwaies (in the beginning) ſtiled and proclaimed <hi>Rebellion,</hi> by the King that they <hi>Oppoſe,</hi> untill Succeſs or Treaty qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie that Name, That they ſhould not content themſelves with a General Pardon, and Act of Oblivion, and the ſettlement of the Government for the future, to their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Content and Security for themſelves, and their

Eſtates, But that Inheritances muſt be <hi>confiſcated</hi> and <hi>diſpoſed</hi> of by them, and ſuch perſons as they ſhall pleaſe, without legal Tryal, and as it were by <hi>Proſcription</hi> or <hi>Decimation,</hi> be by a Vote deſigned to <hi>loſs of Life and Eſtate without Pardon or Mercy</hi>; What greater Cruelty could have been uſed towards them, if they had faln into the hands of the <hi>Turk</hi> or moſt mercileſs Conquerour? eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if it ſhall be conſidered, that in this Caſe no Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality could be admitted, nor the moſt peaceable-minded man avoid the being ingaged. For as by the Law it is <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to take Armes againſt the King,</hi> by the above-recited Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, ſo by the Statute of the 19 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>It is loſs of all Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Castles, Lordſhips, Mannors, Lands, Tenements,</hi> and <hi>other Hereditaments, &amp;c. not to take Armes for the King, and not to follow him in his Wars againſt his Enemies or his Rebels</hi>; which the Subject (<hi>de bene eſſe</hi>) is to underſtand to be ſuch as the King proclaimeth to be <hi>Traitors</hi>; Not that a <hi>Proclamation</hi> maketh them ſo; but the Subject is ſo to eſteem them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they be brought to a legal Tryal.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. The Motives deduced from Honour, Honeſty and Gratitude of not forſaking the King in his troubles.</head>
            <p>BEſides the Obligation formerly ſet down, deduced from the Law of God, and the poſitive Law of the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95489:23"/>
Kingdom, there is a third Law, which hath a great Autho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rity in the hearts of all generous and noble-minded Men, which is the Law of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Gratitude,</hi> which Law I conceive to be a Branch of the Original and firſt Law, <hi>The Law of Nature</hi>; For it hath had and ſtill holdeth a Value and Reverence through all Religions, as it hath done through all times.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs this Law hath been, and is in ſome kinds too high lifted up, and is become the <hi>Idol</hi> of many mens fancies, who pay unto it a more exact Obedience, and are more carefull not to tranſgreſs againſt it, than they are not to offend God, or the Laws they live under, whereof we have daily too many Preſidents, when men rather than to be failing in point of Honour, will upon frivolous provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, decline all duties to God and Man, and ſacrifice to this <hi>Idol</hi> oftentimes the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes, together with their Souls: But this is an Exceſs and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcency of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Courage,</hi> in the juſtification where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I know nothing that can be ſaid; In the excuſe of it, it is to be hoped, that in ſo generally-received an Error, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men become Infamous, and ſcarce fit for honeſt compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that comply not therein, Cuſtom and Univerſallity may allay and mitigate the Offence: But that Honour which I ſpeak of, is better expreſt by plain <hi>moral Honesty</hi> and <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> when neither Fear nor Diſadvantage ſhall drive us or withold us from juſt Duties; nor the Misfortunes or Diſtreſſes of thoſe to whom we have had former obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, make us leave and forſake to be aſſiſtant and ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto them in all juſt and lawfull things, although it be to our own Hinderance, or that we can expect no further good or advantage by them. And herein my Caſe is diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the common Caſes of Subjects, being more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly bound unto <hi>Gratitude</hi> by many Benefits; and unto <hi>Honeſty, Affection,</hi> and <hi>Fidelity</hi> by my Service in places of greateſt Truſt about the King, both for nearneſs to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, and as a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant conſided in as a privy Counſellour.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> it hath been at all times ſo deteſtable,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95489:24"/>
That to the Reproach of being ingratefull, nothing can be added. And the <hi>betraying</hi> or <hi>forſaking</hi> of a mans Maſter in his Diſtreſs, hath ſo great a Relliſh of the <hi>Judas,</hi> that no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and generous Heart, would for any earthly Reſpect, do any thing that might ſeem to be like it, or be in hazard of being miſtaken for it. For mine own part, I do ingenuouſly confeſs; that, had I no Precepts of the Law of God, no Tyes by the Law of the Kingdom, nor Horrour of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence for breaking thoſe ſacred Obligations into which I was entred, by taking ſo many ſolemn Oaths; Yet <hi>Gratitude</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> ſingly ſhould have been unto me of ſo high Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, That no Reſpect of my <hi>Life, Fortunes,</hi> or <hi>Poſterity,</hi> ſhould have made me lift up my Hand againſt my King, or to have forſaken my Maſter in his Miſeries and Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>I have had the Honour to have ſerved this King and his Father by the ſpace of more than forty years, and was by his Father, from a younger Brother of a Gentlemans Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, raiſed by his Goodneſs (above my Merit) to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of an <hi>Earl,</hi> and a Conveniency of Subſiſtance in that Quality. I was truſted by him in ſeven Ambaſſages, and called to his privie Counſel, recommended unto the Prince his Son, as a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, and (which was above all theſe Obligations) I was admitted to more than an ordinary meaſure of his Truſt and Confidence. And certainly theſe great Obligations from the Father could not but imprint <hi>Gratitude</hi> in my Heart towards the Son, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially He being now become my King and Maſter, And ſo by all the Oaths that I had taken to the Father, I was likewiſe by him obliged to them as his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</p>
            <p>But beſides theſe Tyes of <hi>Gratitude,</hi> I muſt Proteſt, that weighing and conſidering impartially the Kings Actions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as they relate to his Government as a King, or his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Deportments as a Man (ſetting Conſcience aſide, and that I had not been thereby reſtrained) I could never find any thing that could ſatisfie my judgement in point of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Juſtice or right Reaſon for <hi>the taking Arms against him.</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95489:24"/>

               </gap> ill done by the Kings Miniſters, and the Subjects Propriety and Liberry might have run great hazard under an ill Prince, by thoſe waies that were then ſet on foot. For to ſpeak free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my ſenſe, by the Principles then received, all was put into the Kings hands; for Neceſſity was made Maſter of all, and of that Neceſſity the King was made the ſole Judge, (and Princes may eaſily miſtake their own private Wants for publique Neceſſity) But from this Exceſs, little of the fault can with Reaſon be charged upon the King, and leſs ground for the taking of Arms; For it is well known, (the King having been unſeaſonably imbarqued in War both with <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>) his Treaſure was wholly exhauſt, and he was reduced to great ſtreights. The King called divers Parliaments, but they proved ſo unhappy, that two or three of them were diſſolved in great diſorder, and the Kings Wants were not <hi>relieved,</hi> but the King and his People part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with little ſatisfaction on either ſide. The King then being enforced to uſe all indeavours for his Relief in theſe his great VVants, conſulted with the Officers of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venew, and his learned Councel, what courſe was to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for his Supply without calling a Parliament, For it had been voted at the Councel-Table, That the Calling of a Parliament was not then fit or ſeaſonable. And at the breaking off of the laſt Parliament before this, <hi>An.</hi> 1640. It had been declared by ſome of the Kings Miniſters in the Houſe of Commons, <hi>That if the King were not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by Parliament, he muſt and would betake himſelf to new Counſells,</hi> The plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> whereof was underſtood to be, That the King would find out ſome other Courſe for his ſupplies, without making uſe of his People in Parliament. And this Opinion that Parliaments would for ſome time be laid aſide, gave Boldneſs and Incouragements to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters and Projectors to ſet on foot many <hi>Monopolies</hi> and <hi>Projects,</hi> which were ſtill countenanced by the colour and pretence of Law; And amongſt the reſt, and indeed ſtriking at the <hi>Root</hi> of the Subjects Propriety, was that of the <hi>Ship-mony</hi> brought forth. <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>In what ſort the Project of the Ship-mony was ſet on foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fault wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of cannot with any Iuſtice be attributed to the King.</hi>
               </note> And the Attorney <hi>Noy</hi> hath the

He was in his time held to have been a great <hi>Oracle of the Law,</hi> and had been in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Parliaments a great <hi>Patriot and Propugner of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Liberty,</hi> and his Opinion was of <hi>high Authority</hi> in point of Law with the King and with all Men: He aſſured the King, that there might be means found out of the Kings own (eſpecially in times of Neceſſity) for him to ſupply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf juſtly, and according to the Law, And ſo propoundeth this Project of the <hi>Ship-mony.</hi> The King relyed not upon the ſingle Opinion of his Attorny, But as a good Prince ought to do, He took the further Advice of the <hi>Judges</hi> who are his proper Counſel in matters of the Law, and with whom he ought to Conſult, And they are ſworn to <hi>Counſell him faithfully,</hi> The Major part of them, which involveth the reſt, approved this Project as legal, But the King would not content himſelf with their <hi>Verbal Advice,</hi> But required the then <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice</hi> and the <hi>Judges</hi> to ſet down the Caſe, and their Opinions of it under their hands, which they did accordingly. So that it being to be preſuppoſed that the King (mote than in the points of adminiſtring Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice) cannot have a diſtinct knowledge, either of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of his own Prerogative, or the abſtruſe Caſes of the Law, In a point ſo much concerning him, as the relieving of him in his great wants by ways avowed to him to be <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>legal,</hi> what more upright or prudent Courſe could a Prince take, than to be adviſed (not by young Men, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites at Court) but by his <hi>learned Counſell,</hi> and his <hi>grave Judges,</hi> ſworn to adviſe him faithfully according to their beſt skill, who if they have behaved themſelves wickedly or corruptly, upon their heads let Judgement light, But let the King and his Throne be free. But many Men conceiving (and not without Reaſon) That this private and extra judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Opinion of the Judges, was not to be a <hi>binding Rule,</hi> did not <hi>acquieſce</hi> therin, but did <hi>refuſe</hi> the Payment of the <hi>Ship-mony,</hi> and did indeavour to defend this their <hi>refuſal</hi> by a due and legal way of Proceſs, and particularly Mr. <hi>John Hamden.</hi> And the Buſineſs was brought to an Iſſue, and to a publique Tryal in the <hi>Exchequer-Chamber,</hi> which is
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:95489:25"/>
the higheſt and ſupremeſt Judicature (under the Parliament) which the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> knoweth in point of Law; for it is a Court compoſed of all the Judges of the ſeveral Tribunals, for the ending of ſuch difficult and dubious Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as have not been formerly over-ruled, or wherein there is found a difference in Opinion amongſt the Iudges them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; And herein the Counſell on both ſides, whether the Caſe be betwixt Party and Party, or the King and Subject, do not only <hi>plead,</hi> but <hi>argue</hi> the Caſe in Law, and the Iudges do commonly before they give Sentence, <hi>argue</hi> themſelves the Caſe, in point of the learning of the Law, All which ſolemnities paſſed in this Caſe, without any interruption by the King; And after divers daies <hi>hearing</hi> and <hi>arguing,</hi> Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed for the King by Plurality of Votes, for the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Votes are involved in the Iudgment of the Major part, as there is a Neceſſity they ſhould be in all Counſells and Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catures, otherwiſe Controverſies could not be ended, unleſs there were an unanimous Agreement in all that had Votes, which ſeldom happeneth. But in this Caſe three parts of fow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Agreed in the Iudgment for the King; So that if the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges have erred now in Iudicature, being ſworn <hi>to do equal Juſtice betwixt the King and the Subject,</hi> as they did before in their Advice unto the King, being ſworn <hi>to Counſell him faithfully,</hi> the greater is their fault and Offence; But I muſt confeſs I am not able to ſet out the Kings Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>This Caſe yet paſſed further, For it being brought into the Parliament by way of Grievance, the Iudgement was not only <hi>reverſed,</hi> all Records <hi>burnt,</hi> and all Courſes <hi>given way unto</hi> by the King, which the Houſes themſelves could think on, That no ſuch Exceſſe might be attempted again in future times: But the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> and the <hi>Iudges</hi> were (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Interpoſition of the King) left unto the Juſtice of the Parliament, And the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> and divers of them, were by the Houſe of Commons impeached of <hi>high Treaſon</hi>; So the King <hi>having no hand</hi> in the ſetting it on foot, nor in the erroneous Iudgement, nor <hi>having protected</hi> the Parties cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable from Puniſhment, But the Grievance being <hi>redreſſed,</hi> and ſufficient Caution and Proviſion aſſented unto by the

King, for the <hi>preventing</hi> of the like for the future, I could not deduce from hence any Argument of the Kings intention <hi>to ſubvert the Law,</hi> or of any juſtifiable ground of <hi>taking arms againſt him.</hi>

            <head>CHAP. VIII. A Vindication of the King againſt that falſe and injurious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperſion of unſettledneſs in his Religion.</head>
            <p>THe ſecond main and important point that hath been made uſe of to the Kings Diſadvantage, and by which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:95489:26"/>
the Hearts of the People have been moſt alienated from him was chiefly by ill informed Miniſters in the Pulpit, who have moſt untruly ſuggeſted an unfirmneſs and unſettledneſs in the King in point of his Religion, and an inclination in him to overthrow the <hi>true reformed Proteſtant Religion</hi> eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Laws of the Kingdom, and to introduce <hi>Popery.</hi> This I muſt confeſs was ſo far from planting in me any thing to the Kings Prejudice, That by ſo much the more it confirmed me in my Duty and Affection towards the King, by how much of mine own knowledge this wicked Aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>injurious:</hi> For in that point of the Kings Religion, few men living had the Cauſe, or could have the means to be ſo perfectly informed of it as my ſelf. For beſides that from his Youth upward I had been an eye-witneſs of his <hi>Education,</hi> being in the King his Fathers time admitted as a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber, I was for divers years imployed in the Treaty of a Mariage for him, with a <hi>Princeſs,</hi> of a differing Religion, And was to that purpoſe his Fathers Ambaſſador in <hi>Spain,</hi> when the King (then Prince) arrived there in Perſon, And it is true that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had conceived great hopes of his becomming a <hi>Romiſh Catholique</hi> (wherein there wanted not incouragement both from divers in <hi>England</hi> and from ſome about him) and for the effecting of it, there was no induſtry omitted by them, but the learnedſt men in <hi>Spain</hi> were imployed to ſatisfie him; And he was by <hi>Artifice</hi> brought to ſet a Conference with the ſaid Divines upon Tearms of great Diſadvantage: For one <hi>Wadeſworth</hi> that had been an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſter, and was then become a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Catholique,</hi> was put upon him for his Interpreter, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he the Aſſiſtance of any learned man with him: Yet gave he ſo good an Account of his own Religion, and anſwered ſo pertinently the Objections of the others, as was much beyond the expectation of all that were preſent at the ſaid Conference. But ſeeing himſelf ſtill preſſed in that kind, Although the King of <hi>Spain</hi> aſſured him, that with this one thing all difficulties were overcome, and that he would ſign him a Blanck in all things elſe; yet not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain them with any further hopes, he poſitively declared
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95489:27"/>
his Reſolution to remain unremoveable in his own Religion; and would afterwards admit of no more Conferences in that kind, and certainly, if any earthly conſideration could have been prevalent with him, he had then ſuch Motives as might have wrought upon him. For beſides the Diſgrace of failing in his firſt Enterprice, (eſpecially an Enterpriſe of Love and in his own Perſon) the <hi>Princeſs</hi> was of that Merit, and her Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of him ſuch, And his ſatisfaction of her Virtue, and his Affection to her Perſon ſo great, that nothing but <hi>point of Religion</hi> could have made him leave her behind him: For it was declared unto him that in Caſe he would conform him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>point of Religion,</hi> no <hi>Dispenſation from the Pope</hi> would be then needfull, but the Mariage ſhould be conſummate without any further expectation from <hi>Rome,</hi> as ſoon as he ſhould deſire it.</p>
            <p>But he thereupon declared that he would rather expect the <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> and reſolved to imploy his indeavours that way, and ſo preſently ſent one Mr. <hi>Andrews</hi> (a Servant of his) to <hi>Rome,</hi> to cauſe Mr. <hi>George Gage</hi> (that was then there ſolliciting of the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi>) to procure the diſpatch there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of with all poſsible diligence, and Letters were written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by the Princes Order to deſire him, that if there were at <hi>Rome</hi> any Opinion of the Princes becomming a <hi>Roman Catholique,</hi> and upon hope thereof any Retardment of the granting the <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> he ſhould undeceive them in that point, and preſs the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> upon <hi>the Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> agreed upon; The Prince was then moved by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Miniſters</hi> to write unto the <hi>Pope</hi> in anſwer of ſome Letters which the <hi>Pope</hi> had ſent unto him, and to move him for the granting of the <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> and the Letters were brought ready drawn unto him, and ſome paſſages there were, from which ſome hope might be gathered, that in time, when it might be thought more ſeaſonable than at the preſent (leſt it might be thought he had changed his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion for a Wife) he would not be unwilling to receive further ſatisfaction in the <hi>Catholique Religion</hi>; all which he ſtrook out, and wrote only <hi>a Letter of Civility,</hi> ſuch a one as he thought fit to write to one, from whom he was to receive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:95489:27"/>
favour in a Buſineſs that he moſt deſired, and without whom there was no poſſibility of obteining it, unleſs he would have conformed himſelf in <hi>point of Religion,</hi> which he being reſolved not to do, he thought it fit to apply himſelf unto the <hi>Pope</hi> by all fair and amiable means, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in promiſing not to be <hi>ſevere</hi> againſt thoſe of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, thereby to facilitate with the <hi>Pope</hi> the granting of the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi>: All which Diligences he might have excuſed by his <hi>Conformity</hi>; for then no <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> would have been needfull, And hereby no further hope remaining in the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> or at <hi>Rome</hi> of his altering his Religion, the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> was granted upon <hi>the Articles formerly agreed on in point of Religion.</hi> Theſe Letters have been publiſhed and tranſlated into ſeveral Languages, which though I cannot ſay corruptly, yet ſtrained as much as might be to his diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. And it is probable that the like Letters of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance to the <hi>Pope</hi> may have been procured in the Treaty of the Match with <hi>France,</hi> wherein the <hi>Popes Diſpenſation</hi> was likewiſe held neceſſary: But all are Arguments of the Kings firmneſs in his Religion, when he would rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo the trouble and delay of the <hi>Diſpenſation,</hi> than by his <hi>Conformity</hi> to have effected what he deſired without any dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty or further hazard; and this hath been fully confirmed ever ſince, by his profeſſion and living in the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſtabliſhed in the Church of England,</hi> from which no man can ſay with truth, that he hath prevaricated in the leaſt tittle.</p>
            <p>Beſides this great proof of his firmneſs and ſettledneſs in his Religion, his conſtant and daily Practice both in Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique and Private in the exerciſe of his Devotions, may and ought to give ſatisfaction to all that conſider him without prejudice; For his reſorting twice every day to Publique Prayors, and twice a week at leaſt to Sermons, and his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent receiving of the Holy Sacrament, is publiquely known unto all; but his private Devotions to thoſe only that are of nearer Attendance about his Perſon, who well know that he never faileth morning nor evening to retire himſelf to his private Prayers, and upon Occaſions in the day time beſides, he ſhutteth up himſelf to his Devotions; Inſomuch
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95489:28"/>
that it is known, that upon particular Cauſes, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to himſelf ſome Faſts, with that ſecrecy, that thoſe neareſt ahout him have gotten no knowledge of it, but by his <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> for God hath given him ſo good a Health, that he neither needeth, nor otherwiſe uſeth to forbear Meals. It is likewiſe well known that he hath Compoſed <hi>excellent Prayers,</hi> which he hath cauſed to be uſed ſuitable to the Occaſions, as particularly, <hi>for the good ſucceſs of the Treaty at</hi> Uxbridge.</p>
            <p>Further, I may teſtifie, and do it in the preſence of God, that in Conference with me of great and private Truſt concerning his <hi>preſent ſad Condition,</hi> he hath told me, that although he could not but be ſenſible of his own Diſtreſs, of that of the <hi>Queen,</hi> and of his <hi>Children,</hi> the <hi>Calamity</hi> of the Kingdom, and very particularly of his <hi>Friends,</hi> likely to be deſtroyed for their fidelity unto him: yet that which moſt afflicted him, was <hi>the Apprehenſion of the Ruine and Deſtruction of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and of the true Proteſtant Religion,</hi> which he conceived had the leaſt to be mended in it, and moſt both in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi>) agreeing with the Primitive Times of any Church he knew in the World; And I am of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, that it will be found of much difficulty to pull from him this Opinon, unleſs his Conſcience and Iudgement ſhall be convinced by ſome ſuch learned and unanſwerable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as he hath not yet known: For although it be very probable that <hi>temporal regar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> may make him condeſcend unto <hi>great inconveniences</hi> and <hi>great leſſenings</hi>; yet if I much miſtake him not, that have known him many years, no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings or Dangers, nor other worldly Conſiderations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, will be of Power to cauſe him to make <hi>Shipwrack</hi> of his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>And although it be very true, that the <hi>Queen</hi> his Wife be moſt dear unto him, and in all other things of greateſt Power with him, yet in matter of <hi>Religion,</hi> his Reſolution to <hi>live</hi> in it, and his Ability to <hi>defend</hi> it, was ſo well known unto Her, and to all about her, that as they could not but think it bootleſs to Attempt any thing in that kind, ſo they knew they could not eſſay it without Offence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95489:28"/>And although he hath alwaies indeavoured to breed up the <hi>Prince</hi> his Son in great Duty and Reverence to the <hi>Queen</hi> his Mother, with a ſtrict command unto him to be <hi>obedient to her in all things</hi>; yet it hath alwaies been with this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction, <hi>Except it be in point of Religion,</hi> And upon my own knowledge I dare and do deliver this for a poſitive Truth.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe the <hi>matching</hi> of his <hi>eldeſt Daughter</hi> to a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Prince</hi> (though not of the Rank of Kings) may be jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged as a great Argument of his love to the <hi>Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> Beſides, in the beginning of theſe troubles, knowing this malicious ſuggeſtion caſt upon him, he ſet forth a <hi>publick Manifeſt</hi> unto the <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> to <hi>vindicate</hi> himſelf from that <hi>ſcandal,</hi> and to <hi>aſſure</hi> the World of his <hi>Constancy</hi> and Reſolution to <hi>live</hi> and <hi>die</hi> in the <hi>Reformed Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as for his Piety in this his Profeſſion, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works,</hi> And what greater Argument of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> can there be to man who cannot ſearch into the Heart, (to God that only belongeth) than a temperate, ſober, good Life and Converſation. What blood in his Reign hath been <hi>ſacrificed</hi> to his Wrath or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge? What Confiſcations have <hi>enriched</hi> his Treaſure? What noble Family hath been <hi>diſhonored</hi> by his Luſt? What Incouragement hath Vice, Exceſs, or Licentiouſneſs <hi>received</hi> from his Example? Nay, I am perſwaded, that it will much trouble his Enemies, yea Malice it ſelf, to find out the Vice wherewith to <hi>reproach</hi> his Life: yet how many <hi>Shimei</hi>'s have <hi>reviled the Lords Anointed,</hi> of whom we are taught <hi>not to ſpeak ill in our Bed-chambers</hi>? And when Cauſe of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill againſt him hath been wanting, they have ſet him up as a <hi>But</hi> before them for their ſcurrilous <hi>Wits, Libels,</hi> and <hi>Hue and Cries, &amp;c.</hi> I am far from <hi>charging</hi> the Houſes for having a hand in theſe <hi>low</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> things, only I ſhall ſay, that it is poſſible for private Errors to become publique Faults, <hi>non Committendo, ſed non Caſtigando.</hi>

               </note> It was <hi>Elies</hi> Caſe, and Gods Iudgement followed it.</p>
            <p>Beſides this certain knowledge that I had of the Kings <hi>ſettledneſs in his Religion</hi>; I was far from being <hi>ſatisfied</hi> in my Conſcience (that if the King ſhould have <hi>changed his

            <p>THere is yet one further Objection, wherwith I have heard ſome indeavour to <hi>countenance</hi> and <hi>justifie their taking Arms againſt the King,</hi> which was, <hi>That he firſt made War againſt his Parliament, meaning by force to introduce an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power in Church and Common-Wealth; And that the War on their ſide was only defenſive, and for the maintenance of their liberties, proprieties, privileges, and Religion.</hi>

Now if the King had had any ſecret Intention of <hi>making of a War,</hi> would he have done ſo many things ſo prejudicial to himſelf, and ſo againſt his heart, only for the preventing of it? and although his hopes of a quiet ſettlement by the <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> of theſe two Bills failed him, he yet gave not over the doing of all further things which he thought might <hi>renew</hi> a right underſtanding betwixt him and the Houſes.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe when that <hi>unhappy</hi> and <hi>unſeaſonable</hi> Act of his going to the Houſe of Commons in Perſon happened, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to <hi>redeem</hi> it with ſuch Acts of <hi>acknowledgemeot, ſubmiſſion,</hi> nay I may ſay <hi>asking forgiveneſs,</hi> as were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver done by any King unto his Subjects.</p>

            <p>After the King had found himſelf diſappointed of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, and that by his former <hi>yieldings</hi> and <hi>complyances</hi> the miſunderſtandings were little <hi>allayed,</hi> but greater appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances grew every day that other of unquietneſs and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, And that he had thought fit to withdraw himſelf from <hi>London</hi> for his <hi>ſafety,</hi> and the avoiding of Affronts, which he had cauſe to fear; (for that the five Members were the next day by the armed Train'd-bands of the City in martial manner to be brought to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and to paſs by the <hi>Kings Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi>) Yet ſo deſirous was the King to ſweeten things again, that (upon great inſtance) he paſſed the Bill for <hi>debarring</hi> the Biſhops their Seats and Votes in Parliament, upon hopes that were given (with no ſmall Aſſurance,) that upon grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the Houſes therein, all things would ſpeedily be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a way of Accomodation.</p>
            <p>I had often heard the King ſay, That <hi>(beſides the wrong done unto the Biſhops, who had as good Right to their Votes in Parliament as any other Peers from the first Original of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments) he conceived he could not do any Act of greater Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to himſelf and his Succeſſors, than the paſſing of that Bill.</hi> Yet the deſire he had of a <hi>reconciliation</hi> with his Parliament, overweighed all other Conſiderations and Intereſts whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, And he gave his Royal aſſent unto the Bill; But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that effect which the King expected thereby, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced rhe 19 <hi>Propoſitions of Grocers Hall</hi> before mentioned; Whereupon although the King gave no negative Anſwer,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95489:31"/>
yet he put on a Reſolution to make no further Anſwer to any new Propoſitions: But his Requeſt to the Houſes was, <hi>That they would ſet down together all ſuch means as would give them ſatisfaction, wherunto they ſhould receive a gracious and ſatisfsctory Anſwer to all they could iuſtly or reaſonably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>; But this was declared to be a breach of privileges, to <hi>reſtrain</hi> the Propoſals of the Houſes either in matter or form. The King on the other ſide thought, that whatſoever he had formerly done had ſerved only to <hi>ſtrip</hi> himſelf of his known Rights, but had no way advanced a general accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, And ſo for the future, betook himſelf to <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Proteſtations</hi> inſtead of <hi>Anſwers,</hi> wherein he proffer'd to <hi>concurre</hi> in all things they ſhould deſire for the ſettling of all Liberties and Immunities of the Subject, either for the Propriety of their Goods, or Liberty of their Perſons, which they either had received from his Anceſtors, or which by himſelf had been granted unto them. And if there did yet remain any thing of Grace, for the <hi>good</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of the Subject, he would willingly heaken unto all their reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Propoſitions. And for the ſetling of the <hi>true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Religion,</hi> he moſt earneſtly recommended the Care thereof unto them, wherein they ſhould have his <hi>Concurrence</hi> and <hi>aſſictance.</hi> The Rule of his Government he proteſted ſhould be the ſetled Laws of the Kingdom; And for the Indempnity and Comfort of the Subject, he offered a more ample and General Pardon than had been granted by any of his Predeceſſors, and for the performance of all he had promiſed, (beſides ſolemn Oaths and Execrations whereby he bound himſelf) <hi>he deſired God only ſo to bleſs and proſper him and his Poſterity, as he ſhould faithfully perform the ſame.</hi> And further, for the greater ſecuring of what ſhould be agreed and ſetled, he gave ſuch voluntary ſecurity, as I conceive was never before demanded, nor by any King offered to his Subjects; That in the Caſe he failed in performance, or ſhould do contrary to that which he had promiſed or agreed, He acquitted and freed his Subjects of their Obedience.</p>

            <p>Beſides the above ſpecified Reaſons of the Kings deſiring <hi>Peace,</hi> It could not be ſuppoſed, that in humane prudence the King could deſire a War, being altogether unfurniſhed of <hi>men, mony</hi> and <hi>ammunition,</hi> and the contrary party provided of all, by the being <hi>ſeized</hi> of his Forts, his Magazins, his Navy, his Rents, the Revenew of his Crown, and of the powerfull and rich City of <hi>London,</hi> and of the perverted Affections of his People. He was fain at his return from <hi>Dover</hi> (whither he had accompanyed the <hi>Queen</hi> when ſhe paſſed into <hi>Holland</hi>) to go from place to place, as to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> and to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> lingring up and down in hope ſtill of ſome Overture of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, and many Motions tending thereunto, were made by my ſelf and other the Kings Servants that ſtayed behind him with the Parliament; But they were not then thought ſeaſonable, and wrought little effect, and the King having loſt all hopes in that kind, held it fit to retire himſelf further from danger, (as he conceived) and ſo went unto <hi>York</hi> with a very mean Equipage and a ſlender Attendance of not above 30 or 40 Perſons. It is true, that many of the Nobility and Gentry repaired thither unto him, ſhewing great Affection and Reſolution to follow him in all Fortune; and Indeavours were uſed that the King might be put into the beſt poſture of Defence that was poſſible, but ever with a deſire that thoſe ſmall Forces might rather <hi>countenance</hi> ſome Treaty or Overture for Accommodation than that there was any belief that thoſe Forces were fit to carry through a War. And to that purpoſe the Earls of <hi>Southampton</hi> and <hi>Dorſet</hi> were ſent unto the Parliament with new Overtures from <hi>Nottingham.</hi> But nothing would be heard untill the King had firſt <hi>taken down his Standard, and laid down Arms,</hi> which the King underſtood to be <hi>a total ſubmiſſion and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

For although <hi>de facto</hi> in the Conteſtation of War, they have ſeized and poſſeſſed themſelves of them, yet they will not pretend, that they have right unto them <hi>de jure,</hi> And it is <hi>Right</hi> that conſtitutes the <hi>Iuſtneſs</hi> or <hi>Uniust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the entring into a War; <hi>Succeſs</hi> protecteth, and may eſtabliſh for the future, but cannot rectifie or make good an <hi>unjuſt beginning.</hi> And it muſt be their future proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by which the moſt probable Iudgement can be made of their former intentions.

            <p>THere was yet a further Tye of Gratitude put upon me, by the Generouſneſs, and Reconcileableneſs of the Kings Diſpoſition: (a virtue ever to be wiſhed, but not often found in offended Princes) For I having been ſo unhappy, as to have fallen very highly into his Disfavour, and to have remained many years under a Cloud of his heavy Diſpleaſure: yet not long before the beginning of this Parliament, having the opportunity of acceſſe unto him, at the great Counſel at <hi>York,</hi> And then being imployed as <hi>Prolocutor</hi> in the Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

for the Treaty with the <hi>Scots</hi> at <hi>Rippon</hi> for a <hi>Ceſſation,</hi> and afterwards for the Peace at <hi>London</hi>; he was pleaſed to receive ſo good ſatisfaction concerning me, and all my former pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, that he did <hi>graciouſly</hi> paſs by, whatſoever offence he had conceived againſt me, and did not only call me to his Counſel-Table, (where, in regard of my many years ſervice under his Father, he might have judged me uſefull unto his ſervice) but out of a Confidence and Truſt (which to fail in even amongſt Heathens, would be held odious) admitted me to the place of the neareſt Attendance about his Perſon, as <hi>a Gentleman of his Bed-chamber,</hi> who (beſides the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of Acceſs in all places) have the Honor to ſleep by him in the night in his Chamber, and to be truſted alone with the <hi>ſafety</hi> of his Perſon, as I have often been.

            <head>CHAP. XI. A Brief Summary of the Reaſons formerly ſet down for the not taking Arms againſt the King.</head>
            <p>THeſe are the Reaſons that have reteined me in that Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which I conceived my ſelf bound unto towards the King, The ſum of them being briefly thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I underſtood <hi>Hoſtile Reſiſtance against the King,</hi> to be expreſly prohibited by the word of God, both in the old and new Teſtament.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhould have gone againſt the Doctrine and Practice of the Primitive Church, and againſt the preſent Tenents and Confeſſions of Faith, of all the Reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Admitting the Maxims of thoſe hot-headed men, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Romaniſts</hi> or <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> that have written in favour of Subjects <hi>taking Arms againſt their Prince</hi> to be true, (as they are falſe, and condemned by their own Churches reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) yet in this Caſe, they could be no Arguments to me; For that their Doctrine and Principles, are in no kind applicable to the preſent matter in Fact.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſhould have directly broken all thoſe ſolemn Oaths which I had ſo often taken, of Fidelity and Allegeance to the King.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I ſhould have gone againſt the Laws of the Kingdom, by which <hi>to take Arms againſt the King, or to adhere to his Enemies, &amp;c.</hi> is made <hi>Treaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. I ſhould have been failing in the Obligations of Honor and Gratitude.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſhould have tranſgreſſed againſt Moral Honeſty, and natural Iuſtice, <hi>to have fought againſt the King,</hi> as an unjuſt and an irreligious Man, whom I knew to be, in more than an ordinary meaſure, <hi>Iuſt</hi> and <hi>Religious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that if I ſhould have broken through all theſe Duties of Religion, of Oaths, of Loyalty, of Laws, of Gratitude, and

            <p>And howſoever this may be judged a ſevere Cenſure, 'It is only againſt my ſelf, as I ſay in the beginning of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, <hi>Men may upon differing Painciples go differing waies</hi>; And I cannot be ſo uncharitable, as to think ſo many <hi>grave, learned,</hi> and <hi>noble</hi> Perſonages, would break through ſo many plain Duties, under which they had formerly lived, And un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they had not only ſworn but conformed themſelves; But that they had either <hi>found out</hi> or had had <hi>revealed</hi> unto them, ſome ſuch things for the ſatisfaction of their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, as God hath not yet been pleaſed I ſhould attain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

            <head>CHAP. XII. All the former Reaſons applyed to the preſent Caſe of King <hi>Charles,</hi> with a poſitive opinion thereupon.</head>
            <p>THeſe have been the Motives of ſetling my Conſcience in the Opinion that I ſhall briefly here ſet down, deduced from the Principles of this Diſcourſe, which (upon this indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual Caſe) is;</p>
            <p>That neither upon pretext of Religion, Perſonal Vices, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes in Government, nor any other Colour or Pretext whatſoever, the Subjects of the Crown of <hi>England</hi> may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Obedience, or make <hi>Hoſtile Reſiſtance</hi> to King <hi>CHARLES</hi> the preſent King, Being by Right of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, juſtly poſſeſſed of the Crown, His Title no way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, either upon his Divine or Moral Vertues; And the ſaid Subjects having received him, and acknowledged him for their <hi>only Supreme Governor,</hi> done him Hommage, and ſworn to him Faith and Allegeance abſolutely and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Condition.</p>
            <p>As for other Kings or Potentates, whether Elective King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or Kingdoms that (at the Erection of them) were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the firſt King upon Expreſs Covenant, and only with a Conditional Obedience, as is pretended by thoſe of <hi>Aragon</hi> and others: of theſe I ſhall not ſpeak. Neither ſhall I adventure to ſpeak of thoſe <hi>Catholique</hi> Kings and Princes, which acknowledge (in ſpiritual matters) a Superiour Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the <hi>Pope</hi> over them, (And he pretendeth (as hath been before ſet down) by neceſſary Relation and Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Temporal upon the Spiritual) to have a Temporal
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:95489:36"/>
Power over them, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia</hi>; and hath often put this his Claim in Practice, by accompanying his <hi>spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Cenſure of Excommunication,</hi> with the Sentence of <hi>diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging</hi> Subjects of their <hi>obedience</hi> to their Princes, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of depoſing them. Herewith I ſhall not meddle, None of theſe caſes being applicable to the preſent Caſe of King CHARLES, who is no <hi>Elective King,</hi> but holdeth his Crown by an unqueſtionable Title of Succeſſion, derived to him by Deſcent from his Anceſtors, for the ſpace of more than ſix hundred years: Neither was there ever any Pact or Condition with him, or any of his Anceſtors of <hi>forfeiture,</hi> in Caſe of <hi>miſgovernment</hi> or <hi>wickedneſs</hi>; And <hi>breach</hi> of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants forfeiteth not an Ordinary Eſtate, unleſs there be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Clauſe and Condition of <hi>forfeiture:</hi> which in this Caſe, neither was, nor ever can be pretended. It is true, that his Anceſtors and himſelf, have limited and reſtrained their Legal Right, by many Conceſſions and Laws in ſome Caſes, as, The making of Laws without Conſent of Peers and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the levying of Mony, &amp;c. which he cannot <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> without great Injuſtice, as ſhall be after ſhewn: But no ſuch Pact or Covenant can be produced, or pretended, whereby upon <hi>breach,</hi> he <hi>forfeiteth</hi> his Soveraignty, or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it juſtifiable for his Subjects to take <hi>Arms</hi> againſt him, or to <hi>inflict Puniſhments</hi> upon his Perſon, either by <hi>depoſing, Death,</hi> or <hi>Impriſonment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Caſe likewiſe of <hi>Catholique Princes</hi> no way concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him, who acknowledgeth in the <hi>Pope,</hi> no ſuch Superior Juriſdiction: Neither if he did, are there any ſuch Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures iſſued out againſt him, as might warrant ſo much as his Catholique Subjects <hi>to take arms</hi> againſt him. So that whatſoever Pretences may be in ſome Caſes, concerning ſuch Princes as I have above ſpecified, (wherein I ſhall not preſume to deliver any Opinion) yet in the preſent Caſe of King CHARLES, there can be no colourable pretence of <hi>taking arms</hi> againſt him, or of <hi>depoſing</hi> him, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be, (in effect) when he is <hi>diveſted</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a Room; but when the liberty of <hi>going,</hi> and the freedom of <hi>ſpeaking</hi> is reſtrained, to ſuch places or perſons as others ſhall pleaſe, and he remain under the Guard of Armed men, not of his own chooſing, but impoſed upon him by others.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> derive their <hi>Title</hi> and <hi>Right</hi> from <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman,</hi> who although he came in by <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> yet his Succeſſors (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that a Right acquired by Force, may likewiſe be recovered by Force, by thoſe upon whom the forceable Intruſion was made) were pleaſed by way of pact and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, to limit and qualifie that <hi>Imperium abſolutum,</hi> which is acquired by <hi>Conqueſt</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the People of <hi>England,</hi> thereupon did ſubmit themſelves to his Government, and became his Subjects and his Liege-men, And thereby was Conſtituted <hi>Imperium legitimum, a juſt and Rightfull Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty</hi>; the Kings remaining with Supreme Power, and the People with Common Right, whereby they were <hi>freed</hi> from the Servitude of <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> and remained under a <hi>free</hi> Subjection, whereunto they had by their Conſent ſubmitted themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Kings likewiſe did recede from <hi>Abſolute and Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power,</hi> and remained with <hi>Supreme,</hi> but not with <hi>Abſolute Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>free Subjection,</hi> I underſtand when a People live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Laws to which they have given a <hi>free Conſent,</hi> and not under the meer <hi>Will</hi> of the Prince; And that they retain ſuch a Propriety in that which is their own, that without their Aſſent or legal forfeiture, it cannot be taken from them; And this is a true difference betwixt a <hi>Free Subject</hi> and a <hi>Slave or Servant. Quicquid acquirit ſervus, acquiritur Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mino, Liber quod acquirit, acquirit ſibi, Whatſoever a ſervant getteth, he getteth for his Lord, Whatſoever a Freeman getteth, he getteth for himſelf.</hi> And ſo although that <hi>Dominion</hi> of all belongeth to the Prince, <hi>Propriety</hi> belongs to every man, <hi>Dominium totius apud Caeſarem, Proprietas apud ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>los.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Difference that I underſtand betwixt a <hi>Supreme,</hi> and
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95489:37"/>
               <hi>Abſolute Empire,</hi> is, That in <hi>Abſolute Empire,</hi> the Rule of the Peoples Obedience, is only the Soveraigns <hi>Will.</hi> So it is in <hi>Turky, Muſcovia,</hi> and all ſuch Princes, as retain entire, the Right of <hi>Conqueſt</hi>; and was in ſome ſort under the <hi>Roman Emperor</hi> after the <hi>Lex Regia</hi> was eſtabliſhed by the Peoples Conſent; whereby they transferred their entire Right unto the <hi>Emperor.</hi>

               <hi>That the King can do no Wrong</hi>; which is very falſe in many ſenſes, and may be very well called <hi>fictio Iuris, a kind of Metaphyſical Fiction.</hi> For Kings may do <hi>Wrong,</hi> and be as wicked as other men, and may commit Murther, and lye with other mens Wives, and wrongfully take take other mens Eſtates, which no Fiction of the Law can make not to be <hi>Wrong,</hi> although his Perſon be exempt from puniſhment. And that <hi>abſtract</hi> Conſideration of the King, for his juſt Power and Office, as it hath been often ill uſed heretofore in way of Aſſentation: So there hath been as ill uſe made of it in theſe troubles; when the <hi>taking of arms</hi> and the <hi>fighting</hi> againſt him, was pretended not to be againſt the King, but againſt CHARLES STEWART. But (to ſpeak in Terms intelligible) a King both may do <hi>Wrong,</hi> and the People may ſeek their <hi>redreſs,</hi> in ſuch ſort as the Law of the Land alloweth: And the difference betwixt King and Peoples <hi>failing</hi> in their reciprocal Duties, is not but that they <hi>do Wrong</hi> alike, <hi>offend God</hi> alike, and are both of them liable to be queſtioned, according to the extent of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:95489:37"/>
the Law, by both their Conſents eſtabliſhed. The Subjects tranſgreſſing the Law, ſhall be puniſhed according to the quality and meaſure of their Delicts. <hi>Felony,</hi> by loſs of their Goods and Chattels, and by a milder Death, <hi>Treaſon</hi> by a more ſevere Death, and Confiſcation both of Goods and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. But hereof they muſt be convict <hi>per pares, by Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their own Condition,</hi> and adjudged by a Superiour Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which can be derived only and ſingly from the King. So that the King not having his Peer, or any of his own Condition, cannot have a legal Tryal; And having no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction ſuperior to himſelf, cannot be <hi>adjudged,</hi> or <hi>ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced</hi> by any. For neither the Extent of the Law, nor any Condition of the Pacts, or Stipulation, do reach to the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing</hi> of the Perſon of the King, or the <hi>forfeiture</hi> of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us. It is true, that (in civill things) Tryals may be (and often are) brought againſt the King; And Kings do give way, That the Iudges be ſworn to do <hi>equal Iustice</hi> betwixt them and their Subjects. And in point of Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Wrong, we may <hi>Remonſtrate</hi> our Grievances, and challenge Redreſs by our <hi>Petitions</hi>; Which if they be not condeſcended unto, we may inſiſt upon them as our <hi>right,</hi> and claim them as a <hi>due,</hi> and not as of <hi>grace</hi>; And although we do it by way of <hi>Petition,</hi> that is but a dutifull form of Subjects bringing their Plea againſt the King, For in other ſort he ought not to be impleaded. Beſides theſe Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Right, we may (as it hath been formerly ſaid) <hi>remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, enter our Proteſtations,</hi> and take all thoſe Courſes which the Laws allow. Neither ought the King to <hi>take Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> at theſe legal Conteſtations with him, becauſe by his aſſent unto the Laws, he hath aſſented unto them: Nay he ought in them to do us <hi>Right,</hi> being bound thereunto by the Law of God, and by his Oath, and by moral Honeſty and Iuſtice.

And when he breaketh through all the Bonds and Tyes of Oaths, of Divine Precepts, and Moral Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, only to ſtretch and extend his Power and Greatneſs; why ſhould he not expect, that Subjects ſhould make as bold to tranſgreſs the ſame Duties, in hope of recovering <hi>Liberty,</hi> with the falſe ſhew whereof, people are apter to be further tranſported than by any earthly deſire whatſoever? Neither

will the fear of Death or Danger reſtrain them, becauſe they will not attempt, untill opportunity make them hopefull of prevailing, and then they conceive by Power to provide for their own Impunities,</p>
            <p>But beſides this proneſs in people to be eaſily led, &amp; perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into <hi>Rebellion,</hi> under the falſe and ſpecious ſhew of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering <hi>liberty,</hi> The great Monarchs &amp; Princes of Chriſtendom, have been (in great part) the fomentors &amp; upholders of <hi>Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> and their Doctors have not ſo much by their <hi>preaching,</hi> and <hi>writing</hi> beaten it down, as the Princes themſelves have by their <hi>Examples</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> given encouragement unto it; for although I ſhall ever ſpeak with Reverence of Princes and their Actions, yet I ſhall hope that the humble repreſentation of this truth will receive a fair interpretation. For it is unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably true, that in this later Age all the great Monarchies and States of Chriſtendom have been made unhappy by Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine Wars, which have been fomented (if not contrived and deſigned) by one Chriſtian Prince againſt another; every one countenancing and encouraging <hi>Rebellion,</hi> untill it become his own Caſe, and then he is offended: of this I ſhall give no particular inſtances, the Notariety of it is too great, and I fear every State may too eaſily apply it to what they have done, And it may be feared that the ſad Condition of almoſt all the States of Chriſtendom at this preſent day,<note place="margin">

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have ſpoken ſo often upon the ſubject of <hi>Accommodation,</hi> with ſo little acceptance, and with ſo ill ſucceſſe, that it was in my Intention not to have made any further eſtay in this kind; but my zeal to the peace and happineſs of this Kingdom, and my apprehenſions of the near approaching of our unſpeakable miſeries and calamities, ſuffer me not to be Maſter of mine own Reſolutions.</p>
               <p>Certainly this Kingdom hath at all times many advantages over the other Monarchies of <hi>Europe.</hi> As, of Situation, of plenty of rich commodities, of Power both by Sea and Land: But more particularly at this time, when all our neighbouring States are by their ſevetal intereſts, ſo involved in War, and with ſuch equality of Power, That there is not much likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of their Maſtering one another, nor of having their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences eaſily compounded. And thereby, we being only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all Trades, and to all places: Wealth and Plenty (which follow, where Trade flouriſheth) are in a manner caſt upon us.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not trouble your Lordſhips by putting you in mind of the great and noble undertakings of our Anceſtors: Nor ſhall
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95489:43"/>
I paſs higher than the times within mine own remembrance.</p>
               <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a Princeſs diſadvantaged by her ſex<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by her age, and chiefly, by her want of Iſſue: yet if we ſhall conſider the great effects which were wrought upon moſt of the States of Chriſtendom by this Nation under her prudent government; (the growth of the Monarchy of <hi>Spain</hi> chiefly by her impeached; The <hi>United Provinces</hi> by her protected; The <hi>French</hi> in their greateſt miſeries relieved; Moſt of the Princes of <hi>Germany</hi> kept in high reſpect &amp; reverence towards her and this Kingdom, and the peace and tranquillity wherein this Kingdom flouriſhed; and which hath been continued down unto us by the peaceable government of King <hi>Iames</hi> of bleſſed memory, and of his now Majeſty, untill theſe late un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy interruptions) We cannot but judge this Nation equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable with any other, of Honor, Happineſs, and Plenty.</p>
               <p>Now, if inſtead of this happy condition, in which we have been, and might be, upon a ſober and impartial inquiry we ſhall find our ſelves to have been for ſome few years laſt paſt involved in ſo many troubles and diſtractions, and at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to be reduced to the very brink of miſeries and calamities; It is high time for us to conſider by what means we have been brought into them, and by what means it is moſt probable we may be brought out of them.</p>
               <p>This Kingdom never enjoyed ſo univerſal a peace, neither hath it any viſible enemy in the whole World either Infidel or Chriſtian: Our Enemies are only of our own houſe, ſuch as our own diſſentions, jealouſies, and diſtractions, have raiſed up: and certainly, where they are found (eſpecially betwixt a King and his People) no other cauſe of the unhappineſs and miſery of a State need to be ſought after: For civill diſcord is a plentifull Sourſe, from whence all miſeries and miſchiefs flow into a Kingdom.</p>
               <p>The Scripture telleth us of the ſtrength of a little City uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of the inſtability of a Kingdom divided within it ſelf; So that upon a prudent inquiry, we may aſſign our own jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, and diſcords, for the chief cauſe of our paſt and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent troubles, and of our future fears.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that by the counſel and conduct of evill
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95489:43"/>
Miniſters, the Subject had cauſe to think their juſt liberties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded; And from thence have our former diſtempers grown: For it is in the body politick of a Monarchy, as in another Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural body, the health whereof is defined to be, <hi>Partium cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris aequa temperies, an equal temper of the parts.</hi> So likewiſe, a State is well in health and well diſpoſed, when Soveraign Power and common right are equally ballanced, and kept in an even temper by juſt and equitable rules.</p>
               <p>And truely (My LORDS) by the goodneſs of His Majeſty, and by the prudent endeavour of the Parliament, this State is almoſt reduced to that equal, and even temper, and our ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is rather continued out of fancy and conceipt (I mean fears and jealouſies) than out of any real diſtemper or defect.</p>
               <p>I well remember, that before the beginning of this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome Noble Lords preſented a Petition unto the King, and in that Pettion did ſet down all or moſt of the Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and diſtempers of the Kingdom, which then occurred to them. To theſe (as I conceive) the Parliament have procured from his Majeſty ſuch redreſſes as are to their good ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Many other things for the eaſe, ſecurity, and comfort of the ſubject, have been by their great induſtry, found and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, and by his Majeſties goodneſs condeſcended unto. And now we are come ſo near the happineſs of being the moſt free and moſt ſetled Nation in the Chriſtian world; Our dangers and miſeries will grow greater and neerer unto us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day than other, if they be not prevented.</p>
               <p>The king on his part offereth to concurre with us in the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all the liberties and immunities either of the propriety of our Goods, or liberty of our perſons, which we have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from our Anceſtors, or which himſelf hath granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us; and what ſhall yet remain for the good and comfort of his Subjects, He is willing to hearken to all our juſt and reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable propoſitions: and for the eſtabliſhing of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, he wooes us to it: And the wiſdome and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the Parliament hath now put it in a hopefull way.</p>
               <p>The rule of his government, he profeſſeth ſhall be, the Laws of the Kingdom, And for the comforting and ſecuring of us,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95489:44"/>
he offereth a more large and more general Pardon, than hath been granted by any of his Predeceſſors.</p>
               <p>And truly (My LORDS) This is all that ever was or can be pretended unto by us.</p>
               <p>We, on the other ſide make Profeſſion, That we intend to make his Majeſty <hi>a glorious</hi> King, to endeavour to ſupport his Dignity, and to pay unto him that Duty and Obedience, which by our Allegiance, ſeveral Oaths, and late Proteſtations we owe unto him, and to maintain all his juſt Regalities and Prerogatives, which I conceive to be as much as his Majeſty will expect from us.</p>
               <p>So that <hi>My Lords</hi>) we (being both thus reciprocally a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed of that which in the general would make both the King and People happy) ſhall be moſt unfortunate, if we ſhall not bring both Inclinations and Indeavours ſo to propound and ſettle particulars, as both King and People may know what will give them mutual Satisfaction, which certainly muſt be the firſt Step to the ſetling a right underſtanding be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, And in this I ſhould not conceave any great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if it were once put into a way of preparation. But the greateſt difficulty may ſeem to be, how that which may be ſettled and agreed upon, may be ſecured. This is commonly the laſt point in Treaties betwixt Princes, &amp; of the greateſt niceneſſe, But much more betwixt a King and his Subjects, where that Confidence &amp; Belief which ſhould be betwixt them, is once loſt: And to ſpeak clearly, I fear that this may be our Caſe, and herein may conſiſt the chiefeſt difficulty of Accomodation; For it is much eaſier to compoſe differences ariſing from Reaſon (yea even from Wrongs) than it is to ſatisfy Jealouſies, which ariſing out of Diffidence &amp; Diſtruſt, grow and are varyed upon every Occaſion.</p>
               <p>But (<hi>My Lords</hi>) if there be no endeavours to <hi>allay</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> them, they will every day increaſe and gather ſtrength; Nay they are already grown to that height, and the mutual replyes to thoſe direct tearms of Oppoſition, that if we make not a preſent ſtop, it is to be feared, it will ſpeedily paſſe fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>verbal</hi> Conteſtations.</p>
               <p>I obſerve in ſome of his Majeſties Anſwers, a Civil War
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95489:44"/>
ſpoken of: I confeſſe it is a word of Horrour to me, who have been an eyewitneſs of thoſe unexpreſſible Calamities, that (in a ſhort time) the moſt plentiful and flouriſhing Countries of <hi>Europe</hi> have been brought unto by an <hi>inteſtine War.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I furrher obſerve, that his Majeſty proteſteth againſt the miſeries that may enſue by a war, and that he is clear of them. It is true, That a Proteſtation of that kind is no actual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of War, but it is the very next degree to it, <hi>Vltima admonitio,</hi> as the Civilians term it, <hi>The last admonition</hi>; So that we are upon the very brink of our miſeries; It is better keeping our of them, than getting out of them: And in a State, the Wiſdome of Prevention, is infinitely beyond the Wiſdome of Remedies. If for the ſins of this Narion, theſe miſunderſtandings ſhould produce the leaſt Act of Hoſtility, It is not almoſt to be believed, how impoſſible it were to put any ſtay to our miſeries; For a Civil War admits of none of thoſe Conditions, or Quarter, by which Cruelty and Blood are amongſt other Enemies kept from Extremities; Nay if it ſhould but ſo happen (which God of his goodneſs avert) That mutually Forces, and Armies ſhould be raiſed, Jealouſies and Fears would be ſo much increaſed thereby, that an Accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation would be rendred full of difficulty and length; and the very charge of maintaining them, (whilſt firſt a Ceſſation of Arms, and then a general Accommodation were in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) the Wealth of the Kingdom would be conſumed.</p>
               <p>And of this we had lately a coſtly Example; for in thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Troubles betwixt us and <hi>Scotland,</hi> after there was a ſtop made to any further Acts of Hoſtility, and a deſire of Peace expreſſed on both ſides, Commiſſioners nominated, and all the Articles propounded; yet the keeping of the Armies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for our ſeveral Securities (whilſt the Ceſſation at <hi>Rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,</hi> and the Peace at <hi>London</hi> where in treating) coſt this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome not much leſſe than a million of pounds. And if two Armies be once on foot here in <hi>England,</hi> either a ſuddain En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter muſt deſtroy one of them, or the keeping of them on foot, muſt deſtroy the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>I hope therefore we ſhall make it our endeavour, by Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and Calmneſſe, yet to put a ſtay to our ſo near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95489:45"/>
miſeries, and that we ſhall hearken to the wiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our Bretbren of <hi>Scotland</hi> in their late Anſwer to the King and Parliament, wherein they earneſtly entreat us, <hi>That all means may be forborn, which may make the Breach wider, and the Wound deeper, and that no place be given to the evill Spirit of Diviſion, which at ſuch times worketh unceſſantly, and reſteth not: But that the faireſt, the moſt Chriſtian, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way may be taken by ſo wiſe a King and Parliament, as may (againſt all Malice and Oppoſitions) make his Majeſty and Poſterity more glorious, and his Kingdom more happy than ever.</hi> And in another place they ſay, <hi>That ſince the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath thought meet, to draw the Practice of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland <hi>into Example, in point of Declaration: They are confident that the Affection of the Parliaments will lead them alſo to the Practice of that Kingdom, in compoſing the unhappy Differences betwixt his Majeſty and them, and (ſo far as may conſiſt with their Religion, Liberties, and Laws) in giving his Majeſty all ſatisfaction, eſpecially in their tender Care of his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Perſon, and of his Princely Greatneſs and Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly (MY LORDS) this is wiſe and brotherly Advice, and I doubt not but we are all deſirous to follow it. We muſt not then ſtill dwell upon generals (for generals produce no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing) But we muſt put this Buſineſs into a certain way, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by particulars may be deſcended unto; And the way that I ſhall offer with all humility is, That there may be a ſelect Committee of choiſe Perſons of both Houſes, who may, in the firſt place truely ſtate, and ſet down all things in difference betwixt the King and the Subject, with the moſt probable way of reconciling them: Secondly, to deſcend unto the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which may be expected by each from other, either in point of our ſupporting of him, or his relieving of us. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how all theſe Conditions, being agreed upon, may be ſo ſecured, as may ſtand with the Honor of his Majeſty, and the ſatisfaction of the Subject.</p>
               <p>When ſuch a Committee ſhall have drawn up the heads of the Propoſitions, and the way of ſecuring them, they may be preſented unto the Houſes, and ſo offered unto his Majeſty by ſuch a Way, as the Parliament ſhall Iudge moſt probable to produce an Accommodation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:95489:45"/>MY LORDS, What I have ſaid unto you, hath been chiefly grounded upon the Apprehenſions, and Fears of our future Dangers. I ſhall ſay ſomething of the unhappineſs of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eſtate, which certainly ſtandeth in as much need of Relief and Remedy, as our Fears do of Prevention; For although the King and People were fully united, and that all men that now draw ſeveral waies, ſhould unanimouſly ſet their hand to the work, yet they would find it no eaſie task, to reſtore this Kingdom to a proſperous and comfortable Condition: If we take into our Conſideration the deplorable Eſtate of <hi>Ireland,</hi> likely to drain this Kingdom of Men and Treaſure: if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Debts and Neceſſity of the Crown, the Ingagements of the Kingdom, the great and unuſual Contributions of the People, the which although they may not be ſo much to their Diſcontent, (for that they have been legally raiſed) yet the burthen hath not been much eaſed: let us likewiſe conſider the Diſtractions (I may almoſt call them Confuſions) in point of Religion, which of all other Diſtempers are moſt dangerous and deſtructive to the Peace of a State.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe publique Calamities, let every particular man conſider the diſtracted diſcomfortable eſtate of his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: for mine own part, I muſt ingenuouſly profeſs unto your Lordſhips, That I cannot find out (under the different Commands of the King and the Parliament) any ſuch Courſe of Caution and Warineſs, by which I can promiſe to my ſelf Security or Safety. I could give your Lordſhips many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Inconſiſtency and impoſſibility of obeying theſe Commands: But I ſhall trouble you with only one or two.</p>
               <p>The Ordinance of Parliament (now in ſo great agitation) commandeth all Perſons in Authority, <hi>to put it in execution,</hi> &amp; all others <hi>to obey it according to the Fundamental Laws of the Land</hi>: The King declareth it to be <hi>contrary to the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Laws, againſt the Subject, and Rights of Parliament</hi>; And commandeth all his Subjects of what ſort ſoever, upon their Allegeance <hi>not to obey the ſaid Ordinance,</hi> as they will anſwer the contrary at their perils.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe in point of the King, commanding <hi>the Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of divers of us upon his Perſon,</hi> whereunto we are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95489:46"/>
by ſeveral relations of our Services and Oaths; in caſe we comply not with his Commands, we are liable to his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and the loſs of thoſe places of Honor and Truſt, which we hold under him: if we obey his Commands, without the leave of the Parliament (which hath not been alwaies gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) we are liable to the Cenſure of Parliament, And of both theſe we want not freſh Examples. So that certainly this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be acknowledged to be <hi>an unhappy and uncomfortable Condition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am ſure I bring with me a ready and obedient Heart, to pay unto the King all thoſe Duties of Loyalty, Allegeance, and Obedience which I owe unto him; And I ſhall never be wanting towards the Parliament, to pay unto it all thoſe due Rights, and that Obedience which we all owe unto it. But in contrary Commands a Conformity or Obedience to both, is hardly to be lighted on. The Reconciliation muſt be in the Commanders, and the Commands; and not in the Obedience, or the Perſon that is to obey. And therfore untill it ſhall pleaſe God to bleſs us with a right underſtanding betwixt the King and Parliament, and a Conformity in their Commands, neither the Kingdom in publick, nor particular men in private, can be reduced to a ſafe or comfortable Condition.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid thus much to give Occaſion to others to offer likewiſe their Opinions; For if we ſhall ſit ſtill, and nothing (tending to the ſtay of the unhappy miſunderſtandings, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly betwixt the King and his People) be propounded: It is to be feared, that our miſeries will haſten ſo faſt upon us, that the ſeaſon and opportunities of applying Remedies may be paſt.</p>
               <p>I have herein diſcharged my Conſcience, ſuitable to that duty, which I owe to the King my Soveraign and Maſter, and ſuitable to that zeal and affection, which I ſhall ever pay to the happineſs and proſperity of the Kingdom, towards which I ſhall ever faithfully contribute my humble Prayers and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt endeavours. And I ſhall no waies doubt (whatſoever ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs this my Propoſition may have) it will be accompanyed with the good wiſhes of your Lordſhips and of all peaceable and well-minded men.</p>

                  <salute>My Lords,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>YOu were pleaſed not many daies ſince, to declare your diſpleaſure for the printing of a Speech made by me in this Houſe, on the 20 of <hi>May</hi> laſt; and the Cauſe of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure was declared to be, for that the ſaid Speech did ſeem to inſinuate, that my former motions for <hi>Accommodation,</hi> had found but little Acceptance, whereby there was caſt upon the Houſe an Imputation, as though it ſhould not be inclined thereunto.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhips Diſpleaſure in that kind hath given me Incouragement to renew my former Motion, hoping it may be now more ſeaſonable than at former times; At leaſt (MY LORDS) I fear it is at ſuch a ſeaſon, that whoſoever is deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to move for the preventing of a Civill War, ought to ſpeak now, or he may hereafter hold his peace; For differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are reduced to that height of oppoſition, betwixt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and the Houſes, that if ſome ſpeedy means be not laid hold of for the allaying and reconciling of them, it is to be feared, that a very few daies will change our Conteſtations, which yet are but in words and writing, into actions of blood and open Hoſtility, the which certainly may yet by your Lordſhips wiſdoms be prevented; but being once begun, will not be remedied, but after long time, and unſpeakable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries.</p>
               <p>The way that I preſumed formerly to offer was, that this Honorable Houſe would be pleaſed to move, that a ſelect Committee of choiſe Perſons of both Houſes might be nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, who may truly ſtate, and ſet down all things in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95489:47"/>
between the King and the Subject, with the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable waies of reconciling of them: Secondly to deſcend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particulars, which may in reaſon be expected by each from other, either in point of our ſupporting of the King, or of his relieving of us: and laſtly, how all thoſe Conditions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed upon, may be fittingly ſecured.</p>
               <p>MY LORDS, The greateſt difficulty (as appeareth unto me) in this point of <hi>Accommodation</hi> (which ſo highly impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the good of the King, of the Kingdom, and our own) conſiſteth in the beginning of it, For certainly, if it once were put in a way (being accompanyed with the Inclination which your Lordſhips expreſs to it, and with thoſe earneſt deſires which the King profeſſeth by his ſo many Invitations, that we would clearly ſet down all that (from him) would give us ſatisfaction) it could not miſs of a happy, and bleſſed Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: For, in ſubſtance, if our deſires be ſuitable to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, we are agreed: For our profeſſions are that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to pay unto the King all Duties of <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> and to make him <hi>a Glorious King.</hi> The King ſaith, that to thoſe great Liberties and Eaſes which he hath already grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us this Parliament, he is ready to adde any thing that ſhall be (with reaſon) further propounded unto him for our Comfort and Satisfaction, So that little ſeemeth to remain, but that from Generals we fall to the Inviduals, and expreſs particularly what we mean by making him <hi>a Glorious King,</hi> And paying unto him <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Obedience,</hi> And likewiſe that the Individuals for our further Comfort and ſatisfaction be propounded, So that the intentions of the one and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being clearly known, if any thing remain in difference, it may by Treaty, and by calm waies of Debate be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled, Whereas the Profeſſions which are now made on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide of deſiring <hi>an Accommodation,</hi> being only in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, tend rather to a Vindication or Iuſtification of one part againſt the other, than any way to advance <hi>an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> whereas in particular Propoſals, Reaſon and Equity would ſway; and if we do really deſire <hi>Peace,</hi> as we profeſs, we ſhould on both ſides ſtretch toward the effecting of it, whereas if War be once on foot, it is no longer Reaſon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95489:47"/>
and Iuſtice which we make the Rules of our demands and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, but Succeſs; which as it is unequitable, So it is a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en uncertain Rule, bowing and bending to the various chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of War, and of Advantage; And therefore if we do hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily deſire <hi>Peace,</hi> Let's follow our Saviours Counſell, Agree with our Adverſary whilſt he is yet on the way, Otherwiſe we ſhall find by ſad experience, that, that which might now be eaſily prevented, ſhall hardly hereafter be remedied.</p>
               <p>If a War happen to be here in <hi>England,</hi> (which God avert) it cannot be but moſt bloody and feirce, for being ſhut up here in an <hi>Iſland,</hi> we ſhall fight as in a Cock-pit; And there being in the Kingdome few conſiderable ſtrengths, there muſt of neceſſity be more fighting in a year or two, than hath been in the Low Countries in twenty. It is probable the War will not be ſo long, but it will be more bloody; And if we ſhould prevail for the preſent, there will remain a ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of troubles. We all bear a reverence to Monarchy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which, we and our Anceſtors have lived ſo many Ages, And the King is bleſſed with a plentiful Iſſue, And our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and Intentions are not to caſt off juſt Subjection, but to preſerve juſt Liberty, which I am moſt confident we may do without the hazard of a War; And what with our anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Privileges, his Majeſties new Conceſſions, and what he yet further offereth, we may remain the happieſt and the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Subjects that live under any King; The King likewiſe whatſoever Succeſſe he may have, will be no Gainer by a War, For if he ſhould conceive by Force to introduce an Arbitrary Government, (which I am moſt aſſured is far from his thoughts) he will find his own Adherents, his chief oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers; who although they may fight in defence of his Perſon, and juſt Rights, according to their Oaths and Allegance, yet they will be loath to fight themſelves into ſlavery. So that what is good for him, will be good for us, which is an happy and equitable Agreement, and the contrary will make both miſerable, in ſo great a degree, that as now we may be juſtly eſteemed the happieſt Kingdome in <hi>Europe,</hi> and the very En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of all our Neighbours; So in a ſhort time, if a Civill War break in amongſt us, we ſhall remain the Scorn or the Pitty of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:95489:48"/>I am far from thinking that any of your Lordſhips are leſs inclined to an <hi>Accommodation</hi> than my ſelf, but ſome body muſt be the mover, And thoſe miſerable ſpectacles, which mine eyes have of late years beheld in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> make me zealous and importunate, that they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented here, if ſuch be Gods holy will, if not, yet I ſhall have this particular Comfort (what fortune ſoever ſhall befall me) That as I am aſſured that I have had no hand in any thoſe things which have cauſed the unhappy differences betwixt the King and his People, ſo I ſhall appeal unto your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, if I have not been ſubſervient unto your Lordſhips in all things, that might have removed theſe miſunderſtandings, and to have imployed my Indeavours and ſolicitation, even unto Importunity, for the ſetting on foot ſome way of <hi>Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,</hi> wherby only our unſpeakable Calamities (and very near at hand) can be diverted from us.</p>
