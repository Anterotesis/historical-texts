            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>
            <p>AS there was, is, and alwayes ſhall be an Omnipotent, Eternall, Infinite Eſſence, and Being, GOD, which created and faſhioned the Earth and all that therein is, by which, whom, and none other, all things and appearances (light and darkneſs) were created and made: (and by which and whom they ſhalbe ended, and by none other.) In which Creation of Light, he placed Man chiefe King, Ruler, Father &amp; Governor, to Rule, &amp; Govern himſelf firſt: then all other Creatures upon the Earth, according to their ſeveral natures: And gave unto him Laws, as adherent and inherent to his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, profeſſion, office, and nature: in, and according to which, he was, and is to walk, rule, and govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, &amp; all others under him in the univerſe: which Laws were actually obſerved, performed, and kept, by our fore-Fathers inviolable, and ſtedfaſtly maintained to bee the fundamentals, foundations, pillars, and props of Government, by which they injoyed liſe and light, and were free: holding it better the Fabrick to break in ſunder, then the Law to be violated or broken.</p>
            <p>Hearken therefore, O People, learn to know your Laws which make you free, (they are ſhort and eaſie) Make good all your concluſions with your mouths and hearts, and kindle your benummed ſenſes with a conſtant zealous obedience to your greateſt Law-giver, greateſt King and Father JEHOVAH<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (the only end, center, and foundation of your underſtanding, judgement, peace, and reſt,) not regarding pleaſure, profit, honour, popularity, and the like glittering intereſt: but ſtand ſtedfaſt and cloſe in, and to his honour, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, goodneſs, naked truth, and obedience, as it is preſcribed in the Law of our fore-Fathers, abridged in two ſentences, Love God withall thy heart, thy Neighbour as thy ſelfe.</p>
            <p>Every man is a King, Prieſt, &amp; Governor in, to, &amp; over himſelf: Every one in his family is himſelfe, &amp; every thing in that family is for good in that family to every particular perſon. And none hath any thing to do with him, but by his aſſent, (except in a publick neceſſity) if any one taketh any thing from him (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) without his conſent, it is no leſs then Theft and Robbery, and abſolutely againſt the Law of our fore-Fathers, the Law of Nature, and againſt the liberty and freedome of the People and Nation: But if any one ruleth not well, let his judgement come from the Neighborhood, the people who beſt know him, yet gradually from the Peoples Truſtees or Officers.) For judgement centers at every mans doore.</p>
            <p>Man of himſelfe is abſolutely free, ſo long as he keepeth himſelf from Contract: but in caſe he enters into Contract with another, he is no longer free, but bound: therefore that he is in bondage, it procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from himſelfe, and thereby deſtruction is of himſelfe, and there lieth his bondage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for having once contracted, he and they ought to keep faith, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>No man would make a Contract, if he were not thereunto compelled by ſome exigence; for Contract: leads to be performed in time and place; but no Man can command time, place, ability, or power. Surely he is only free, happy man, which keepeth himſelf from any Contract, but what God in Nature hath injoyned him. God in Nature hath made men Kings and Governors (as I ſaid before) to govern well themſelves; now ſee wherein he is bounded by God in Nature, Do as thou wouldeſt be done unto, and no otherwiſe: for therein lies the foundation of the Law, which ſhall judge every particular perſon; for in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſon is the Judge plac'd which ſhall either juſtifie or condemn.</p>
            <p>Follow not the opinions of others, which (rightly conſidered) are meere fancies, and depend more upon your conceſſion, then truth. But (ſtudy the Law of God in Nature) look into thy ſelfe; remember thou art a Stem proceeding from the Stock of the greateſt King, Father, Prieſt, and Prophet, JEHOVAH: that thou art King, Father, Prieſt, Prophet, and Governor over thy ſelfe, and all that he hath given unto thee. Rule Well, and thou art well, for hee that Ruleth muſt be juſt, Ruling in the feare of the Lord: if thou Rule not well, thou art not well, and diſquieted in thy ſelfe: there is thy liberty and thy bondage.</p>
            <p>Return firſt into thy ſelfe, doſt thou Rule well thy minde, thy thoughts, thy words, thy hands, thy feet, nay, even all thy action? (then to others as to thy ſelf) if ſo, then thou art well, and happy ſhalt thou be, for He that Ruleth well is worthy of double honor. To Rule your ſelves well is the high way to be choſen to Rule them which cannot rule themſelves well. Remember unruly <hi>Cain</hi> who murthered his brother <hi>Abel;</hi> the Scripture is full of them, as rebellious <hi>Abſolom,</hi> covetous <hi>Ahab,</hi> proud <hi>Haman,</hi> laſcivious <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and others; did they Rule well?</p>
            <p>Wherefore were Rulers and Governors choſen, but to Rule thoſe well that would not rule themſelves well? which Rulers, and Governors, as elected and choſen by the people, are as ſervants to the people: and in Ruling well, immediate Officers and Servants to JEHOVAH: for they in their adminiſtration, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and admoniſh thoſe which Rule not well: and from hence ſprings the Magiſtracy, and Miniſteriall function, <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, and Pot of Manna; Civill and Eccleſiaſticall proceedings. Heere you may ſee the beginning of Writings, how <hi>Moſes</hi> began, the reſt followed him: here O Men may you diſcern the end of all.</p>
            <p>Now let us beare our ſhame: we have loſt our knowledge, we have periſhed: hath not Covetouſneſs, Pride, and Hypocriſie beene a continuall ſtumbling block? the Judges of the Land have judged unjuſtly, and adminiſtred falſe judgement for bribes, and have led the people in ignorance.</p>
            <p>The Preachers (called the Clergy) have preached falſe Doctrine, venting thoſe things which accrued to their profit and advantage, practiſing covetouſneſs, pride, oppreſſion, laſciviouſneſs, ſuperſtition, Idolatry, and hypocriſie: Indeed preaching and practiſing any thing, for baſe lucre, profit, and gain. Thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but thy Fathers will: what is that will? ask the Law inherent in thy Nature.</p>
            <p>Where a chiefe Ruler is choſen, his Office and duty is, to defend and preſerve thoſe that Rule well: from the pride, couetouſneſs, and oppreſſion of thoſe that Rule ill, and to remove, take away, and deſtroy the cauſe of Ruling ill, and to ſupport and cheriſh thoſe that Rule well.</p>
            <p>Perhaps you will ſay, you have choſe none to Rule over you: indeed every one is not fit to chooſe, becauſe they have loſt their underſtanding; how can he which Ruleth ill himſelfe, chooſe well? his eyes are dim, and his underſtanding clouded? is the blind fit to lead the blind? (no) yet it is the indubitable right of the People to chooſe.</p>
            <p>Now that the Government is not underſtood, you that have had the Ruling, and Teaching Powers, are to be blamed and fhamed, for you have lead the People in ignorance, and onely Ruled, taught, and Lorded for your ſelves.</p>
            <p>If you chalenge a right of governing, as being choſen; then as Governors and Rulers you ought to have the Laws of our fore-Fathers planted in your hearts: which you are to obſerve and practiſe: for if you challenge our fore-Fathers Powers in ruling over the People; then is it but juſt, that the People challenge, you Rule in our fore-Fathers wayes and Lawes, and therein be limitted and bounded; for therein lies the liberty and freedome of the People, and your ſafety.</p>
            <p>Therefore they which chooſe, ought to have skill in Ruling well, in regard thoſe Officers, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors are to be choſen, who have skill in Ruling well: which Officers, and Governours, are no other then Servants, or Truſtees to, and for the People: and ought not to make any by-Laws, but ſuch as center upon the fundamentals, which before they be confirmed and enacted, ought of right to be preſented to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the Sheriff of every County, at their County Courts: as alſo by the Stewards of every Hundred and Liberty at their Courts (which Steward ought to be ſworn for the execution of his Office, which is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neglected) to be approved and allowed of by the People: And in caſe the People find them not good as to the Publick, they may refuſe obedience to that Law, and that Law ought to lie dormant untill the People have choſen wiſer and more faithfull Truſtees, for the altering, or rectifying of ſuch Law: For all by Lawes are alterable, but the fundamentall Law is unalterable: Is not the People greater then their Truſtees, and Officers? The Maſter is more worthy then the Servant.</p>
            <p>You Powers, you Kings in power that give Power, Offices, and places of Truſt (by the Peoples power) are impowred to call them to an account: Therefore look to it, for the People the Kings eyes are upon you. Did the by-Law-makers Rule well in running <hi>ad infinitum</hi> with by-Lawes <hi>Sans</hi> number, till they run themſelves out of doors, and left an <hi>odium</hi> behind them? do not you over-run your ſelves, the Royall Law, the Peoples Right; it is better to ſtand ſtill, leſt you run into confuſion.</p>
            <p>As the People have right to chooſe their owne Officers, it being their Liberty, an Appendix to their Birth-right and Freedome which doth gradually aſcend from the People to their chiefeſt Officers: So are they to let juſtice gradually deſcend and center to, and in the People againe.</p>
            <p>Did thoſe Rulers Rule well, when their benummed Senſes preferred their own pleaſure, profit, honour, and the like, not regarding the honour, worſhip, and obedience to JEHOVAH, when they flighted the Stock (from whence they proceeded) JEHOVAH the greateſt King, the Laws of God in Nature, the Laws of our fore-Fathers, the good and welfare of the People. Nay, ſuffering the pure and perfect Law of God to be Monopolized into a Trade, permitting the inventions of men to be preached to the ignorant (for gain) which the wiſeſt could neither underſtand nor know how to reform, ſo that the People periſhed in want of knowledge, keeping the People in ſubjection, only Ruling and Lording it for themſelves.</p>
            <p>Did they Rule well, when they converted the Publick Treaſure to their own Intereſt? contracted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a ſmaller number, that the Divident might be the greater to them that were left: conniving at each others ill ruling: gratifying one another (as they term'd it) with thouſands, (when the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth wanted money to perfect their great affairs) fully intending never to give an account thereof; they endeavoured to perpetuate themſelves in their unlimited power; laying yoaks upon the Peoples necks, which makes them complain and groan under the burthen of them: denying the People to chooſe other Truſtees (in their places who were ſecluded) whereby their actions might have been diſcovered, and the People eaſed.</p>
            <p>Did they Rule well, when there was not an oppreſſion in the Nation, but (if not contrived and acted by them) was ſolicited by ſome of their Clerks, or Favorites, and connived at by them, whereby juſtice was perverted, and Bribery and oppreſſion practiſed by Authority, (forgetting to be juſt, Ruling in the fear of the Lord) forcing many to travel after them and their Lawes, till they have worne out their Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at the doore: denying aſſiſtance to juſt requeſts, when by a little lip labour they might have made thoſe happy, who have beene compelled by exceſſive expence, (the Mother of want) to leave the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a juſt Cauſe, to the ruine and deſtruction of them and theirs.</p>
            <p>Did they Rule well, in making ſo many Lawes the People can neither number, nor underſtand them; (if they keep them from their ſhoulders:) for in reading them, no man knows where to center; by which and their own wills (being their reaſons) they made double, and treble conſequences, of mens words, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own conſtructions, whereby to accuſe, impriſon, and afflict them. (By the like practiſe Chriſt ſuffered as a Blaſphemer) Mens Words are their own, and the interpretation of them.</p>
            <p>Did they Rule well, when they ſuffered the poor, blind, and lame to periſh in the ſtreets, &amp; high-wayes, (permitting them to want work, and their children bread,) ſetting up the Metall Money (which hee that hoords it deſerves to eat and drinke nothing elſe untill the poore be ſatisfied:) above the whole Creation: Monopolizing the Earth, which if (by the project of a <hi>Kilvertiſt)</hi> they could have Monopolized totally to themſelves, (by their owne Lawes) they might have ejected the people (their Maſters) out of the Land: and it is thought they would have Monopolized the Sun, Moone, and Stars, if it had beene poſſible; nay, God himſelfe, if they could have known where to have found him.</p>
            <p>Did they Rule well, when they were ten Months of twelve in the Country; WAITEing to catch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated men in Bargains, (extorting and oppreſſing the People) for themſelves and others? what excuſed them in their abſence; who when they were in Town, could make their appearance in the morning, and all the day after ſit drinking in Taverns, Bowling Alleys, or—making the members of their bodies (the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt) to be the members of Harlots? Particular failings produce inevitable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction: were they not all breakers of the Royall Law of God planted in Nature?</p>
            <p>A word to thoſe that Rule not well: Doſt thou ſay, do not murder, and wilt thou murder? Doſt thou ſay, do not commit Adultery, and wilt thou commit Adultery? Doſt thou ſay, do not ſteal, and wilt thou ſteal? Doſt thou ſay, do not covet, and wilt thou covet? Doſt thou ſay, be not drunke, and wilt thou be drunke? Doſt thou ſay, be not envious or malicious, and wilt thou be envious and malicious? Doſt thou ſay, do not oppreſs thy neighbour, and wilt thou oppreſs thy neighbour? Doſt thou ſay, doe not ſweare, cheat, and lye, and wilt thou ſweare, cheat, and lye? Do ſo ſtill: he that is filthy let him be filthy ſtill: you are the cauſes of confuſions: There would be no need of Stocks, Houſes of Correction, Whips, Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor Gallows, but for you, whoſoever thou art; Governors, Rulers, and Councels, (yea, and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments too) might meet and have nothing to doe, were it not for you unruly Members; but goe your wayes, you have loſt your Kingly Government, your Prieſtly Government, and Propheticall Office; and ſo are laid aſide, as uſeleſs: Will you over-run God in Nature, the Royall Law inherent in you? O the darkneſs within, which makes the confuſion without!</p>
            <p>A word to all Rulers, and to all of all ſorts: The greateſt King with the greateſt Powers is at your heels; he comes with ſuch force and Powers, that neither Crowns nor Caſtles, walled Cities, nor your weapons of war ſhall prevail: he will put an end to your Tumults, and evil doings by the brightneſs of his coming; then ſhall you come, and give an account of your Kingſhip and Governments: have you Ruled well, or not well? hearken! what means the noyſe from the North, from the South; nay from all quarters? ſome crying out of Priſons, ſome in Priſons, ſome in the Streets and High-wayes; the Creation groanes, and their cries are gone up to the greateſt King JEHOVAH: if you will not amend, and help, and plead the cauſe of the poore, and oppreſſed; and ſet open the Priſon doors, the greateſt King comes with ſalvation and deliverance; and you ſhall ſtand by as Cyphers, and be aſhamed.</p>
            <p>Here I have ſet down your work, you need not trouble your ſelves, except to do well be a trouble to you; (if you pleaſe) underſtand the excellent foundations of God, his Lawes planted in Nature, which will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct you to the underſtanding of his Prophets, Apoſtles, the Scriptures; yea, things to come: Wherefore if you covet any thing, let it be Love and Meekneſs, towards all; Man being indeed limitted, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded within that excellent Law of God in Nature: which is for the ordering of every particular Member, in every particular Man in good and for good; and if he ſteps out of that bound to govern another, it muſt be by contract; for otherwiſe it begetteth enmity; from hence ſpringeth the great confuſions in the world: If we ſee one that Ruleth not well, it is our duty to adviſe him in love and meekneſs, that he Rule well.</p>
