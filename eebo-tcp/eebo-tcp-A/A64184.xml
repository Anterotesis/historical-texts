            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Adam</hi> was not created an Infant, he was made of full strength and vigour, as at 40 or 50 yeares of age, of perfect stature, with an able body, fit for Generation, because he was to be the common Father by whom Mankind should be propagated; his soul was furnished with all naturall Sciences; he was the first Doctour to whom all Mankinde was to goe to Schoole, to learn of him (as of a Master) the secrets of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the Inventions of Art, the knowledge of God, and the mysteries of Faith.</p>
            <p>Inveterate and dispitefull malicious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have oftentimes seemed to be reconciled, but it hath been for the plotting, contriving, or attempting some perfidious and mischievous actions; but they seldom or never did combine for any love which they bare either to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, Manners, Laws, or Conditions of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:

For the Heathen Nations had divers se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall damnable gods, and detestable Religions, and by reason of their diversities of opinions, they hated one another deadly, with implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and irreconcileable hatred, yet, in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness they could joyn and agree together, against the true God and his Church, as all times, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and Histories have found and declared; and most excellently hath the Kingly Prophet and Propheticall Psalmist described the doings and qualities of these various people, in the 83. Psalm, where he saith, that,</p>

            <p>The Fools immitation, the Courts Ambition, the Cities surfet, and the Countries poyson, Divinity hath opposed and threatned it, Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity hath condemned it, Epigrams hath Jeefd it, Satyrs have whip'd it, and if we do not tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Repent it, God will justly Judge it.</p>
            <p>Books and Epistles, (or Letters) if they treat of Vertue, they are not only good, but the best company a man can keep; but they are the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest Counsellors for direction of mens lives and actions; they have no fearfull hearts, or hearts to fear; they have no blushing faces, or faces to blush; they dare boldly call <hi>Nero</hi> a bloudy Tyrant, <hi>Midas</hi> a covetous Asse, <hi>Sardanapalus</hi> a lascivious Effeminate foole, <hi>Heliogabalus</hi> a wast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full profuse Whoremaster, and <hi>Messalina</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satiate and imperious Strumpet; for Books do never alter their intended purpose, nor breake off their discourse in hope of favour, or fear of mens anger or displeasure.</p>
            <p>A man that loves me well, and a friend that is firme unto me, they are both rare in these daies, but if I were put to my choise, which of those I would first lose, or part withall, then I would leave my Lover, and keep my Friend: For he that loves may not alwayes be a friend, but it is certain that he that is a Friend alwaies loves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:44365:4"/>God in pardoning of a sinner shews his great mercy, his not pardoning is no injustice; for if I do forgive one Debter and sue another, I have shewed kindness to one, and no wrong to the other.</p>
            <p>Let us doe our best, to doe our best; and if power be not able, let good endeavour not be idle; let us be as wise as the unjust Steward, if we cannot pay all that we owe, let us pay all that we are able, for God is so gracious, that with him our good wills are taken for good deeds.</p>
            <p>Our first miseries came by Eating, and our Saviour suffered 40 daies fasting for it; then as our Parents did eat themselves and us soul-sick, so we must fast for our souls health; for as ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with delight expulst us out of the <hi>Paradise</hi> Terrestriall, so fasting and contrition must be our punishment and practise and helps to bring us to the Heavenly <hi>Jerusalem:</hi> the Prodigall, by fasting, said, <hi>I dye with hunger,</hi> and that hunger made him say, <hi>I will go to my Father, &amp;c.</hi>

This is the Devils kindness to leave a man a wicked Wife to worke his confusion.</p>
            <p>Though Churches have the Names of Saints, yet they are the houses of the Lord; they are dedicated or given to God, therefore they are Gods houses. <hi>Bethel</hi> was the house of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. And before the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built, when <hi>Davids</hi> son was dead, hee went into the house of the Lord, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. The Temple is the house of Prayer, <hi>Isa.</hi> 56. 7. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 13. Christ cast out and whipt forth of the Temple all the buyers and sellers. <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.
<pb facs="tcp:44365:5"/>
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. All Churches, or houses of Praier are materiall Temples. The Temple of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was as the Cathedrall, yet there were in that City 480. Synagogues besides; all those Synagogues were as materiall Churches for the people to congregat together to serve God; in many of those Synagogues our Saviour preached often and openly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 20. Those Houses, which we Christians do call Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, were to shelter and defend the people in them that did assemble, from the injury and violence of winde and weather. And the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that were, are, or ever shall assemble and meet in the fear of God, in true faith in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> in those materiall Temples or Churches made with hands, those true Beleevers are all in all places, tongues, languages, and Nations, the true Church and spirituall spouse of Christ built upon the Rock. And although materiall Churches of lime and stone may be ruined and spoiled by all consuming Time, or want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, or the fury of War, as <hi>Jerusalems</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Temple and many other Churches have beene and are defaced and defiled. Yet the Church that is not made with hands, that is true, Catholike, and Apostolically founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rock; that Church, the Holy Ghost is with alwaies to the end of the World, and the Gates of Hell shall never prevaile against her, <hi>Math.</hi> 16. But concerning our materiall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44365:5"/>
they be Gods school-houses, the Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers (that are called and sent from God) are the School-masters and Gods Ushers; and we are, or should be the Scholers, but wee have madly broke up School, plaid the michers and truants, abused the Schoole-master, and spoyled the School-house.</p>
            <p>Gentle and good counsell or reprehension are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable if well bestowed, and humbly accepted; <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> was a man endued with eloquence, and mighty in knowledge, and expounding the Scriptures, <hi>Acts 18</hi> yet hee came for instruction and counsell to <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla,</hi> a poor simple mechanick man and his wife. For so that good may be done, it matters not how mean, or unlearned, how yong or old the parties are that do it. I do beleeve the Resurrection, though weak women were the first that reported it, <hi>Mark 16.9. Joh. 20. 18. Timothy</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were both very yong when they were called to be Preachers: And <hi>Peter,</hi> the elder Apostle, was contented to be rebuked by <hi>Paul</hi> which was the yonger, <hi>Gal. 2.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many good men have had children of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary natures, dispositions, and qualities; <hi>Adam</hi> had a cursed <hi>Cain,</hi> and innocent <hi>Abel; Noah</hi> had good <hi>Sem,</hi> and wicked <hi>Cham; Abraham</hi> had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall <hi>Ishmael,</hi> and spirituall <hi>Isaack; Isaack</hi> had hated <hi>Esau</hi> and beloved <hi>Jacob; David</hi> had wise <hi>Salomon,</hi> and proud <hi>Absolom.</hi>

or 6. years, for which hee was accused to bee turned from his Religion, and fallen into Papistry. And being examined by a Bishop and some other Divines, they found him fast and firm in the Protestant Doctrine: then he was asked, what was the cause that he refray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to come to Church in so long a time: to which he answered, that when he was last at Church, then hee heard a most sufficient Lesson for him to practise and follow; and when hee had well learned that one good Lesson, he would go to Church and fetch another; they demanded what were the words contayned in that Lesson? he replied: it was in the 39. Psalme, <hi>I have said I will take heed to my waies, that I offend not with my tongue.</hi> By this one Text we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and exhorted, to say well and doe well; wherein are included all the Rules and Grounds of Christianity and Christian Religion.</p>
            <p>It is a question whether are more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, either people or sheaves of corn; every sheaf doth not yeeld much above halfe a peck one with another: the least Child doth spend the quantity of a peck every yeare, and it may be thought that every man or woman do eat at the least a bushell: In this may be seen the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and mercifull providence of God, in feeding so many. Let these mercies bee with thankfulness considered, that the ox, calf, sheep, buck, all Beasts on the Earth feeding, Fowls of the Ayr, Fishes of the Sea, Fruits of the Field, Orchard, or Garden; they are running, flying,

swimming, growing this day, and the next day they are translated into the sustenances and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of the flesh and bloud of every man and woman.</p>

               <hi>A ship is a right embleme, hieroglyphick of Gods Church Militant: the world is the sea she sails in, the storms and tempests that assault and beat against her are persecutions, the haven she steers to anker in, is Heaven, the Pilot is Christ, the marriners are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Apostles, godly Ministers, and painfull Pastors; the passengers are all true beleeving Christians; the main Mast of this ship is Christs Crosse, the sailes are pious profession, the fair and prosperous wind is the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, the contrary winds are Satans blustering, or false doctrine, the Card and Compass is Gods word, to sail as that directs, the Needle to the fixed North Pole is Faith, the cables, ropes, sheats, tacks, braces, and boleins, and other cords are Love, the Anchor is hope, prayers, tears, and penitentiall sighs are the Ordnance, the food (or victualls) are the Sacraments, and Gods good pleasure is the Rudder.</hi>

            <p>We have to doe with a mercifull God, that will make the best of our intents and actions, who hates all captious rigorous sophistry and Sophisters; that misinterpret and construe all things to the worst; for God hath a touchstone to try Faith, whether it be right or counterset, he weighs it not in the Ballance, he esteems the puritie of the qualitie more then the heaviness of the quantitie. Christ bids us be holy, as he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44365:7"/>
is holy, which though we cannot attain to, yet let us do our good will. Though we cannot fast and pray, and please God as he did, yet it is our best and safest way to do our endeavours to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him as near as we can.</p>
            <p>If we sow the seed of Sin, we may expect a Harvest of Judgement, for such seed as we sow, such fruit we shall reap; as we measure to others, such shall be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd unto us: for in the 1. Chapter of <hi>Judges, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibezeck</hi> is Recorded, that he caused the fingers and toes of 70 Kings to be cut off, and afterward he was so serv'd himself. <hi>Absolom</hi> killed his Brother <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and <hi>Joab</hi> killed <hi>Absolom;</hi> also <hi>Joab</hi> killed <hi>Abner</hi> and <hi>Amasa</hi> cowardly, and <hi>Joab</hi> was killed for killing: The Amalekite that belied himself, in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging word to <hi>David</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> was dead, and that he had slain him, <hi>David</hi> caused him to be slain, because he confest himself to have killed the King. These ex-amples are in the sacred Scriptures plentifully Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: Because of unrighteous dealing and wrong, and riches gotten by deceit, Kingdoms have been turned and translated from one People to another, for the rash and harsh answer of <hi>Roboham</hi> caused <hi>10</hi> Tribes of Israell to fall from him to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> and after that the whole house of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> were rooted out by <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sha,</hi> the house of <hi>Baasha</hi> was destroyed by <hi>Zimri,</hi> the house of <hi>Ahab</hi> utterly overthrown by <hi>Jehu;</hi> and 31 Kingdoms were taken from bad Kings and wicked Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and given to the Israelites.

               <hi>Lucifer</hi> is Lord of Pride, Presumption, and Ambition, <hi>Isay.</hi> 14. Secondly, <hi>Belzebub,</hi> is for Envy, and Malice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.

The seventh is <hi>Belphegor,</hi> for Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony and Drunkenness. It hath alwayes been the practises of the Devill to strive to be hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as God, for he would have been God, but because he could not, hee hath playd the Ape with counterfet imitation, to be honoured with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44365:8"/>
and in such manner as God was adored and worshipped withall, for when God was served with Sacrifices by true Believers, the Devill was served, by Pagans and Infidels, with Hecatombs of Beasts, and sacrificed children, even by Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, Kings &amp; Princes; and as God had and hath his Priests, the Devil had his Archflammings, and Flammings; and in these daies hee hath Hypocriticall Ministers, more then a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: God hath his Sacraments, the Devill hath his Expiations and Ceremonies; God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a Heaven to his servants, and threatneth a Hell to willfull and impenitent sinners, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill promiseth his servants Elizium fields, and threatneth with his Stygian Lake.</p>
            <p>The Pagans had a wicked, foolish, and abominable number of strange Gods, some worshipped the <hi>Sunne,</hi> some adored the <hi>Moon,</hi> some reverenced the <hi>Stars;</hi> in the ship (when <hi>Jonas</hi> was in the storm) they had almost as many ungodly Gods to pray to, as there were persons; for every one prayed or cried to his owne God, and they did bid <hi>Jonas</hi> pray to his God. At <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> they had so many Temples wherein they ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red severall damnable Gods, that they were fain to erect one Temple to the unknown God, Act. 17. 23. The <hi>Tirians</hi> and <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> did fetter and chain their Gods, and imprison them, because they should not run or flie from them; so also did other Nations. Some held the <hi>fire</hi> to bee the greatest God, others honoured the <hi>water,</hi> as greater in power then
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44365:8"/>
the <hi>fire,</hi> because <hi>water</hi> will quench <hi>fire.</hi> Some others worshipped the <hi>Earth,</hi> for her fruitfulnesse, for bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, feeding, and being the common mother of All. Some thought the <hi>Ayre</hi> to be God, for its purity and subtilty, for its ubiquitary, being in all places, because where there is no Ayre there is no life. Some bad the <hi>Sea,</hi> and Sea Gods in great adoration, <hi>Thetis, Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Proteus, Driades, Hammadriades,</hi> and some attributed Divinity to well deserving men and women, as <hi>Janus, Hercules, Ceres;</hi> some esteemed the 7. Planets for Gods; others had <hi>Dogges, Cats, Rats, Crocodiles, Serpents, Fruits, Garlicks, Onions,</hi> and the Divell himself, to be their Gods.</p>
            <p>The people were so zealous in their irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Religions, that they built stately and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent Temples; in <hi>Ephesus</hi> there was a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Diana,</hi> which with the labour of 100000 men, was 20. yeers a building; the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites,</hi> they built high places to <hi>Baal,</hi> in the valley of <hi>Benhinnom;</hi> there they sacrificed their sonnes and daughters to <hi>Molech,</hi> Jer. 32. 35 <hi>Baal, Molech,</hi> or <hi>Milcom,</hi> are all one Idoll. It had the form of the face of a <hi>Bullocke,</hi> it was hollow, made of Brasse; at the sacrificing of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they used to bear Drums, and make noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses with divers sorts of loud Instruments, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the parents, kindred, or friends of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed children, should not hear the cries and shrieks that they roared in their tortures. The Israelites had <hi>a molten Calfe in Horeb,</hi> the more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44365:9"/>
Calves they. The Philistims had their <hi>Dagon.</hi> Many Nations of the Gentiles worshipped <hi>Baal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Peor,</hi> or <hi>Priapus,</hi> Numb. 25. 3. <hi>Baalzeebub,</hi> a Lord of flies, God of <hi>Ekron,</hi> or <hi>Acheron;</hi> this I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol King <hi>Ahaziah</hi> sent to for helpe when hee was sick. And thus the Devill hath in all ages and places bewitched and blinded the people with hellish heathenish Idolatry and superiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it is too true, as lamentable experience shewes us, that all our Divisions, Breaches, Rents, Sects, and seperations, do most clearly shew and manifest that the inveterate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice that the Devill hath ever borne against God and his Church is as violent now as ever it was.</p>
            <p>Such servants as do sow good services do deserve to reap good wages for their labour; wherefore should I expect more respectfull services from my servant then I do to my God? if God should mark, or remember, all my faults, what a miserable wretched thing were I! Though servants be the feet, yet the feet are as necessary to go, as the eyes are to see; all have <hi>Adam</hi> for their earthly Father, and God for their heavenly; we are all Brethren, we have all one God, all one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore we do not say, when we pray, My Father, or Thy Father, or His Father, Her Father, or Their Father; but we are commanded to say, Our Father, &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Charles de Fonseca,</hi> in his 14. Sermon, <hi>pag.</hi> 222. Printed by <hi>Adam rslip, Anno</hi> 1629. this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Relation, word for word, truly copied.</p>

               <head>The Remarkable Relation that <hi>Pilate</hi> made to <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperour, concerning <hi>Christ,</hi> full of admiration and pity.</head>
               <p>IN <hi>this Kingdome there was a wonderfull strange man, his behaviour and beauty beyond all other in the world; his discretion and wisdome celestiall, his gravity and soberness of cariage beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison, his words mysticall, the grace wherewith he delivered them strook his Enemies with astonishment. Never man saw him laugh, weep they have. His works savoured of more then Man. He did never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harm, but much good hath he done to many: he hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by hundreds such as had been sick of incurable diseases: he cast out Divels, he raised the dead, and his miracles, being numberless, they were done all for others good. He did not work any miracle wherein was to be seen the least vanity or boasting in the world. The Jews, out of envy, layd hold on him, and with a kind of hypocrisie and outward humility, (rather see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming then being Saints) trampled him under foot, and mard his cause. I whipt him to appease their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the people being about to mutiny, I condemnd him to the death of the Cross. A little before he brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed his last he desired of God that he would forgive
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44365:10"/>
those his Enemies which had nayled him to the Cross. At his death there were many prodigious signes, both in Heaven and Earth; the Sunne was darkned, the Graves were opened, and the dead arose. After hee was dead, a foolish Jew thrust a speare into his side, shewing the hatred in his death, which the Jews bore unto him in his life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Contraries never did agree, nor ever will be brought to any conformity. <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> the <hi>Ark</hi> and <hi>Dagon, Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat, God</hi> and <hi>Belial, Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ishmael, John</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus, fire</hi> and <hi>water, good</hi> and <hi>bad, vice</hi> and <hi>vertue, light</hi> and <hi>darkness.</hi> Amongst all these, there never was, is, or ever will be any unity or friendship, eyther in Heaven, in Earth, in the City, in the Church, in the Bath, in the Family, in the Womb, or in the World.</p>
               <p>Four of mans best friends have brought forth four wicked Daughters; the first friend is <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,</hi> and shee hath beene the mother of <hi>Envy.</hi> The second is <hi>Peace,</hi> and shee brought <hi>Idleness</hi> into the World. The third is <hi>Truth,</hi> and shee hath brought forth a wicked Brat called <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</hi> The fourth is <hi>Familiarity,</hi> and shee hath brought amongst us a forgetfull, proud, sawcy Knave, called <hi>Contempt.</hi>

may returne and fight, hee that dies cannot. <hi>Jacob</hi> fled from <hi>Esau, Moses</hi> from <hi>Pharaoh, Elias</hi> from <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> scaped away when he was let down in a Basket from the Walls of <hi>Damascus.</hi> The vertue of <hi>Fortitude,</hi> is alwayes between two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams, <hi>Daring and Dreading; David</hi> who killed a Lion and a Bear, who vanquished and slew the Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant <hi>Goliah,</hi> who brought 200. foreskins of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listins</hi> to King <hi>Saul,</hi> who was valiant and victoriously glorious and renowned, yet hee fled from <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chish</hi> King of <hi>Gath,</hi> 1. Sam. 21. 10. 13. He also did flie from the fury of the sword of his disobedient and rebellious son <hi>Absolon,</hi> 2. Sam. 17. 21. 22. also he fled at other times. <hi>Christ,</hi> who conquered sin, death, and hell, fled into AEgypt, Matth. 2. 14.

               <p>The tongue is double walled, fenced, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenched with teeth, gummes, and lips, (which are rampiers and bulwarks;) the two eyes are centinells, and the eares doe lie perdue; which shews that we should hear and see twice as much as we speak. There hath beene many a man ruined by too much talking, but very few have received any great damage by being silent: the tongues chiefe office should bee to pray, and to prayse God, but it is a treacherous retestable part for the tongue of any man to pray or wish the damnation of his owne body and soule, (as too many Roarers doe every day

and houre) with impious execrations, as God damn, sink, renounce, consume, forsake, con found, &amp;c. The tongue of man was not crea ted for such damnable purposes: it was a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome amongst the ancient Romans to learne first to bee silent, and secondly to speake; but there are a generation of tautallogicall tongue men, who do neither know how to speake, or when to hold their peace. A wise mans tongue is in his heart, but a fools heart is in his tongue, Eccl. 21. For he that doth nothing but talke, doth talk nothing. To speak against the Truth is the Divels Rhetorick; and to talke against Reason is vain babling and prating, more fit for a <hi>Parrot</hi> then a man: <hi>Salomons</hi> counsell is, <hi>Let thy words be few,</hi> Eccles. 5. 1. <hi>Jesus</hi> the son of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> sayth, <hi>Make not much babling when thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, Eccl.</hi> 7. 14. <hi>Christ,</hi> the son of God, wiser then <hi>Salomon,</hi> or the son of <hi>Syrach,</hi> he counsels us to use no <hi>vain Repetitions when we pray,</hi> Matth. 6.

By this it may be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it is vain to trust in man.</p>
               <p>The Arian Heretiques denied the Eternity of <hi>Christ,</hi> and that there was a time when <hi>Christ</hi> was not. But all faithfull true beleeving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians doe know <hi>Christ</hi> to bee Eternall and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equall with the Father; for <hi>Christ is the wisdome of God the Father,</hi> therefore Eternall. For it is Blasphemy, in the highest degree, to hold the opinion of <hi>Arius;</hi> for if <hi>Christ</hi> at any time had been from God the Father, then had the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God been also absent from God, for <hi>Christ</hi> is the wisdom of the Father.</p>
               <p>Though a Priest or Preacher do live a licentious life, yet if his Doctrine be good, it is our safest way to receive it.

not a jot the worse.</p>
               <p>As our manifold sinnes doe extreamly cry to God for Vengeance, so our miserable estate and condition should always incite and move us uncessantly to cry for mercy.</p>

Resurrection, and Ascension; all these Prophets and Seers, were directed by one and the same Spirit, the Holy Ghost: he 70. Interpreters were of sundry Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Languages, many of them having never conversed, or spake to, nor scarce saw each other; yet they were all guided and inspired by the same Spirit, that they miraculously interpreted and in an unity collected an uniform and exact Originall Translation of the sacred Scriptures, both Mysticall and Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall.</hi>

                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:44365:13"/>If we compare the times past with the dayes wherein we live, we shall finde much alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for I read that in the 11. yeer of the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the third, that a quarter of Wheat was but at the price of 2s. a far Oxe 6s. 8d. a fat sheep 6d. 6. Pidgeons 1d. a fat Goose 2d. a fat Pig 1d. and the Rates of all Rents and all other necessaries were at Prices according. And it is probable that there were as many people in those dayes as are now; for in the 22 yeer of the same King, there was a great Plague and mortality of People in England, so that in lesse then 6. months, from the 12. of January to the last of June, there died in <hi>London,</hi> and the Liberties 57374. persons; and in <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> there died 7052. So likewise the Infection was so hot spred over the Kingdome, that it swept many thousands away in many places: by which may bee perceived how populous Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was 400. yeers ago. Also Ireland did then pay 30000. yeerly tribute to the English crown. See Sir <hi>Richard Bakers</hi> Chronicle.</p>
               <p>God is more mercifuil then Man can be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if Man can bee truly sorrowfull. Nor can Man commit any sinne, but, against it, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Mercies hath provided many wayes and meanes to restraine it; hee hath given us a Law of Nature, and a reason to obey that Law he hath printed and graved in the hearts and bodies of men; and this Law doth shew and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44365:13"/>
teach us what to doe, and what not to doe; it makes us to know good and evill, it directs us to vertue, it resists vices; and this much the very law of Nature hath dictated into the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable soules of men.</p>
               <p>But to this unwritten law of Nature, Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God was pleased to adde a supernaturall written Law, declared in the Decalogue, (or ten Commandements.) But when time was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and Prophesies accomplished of Christs comming, (he being come) from him wee had a new Law to guide us to that perfection as becomes Christians.</p>
               <p>And because this Law is petpetuall and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable, our great and gratious Law giver hath appointed Pastors and Preachers to direct us in the observation thereof, and he hath also ordayned Magistrates to have power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to see the Law put in execution, and to inflict punishment upon the contemners and transgressors of the same.</p>
               <p>For the further direction and observation of this Law, God hath placed a sharpe and just Judge, called Conscience, in the breast of every man or woman, which Judge doth impartially accuse or excuse the unjust or just.</p>
               <p>This Judge Conscience, deters and affrights us from many uncleane and unlawfull words and works; it binds us, as it were, to the good behaviour, it keeps us in aw, it is both a school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>master
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44365:14"/>
and a Corrector, it teacheth us our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it tells us our faults without flattery, it is the eye of the soule, for as the body is ruled and directed by the eye, so is the soul guided, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and corrected by the Conscience.</p>
               <p>It tells us what is lawfull, what is illegall; it is a witness that accuseth and evidenceth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, it is a Judge that condemnes or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quits us, as it findes us guilty or not guilty; it is also a terrible Executioner of Justice, and justly it torments with due punishment all our misdoings.</p>
               <p>In Naturall reason wee may perceive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcience to be a binding Law, for when a man is about to put in practise any wicked act, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of prophanenesse against God, or abuse to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, presently Conscience forbids it, and commands him to remember that God sees his thoughts and actions, and to have that just precept in his minde, <hi>Whatsoever thou wouldst that men should doe unto thee, doe thou the same unto them;</hi> for Conscience is a Law wherein no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse is to bee admitted, no evasion or illusion, no bribe, cloke, cover or dispensation can make this Evidence mute, for it will declare the Truth, and the whole Truth, without the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement of a tittle.</p>
               <p>Thus is Conscience not onely a Law; but a witnesse against us for all our open and secret transgressions, whether wee bee on Sea, or on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44365:14"/>
Land, sleep or awake, at bed or boord, at home or abroad, in company or alone, Conscience still cryes out against the guilty.</p>
               <p>This Witnesse is a true and a stout Preacher, diligent in his function, he is no idle non Resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and though a man be never so secret and silent, yet his Conscience will not be put to si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Thou canst not stop the cars of thy soul, but it will ever heare thy Conscience cry out, and it will be ever telling thee such things as thou couldst wish were not; our first Parents after their great sinne of disobedience, their Conscience so accused them, that for fear and shame they hid themselves amongst Bushes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cains</hi> Conscience was so shrill and vehement in crying out against him for his murdering of his innocent brother <hi>Abel,</hi> that he cried out, and in despairing of mercy from God, confest his crime to bee more then God would or could forgive. The sonnes of <hi>Jacob</hi> when they were in distresse, their Consciences plainly told them that their afflictions fell on them for their false unnaturall selling of their Brother <hi>Joseph: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science is twice 500 Witnesses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as Conscience is a Law to guide us, and a Witnesse to accuse us, so it is an impartiall Judge to condemn us if we be faulty, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit us if we be clear and innocent; if <hi>Cain</hi> had appealed from the sharp judgement seat of his own Conscience, to the high Tribunall of Gods
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44365:15"/>
mercy, then instead of destroying desperation, he had found Remission and Salvation. The Centurion humbly did acknowledge himselfe to bee so unworthy a Sinner, that he was not worthy <hi>Jesus</hi> should come under his Roofe; that meek and faithfull acknowledgement caused Christ in compassion to cure his sick servant, for there was never any sinners that by penitent appealing from the rigorous sentences of their own Consciences, to the Throne of Grace, but their appeals procured their pardons, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the sacred Stories of <hi>David, Manasses, Mary Magdalen,</hi> and other penitent and blessed Souls. Thus though we flatter our selves in our follies, yet our Consciences will neither bee brib'd nor flatter'd.</p>
               <p>Confcience being a just Law, a true Accuser, and an upright incorrupt Judge; it followeth in the last place, that it is a terrible Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who with a Vermin called the Worme os Conscience, doth continually gnaw the souls of impenitent sinners, for though there may be some fruitlesse shaddow of painted pleasure in the conceiving of sinne, yet that conception is presently check'd, reprov'd, grudg'd, and grumbled at by the Conscience; but when the soul is delivered of this impious Imp, then the Worm gnaws most tormentingly: for instance of this, there needs no more proofs then the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed case of <hi>Judas,</hi> who after he had concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44365:15"/>
and brought forth the damnable Treason of betraying his gracious and innocent Master, his Conscience so tormented him, that hee thought Hell would yield him more ease and lesse terrour, and therefore hee despairing hang'd himselfe, to be freed from the horror of the continuall sting of a gnawing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
               <p>It is a perpetuall torture that will never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a sinner to take rest, till such time as by true Repentance and amendment of life, he be clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed from his former transgressions; if hee bee waking or sleeping, it frets and galls him with bitter remorse, or affrights and scares him with fearfull dreams, wheresoever he goes, it make<gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 letter">

or outward proofs doth manifest unto them, and yet for all their testimonies and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, they so often erre in their judgements: But Conscience beareth sway over our outsides and insides both, it governes, rules, approves, reprooves, clears, and punisheth all our inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and exteriour thoughts, words, and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (as is before declared) for Conscience is clear sighted, and sees all.</p>
               <p>Conscience hath sundry divisions and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions; for we use to say that such as do rake, scrape, and ravenously devour mens lives and livelyhoods, in joyning house to house, land to land, eyther by oppression, extortion, fraud, or force, they care not how so they have it. Some men will say that all such Caterpillers have large Consciences, and some are in the mind that they have no Conscience at all. To put a <hi>medium,</hi> or mean, betwixt these two extreams, of too large (or large Conscience) and no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, let every man examine himselfe, and they will quickly find that each of them hath a Conscience (though not visible, yet invisible) that will tell him how it is with him, eyther well or ill according as he hath used his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science.</p>
