         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVE have this Relation,
by a Gentleman who
was taken Priſoner at
<hi>Londonderry</hi> by ſome
of King <hi>James</hi>'s Men the eighteenth
of <hi>April</hi> laſt, and from thence carried
to <hi>Dublin</hi> by a ſtrong Guard, where
he was forced to give in 5000 <hi>l</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
for his Appearance every day
at the Caſtle: But ſeeing that King
<hi>James</hi> had ſo good Intelligence every
day from <hi>England,</hi> he perſwaded his
Bail to come for <hi>England;</hi> who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
left <hi>Dublin</hi> the. 26th of, <hi>June,</hi> in
a ſmall Wherry, with only two Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
and arriving at <hi>Moſſen</hi> the 29th
of the ſame Month came to <hi>London</hi>
the 2d inſtant. Who certainly affirms:</p>
            <p>That Collonel <hi>Kirk</hi> has been in the
River of <hi>Londonderry</hi> for three weeks
paſt; but could not get in by reaſon of
ſome Floats of Timber which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
has ſunk at <hi>Brook-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That about the firſt of <hi>June</hi> the
Royal Regiment marched from <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
towards <hi>Londonderry,</hi> where they
intended to do great Feats; but the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
bravely ſallying out, killed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Man of them, except only two Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants,
who eſcaped on Horſe-back;
In purſuing of whom, the Beſieged
got a brave Prey of Three Hundred
Cows, and other Proviſions: The
next day the Enemy ſent to have leave
to bury their Dead, which was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
in the mean time, while they
were at work, Collonel <hi>Walker</hi> had
occaſion to ſend a Meſſage to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
General, by a Captain of the
Gariſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after he had deliver'd his
Meſſage, and was returning back, one
of the <hi>French</hi> Officers drew his Sword,
and vowed that he would revenge his
Friends Blood upon the Rogue, and
immediately r<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n him through the
Back, and killed him. The Town
had immediate News of the ſaid Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and Sallyed out, upon which
the Enemy, according to their old Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,
took to their Heels.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>Iniskilling,</hi> if they could be
provided with Ammunition, it would
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98716:2"/>
hold out for Twelve Months; for
they have all the Cows, Sheep, and
Salt, that was in the Three Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Counties: They have made
two very Large Redoubts, incloſing
all the Iſland, that was about the
Town; ſo that they have Graſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
under the Command of their
Guns, to keep their Horſes; which
conſiſts of 1500, their Foot of 5000.
The Enemy never made any Attempt
there, only upon their March to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donderry,</hi>
they thought to have taken
it in by the way, but were defeated
with the Loſs of Four Pieces of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,
and 15 Barrels of Powder, and
Shot equal, which they had not time
to Plant; for the Beſieged Sallied out,
and took their Cannon, with the Loſs
only of Ten men; and kill'd 40 of
the Enemy.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtants of <hi>Dublin</hi> and <hi>Drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heda</hi>
live pretty peaceably; but all the
Country beſides, though they have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections,
yet nevertheleſs they are day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Robb'd, Plundered and abuſed by
the Soldiers and Rabble: And when
complaint is made, they have no ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi> is out of all
Imployment, and hath betook himſelf
to a private Lodging at <hi>Chappel-Lizard;</hi>
Collonel <hi>Macharty</hi> finding King <hi>James</hi>
kinder to the <hi>French</hi> than to the <hi>Iriſh,</hi>
ſaid one day in a Tavern, That he
would lay down his Commiſſion,
rather than be ſubjected to the <hi>French.</hi>
Next morning ſomebody told King
<hi>James,</hi> who immediately ſent for him;
who, inſtead of denying, or excuſing
what he had ſaid, added much more:
So that he inſenſed the King ſo much
againſt him, that he diſpoſed of
all his Imployments to the <hi>French;</hi>
He was Major General of the Army,
Governor of <hi>Cork,</hi> and Collonel of a
Regiment of Horſe: this happened
upon the 16th of <hi>June;</hi> the 17th, in
the evening, he went out of Town on
Horſe-back with one Servant towards
<hi>Kilmanan,</hi> it was thought he went to
<hi>Chappel-Lizard</hi> to <hi>Tyrconnel.</hi> The Lord
<hi>Brittas</hi> being much in favour with the
King, was unfortunately at the <hi>Globe
Tavern</hi> upon <hi>Cork-Hill</hi> with ſome
<hi>French</hi> Officers, ſomebody came into
the Room, and gave an account
that there was an Expreſs arrived
from <hi>France,</hi> giving an account of
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s being with Child; but
it was his ill luck to ſay, That if ſhe
was with Child, it was got by the
<hi>French</hi> King: next morning it came
to King <hi>James</hi>'s ear, who imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
ſent for him, and turned him
out of his Command, as Collonel of
Foot, and gave it to a <hi>French</hi> Captain
before his face, upon which my Lord
went immediately into the Country,
and will not return any more, it is
thought.</p>
            <p>Their whole Army of <hi>Ireland,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
them that are in the Gariſons,
conſiſts of but 15000 Foot, and 5000
Horſe and Dragoons, ſuch as they are.
There is at the Siege of <hi>Derry</hi> 9000
Foot, and 2000 horſe, the reſt is all
ſcattered up and down There is
Coin'd in <hi>Dublin</hi> Shillings and Six pences
of Copper, with the <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi>
in the middle on the one ſide, and <hi>James
Rex</hi> on the other.</p>
            <p>All the old Furnaces and Brewing-Kettles
are called in by Order, and
thoſe they make this Coin of; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this Invention, they had no way
of Paying their Army.</p>
