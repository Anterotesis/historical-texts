            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe Fame that is ſpread abroad of this Well, by thoſe that have had the fortune to uſe it, is not unknown to many, nor the Malice neither of ſome Perſons to all Mankind but themſelves; no marvail then if exerciſed againſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of this Water that is ſo much for their benefit: I wiſh ſuch have not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make uſe of it, as ſome of the like ſtamp have done, that have cryed it down in publick, and for the Curing of their own Diſtempers make uſe of it in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate;
<pb facs="tcp:94825:4"/> with ſuch ſucceſs as to perform what all their Choiceſt-Medicaments have fail'd in. Like many Phyſitians, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding that to others, which they uſe themſelves.</p>
            <p>It being indeed the Intereſt of the leſs Generous minded, both Phyſitians and Surgeons, to beat down the fame of Cures done by this Water, to inhanſe their own Advantage, though to the utter ruine of many Diſeaſed Perſons.</p>
            <p>But we need not ſpend the Readers, nor our own time in vindicating this Well from the aſpertion of ſuch, or indeed of any: It is ſufficiently able by the daily effects of its Virtues produce, to waſh off all ſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and raiſe its own fame above all the noted Springs we have yet heard of: Of which you'l be farther ſatisfied by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing the annexed and true account that we could take of ſome Cures performed by it, that indeed would be beyond belief, were there not good authority for them.</p>
            <p>Nor would thus much as hath been ſaid; did not the glory of God lie buryed in our ſilence, which of all things we ought
<pb facs="tcp:94825:5"/> to be moſt concern'd for: Shall ſo great a mercy as this Healing Well be ſlighted? and his goodneſs not extolled? Shall we be Cured by it, and he not Praiſed; the way purely not by concealing his mercies in the wonderous effects of it, much leſs by celipſing them. As his mercies ſhine openly and run freely, ſo let our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement too, and not be clouded by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogating either from the Author, or means, by which he conveyes ſo great a health to us.</p>

            <head>Something Concerning Water in General. Of the Original, and the Reaſons of the ſeveral Virtues of Springs: With an account of the Healing Spring, in Willowbridge-Park in Stafford-Shire.</head>
            <p>AN exact Philoſophical and Phyſical Treatiſe of Water in General, or in particulars; Sea, River, Rain, or Spring-Water, was never the Intention of the Writer: which though not wholly out of his road, yet out of his compaſs of time to perform, wanting all ſorts of ſuitable Conveniences. But ſuch light touches that from his own reaſon fell in his way to this Spring, ftands in yours to the account of ſome Cures it hath performed, giving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſome Pen more ingenuouſly Induſtrious to give better ſatisfaction, of the admirable Virtues of this Well.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hypocrates</hi> (that great Maſter of reaſon, and Prince of Phyſitians, (as ſome term him, not unworthily) affirms that Water and Fire are the two Principles of life; giving (as well he may) water the preheminence, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

            <p>And is fitly placed before Fire, Aire, or Earth, for it extinguiſhes the firſt, changes the ſecond into its ſelf, and devoureth the laſt. The moſt mundane beings running the race of nature without Fire, but none without Water. As we are abundantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to that Element in our compoſition and ſubſiſtance (having chiefeſt regard to the grandeſt power, God Almighty in the formation and upholding of all things.) So for the rectifying of the motions of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Machins of our Microcoſmus's, and the repairing thoſe breaches in the walls thereof that our irregularities have made. Witneſs the advantage we have by Water in general, but more by many particular Springs, whoſe uſe is excellent for particular Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers: but moſtly for this Spring, the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of what is hear made publick, ſince God hath been pleaſed ſo to bleſs it, and us with having the advantage of it, as to inforce it with ſuch virtues, as to be a Catholicon
(if rightly uſed) for moſt (if not all) Diſeaſes in Man, or Beaſt.</p>
            <p>This Spring was firſt taken notice of, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

            <p>Now the nature of the Spring, is ſuitable to the Qualities of that Earth, or Minerals through which by its many turnings and windings in its paſſage through the bowels of the Earth it runs; carrying with it either faculty, or ſubſtance, or both.</p>
            <p>Some Springs (as this we treat of) out of the ſubteraneal ſubſtances attract faculties to each other, as thoſe ſubſtances they paſs through. Which ſolves the Queſtion of the Curious enquirer, why the ſame Spring ſhould Cure divers Diſeaſes, and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or having but ſmall kin to each other; as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> any ſimples compounded together of natures repugnant to each other, having had their due fermentation, working ſo upon one another, as to become incorporated, with a concatenation of their virtues; may oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the ſame Queſtion, yet produce in its effects a rare Medicine for moſt Diſeaſes. and as it is moſt powerful againſt thoſe for
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94825:8"/> which there was a greater quantity of ſuitable Simples in the compoſition. So is each Spring of the greater force and quicker diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch in the Curing thoſe Diſtempers, for which thoſe Minerals it laſt and moſt run through his, proper.</p>
            <p>The virtues this Spring laſt participated, is conceived to be Sulphur and Nitre by its Coldneſs, and driving out an internal Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the extream parts of the body, and its Balſamick virtue in healing it, and all ſorts of Soa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s whatever, that it with its vertues can reach either Internal, or External.</p>
            <p>The Taſte of this Water is extreamly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to moſt, near to that of new milk mixed with common Spring water. But can give no pleuſible reaſon of the contrary and bitter reliſh it hath left on the Pallets of ſome few, that have given mean account thereof.</p>
            <p>This Water is free from any manner of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, but of a Chriſtal clearneſs, ſome where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſtanding but a little time in a clear Glaſs, which I often for ſatisfaction tryed, left a thick Oyly foeces all over the Glaſs. A quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it being exhaled over the fire, there hath remained a ſubſtance of the thickneſs and colour of Honey; but we were debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated for making Chimical experiments of it for want of ſuitable Utenſils: would but an Artiſt beſtow ſome pains upon it, 'twould certainly require his pains, and he thereby
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94825:8"/> find out the reaſons of, and confirm thoſe that (are not eye witneſſes) may doubt its vertues.</p>
            <p>What this Water performs, you are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Epiſtle to Reader, by a Right Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and though Female, yet a Pen of more than a Maſculine ſtrain and vivacity, proceeding from ſo ready a Phaucis at all times, that the richneſs thereof flows as much faſter than ſhe can write (though an incredible ſwift hand) as this Spring outdoes the belief of many. Therefore the dull ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I might have given, would have ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like flateſt Water after the briskeſt VVine.</p>
            <p>However before we come to the Alphabe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical account of the few of thoſe many Cures it hath done ſince Spring was a twelvemonth: Thoſe perſons that deſire to make tryal of this VVater, that are not able to ſee a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian for better advice, are deſired to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe brief and eaſie rules</p>
            <p>Firſt, Rightly to conſider the nature of their Diſtemper, and which way the water muſt work to Cure them, and to take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may prepare their Bodies for it, to facilitate its operation; though few that methodically uſe the water, and have time ſo to do, will ſtand in need thereof.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that they Drink two or three days before they Bath, and that in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not overcharging their Stomachs at the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:94825:9"/> firſt, but increaſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their draughts every morning, and uſing if they can, ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exerciſe (as walking) betwixt every three or four Glaſſes, and when they once find the water to paſs freely, by urine, or Stool, they may Drink the more freely. Then whether they have any outward Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, or not, to Bath the whole body; the time moſt proper, in the Morning? and after their drinking the water, not to Dine till they find it clearly paſſed, which you may know by their Urines, if it be any thing coulored when you make it, for till then it will be clear, and if chiefly to work that way, to take heed of provoking ſweating, which is a great hindrance of the waters paſſage by Urine. An <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of ability, to drink their two or three firſt Glaſſes mixed with White-Wine.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, for their Dyer, to be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and avoid all ſort of Salt Meats, and if they drink this water in the Evening, which may be done, (but not ſo proper as in the Morning) to eat little or no Supper, if any, that which is of light Digeſtion.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that they be not too haſty in leaving this water, but rather for a ſettled Cure to ſtay two or three dayes longer than needs, that go on too ſoon; and for encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement read this enſuing and Juſt account as could be taken, of ſome of the cures done
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94825:9"/> by this Spring. Many having made uſe of it, that kept their Diſtempers as cloſe as they did the benefit they received by it; ſome ſtealing the advantage of Bathing in it, when night had ſpread its ſable mantle o're the ſurface of our hemiſphaere (thinking the Stars were no Intelligencers) thereby to hinder their Diſtempers well as Cures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appear in open day.
