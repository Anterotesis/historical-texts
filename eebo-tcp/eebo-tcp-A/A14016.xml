            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>To cleare the clowds of drowping cares, and miſts of mournful mind,</l>
            <l>And baniſh bale, that heauy harts in cheerleſſe chaines did bind.</l>
            <l>And more than that, to further health, by mouing to and froe,</l>
            <l>That in our lumpiſh luſtleſſe limmes, no dire diſeaſe might groe:</l>
            <l>VVhich otherwiſe (ſet ſport aſide, and ſweete delightfull glee)</l>
            <l>In idle bodies breedes of force, as we by proofe do ſee,</l>
            <l>Not much vnlike the ſtanding lakes, in durtie dampiſh groundes,</l>
            <l>VVhere water hath no power to paſſe, moſt noiſome filth aboundes.</l>
            <l>If games were thus found out at firſt, for minde and bodies eaſe,</l>
            <l>Aſwell to quit that one of griefes, as th' other of diſeaſe:</l>
            <l>VVhy then? of force it follow muſt, that thoſe delights are chiefe,</l>
            <l>And moſt to be imbraſte, that lend to either part reliefe.</l>
            <l>VVhich if be ſo, I neede not bluſh; or deeme it my diſgrace,</l>
            <l>If Hawkes and Spanels I preferre, and ſet in hieſt place.</l>
            <l>For truly no deuiſe delights, the minde of man ſo much,</l>
            <l>No game ſo gladſome to the limmes, there is no pleaſure ſuch,</l>
            <l>No Phiſicke fitter to remoue the dregges of direfull paine,</l>
            <l>And to reſtore to former life, the feeble force againe.</l>
            <l>Of Spanels first I meane to ſpeake, for they begin the glee,</l>
            <l>VVho being once vncoupled, when they feele their collers free,</l>
            <l>In royſting wiſe about they raunge, with cheerfull chappes to ground,</l>
            <l>To ſee where in the champion may, ſome lurking fowle be found.</l>
            <l>A ſport to vew them ſtirre their ſternes, in hunting to and fro,</l>
            <l>And to beholde how nature doth hir power in Spanels ſho:</l>
            <l>VVho ſcoure the fields with wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>drous skil, and deale in cunning ſort,</l>
            <l>As though indeed they had conſpirde, to make their maſter ſport.</l>
            <l>VVhat merier muſicke can you craue? what note but halfe ſo good?</l>
            <l>As when the Spanels croſſe the ronne, of Feaſants in the wood?</l>
            <l>Or light vpon the little Poutes, where they haue lately bene?</l>
            <l>Aſſuredly no better glee, is either heard or ſeene.</l>
            <l>
               <pb facs="tcp:23404:5"/>So as by Hawkes doth pleaſure grow, vnto the gazing eie,</l>
            <l>And dogges delight the liſtning eares, before the hawkes do flie.</l>
            <l>VVhat dolt ſo dull but takes delight, when once the Spanell ſprings</l>
            <l>The fearfull fowle, and when the hawke lies long vpon hir wings?</l>
            <l>VVhat ſenſe ſo ſad, what minde ſo mazde, but ſettes his ſorowes by,</l>
            <l>VVhen once the Falcon free begins, to ſcud amid the skie?</l>
            <l>To turne and winde a birde by ſleight, and eke at last to ſlay</l>
            <l>VVith ſtrong encounter, doues and duckes, and euery other pray?</l>
            <l>The pretty Partridge, Rayles and Quayles, that haunt the open field?</l>
            <l>And from hir mountey to enforce the Hearon haught to yeeld?</l>
            <l>By binding with hir cloſe in cloudes, in maner out of ſight?</l>
            <l>For noble Peeres and cheefeſt States, a paſsing pleaſant flight?</l>
            <l>So ſmall a birde, ſo large a fowle, at ſuch a loftie gate,</l>
            <l>To reach and rappe, and force to fall, it is a game of ſtate.</l>
            <l>No fellow to the flight at Brooke, that game is full of glee,</l>
            <l>It is a ſport the ſtowping of, a royſting Hawke to ſee.</l>
            <l>And if ſhe miſſe, to marke hir how ſhe then gettes vp amaine,</l>
            <l>For beſt aduauntage, to eneaw the ſpringing fowle againe.</l>
            <l>VVho if be landed as it ought, then is it ſure to die.</l>
            <l>Or if ſhe ſlippe, a ioy to ſee, the Hawke at randon flie,</l>
            <l>And ſo for head to ſlea the fowle, a noble ſport to vew,</l>
            <l>In my conceyt no pleaſure like to Hawkes, I tell you trew.</l>
            <l>It ſettes the ſenſes all to worke, there may none idle bee,</l>
            <l>The tung it lures, the legges they leape, the eie beholdes the glee:</l>
            <l>The eares are buſied eke to heare, the calling Spanels queſt,</l>
            <l>Do tell me then what ſenſe it is, that reſpite hath to reſt?</l>
            <l>And more than that, the hart it leapes, and laughes for ioy to think</l>
            <l>How ſuch a ſlender hawke ſhould cauſe, ſo huge a fowle to ſhrink.</l>
            <l>This kinde of ſport doth baniſh vice, and vile deuiſes quight,</l>
            <l>VVhen other games do foſter faults, and breede but baſe delight.</l>
            <l>No idle thought can harbor well within the Falconers braine,</l>
            <l>For though his ſportes right pleaſant be, yet are they mixt with paine.</l>
            <l>The toile he takes to find the fowle, his greedy luſt to ſlay,</l>
            <l>The fowle once found cuts off co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceits, &amp; driues il thoughts away.</l>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E find this a generall rule and obſeruation, and doe holde it for good, in all Artes and Sciences, wherein men do trauell and buſie them ſelues, eyther to the benefite of others, or to their owne pryuate pleaſure, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores, in the beginning of their workes to lay downe the ſubiecte of that whereof they meane to treate, whiche in verie deede is nothing elſe, but the ground and matter which doth moue them to write: which doth not only fall out in all liberall ſciences, and ſtudies greatly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted and reuerenced of the learned of all ages, but alſo in the baſe and groſſer trades of men, dayly practiſed with the hande. As when the Goldſmithe doth determine with him ſelfe by cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and cunning arte, to faſhion a Iewell of any price and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, he is driuen to make choyce of his mettall, either golde or ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, whereon to beſtowe the excellencie of his arte, which cannot be named by a more fit or conuenient terme, than to be called the Subiecte of his ſcience. Likewiſe here myne Author, in this treatiſe, and booke of Falconrie, following the accuſtomed order of the learned, and common practiſe of ſuch as doe write, hath layde downe a Hawke, the Subiect of his deuiſe, of which he is determined at large to ſpeake, with full ſhewe and declaration of the true nature and properties of all Hawkes, as alſo ſuch o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter as is incident, and appertayning in any reſpecte to that ſkill, of all other gentlemanly ſportes and practiſes, the moſt pleaſant and commendable. But before he doth aduenture too deale ſpecially of any matter concerning Falconrie, to giue the Reader a perfite and abſolute vnderſtanding, both of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, and of the knowledge of the thing, hee thinketh it not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his purpoſe, but a matter moſt neceſſarie to the attaynment
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23404:7"/>
of his deuiſe, to frame a generall diuiſion of all Hawkes and Birdes of praye, racking (as it were) and deuiding that one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyre and generall name of a Hawke into many members and partes, the better thereby to diſplay the true nature, qualitie, and condition of a Hawke, as alſo the ſkill of Falconrie: for the whole being layde out into his members and partes, it ſhall bee the more eaſie to come to the notyce of that, whereof he is reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to write, whoſe nature and ſubſtance is included in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular members. Wherfore myne Author following that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and preſcribed rule of knowledge, hath vſed this methode, ſetting downe to the viewe of the reader, in the verie entrie and proeme of his worke, a manifeſt and generall diuiſion of Hawkes, the better to decypher the ſpeciall nature, of eache one Hawke in his own proper kynd, which otherwiſe were verie hard to do, by meane of confuſion of ſundrie names and termes, as alſo, the number of byrdes of praye.</p>

            <p>This Hawke whome I terme a Matagaſſe, after the French is in the Italian tounge, called, <hi>Regestola Falconera,</hi> and among the Germa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, <hi>Thornkretzera,</hi> Hawke not in vſe with vs, and in trouth of ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der regard and eſtimation in nature.

            <p>You muſt note, that all theſe kynde of Hawkes, haue their Tyercelles, whiche are the male byrdes and cockes of euerie ſorte and gender: And further, that the female of all byrdes of praye and rauyne, is euer more huge than the male, more ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, hardie, and watchfull, but of ſuche byrdes as do not liue by rauyne and pray, the male is more large than the female.</p>

               <p>For all hawkes and byrdes of praye, do not ſerue the Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners vſe, but onely ſuch as are hardie and free of mettall, able to flye the fielde and ryuer. And therefore thoſe onely kyndes ſhall be the Subiect of my booke, and not thoſe baſe, baſtardly refuſe hawkes, which are ſomewhat in name, and nothing in deede.</p>
               <p>As the Greekes would, that <hi>Hierax,</hi> &amp; the Latyns that <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiter,</hi> which is a ſpeciall terme to one hawke and byrde of pray, ſhoulde giue the generall name and title to all Hawkes and byrdes of praye, bycauſe of his excellencie: So in like manner, the Frenchmen of our age, haue ordained that the Falcon, which is a terme peculiar and proper to one kinde of byrde of praye, ſhall giue generall name and appellation to all hawkes, and byrdes of praye, what ſo euer they bee, bycauſe the Falcon doth paſſe all other hawkes in boldneſſe and curteſie, and is moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to man, of all other byrdes of praye. And thereof it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, that we ſay, the Falcon Gentle, the Haggart Falcon, the Falcon Sacre, and ſo likewiſe of the other hawkes, calling them all by the name of Falcon.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, as the Falcon, whiche is a ſpeciall name of one kynd of hawkes, hath giuen name to all other hawkes and birds of praye. So hath it beſtowed the name and tytle of a Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to euerie one of what ſtate or calling ſoeuer hee bee, that doth deale with any kinde of Hawkes: and the terme of Falconrie, to the arte, profeſſion, and knowledge of luring and manning thoſe byrdes of praye, by which ſingular ſkyll, they are made to flee all other foules, as well thoſe foules of ayre, as of the lande and ryuer. Whiche in my conceite, deſerueth no ſlender commendation and prayſe, being a matter almoſt quite againſt the lawes of nature and kynde, for one foule ſo artificially to vndertake and ſo cruelly to murther another, and hauing atchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his enterpriſe, with greedie and willing minde, to repaire to man againe, hauing the whole ſcope of the heauens, and the circuite of the earth at their pleaſure to range and peruſe: and to

yeelde them ſelues in ſuch franke maner to the pryſon and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of man, being by kinde ſet free and at libertie to praye, and diſpoſe them ſelues. Suche and ſo great is the ſingular ſkill of man, when by arte he is reſolued, to alter the preſcribed order of nature, which by induſtrie and payne we ſee is brought to paſſe and effect.</p>

               <p>HAuing deuided all thoſe byrdes of praye and rauine, whiche ſerue to Falconrie &amp; Hawking, into Eagles and Falcons, I mean firſt of al to decypher you the Eagle and Vulture, whom ſome haue thought to be compriſed vnder the kynd of an Eagle. And ſo conſequently after that, to ſpeake of Falcons which are byrdes of pray, ſeruing to the vſe and myſterie of Hawking, and taking their names of the Falcon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> was of opinion, that there was ſixe kynds of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles, which are named by him, according as it pleaſed the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantes of Greece to enforme him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plinie</hi> in making the ſame deuiſion of Eagles, hath varied in that poynt altogether from <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as touching the names and termes of Eagles, for that they were of diuers countries, and did write in ſeuerall languages. But for that I meane in this booke onely to ſpeake of thoſe kyndes of Eagles which ſerue to Falconrie, I will deale but with two ſortes of Eagles, for at theſe dayes we haue the vſe and experience but of the browne Eagle, whiche is the Eagle Royall, and the blacke Eagle, the other kyndes being of a baſe and ſlender courage, as no Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner will payne him ſelfe to lure them, or manne them for vſe or pleaſure.</p>

                  <p>THe brown or yellow Egle after <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion is called in Greeke <hi>Guyſeon,</hi> which doth ſignifie in the Frenche tong (kindly &amp; no baſtard borne) bicauſe it is of all other kynds of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles the true &amp; right Eagle, &amp; he doth cal him by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greeke word
<hi>Chriſaitos,</hi> by reaſon of his golde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mayle, &amp; in Latin he is termed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23404:10"/>
                     <hi>Stellaris,</hi> and <hi>Herodus.</hi> This is that Eagle whome we call the Egle royall, king of byrdes, and ſometimes the byrde of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> and that Egle, which ought to be taken and accompted the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall beſt, being more huge and large than the reſt, and beſides more rare and daintie to be ſeene. For ſhee doth haunt moſte commonlye the toppes of highe and craggie mountaines, and doth there praye vpon all ſortes of foules, as alſo Hares, Kyddes Gotes, and ſuch other like wilde, and ſauage beaſtes of the field.</p>
                  <p>This Eagle dothe liue alwayes ſolitarie and alone, vnleſſe happily ſhe haue hir broode with hir, whome ſhe doth conducte and guyde from place to place, the better to inſtruct them howe to kyll their praye, and feede them ſelues. But no ſoner hath ſhe made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> perfit, and throughly ſcooled them therin, but preſently ſhe chaſeth them out of that coaſte, and doth abandon them the place where they were eyred, and will in no wiſe brooke them to abide neare hir, to the ende (that the countrey where ſhe diſclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth) and maketh her Eyrie, bee not vnfurniſhed of conuenient pray, which by the number and exceſſiue ſtore of Eagles, might otherwiſe be ſpoyled and made bare. For it is verie likely, that if hir broode and increaſe ſhould there make ſtay, beeing ſo huge byrdes, and of ſo great rauyne, there woulde in ſhort ſpace lacke praye for hir ſelfe, and by meane thereof breede hir to a farther euill and miſchiefe: for the auoyding of whiche, this prouident and carefull foule doth preſently force hir broode to depart into ſome other part and region.</p>
                  <p>This Egle maye with eaſe be diſcerned from the Vulture, bycauſe this Eagle Royall, being browne or yellowe maylde, hath not hir armes or feete in any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition couered with plume, as the Vulture hath.</p>
                  <p>True it is, that the arme of the Eagle is ſhort, yellow mayld &amp; all beſet with ſcales, the pounces large, her beake blacke, long, and crooked at the toppe. The trayne of the Egle Royall, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the trayne of the ſlender blacke Egle, is ſhort and ſtiffe at the poynt, euen as the traine of the Vulture is.</p>
                  <p>The Egle is alwayes of one ſelf hugeneſſe, in reſpect of hir nature, and it can not be ſaid, in that ſhe is an Eagle, that ſhe is
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23404:10"/>
either larger or leſſer, at any one time or other, vnleſſe you will giue hir the ſurname and addition of blacke, yellowe, or ſome other ſuch proper name and terme, which doth alter hir accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to hir accydentes, but nothing at all in regarde of hir ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and nature. And were it not that ſhe is ſo maſſy a foule, and not portable on the fiſte (as in troth ſhe is exceeding huge) and beſides, it is ſo harde and difficulte a matter, to prouide hir pray and foode, Princes, and puiſſant ſtates, would more vſually haue hir, and hawke with hir, for their ſolace and pleaſure, than they nowe doe. But by reaſon ſhe is ſo huge and ventrous, ſhe might happily offer force and violence to the eyes and face of hir keper, if at any time ſhe ſhould conceiue diſpleaſure againſt him. And for this cauſe in chiefe, the Egle is not in vſe, as other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hawkes and of leſſe force be in theſe dayes.</p>
                  <p>He that will haue the Egle to be good and tractable, muſte deuiſe to take her an Eyeſſe in the Eyrie, mannyng and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoming hir among houndes and greyhoundes, to the end that when he goeth and addreſſeth him to the fielde, the Egle ſoaring aloft ouer the houndes ſtarting the game, Foxe, Hare, Gote, or ſuch like beaſtes of the wood, ſhee making hir downeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me, and ſtouping from hir wings, may ſo ſtay and ſeaze vpon the game, vntill the dogges come in and procure the fall thereof. A man may feede hir with any kynde of fleſh, and chiefly of ſuch game and praye as ſhe ſlayeth in the fielde by flight.</p>
                  <p>Tawnye, or browne mayle in an Eagle, deepe and hollow eyes, ſpecially if ſhe be bred in the weaſt partes of the worlde, is an aſſured ſigne of hir goodneſſe: for the tawnye Egle is euer founde good in proofe.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the whitneſſe on the head of an Eagle, or on hir backe, is a ſingular token of an excellent Eagle.</p>
                  <p>That Eagle, that when ſhe fleeth from the fiſte of hir keeper will either flee vpon the man, ſoaring round about him, or light on the grounde, and take the ſtand, is by al probabilitie and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, no inwarde Eagle, but a fugitiue, and a rangler.</p>
                  <p>At what time the Egle, diſplayes hir trayne in hir flight, and makes a turne in hir mountie, it is a verie great ſigne that ſhee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23404:11"/>
determineth to flye on head and gadde: the nexte remedie for which miſchiefe is to throwe hir out hir meate, and lure hir with as loude a voyce as you poſſible may. And if it be ſo that ſhe then ſtoupe not to that which is caſte out vnto hir, then eyther hath ſhe ouer gorged hir ſelfe, or otherwiſe ſhe is to hye and too full of fleſhe. A meane to auoyde this inconuenience, is to ſowe the feathers of hir trayne together, to the end ſhe may not ſpread them abroade, nor vſe the benefite of hir trayne feathers in hir flight. Or elſe another way is, to deplume and make bare hir tuell and fundament ſo as it may appeare, and then certainely for feare of the colde ayre ſhe will not aduenture to mounte ſo hie: but feeling hir trayne feathers faſt ſowed together, ſhe will ſtande in awe of other Eagles, whome by the meane of that deuice and practiſe, ſhe ſhall in no wiſe be able to auoyde.</p>
                  <p>When the Eagle maketh a ſhort turne vpon hir keeper in hir flight, and flyeth not out aforehead, that is one principal good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken that ſhe will not away.</p>
                  <p>It hath beene ſayde, that an Eagle is of force to areſt and cauſe a woulfe to ſtay, and will take him, with the ayde and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of dogges, making into hir reſcue, and that it hath bene ſeene and experimented. But for my part I finde the oddes of them ſo great, as I leaue the beliefe of it to the reader, not recy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it as a troth, but a thing written, to ſhewe the great hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and vndaunted nature of the Eagle.</p>
                  <p>It is reported that the men of the countrey where the Eagle eyreth, knowing thereof, and intending to bereaue hir young broode, doe arme and well furniſh their heades, for feare leaſt the Eagle doe offer them force and violence. And if ſo they ſhewe the old breeder one of hir chickens, or tye it to the bough of a tree neare the place where ſhe buildeth, ſhe will call and cauſe the damme to repayre thether by continuall cleping, who findeth hir, and pitying hir cryes, will bring it ſo much prouiſion and praye, as he that commeth to take hir from the eyrie, ſhall there dayly be ſped of as muche fleſhe and prouiſion as will verie rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably ſerue him and ſixe others. For the olde Eagle will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey thyther Hares, Conies, foules, and ſuch other like vittell, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23404:11"/>
viandes, for the ſupplye of hir neceſſitie.</p>
                  <p>The Eagle doth not commonly vſe to praye neare vnto his eyrie, but to kyll hir prouiſion abroade as farre off as ſhe maye. And if ſo it happen, ſhe leaue any fleſhe after ſhe is full gorged, that doth ſhe reſerue carefully for the nexte day, to the ende that if foule weather ſhould happily growe to hinder hir flight, yet ſhe might be ſtored of ſufficient praye for the daye following, without any further trauell.</p>
                  <p>An Eagle doth not forſake or chaunge hir Eyrie all hir life time, but of cuſtome doth yearely returne and make repayre to one ſelf place, and there buildeth moſt aſſuredly, by meane where of it hath ben noted and obſerued in time paſt, that an Egle doth lyue verie many yeares. Before hir olde age, hir beake waxeth ſo exceeding long and croked at the toppe, as ſhe is much hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red thereby of hir feeding: in ſort as ſhe dyeth not of diſeaſe or by extremetie of age, but only by reaſon ſhe can not poſſible vſe the benefite of hir beake, being accrewde and growne to ſuch an exceeding length and diſproportion. Whereof commeth the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe as I take it. <hi>Aquilae ſenectus</hi> the age of an Eagle, which is properly applyed to men that do lyue only by drinke, as olde men are wont to do.</p>
                  <p>The Eagle doth euer wage warre with the little Roytelet, whome the Frenche men doe ſo terme, for that this foule is thought to be a little king among byrdes, as the Etimologie of the worde doth ſeeme to importe, the Latines likewiſe they call him <hi>Regulus,</hi> and the Germans a Goldhenlyne. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and chiefe grounde of this controuerſie betwixte the Eagle and the Goldhenlyne, is (by the report of <hi>Aristotle</hi>) onely vpon the name, for that ſhe is called the king of birdes, of which title and preheminence the Eagle would willingly bereaue hir.</p>
                  <p>Againe there is one other kind of litle foule whom <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> calleth a <hi>Sitta,</hi> the Latines <hi>Reptitatrix</hi> or <hi>Scandulaca,</hi> and the Frenchmen <hi>Grimpereau,</hi> that doth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Egle verie great outrage &amp; offence.

                  <p>When I ſayde before, that the Eagle royall was of a yellow mayle, I meant nothing elſe by that ſpeach, but that the Eagle was maylde, of the verie coloure of a Deares haire, which is in deede not yellowe, but browne or tawnie. And albeit <hi>Aristotle</hi> for his pleaſure, termed it by the Greeke worde, <hi>Chriſaitos,</hi> which is as much in effect, as to ſay, the golden Egle: yet muſt it not therefore bee concluded, that this Eagle is of a right golden mayle, but of a more browne or tawnie mayle, than the other kinde of Eagle is.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Plinie</hi> hath placed this blacke Eagle in the firſte order and rancke of Eagles, as one that would willingly prefer hir before all other kyndes of Eagles. And here <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath ſet hir but in the thirde order and place.</p>
                  <p>The blacke Eagle (ſayth he) being leſſe huge and corpulent than the other, is of farre more force and excellencie.</p>

               <p>All other byrdes of praye do differ from the Vulture, in that they are deſtitute and voyde of plumage vnder their winges, whereas the Vultures be there veſted and couered with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent fyne downe. Their ſkinne is thicke like a Goats ſkinne, and namely you ſhall finde vnder their gorge, a certayne patche of the breadth of your hande, where the plume is ſomewhat in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to a redde, like the haire of a Calf, for that kind of plume hath not a webbe faſhioned, as other feathers are vſually ſhapte and proportioned, but are like vnto the downe which is to be founde on eyther ſide the necke, and on the vpper part of the plye and bent of the wyng, in which parts the down is ſo white, that it gliſtereth and is as ſoft as ſilke.</p>

               <p>The Eagle muſt euer be taken when ſhe is in the eyrie, for hir condition is to waxe afterwards very bold &amp; outrageous. It is ſayde, that when the Eagle beginneth to growe to ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, neare cawking or calling time, ſhe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly flyeth with other Eagles, bearing with them to their ſtande where they vſe to praye, a peece of Arſenicke, otherwiſe called Orpiment, whiche doth delay and mortifie their luſte and deſire.</p>

Some of them are of a browne mayle, and ſome other of a ſpotted mayle, their gorges and breaſtes are full of ſtraked lynes, tending to redde, they haue long heades, greate beakes, and very muche crookte, ſtrong armes, and roughe large ſtretchers, in a manner as greate as the palme of a mans hande, boyſteous talons, and a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble long trayne.</p>

In hart and courage ſhe is valiant, ventrous, ſtrong, and good to brooke both heate and colde, as to whome there commeth no weather amiſſe at any time, whereas the moſt part of other Hawkes, eyther are lightlie offended with the one or the other, and muſte haue a hand kept vpon them accordingly, or otherwiſe, there is no great pleaſure to be taken in them.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to endure hard weather: but in mine owne conceyte ſhe is in nature farre otherwiſe. And my reaſon is this, that ſhee ſhould be better able to endure colde than the Falcon Gentle, bycauſe ſhe dothe come from forayne partes a ſtraunger, and a paſſenger, and doth winne all hir pray and meate at the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt by mayne wing, and doth ariue in thoſe parts where ſhe is taken when the fowles do come in greate flockes, whiche is the very hardeſt parte of the yeare. Moreouer being a whote Hawke by kinde, ſhe ſhoulde the better ſuſtayne the force of weather, and that ſhee is a whot Hawke of nature, may bee gathered by hir flying ſo high a pitche, which I take to be, for that in the higher parts, ſhe findeth the colder ayre, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> midle Region is more cold, than the reſt, bycauſe thither commeth no reflexion.

               <head>The good ſhape of a Falcon.</head>
               <p>THat you may the better make choyce of your Falcon, and know a good Falcon from a refuſe, I will deſcribe you the perfecte ſhape of a right good Falcon, ſuche a one as is very like to be good, though many times we ſee, that in proofe, the moſt likely things to ſhew, &amp; to the eye, become in proofe, the worſte and of leaſt regard.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:23404:21"/>The ſhape of a good Falcon therefore is, firſt to haue wyde nares, high and large eyeliddes, a greate blacke eye, a rounde head ſomewhat full on the toppe, a ſhorte thicke beake blewe as azure, a reaſonable highe necke, barbe feathers vnder the clappe of the beake, a good large breaſte, rounde, fleſhy, ſtrong, harde, and ſtiffe bended. And that is the true cauſe, why the Falcon doth greatlye affye in hir breaſte, and ſtriketh with it, and gageth it moſte at hir encounter. And by meane ſhe is very ſtrong armed, ſhee vſeth the more freely alſo to ſtryke a fowle with hir pownces and talons. Moreouer ſhe muſte be broade ſhouldered, ſhee muſte haue ſlender ſayles, full ſides, long and greate thighes, ſhe muſt be ſtrong and ſhort armed, large footed, with the ſeare of the foote ſofte, and all one for hewe with the ſeare of the beake and nares, blacke pownces, long wings and croſſing the trayne, whiche trayne ought to be ſhort, and apte to bende and bowe to euery ſide. For in the trayne of a hauke doth conſiſt a greate helpe, when ſhe flyeth. And therefore (as well as for beautie) if a trayne feather or couert feather be broken, or bruſed, we do couet to ympe them agayne, or ſet them to right, bicauſe it may be the leſſe hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunce to the hawke in hir flighte.</p>
               <p>You muſte note that thoſe verye Falcons, that are of one kinde and ſort, haue very greate difference and oddes betwixt them, and are called by diuers names, according to the tyme that a man beginneth to deale with them, &amp; doth vndertake them, according to the places where they haunte, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the countries whence they come.</p>
               <p>They are diuided into Mewed hawkes, Rammage haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, Sore hawkes, and Eyeſſes, into large hawkes, meane hawkes, and ſlender hawkes, all whiche are of diuers and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall plumes and mayles, according to the diuerſitie of the regions. Alſo they are of diuers prices, according to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and eſtimation of them. Agayne, ſome are blacke Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, ſome ruſſet Falcons, ſome other blancke Falcons: ſome of whiche are riuer Hawkes, to ſlaye the fowle at the brooke, and other ſome fielde hawkes, to flye the lande, and there to

kill the Feſant, Partridge, and ſuch like fowles. Thus you ſee howe diuers and many they be, according to their outwarde accidentes, &amp; yet in nature, all Falcons. Therefore, bicauſe I am to treate of euery kinde ſeuerall, I will not longer holde you in this place, with deſcription of the Falcon Gentle, but hereafter when I write in another place of the diſeaſes, cures and the manning of theſe hawkes, I will as neare I may, let paſſe nothing, that ſhall belong in any reſpect vnto the Falco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but that in one place or other you ſhall finde it.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Haggart Falcon, and why ſhe is called the Peregrine, or Haggart.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Haue many times ſtudied with my ſelfe, for what cauſe the Haggart Falcons, the moſt excellent byrdes of all other Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, haue bene termed Haggart or Peregrin Hawkes. And at firſt was of opinion that men ſo called them, for that they are brought vnto vs, from farre and forayne countries, and are in deede meere ſtrangers in Italie, and (as a man may call them) trauaylers. And this I know for truth, they are not diſcloſed or eyred in Italie, and beſides that there are few in Italie, that do take them at any time, but the greateſt ſtore of them are brought and conueyed thither from forayne regions· but if they ſhoulde be termed Peregrine or Haggart Falcons, for this onely cauſe, and onely in reſpect hereof and nothing elſe, then might we as well beſtow that name alſo vpon all other Falcons, that are not bredde in Italie, as vpon the Tunician and other Hawkes that are paſſengers. Wherfore I am of opinion, that for three cauſes principally and in chiefe, they are called Haggart, or Peregrine Falcons.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Firſt, bicauſe a man can not finde, nor euer yet did any man Chriſtian or Heathen, fynde their eyrie in any Region, ſo as it
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23404:23"/>
may well be thought, that for that occaſion they haue atchieued and gotten that name and terme of Peregrine or Haggart Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, as if a man, would call them Pilgrims or Forayners.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond cauſe is, bycauſe theſe Falcons do rangle and wander more than any other ſorte of Falcons are wonte to do, ſeeking out more ſtraunge and vncouth cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, which in deede may giue them that title of Haggart and Peregrine Hawkes, for their excellencie, bycauſe they do ſeeke ſo many ſtraunge and forayne coaſtes, and do rangle ſo far abrode.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The thirde and laſt cauſe, I do thinke, may be their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and excellencie, bycauſe this worde (<hi>Peregrino</hi>) or Peregrine, doth many tymes importe an honorable and choyce matter, had in great regard: but it ſkilleth not muche whiche of theſe three alleged is the true cauſe, wee will not ſtande vpon the nyce poynt, for that a good Falconer, ought much more to regarde the ſearchyng out of the true nature and propertie of Hawkes, than to haue ſo great and ſpeciall reſpect vnto their names and termes.</p>
               <p>Wherefore I conclude, that theſe Haggart Falcons are not of Italie, but tranſported and brought thither from forayne pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as namely from Alexandria, Cyprus and Candie. And yet this is for certayne, that in Italie there are taken of theſe Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart Falcons, as in the dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the renowned Duke of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara, and in the countrie neare Rauenna, beyng brought thither by force of weather and winde. And by that meanes there are none of thoſe Haggarts founde eyeſſes, but they are all eyther ſoare Hawkes, or mewed Haggarts.</p>
               <p>Of ſhape and proportion they are like the other Falcons, and are of three ſortes, as touchyng their making, and moulde, that is to ſay, large, little, or Falcons of a middle ſiſe. Some of them are long ſhapte, ſome ſhorte truſſed Falcons, ſome larger, ſome leſſe.</p>
               <p>They are ordinarily of foure mayles, eyther blancke, ruſſet, browne, or turtle maylde, and ſome pure white maylde, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any iote or ſpotte of any other colour, but thoſe a man ſhall ver ſeldome ſee. And for that cauſe I meane not to ſay much
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23404:23"/>
of that kinde of mayled Falcons, but will deale with ſuche as are more ordinarie in vſe.</p>

                     <hi>A</hi> Good and right Haggart Falcon ought to haue hir head of a darcke or blancke plume, flatte on the toppe, with a white wreath or garlande enuironing hir head, a large blew bending beake, wide nares, a great, full, blacke eye, hie, ſtately necke, large breſt, brode ſhouldred, a great feather, in colour like the feather of a Turtle, log vanes and ſayles, but ſle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der ſhapte, long traine, hie thighes, and white on the inſide, I meane hir pendant fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhorte, and great armed, large wide foote, with ſlender ſtretchers and talons, and the ſame to be eyther pale white maylde, or pale blewyſh, tending ſomewhat to azure.

                  <p>
                     <hi>A</hi> Good ſkilfull Falconer, will quickly diſcerne a good Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garte Falcon, from a ſleight Falcon, though he be farre of, by the ſtirring of hir wings. For that a Haggart Falcon vſeth not a thicke ſtroke, but ſtirreth hir wing by leaſure and ſeldom, and getteth vp to hir mountee, without any great making out. And although perhaps ſhe be not ſo large as the ſleight or ſore Falcon, yet to ſeeming and ſhewe ſhe is more large, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth by meane of hir ſayles, which in very deede are of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſcope and compaſſe than the ſleight Falcons are. Contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, the ſleight Falcon ſhe vſeth a more ſhort and quicker ſtroke with hir wing, than the Haggart dothe, and doth not deale ſo leaſurely. There are beſides this one difference, ſundrie other, betwixt theſe two kindes of Falcons, which in this place, I will deliuer you, for that you ſhal the better iudge the oddes betwixt them, being both very good Falcons, and the beſt of all other, both for field and riuer.</p>

                  <head>The difference and oddes betwixt the Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart, and the Falcon Gentle.</head>
                  <p>FOr that diuers haue delight to know the difference betwixt the Falcon Gentle and the Haggart, I will here ſhewe you
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23404:24"/>
certayne ſpeciall poynts concernyng the difference of them both. Firſt the Haggarte is a larger hawke than the Falcon gentle, and a longer armed Hawke, with a reaſonable large foote, and hyr talons more long than the Falcon gentles are, a high necke and a long, a fayre ſeaſoned head, and a more long beake than the other hath.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The beame feathers of the Haggart, as ſhe is in hyr flight, are longer than the Falcon gentles, hir trayne ſomwhat larger, the Haggart hath a flatte thighe, but the Falcon gentle a round thighe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Haggart will lie longer on hyr wings than the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con gentle, and hath a more deliberate and leaſurely ſtroke than the other Falcon hath, as I ſayd before.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 From the fiſte, it is reported by ſome, that the Falcon gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dothe flie more ſpeedely than the Haggarte, but at a long flight the Haggarte is farre the better of both, and doth excell all other kinde of Hawkes both for good wing, and maynteynance of hir flighte. Which is a perfite proofe of a very good backe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The Falcon gentle is more haſtie and whote in all hyr doings than the Haggarte, and is thought more raſhe and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious of nature than the Haggart is. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they flee togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Falcon gentle will make hir ſtowping and downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more vnaduiſedly, and will vſe the greater haſte to be at hir pitche agayne than the other, and miſſing the fowle at the ſtowping, the Falcon gentle is in the greater chafe, and will preſently flee on head at the checke, ſo as many times ſhe is harde to come by agayne. Whereas the Haggarte is more deliberate and better aduiſed, whiche proceedeth in my opinion, for that ſhe better knoweth the aduantage of hir flight, than the Falcon gentle, bycauſe ſhe hath bene forced often to praye for hir ſelfe, and hath not bene ſubiect to the order of any keper, neyther hath had any hande kepte vpon hir, to make hir eger and greedie of the praye, more than naturally ſhe is accuſtomed to flee at hyr ſeaſons, to gorge hir ſelfe, whiche ſhe doth both aduiſedly and to great aduantage.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The Haggarte Falcon is taken in Candie, Rhodes, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23404:25"/>
many other places, of that Sea whiche is called <hi>Archipelagus,</hi> or the Iegean Sea.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The beſt ſorte of thoſe Haggart Falcons, haue their beakes of the colour of Azure.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Thoſe of Cyprus whiche are ſmall Hawkes and of a ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet mayle, they are the moſte hardie and ventrous Hawkes of all others.</p>
                  <p>Much more might be ſayde, as touchyng the Haggarte and Falcon gentle, but, for that the Hawkes are dayly in hand and vewe, and bycauſe I haue a larger field to eare, whiche is, to lay you downe the mannyng of them, and ſuch things as are more neceſſarie to a good Falconer. I leaue it, and will proceede to the next kinde of Falcon, whiche is the Tartaret or Barbarie Falcon. As touchyng whoſe name and nature I meane to deliuer you, what I haue gathered as well out of the French copie, as alſo borowed from the Italian, whom I do much reuerence as well for his language, as for his rare and deepe deuiſe in all things wherein he doth deale.

With this Tartarot, or Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barie Falcon, and the Haggart alſo, you may flee all Maye and Iune, for they are Hawkes, that are very ſlacke in mewyng at the firſt, but when they once beginne, they mew and ſhedde their feathers very faſte.</p>
               <div type="section">
                  <head>For what cauſe this Falcon is called a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary or Tartaret Falcon.</head>
                  <p>THeſe kinde of Falcons are called Barberie Falcons, for that moſt commonly they make their paſſage through Barbarie and Tunyſe, where they are taken more often than in any other place: As namely in the Iles of Leuant, Candie, Cypres and Rhodes, where theſe Hawkes do more frequent, and vſe than in any other Region, and the Countrie men will ſooner take them, by endeuour if they may, than any Hawkes that are eyreed in their countrie. And truly I doo not thinke, that in any other place there are ſo many good Craneſlayers, as there are to be had in the Ile of Candie. The reaſon of it is, for that the Nobilitie and ſtates of the countrie, are much more enclined to keepe thoſe kinde of Hawkes that will kill the Crane, than any other people are elſewhere, and they do enure and make their Falcons to that kinde of game, more than to any other fowle. And ſurely you ſhall there haue excellent good hawkes.</p>
                  <p>Thus much it hath pleaſed mine Author to write, of and in commendacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Barbarie Falcon: but here with vs in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glande, I neuer ſaw or hearde of the proofe of thoſe Hawkes, to be ſo good or excellent, as by his reporte I finde them.

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:23404:27"/>THe Gerfalcon is a birde of great force, a verie fayre hawke, ſpecially being mewed, ſhee is ſtrong armed, ſhee hath large ſtretchers and ſingles, ſhe is fierce and hardy of nature, by meane whereof ſhe is the more difficult and harde to be reclaymed. A Gerfalcon will looke to haue a gentle hand kepte on hir, and hir keeper to be curteous and full of patience. The Gerfalcon is a gallant hawke to beholde, more huge than any other kynde of Falcon, hir eyes and hir head are lyke the Haggart Falcon. She hath a great bending beake, large nares, a mayle like vnto a Laner, verie long ſayles, and ſharpe poynted, a trayne muche like the Laner, a large foote, marble feared, blanke, ruſſet, and browne plumed as other Falcons be, more beautifull to the eye than any other kynde of Falcon.</p>
               <p>Theſe kinde of hawkes are made to flee from the fiſte to the Heron, Crane, Gooſe, Buſtarde, and ſuche other like foules. When they are mewed, they doe verie much reſemble the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they doe not chaunge the marble ſeare of the foote. Theyr Tiercels (whome we call Ierkyns) are had in great pryce, they are brought from Leuant, Cypres, Candy, and Alexandria by Merchantes.</p>
               <p>The Gerfalcons by report, doe moſt commonly eyree in the partes of Pruſſia, and vpon the borders of Ruſſia, and ſome of them come from the confines and mountaynes of Norway. But moſt commonly they are taken about Almayne Paſſebyes (as we terme them) or paſſengers.</p>
               <p>With the Gerfalcon you maye naturally flee all kyndes of foules, as I haue alreadie written of the Haggart, and the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barie Falcon.</p>
               <p>Let it not diſcourage or amaze you, that the Gerfalcon is ſo harde to be reclaymed and manned, for the fierceneſſe and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe of their nature is the onely cauſe thereof, but in the ende beyng once wonne, they proue excellent good hawkes.</p>
               <p>They will ſitte verie vpryght and ſtately on the fiſte. Theyr beakes are blewe, and ſo are the ſeares of their legges and feete, their pounces and talons are verie long, and in troth, they will lightly refuſe to flee at nothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:23404:27"/>At my beyng in Moſcouia, I ſawe ſundrie Gerfalcons, verie fayre and huge hawkes, and of all other kyndes of haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, that onely byrde is there had in accompte and regarde, and is of greater price than any other. The reaſon whereof I lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of certayne Engliſhe Merchauntes my countrey menne, who tolde me, that the Emperours Maieſtie Iuan Vazil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niche, did vſe to flee the Rauen with a caſt of Gerfalcons, and tooke no ſlender pleaſure and delight therein.</p>
               <p>The Rauen truely is a monſtrous ſtrong flight, by meane ſhe is of ſo great force and wight of wing, and withall doth vſe to make ſo many turnes in the ayre, as you ſhall ſee no other foule do the like. Yet neuertheleſſe, as they told me, they had ſeene a caſt of Gerfalcons beate hir in ſuch wiſe, as ſhe hath bene forced to take the ſtande, and to pearche in a Pyne or Fyrre tree for hir ſuccour and ſafetie. But that ſhifte little preuayles, for no ſooner is ſhe pearched, but preſently by commaundement of the Emperoure, eache Muſcouite drawing his hatchet from his backe (without which tooke they neuer trauell in that countrey) beſtoweth his force to the felling the tree, which is lightly doone by meane of many handes, and the tenderneſſe of the tymber, the hawkes all that whyle lying vpon their winges looking for their game: who finding the tree to fayle hir, at the fall is dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to truſt hir winges agayne, and ſo by a freſhe flight and newe encounter, doth yeelde exceeding pleaſure to his Maieſtie and ſuch as are in the fielde, and in fyne, is ſlayne by hir mightie aduerſaries the Gerfalcons, who moſt greedily doe ſeaze vpon hir, as their kynde hath taught them to doe. I imagine the flight to be verie ſtrong, and truely the paſtime and pleaſure can not be ſmall, but a game fit for ſuch a mightie Prince as his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie is.

founde in Egypt, and in the weaſt partes, and in Babylon. She will ſlay the Hare and ſuch like.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde kynde is called Semy, ſhe kylles the Choughe, as hir proper game wherein ſhe taken the greateſt pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The thyrde is called Hynair or the Peleryn Sacre, after the Egyptians and Aſſyrians.</p>
               <p>She is called a Peleryn or Haggart, for that hir eyree is not knowne, and bycauſe yearely ſhe maketh hir paſſage towardes Iudea, or Media, ſhe is taken in the Iles of Leuant, Cypres, Candye, and Rhodes. And therefore ſome thinke ſhe commeth out of Ruſſia, and Tartaria, and alſo from the greate Sea. That Sacre that is taken an entermewer, is the beſt hawke,</p>
               <p>The Sacre is of all hawkes the moſt labourſome, and beſt able to brooke hir flight. Shee is alſo peacible and verie tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a hawke that can beſt away with courſe and groſſe diet.</p>
               <p>The praye of the Sacre are greate foules, the Heron, the Gooſe, the Crane, Bytor, and withall the ſmall beaſtes of the fielde and foreſt.</p>
               <p>It is well to be ſene, that the Sacre is a hawk ſomwhat lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the Haggart falcon, of a ruſtie and ragged plume like the Kyte, the ſeare of hir beake &amp; foote like the Laner, hir pou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces but ſhort, neuertheleſſe, ſhe is of great force, &amp; hardie to all kynd of foule, as I haue alreadie reported of the Haggart and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Falcons, but not ſo ventrous and free to flee the Crane, or ſuch like game as the Haggart Falcon is.</p>
               <p>This Sacre is a paſſenger, euen as the haggart Falcon is. No man is able truly to ſay, where ſhe eireeth or diſcloſeth, but at the Rhodes they ſay they come from the parts of Ruſſia, and Tartaria, and the Ocean Sea. Theſe Sacres are taken in great number in the Iles of Leuant, Candle, Cypres, and Rhodes, &amp; ſundry other Ilandes of the Ocean ſea. But I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe to you, that the Sacre is more diſpoſed to the fielde a great deale than to the brooke. As to flee the wilde Gooſe, the Byttor, the Feaſant, the Partridge, and all ſuch like foules. And is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo daintie of hir dyet, or to be kepte, as the long winged hawkes are.</p>
               <p>

               <p>She is a Hawke chiefly to flee the kite, and yet may be made and manned, to flee the field, and ſlay other game of the field as the Falcon doth.</p>
               <p>The Noble men that take pleaſure in the Sacre, to make a flight with hyr at the kite, do vſe this order and deuice, to bring the kite downe from hir mountee, for that in the heate of the day ſhe doth vſe to ſore and flee of an exceding height in the cloudes, to take the comforte of the colde and freſhe ayre, that is in the middle region: They tie a foxe tayle to the legge of a Mallard or Ducke, whom they cauſe to be borne on the fiſte of ſome one Falconer, and do ſo let the ducke flee in the middeſt of a playne, whom as ſone as the kite deſcries from hir pitche, ſhe preſently bateth of hir gate, and maketh hyr ſtoupyng to the grounde, and there gazeth and wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dreth at the ſtraungeneſſe and the ſhape of this fowle; then do they caſt of the Sacre to the kyte, who forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with truſting to the goodneſſe of hyr wing, getteth vp to hyr pitche, as hie as poſſible ſhe may, by making often turnes and wrenches in the ayre, where it is a very pleaſant ſporte to behold the bickring that is betwixt them in the ayre, ſpecially if it be in a playne, where no trees or groues are, to hinder the ſight of the matter, and the day fayre and not windie, for then will the Kite and Sacre ſore ſo hie, as they will flee cleane out of ſight.

                  <p>The Tunycian may alſo be called a Punycian Falcon, for that which we reade of the warres Punicke, againſt the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginenſes, beyng mainteined againſt the inhabitantes of that place, where nowe is ſituated Tunyce.</p>
                  <p>The Tunycian is large, approching neare the nature of a Laner, and verie like in plume and mayle, and not vnlike, for the ſeare of hir foote, but ſomewhat leſſe, and of a longe flyght: hir head is large and rounde.</p>

               <p>THere is a kynde of Falcon that is called a Merlyn. Theſe Merlyns are very much like the Haggart falcon in plume, in ſeare of the foote, in beake and talons. So as there ſeemeth to be no oddes or difference at al betwixt them, ſaue onely in the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for ſhe hath like demeanure, like plume, and very like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to the Falcon, and in hir kind is of like courage, &amp; there-muſt be kept as choycely and as daintily as the Falcon.</p>
               <p>Aſſuredly diuers of theſe Merlyns become paſſing good haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23404:32"/>
and verie ſkilfull, their propertie by nature is to kyll Thruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes, Larkes, and Partridges. They flee with greater fierceneſſe and more hotely than any other hawke of praye. They are of greater pleaſure, and full of courage, but a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſt make grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter care, and take good heede to them, for they are ſuch buſie and vnruly things with their beaks, as diuers times they eate of their owne feete and talons verie vnnaturally, ſo as they dye of it. And this is the reaſon and true cauſe, that ſildome or neuer ſhall you ſee a mewed or entermewed Merlyn. For that in the mewe they do ſpoyle themſelues, as I haue before declared.</p>
               <p>My Italyan Author hath theſe words, both of the ſhape and in commendation of the Merlyn.</p>
               <p>The Merlyn is (ſayth he) of the ſhape of a Falcon, leſſe than the Sparowhawke, more nimble and wight of wing than any other hawke, ſhe doth kyll all ſuch game and pray as the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowhawke doth vſe to ſlay, ſpecially ſmall byrds, namely Larks, Sparowes, and ſuch like, all which ſhe doth purſue with excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding crueltie and courage.</p>
               <p>She is reported to be a hawke of the fiſte and not of the lure, albeit a man may if he will, make hir to the lure alſo. She is a verie ventrous hawke and hardie: by this we may coniecture it: For though ſhe be little bigger than a Piegon, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſhe will hazard hir ſelfe to flee the Partridge, the Quayle, and ſuch other like foules, more large than hir ſelfe, and wil pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue them in ſo cruell maner, as ſundry times ſhe followeth them, euen to the villages &amp; townes, whether the ſilly birdes do flee for ayde and reſcue, from their naturall foe the hawke.</p>
               <p>The Merlin is the only hawke of al others in whom (as mine Author affirmeth) there is no difference betwixt the male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, but yet by experience we finde it otherwiſe, for the female is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> larger bird of the two, and more big than y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other in ſight.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion, that <hi>Lydos, Hierax,</hi> in greeke, and <hi>Leuis accipiter</hi> in Latin, is our Merlyn of whome we ſpeake, and that thoſe birdes of praye whome <hi>Aristotle</hi> termeth (<hi>Leues</hi>) to our iudgement ſhuld be the Merlyns, bicauſe they are the leſſe haw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes of all others that are to be founde.</p>

               <p>OF all birdes of praye that belong to the Falconers vſe, I know none leſſe than the Hobbye vnleſſe it be the Merlyn.</p>
               <p>The Hobbye is a hawke of the lure, and not of the fiſt: alſo ſhe is of the number of thoſe hawkes that are hye fleeing and towre hawkes, as the Falcon, the Laner, and the Sacre be. If a man be diſpoſed to deſcribe the Hobbye, he can not do better, nor deale more artificially, than to matche hir for ſhape with the Sacre.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23404:33"/>
For in good fayth there is but ſmall difference or inequalitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt them, ſaue that the Sacre is farre the huger byrde.</p>
               <p>The propertie of the Hobbie in all countries and regions, where they are eyreed, or otherwiſe brought is to ſoare and flee vpon the hounteſmen and Falconers, and ſo to follow them verie watchfully, to the ende that when they ſpring or put vp any ſmal byrdes, ſhe may ſloupe from hir winges, and ſeaze on them as on hir pray. And this is ſo ordinary a hawke, and the practiſe that I ſpeake of ſo generall, as there is not the ſimpleſt bowre or pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant but doth know it. I can make no fitter nor more apte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon, than to reſemble the frye and ſmall fiſh of the ſea, being had in chaſe by the huger ſort of fiſh deſirous to deuour them: to the ſmall foules and birds of the ayre, purſued by the Hobbye.</p>
               <p>For as ſone as the ſilly fiſhe that is chaſed by the Delphin and ſuch like, do perceiue their ſafetie to be nothing in the Element of water, where, by God and nature they are alotted to liue, eftſone haue they their recourſe to the ayre to ſaue them ſelues, choſing rather to lye at the mercie of the rauening ſea foules, ſoaring vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the water, than to yeelde them ſelues in pray to their naturall aduerſaries the fiſh. Euen ſo the Hobbies perceiuing the hunteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Falconers in the field ſo hunt the poore Leueret, or flee y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Partridge, do forthwith accompanie them, ſoring vpon them, in hope to encounter ſome one ſmal bird or other, whom y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hounds or ſpanels ſhal by fortune put vp, and ſpring by ranging y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field. Then the Larkes and ſuch like ſmall foules, whoſe nature is not to braunch or take the tree, but altogither to liue vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, finding themſelues purſued by the hounds and ſpanels, to begile the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, are enforſt to truſt to their wings, and to take the ayre, &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, finding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues moleſted by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Falconers &amp; Hobbies, do make their choyce and election to become a pray rather to the dogs, or ſeeke mercy among the horſe legges, and ſo to be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed aliue, than to affie in the curteſie of the cruell Hobbies, and to be taken in their cruell talons, where they are moſt aſſured to dye the death.</p>
               <p>The Hobby is ſo nimble and wight of wing, that ſhe dares encounter the Crowe, and to giue ſouſe for ſouſe, and blowe for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23404:33"/>
blowe with him in the ayre.</p>
               <p>This is a naturall and ſpeciall tricke that ſhe dothe vſe, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying the Falconers in the field ſhe doth followe them, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende on them, but it is but for a certaine ſpace, as though in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie deede ſhe had hyr lymites and boundes preſcribed hir, and appoynted howe farre ſhe ſhoulde flee. For as ſone as ſhe lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth them, ſhe preſently ſcoureth along the ſyde of ſome groue or highe woode, where ſhe dothe ordinarily vſe to pearch and take the ſtande.</p>
               <p>The Hobbye hath a blew beake, but the ſeare of hir beake and legges is yellowe. The crynet or little blacke feathers vnder hyr eyes be verie blacke, ſo as moſte commonly they continue and proceede from the beake to the temples or eare burres, and in like manner, is there an other blacke ſtreake that deſcendeth to eyther ſide of hir gorge. As touching the top of the heade, it is betwixt blacke and yellowe, but hath two whyte ſeames vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the necke. The plumes vnder the gorge and about the browes, are reddiſhe, without ſpot or droppe. The plumes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the bellie (or as I may beſt terme them) the breaſt feathers, are broune for the moſt parte, and yet poudered with whyte ſpottes, as Ermynes. All the backe, the trayne and the wyngs are blacke aloft, ſhe hath no great ſcales vpon hir legges, vnleſſe it be a fewe that beginne behinde the three ſtretchers and poun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which are verie large in reſpect of hir ſhort legges. Hir bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yle feathers are engouted twixte red and blacke. The pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant feathers (which are thoſe behinde the thigh) are of a ruſtie and ſmokie verniſh complexion. When a man ſeeth hir ſore aloft in the ayre, he wil iudge hir vnder the wings, that hir plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and downe, as well of hir winges as betwixt hir legges, is ruſſet and reddiſhe mayled.</p>
               <p>There are two foules, wherof the one is called (<hi>Ian le blancke</hi>) which I take to be the Harrohen or capped Kyte, and the other (<hi>Blanch queue</hi>) the ring tayle, who doe alwayes flee with hir for company, beating and ſouſing the Larkes, and if happily they ſpye the Hobbye encountering the Larke, whome they put and force ſo hir winges, it is a pleaſure to behold the game
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23404:34"/>
that is betwixt this caſt of buſſardes and the hawke. For their deſire and intent is to bereaue the ſillye Hobbye hir praye: but ſhee being nimble and wight of wing, encountreth with them, entercepting the Larke from them, manger their might and ſundrie times they buckle ſo together, as you ſhall ſee them come tu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bling down both yfeare, one faſt griping &amp; ſeazed on the other.</p>
               <p>Some would haue that this Hobby of whom I write, ſhould be that byrde whome <hi>Aristotle</hi> calleth <hi>Hipotriorchis,</hi> and the Latines <hi>Subuteo:</hi> but I am not of that mynde, but that it ſhould rather be the <hi>Sacret</hi> whome <hi>Aristotle</hi> doth meane. But let the learned reader iudge the controuerſie, I am to lay downe their natures and properties, and not to decyde any matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie which in deede doth belong to the curious Falconer, and not to him that doth imbrace more the ſporte, than the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie and oddes of ſpeache, which in euerie arte a man ſhall be aſſured to fynde. Let it ſuffice if I gyue the Reader to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande the nature of euerie hawke nowe adayes in vſe, and withall (according to my promiſe and meaning) doe let him knowe the meane to flye with them bothe the fyelde and brooke, as alſo to doe hym to witte, howe to Mewe, Ympe, and cure them beyng diſeaſed. Theſe are the ſpeciall poynts, and ſuch as deſerue thankes from me, and commendation from him. I will proceede in the deſcription of the nature of this hawke, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of the Italian.</p>

                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:23404:35"/>THere are (ſayth he) fiue kindes of Autours or Goſhawkes, ſpeaking of the Goſhawke in the largeſt name and nature, compryſed in that woorde, Autour.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and moſte noble kinde, is the female Goſhawke, whiche is with vs moſt ordinarily in vſe.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is named a demy Autour, or Goſhawke, as it were a kind betwixt twoo other ſortes, and that is a ſpare ſlender hawke and of little regard, in reſpect of any good ſhe will do.</p>
                  <p>The third is the Tyercle whiche is the male, or cocke to the Goſhawke, who doth ſlay the Partridge, and is not of ſufficient force to kill the Crane. He is termed a Tyerclet, for that there are moſt commonly diſcloſed three byrdes in one ſelfe eyree, two Hawkes, and one Tiercell.</p>
                  <p>The fourth kind of Autour is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sparowhawke, whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is to kill all kinde of praye that the Goſhawke dothe, ſaue onely the larger ſorte of fowles.</p>
                  <p>The fifth kind is called (<hi>Sabech</hi>) whom the Egiptians terme (<hi>Baydach</hi>) which doth very much reſemble the Sparowhawke, but is leſſe than the Sparowhawke, and hath a very blewe eye.</p>
                  <p>There are ſundrie ſortes of Goſhawkes, and thoſe brought and conueyed out of ſundrie forayne partes and regions, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, that Goſhawke that is bred &amp; eyreed in Armenia, and Perſia, is the principall beſt hawke, and then next to hyr in goodneſſe, the hawke of Greece, and laſtly that of Afrike.</p>
                  <p>The hawke of Armenia hath hyr eyes greene, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beſt of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kinde is ſhe that hath blacke eyes, &amp; blacke plumes on hir backe.</p>
                  <p>The hawke of Perſia is large, wel plumed, cleare and deepe eyed, with hangyng and pendant eyleddes and browes.</p>
                  <p>The hawke of Greece hath a great head, well ſeaſoned, a ſtrong necke, and is reaſonable well plumed.</p>
                  <p>the Goſhawke of Afrike, hath blacke eyes in hyr ſoarage, but being a mewed hawke, hyr eyes become reddiſh and fierie.</p>
                  <p>At what times Hawkes begin to fall to liking, which is at Cawking time, all byrdes of pray do aſſemble themſelues with the Goſhawke, and do flocke togither. As namely the Falcon, the Sacre, and ſuch other that liue on praye and rauine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:23404:36"/>And hereof it proceedeth that the Goſhawkes become ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers in goodneſſe, force, and hardineſſe, according to the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their choyce, and cawkyng.</p>
                  <p>The beſt Goſhawke ought to be weightie, and a heauie bird, as thoſe of great <hi>Armenia</hi> bee.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Syria</hi> they make choyce of their Hawkes, by the Maſſynes and poyſe of them, &amp; do eſteeme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> moſt weightie Hawke for the beſt: as for the mayle &amp; conditions they do little regard or prize.</p>
                  <p>The blancke Goſhawke is the largeſt, the fayreſt, and moſte apt and eaſie to be reclaymed, and withall the ſtrongeſt of all Hawkes of that ſorte, for ſhe can kill the Crane. And by reaſon ſhe is eyreed in a very hie and loftie place, and ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beſt endure the colde, which is moſt frife in the middle region of the ayre, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſhe good to flee all fowles of that ſorte and condition.</p>
                  <p>The Goſhawke that doth encline and tend to a blacke maile, and that hath ſuperfluous plumes on hyr head, reachyng downe hir fronte or forehead, like a peruque, or borowed hayre, that is a very fayre Hawke for beauty, but nothing ſtrong.</p>

                  <head>The good proportion and ſhape of a Goſhawke.</head>
                  <p>SHe ought to haue a ſmall head, hyr face long and ſtraight like the Vultur or Eagle, a large winde pipe or throte, great eyes, deepe ſet, and the apple or middle parte of the eye blacke, nares, eares, backe and feete, large and blancke, a blacke long beake, long necke, bigge breſt, harde fleſh, long thighes, fleſhie, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant one from the other, the bone of the legge and knee ſhorte, long and large pounces, and talons.</p>
                  <p>The ſhape from the ſterne or trayne, to the breſt forwarde, ought to grow to a roundeneſſe. The feathers of the thighes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the trayne ſhould be large, and the trayne feathers, ſhort, ſofte, and ſomewhat tending to an yron mayle.</p>
                  <p>The brayle feathers ought to bee, like the breſt feathers, and the couert feathers of the trayne, ſhould be ſpotted, and full of blacke rondels, but the colour of the very extremitrie and poynt

of euery trayne feather, ought to be blacke ſtreaked. Of mayle &amp; colour, the beſt is the red, ſomewhat tending to blacke or playne grieſeld.</p>
                  <p>The ſignes of a good Goſhawke, are haughtie courage, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and greedie luſte to feede, often tyring and plucking of hyr meate, ſuddayne ſnatching of hyr foode vpon the fiſte, good endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and great force in aſſayling hir game.</p>
                  <p>The ſigne of boldeneſſe in a Goſhawke is this, tie hyr in an open lighte place, and after a while darcken and obſcure it, by ſhutting ſome windowe or ſuch like deuice, then touche hyr vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ſuddayne at vnwares, if ſhe then iumpe, and leppe to the fiſte without feare or aſtoniſhment, that is an aſſured ſigne of hardineſſe in a Goſhawke.</p>
                  <p>The token of force in a Goſhawke, is this, tie diuers Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes in ſundrie places of one ſelfe chamber or mewe, and that Hawke that dothe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>A token of goodneſſe and excellencie in thoſe demie Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhawkes, whom my Author doth terme (<hi>petite Autours</hi>) is to haue large and cleare eyen, a ſmall head, long necke, lowe and cloſe plume or downe, harde fleſhe, a greene ſeere of hir foote, large ſtretchers and not gowtie or fleſhie, quicke enduyng, large panell, and able to ſlyſe farre from hir when ſhe mewteth.

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23404:37"/>
a great head, a ſhorte necke, to be thicke and groſſe plumed, ſofte fleſhed, ſhort thighed, long armed, ſhorte talons, tawnie hewed, tending to blacke, and harde and rough vnder the foote.</p>
                  <p>A Goſhawke that when ſhe is looſe in the houſe, flees as though ſhe were at large and libertie, breakyng out of a mewe hauyng great groſſe feathers, eyes as redde as bloud, that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uermore batyng, and beyng ſet on the perche, offreth to flee at the face of a man, ſuche a Hawke if ſhe be kepte lowe in fleſhe can not be borne on the fiſte, if ſhe be hie and full of fleſhe, ſhe wil not then abide with hir keeper, but rangle and gadde: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of ſuch Hawkes there is no accompt to be made at all.</p>
                  <p>A fearefull Goſhawke is hardly to be reclaymed and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for the feare ſhe hath will alwayes cauſe hyr to refuſe the fiſte and lure, and make hyr checke, and not willingly repayre to any deuiſe wherwith ſhe is called and rappelde, after hyr flight: whiche is a verie great inconuenience in a Goſhawke, and no ſmall hindrance to the ſporte of him that ſhall happen to haue ſuche a fearefull Hawke: for commonly vnleſſe they be firſte fonde of the keeper, and in loue with the call, they will not flee their game to the likyng of their owner, and the tediouſneſſe in commyng by them agayne after the flight, dothe breede forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of the paſtime, how good and delectable ſoeuer it were before.</p>
                  <p>That Goſhawke, that hath pendant plumes ouer hyr eyes, and (as they ſay in the Countrie) whoſe feathers hang in hir light, the whyte of whoſe eye is very watriſhe and blancke, that is redde maylde, or bright tawnie, hath the moſte aſſured token that may be of ill condicions, and is not like to be well co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming. But if happely ſuch a Hawke fall once to be good, ſhe will then proue a paſſing Hawke.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes (though very ſeldome) do wee ſee a Goſhawke of badde ſhape and in condition cleane contrarie to thoſe ſignes that ought to be lookt for in a good Goſhauke, proue light, luſty, able to hold out and maintayne hir flight, and ſuch a one as will very well ſlay the greater ſorte of fowles.</p>

                     <pb n="63" facs="tcp:23404:37"/>The Goſhawkes praye, is the Fezant, the Malard, the wilde Gooſe, the Hare and Conie: beſides all whiche ſhe will ſtrike ventrouſlie, and ſeaze on a Kidde or Goate, and keepe him play ſo long, as the dogges at length ſhall come in to aſſyſte hir and further the fall of it, whiche doth manifeſtly decypher the great ineſtimable courage, and valour of the Hawke.</p>

                  <head>Out of the French I haue collected this concerning the Goſhawke.</head>
                  <p>SOme men haue thought, and bene of this reſolute minde, that the (Autour) or Goſhawke hath bene of the kind of a Vultur, for the affinitie and neareneſſe of their termes and names: for (Autour) in the French, is that Hawke whom we call the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke, and (Vantour) is the Vultur, which twoo termes, as you ſee, draw very neare to one ſpeach.</p>
                  <p>Some other haue been of opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that betwixt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goſhawke and Sparowhawke, is no oddes or differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in nature, ſaue only in reſpect of the hugeneſſe of that one, and the ſlenderneſſe of the other: but my purpoſe is to treate of the Goſhawke ſeuerally from the Sparowhawke, and ſo to proceede to the Sparow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke, of whom I wil write, according to the French and Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Authours, in a ſeuerall chapter by it ſelfe, to auoyde the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which otherwiſe might happen in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>The Goſhawke is euer more regarded than hyr Tiercell, for the males, or cockes among Hawkes and byrdes of praye, do make euident proofe and ſhew to the eye, of their difference from the femals and Hawkes.</p>
                  <p>Againe we may with eaſe diſcerne the Goſhawke from hyr Tyercell, for that ſhe is farre larger, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Tiercell of hir kind.</p>
                  <p>The Falconers and Oſtregers, haue to theſe two ſorts, added a thirde kinde (as I ſayd before) whome they terme the Demy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſhawke, as a byrde indifferent, betwixt the other twoo.</p>
                  <p>Bothe kindes of them are more hie, and longer armed than eyther the Falcon, or Gerfalcon: they are Hawkes of the fiſte, and (as wee call them) rounde winged Hawkes, quite contrarie
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23404:38"/>
to thoſe I wrote of before, all whiche are Hawkes of the lure, and long winged Hawkes, otherwiſe called Towre Hawkes.</p>
                  <p>The Hawke (I meane the female) is uery much like the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle in mayle, and if wee may make bolde to compare the leſſe with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> larger, ſhe hath a more ſtately high necke than the Egle, and of a more redde or yron mayle, the grownde of hir plume and downe tending to a redde colour.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe Goſhawkes that are of Slauonia, are good at all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of game, large, hardie, and fayre plumed, their toungs black, and their nares great and wide.</p>
                  <p>There are Goſhawkes, whom the Italians call, <hi>Alpiſani,</hi> or haukes of the Alpes, which are much vſed in Lombardie, and Tuſcane, they are more thicke than they are lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, fierce &amp; hardie.</p>
                  <p>But thoſe Goſhawkes that our Oſtregers haue now adaies, are chiefly conueyed out of Almayne, hauing their eyes and the feare of the beake as alſo of theyr feete and legges, yellow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Gerfalcon, whoſe feare is blew and azure.</p>
                  <p>Their traynes are garniſhed with large droppes or ſpottes, croſſing the feather, partie blacke, and partie grey, as alſo the plumes of the necke and head, are more towardes a ruſſet, and powdred with blacke, but thoſe of the thighe and vnder the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or pannell, are otherwiſe marked, for they are not full ſo yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, hauing rounde droppes on them, not muche vnlike thoſe that are on the Peacockes trayne.</p>
                  <p>The Goſhawkes of Almaine are not verie fayre though they be large Hawkes, redde mayled, and yet not hardie.</p>
                  <p>There are ſundrie of them good in their ſoarage, but beyng once mewed proue nothing worthe: there be diuers of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> taken in the foreſt of Arde, and in ſundrie places of Almaine.

                  </p>

                  <p>THere are ſundie ſortes of Goſhawkes, according to the diuerſitie of places and regions. There be Hawkes of
<hi>Armenia, Slauonia, Sardinia, Calament,</hi> of the Alpes, whiche they vſe in <hi>Lombardie, Tuſcan, Marca,</hi> and <hi>Puglia,</hi> ſome other of <hi>Ruſsia, Friuli, Almania,</hi> and otherſome of <hi>Lombardie,</hi> all which I will briefly touch vnto you, and not long dwell in the matter, hauing out of my french authors already deciphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the natures of the moſt part of them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of al there are Goſhawkes, called Armenia Hawkes, much differing from the Goſhawke, in ſort as almoſt, they haue no reſemblance at all to the other kinds of Goſhawkes. They are very fayre and huge, the mayle of them is blancke, as ſundrie haggart Falcons be, they flee with great courage and life, all greater ſort of fowles.</p>
                  <p>There are others eyried in <hi>Slauonia</hi> and <hi>Dalmacia,</hi> and thence are they tearmed Slauon Goſhawkes, which indeede are good for any thing a man will employ them vnto. Very fayre &amp; hardy Hawkes, large footed, very well penned, theyr downe and plumage excellent fine, their tungs blacke, and their nares large and wide.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of Sardinia are nothing like the other Hawkes, they are browne, and ruſſet plumed, finall Hawkes, hard and not ſmall footed, and nothing ventrous.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:23404:39"/>Thoſe of <hi>Calament</hi> are ſhort truſſed Hawkes, and large, blancke ſeared on the foote, thoſe flee the greater fowles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding well.</p>
                  <p>The Goſhawkes of the Alpes, and of <hi>Calabria,</hi> are in a manner more large than they are long, very prowde, and hardie Hawkes.</p>
                  <p>The Goſhawkes of <hi>Lombardie</hi> are not very large, browne mayld, and cowardly kytes to do any good.</p>
                  <p>The Goſhawke of <hi>Ruſsia</hi> and <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> is a large and huge Hawke, the moſt part of them are blancke Hawkes, and taken vp of great Princes and noble ſtates, they are apt and able to do any thing that may be looked for from Hawkes of that kinde. My ſelfe haue ſeene great ſtore of them in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Moſqua,</hi> which is the chiefe dukedome of all <hi>Ruſsia.</hi> The
<hi>Moſcouits</hi> &amp; <hi>Tartarians</hi> doe vſe to flee with thoſe Goſhawkes at the brooke, &amp; there do beate vp the fowle with y<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e drumme, without whiche you ſhall ſeldome ſee a Boyaron (as they tearme them) which is a Gentleman, ride at any time. And one ſpeciall thing which I noted among them was, that as well <hi>Moſcouites,</hi> as <hi>Tartares,</hi> do vſe to beare their Hawkes on the right fiſte, whiche is cleane contrary to our manner and guiſe heere in England, or in any other Region that I haue heard or ſeene, ſaue only in thoſe North partes, no reaſon I can yeeld for it, but that, each countrey for the moſt part hath his faſhion.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of <hi>Friuli,</hi> are good Hawkes, and large, but not ſo fayre as the Slauon Hawkes.</p>
                  <p>Note this, that a good Goſhawke ought to be littell, and broad ſhouldred, large breſted, very round and fleſhly, hauing a long thigh, a ſhort legge or arme, and the ſame greate, and a large foote, and not gowty but ſlender. Contrariwiſe the Tiercell ſhould be large, for it is a common ſaying.</p>
                  <p>A little Hawke, and a large Tiercell, is euer beſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:23404:39"/>All Goſhawkes are by nature greedye, and catching of whome ſome we vſe to flee the riuer, and freſh brookes, and ſome the Sea, and otherſome agayne the field, and neuer or very ſeldome the riuer or brooke.</p>
                  <p>The firſte ſorte for the moſt parte doe pray vppon Duckes, Geeſe, Hearons, Shouelers, and ſuch lyke fowle, as do vſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie haunt, and liue in the Sea and riuers. And thoſe diuers times doe ſeaze and take theyr pray vppon the ſuddayne at vnwares, by fleeing lowe neare the ground, and ſtealing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the fowle.</p>
                  <p>The other, after a while that they haue vſed to flee the field, do pray on Pigeons, Pullets, Hennes, and Partridges. And being once mewed hawkes, and paſt their ſoarage, they will take the ſtand vppon ſome tree, and finding eyther Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, Fezant, Pullet, Henne, or ſuche other like fowle, they make their ſtowping ſo fiercely and in ſuch great haſt, and do flee them ſo farre before hed and at randon, mayntayning, and making good their flight, as in the end they kill them, and do pray vpon them.</p>
                  <p>Of the Goſhawkes, thoſe that bee ventrous, and hardie, will kill the Hare, and hauing kilde him, diuers times, they ſwallow in for haſt greate bones, and doe put them ouer very well, and endue them ſafely withoute anye hurte at all.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that are the riuer Goſhawkes, and doe haunte the water, and brookes, are commonly the moſte hardy and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Hawkes of all that kynde, and do at the riuer of theyr owne inclination and nature fall to kill the greate fowles of the Riuer, of whyche I haue before made recitall and mention.</p>
                  <p>Truely the Goſhawke is very muche to be regarded for hir hardie mettall and courage, for that therein ſhe is not inferiour to anye kynde of Hawke, but rather more fearce and eger. And agayne to bee kept with greater care, for that ſhee is more choyce and daynty, and doeth looke

                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:23404:42"/>Hir feeding is vpon Rattes, Squirrells, and Liſards, and ſometimes vpon certaine birdes ſhe doth vſe to praye, whome ſhe doth intrappe and deceyue by flyght, for this is hir deuiſe.</p>

               <p>Theſe hawkes are in no accompt with vs, but poore ſimple fellowes and peaſantes ſometimes do make them to the fiſte, and beeyng reclaymed after their vnſkilfull manner, do beare them hooded, as Falconers doe their other kindes of hawkes whome they make to greater purpoſes.</p>

               <p>Firſte, it is behooueful for a Falconer to bee very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent &amp; inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiue to learn and marke the qualitye and mettell of his hawkes, &amp; to knowe whiche hawke he ſhal
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:23404:44"/>
flee withall earely, and with whiche late, bycauſe all hawkes are not diſpoſed or mettelde alike. Wherefore, the firſte and ſpeciall obſeruation is, to note the naturall inclination and diſpoſition of his hawkes in that behalfe.</p>
               <p>Then nexte is it neceſſarie for him to bee fonde ouer his hawke, patte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; withall carefull to keepe hir cleane out of liſe, mytes, and all ſuche other diſeaſes, as I ſhall hereafter treate of in the latter parte of this collection, with ſuche remedies, as I ſhall laye downe for euery griefe. And of the twoo, hee muſt rather keepe his hawke hye, and full of fleſhe, than poore and lowe. Beſides that, this is one generall rule, whiche by experience you ſhall finde to bee moſt true, that all kindes of hawkes are more ſubiect to infirmities, being poore and lowe, than when they are luſtie and full in fleſhe.</p>
               <p>Euery night, after he hath fleen with his hawke the daye, either at the fielde, or brooke, he muſte giue his hawke caſting, ſomewhyles plumage, ſome other while pellets of Cotton, or ſuche like, and agayne, ſometimes ſome one medicine or other, according as by hir caſting, or mewte, he ſhall perceyue hir to ſtande needefull thereof, whiche poynte I will more at large deſcribe, in another place proper and peculiar to that matter.</p>
               <p>Euery night, hee muſte not forgette to make the place very cleane vnder the pearche, ſo as he may bothe finde the caſting of his hawke, and be certainly aſſured whither ſhe hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy caſte or not, whereby he may the better iudge and diſcerne hir ſtate. For by the caſting is founde, whither the hawke do neede eyther vpwarde, or downward ſcowrings, or ſtones, or any ſuche like remedie.</p>
               <p>He muſte remember euery euening to tye out his hawke a weathering, ſaue onely in ſuche dayes, as ſhe hath bathed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for bycauſe then the taking ouermuche moyſture, wyll breede hir a thouſande euills and inconueniences. For ſuche euenings as ſhe hath bathed the daye, ſhee ought of right to be placed in ſome warme chamber on a pearche, with a candle burning by hir, where ſhe muſt ſit vnhooded, if ſo ſhe be gentle,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:23404:44"/>
and not rammage, to the ende ſhe may tricke hir ſelfe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce by enoyling hir after the water, before ſhe flee againe.</p>
               <p>Euery morning earely he muſte not forgette to ſet hir out to wether hir, where if ſhee haue not alreadie caſte, ſhee may caſte, and there keepe hir hooded, till ſuche tyme as ſhee go to the fielde.</p>
               <p>In feeding his hawke, he muſte beware of giuing hir twoo ſortes of meate at one time, to gorge hir withall, neither muſt hee gyue hir ſuche fleſhe, as hath any euill ſauour, and is not ſweete, but muſte reſpecte to allowe hir holſome meates, for breeding ill diſeaſes. For Hawkes are dayntie birdes, in their kinde, and the more to be conſidered of, when they are in hande, vnder a Falconers keeping and vſage, bycauſe they were wonte to praye for themſelues at libertie, and therein followe ſuche lawe and order, as nature had preſcribed them, but being reſtrayned, the courſe of kinde is quite altered in them, and therfore the greater arte and regard to be vſed for them. Arte muſt ſupplie the reſtraintes of kinde, by cunning.</p>
               <p>He muſte beware, if happily he haue occaſion of neceſſarie buſines, at his departure from home, not to leaue his hawke tyed on a pearche of any greate heyght from the grounde, for feare of bating &amp; hanging by the heeles, for then either will ſhe caſte hir gorge, or otherwiſe ſpoyle hir ſelfe: but ſhe muſte be placed on a lowe blocke, or ſtone, and if there be mo hawkes than one, they muſte be ſundred ſo farre one from the other, as they maye not approche or reache one the other, neyther with beake, talons, or otherwiſe, bicauſe their nature is to byte, and buckle togither, if they come within reache.</p>
               <p>When he addreſſeth him to make his flighte with his Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, it is behoouefull for him to haue all hir fellow Falconers, or ſuch as haue hawkes in the field, to ſet downe their hawkes on the grounde, to be in the more readineſſe to aſſiſte him in his purpoſe, and to tye them ſure, for feare of ill accidents that may befall them.</p>
               <p>And againe, at the ryuer, he muſt ſkilfull to lande his fowle
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:23404:45"/>
ſo placing the reſidue of his company, and their hawkes, as they may flee eke without any encounter, which is not onely the loſſe of the fowle, and hinderance to their ſporte, but alſo the ruine and ſpoyle of their hawkes on both partes. He muſt be carefull that his hawke keepe hir gate, and flee it good, ſo as in no wiſe hee plucke hir not downe, nor make hir bate of hir pitche.</p>
               <p>He muſte alwayes be aſſured to haue mummy in powder in his bagge in a readineſſe, whatſoeuer ſhould happen, with ſuche other medicines as I ſhall hereafter treate of, for that it may ſo fall out, as his hawke may receyue a brooſe at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter of a fowle. Moreouer he muſte not be vnfurniſhed of Aloes waſht, Cloues, Nutmugges, Saffron, caſting, cryance, and ſuche like neceſſarie implementes. And he muſt remember that his Aloes be ſhining and cleare, for then is it of the beſte ſorte of Aloes.</p>
               <p>Laſtely he muſte be able to make his lures, hooddes, of all ſortes, Ieſſes, bucts, &amp; other nedefull furniture for his hawke, and muſt not be without ſtore therof to allow his betters and ſtates in the fielde, if happily they want any ſuche deuiſes. He cannot well be without his coping yrons, to cope his hawkes beake if it be ouergrowen, whiche will be a hinderance to hir feeding, and to cope hir pownces and talons, if neede be. He muſte haue his cauterizing buttons, and other yron or ſiluer tooles, to cauterize or burne his hawkes if cauſe require ſuche cure.

               <head>The firſt inſtruction is, how to make a Falcon and other hawkes fleeing, after the opinion of Ian de Franchiers.</head>
               <p>FIrſt, let your hawke be taken on the fiſte, and hoodded, then let hir be watched three dayes and nightes, before you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode hir, and feede hir alwayes hooded in an eaſie rufter hoode. At the ende of three dayes you may vnhoode hir, and feede hir vnhooded, and when ſhe is fedde, hoode hir againe, ſo that ſhe be not vnhooded (but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you feede hir) vntil ſhe know hir meate: then when ſhe beginneth to be acquainted with you, hoode hir and vnhood hir oftentimes, to the end ſhe may the better abide the hoode. But vſe hir gently, and be pacient with hir at the firſt, and to the ende your hawke may be the better manned, &amp; the ſooner reclaimed, you ſhall do wel to beare hir co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly in places where moſt people do freque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and where moſt exerciſes are vſed. And when ſhe is well manned, make hir come a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the fiſte for hir meate. And when you haue ſhewed hir the perche or ſtocke, and tyed hir vpon it, put with hir vpon the ſayde pearche or ſtocke ſome Pullet, or other quicke fowle as often as you may, and let hir feede thereon at pleaſure vntill ſhe be reaſonably gorged, and do in like maner vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lewer vntill ſhe knowe it perfectly. Afterwardes you may giue hir more libertie, and lewer hir with a cryance, lewring hir twice a daye further and further of. And when ſhee is throughly lewred, you ſhall teache hir to flee vpon you, vntill ſhe know bothe howe to get to hir gate, and to flee rownde vpon you. Then ſhall you caſte hir oute ſome quicke fowle, and when ſhee hath ſtowped and ſeazed vpon it, you ſhall ſuffer hir to plume it and to foote it at hir pleaſure, giuing hir a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble gorge theron, as is before ſayde, and continewing alwaies to rewarde hir vpon the ſayde lewer, in ſuch ſort, that ſhe neuer finde the lewer without ſome rewarde tyed vpon it, and by
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:23404:46"/>
that meanes ſhee will alwayes loue the lewer and hir keeper well, and will not lightly rangle or be loſte. Thus you may continue hir fortie dayes, or thereaboutes, and then you may flee with hir ſafe ynough. But before you ſo doo, lette hir bee ſkowred and bathed, and fedde with cleane meate, and well waſhed, gyuing hir caſting euery nyght, euen as men vſe to giue fleing hawkes.</p>

                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:23404:47"/>THere is another manner of fleing whiche is called the flight at the Hearon, this is the nobleſt flight of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For the Hawke oughte to bee well lewred and well trayned to get vp to an high gate, and therewithall ſhee muſt well know a quicke fowle, and ſuch a Falcon as is apte to flee, the Hearon ſhoulde not bee flowen with, to any other kind of fowle but onely to the Hearon moſt commonly. For aſmuch as amongſt all other flights, there is no ſuche moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tey made, nor ſuche force vſed as in the flight at the Hearon, and therefore reaſon would that ſuch Falcons ſhould not bee flowen withall or inured to any meaner or leſſe pray than the Hearon. For if a Hawke be a good Hearoner, it is ſufficiente, and if after your Hawke haue flowen the Hearon, you ſhould let hir flee any other ſleighter fowle or pray, She will lightly (by your owne default) become a ſlugge and take diſdayne, in ſuche ſort that (where before ſhe was a good Hearoner) ſhee will be ſo no more, and will turne to hir owne eaſe, ſo that ſhe will neuer care to flee the Hearon. For aſmuche as ſhee will giue hir ſelfe to pray vppon fowle that is more eaſy to reach, and will forget or forſlow hir valiant hardineſſe, the whiche is much to be lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted if a man haue once a good Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roner, and do ſo ſpill hir. Neuertheleſſe you may flee with the Sacre all maner of fowle more eaſely than with any other kind of Hawke, bycauſe ſhe is alike common to all fowle, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo is ſhe hard to be made, and of a hard and dull capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but deſpaire not therefore, for in the end they proue good if the Falconer take ſuche paynes with them as he ought to doe.</p>

               <p>A Sparowhawke newly taken ſhould be thus vſed, take a needle thredded with vntwiſted threde, and (caſting your Hawke) take hir by the beake and put the needle through hir eye lidde, not right againſte the ſight of the eye,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:23404:50"/>
but ſomewhat nearer to the beake, bicauſe ſhe may ſee backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes. And you muſte take good heede, that you hurt not the webbe, whiche is vnder the eyelydde, or on the inſide thereof. Then put your needle alſo through that other eyelydde, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the endes of the thredde togither, tye them ouer the beake, not with a ſtreight knotte, but cut off the thredes endes neare to the knotte, and twiſte them togither in ſuche ſorte, that the eyeliddes may be rayſed ſo vpwardes, that the hawke maye not ſee at all, and when the threade ſhall waxe looſe or vnty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then the hawke may ſee ſomewhat backwardes, whiche is the cauſe that the thredde is put nearer to the beake. For a Sparowhawke ſhould ſee ſomwhat backewards, and a Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con forwards. The reaſon is, that if the Sparowhawke ſhold ſee forewardes, ſhe would beate of hir feathers, or breake them when ſhe bateth vpon the fiſte, &amp; ſeeing the company of men, or ſuche like, ſhe would bate to muche.</p>
               <p>But to trimme your Sparowhawke in hir rightes, ſhee muſt haue Ieſſes of lether, the whiche muſte haue knottes at the ende, and they ſhoulde be halfe a foote long, or thereabout, at the leaſte a ſhaftmete betwene the hoſe of the Ieſſe, and the knotte at the ende, whereby you tye the hawke.</p>
               <p>She ſhould alſo haue twoo good belles, whereby ſhe may be the better hearde. For commonly when a Sparowhawke ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth any praye, ſhe will carry it into ſome thicke buſhe to feede thereon, in ſuche ſorte, that ſhe cannot lightly be eyther hearde or ſeene, and whiles ſhe plumeth it, the plumage doeth often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times couer bothe hir eyes, or one of them, then to take awaye the ſaide plumage, ſhe ſtraineth with one of hir feete, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hir belles diſcouer hir. Therefore if ſhee had but one bell, ſhe might happen to ſcratte with that foote whiche lacketh the bell, and ſo ſhoulde not be hearde. The Sparowhawkes which are wonted to be hooded, and whiche will gently brooke it, are muche better than they which will not be hooded. For they bate leſſe, and are with more eaſe borne in the rayne, or any euill weather. For beeing hooded, the Falconer may hyde and couer

them with his cloke, which he cannot do to the other. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more they ſhall be able to flee better and more ſtrongly, that are good weather hawkes, for they ſhall be leſſe bruſed, than a hawke whiche is not hooded, whiche will weary hir ſelfe with bating, &amp; withall a man may the better flee with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, bicauſe they bate not, but onely when you woulde haue them to flee, whereby they haue the greater courage, and alſo a man may beare them in all places, without bating or bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues out of breath.</p>

               <p>Firſte, to winne hir to feede, rubbe hir feete with warme fleſhe, chirping and whiſtling to hir, and ſometimes preſent the fleſhe vnto hir beake, and if ſhe will not yet feede, rubbe hir feete with a quicke birde, and the birde will crye, and if the Sparowhawke doe ſeaze it with hir feete, it is a token that ſhe will feede.

For it will not bee amiſſe, to gyue hir a bitte or twoo of meate euery time that you hoode hir. When it is euening, then ſuppe hir vp, giuing hir the heade or braines of a Henne or Pullette, vntill the morning.

When ſhe feedeth thervpon, hoode hir againe, giuing hir

the reſte of your bird hooded, and when it is further forth day, you may looke whether ſhee haue any thing in hir gorge, or not. If ſhe haue nothing aboue, giue hir ſome little beaching, and beache hir oftentimes before companie, hooding and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooding hir. But at night ſhe ſhoulde be alwayes vnhooded, that ſhee may ſee people, &amp; become acquainted with them, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hir to feede of a Hen or Pullet. To heale y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> places wher ſhe was ſeeled, to the ende ſhe may ſee the better, when y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> goeſt to bedde, holde hir in a darke corner, and ſpirte a little water vpon hir heade, that ſhe may frote hir eyes agaynſt the pyni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hir wings.

<pb n="95" facs="tcp:23404:53"/>
and rayſeth and ſtirreth hir courage, making hir prowde and ramage. So that ſhe leeſeth the eagerneſſe of hir appetite, and remembreth it not, thinking on nothing elſe but to ſoare and gadde abroade, whereby ſhe may be eaſily loſte. Furthermore, towardes the euening ſhe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſoare ſo far away from you, (although ſhe ſhould ſoare) as ſhe would do in the heate of the daye, bycauſe the night will enforce hir to go to the perche and ſtande. Alſo to enter your Sparowhawke, it ſhall be beſte to ſeeke out ſome champaygne countrie, farre from the wooddes, and let hir be vnhooded when the Spaniels be vncoupled, then if the Partridge ſpring, and ſhe bate, caſt hir off, if they ſpring neare you. And if ſhe kill, reward hir (vpon the grounde) of the heade, braynes, necke, and breaſte of the Partridge. When ſhe hath fedde, take it from hir, and vnſeaze hir, and gette vpon your horſe a good waye from hir. Then whiſtle and call hir, and if ſhee come vnto you, rewarde hir better. Aboue all things, you muſte take good heede that ſhe fayle not hir firſte flyghte at greate birdes, leaſte ſhee turne tayle, and accuſtome hir ſelfe to ſmaller game. But if ſhee bee once well entred at great game, you may quickly make hir flee Larkes and ſmall birdes. If you finde that ſhe haue moſt minde to flee Larkes, lette hir flee them, and rewarde hir on them. For there is no flyghte pleaſaunter than the flyghte of the Sparowhawke at the Larke. And for as muche as the fleſhe and bloude of Larkes is hotte and burning, it ſhall bee good when you flee the Larke, to gyue your hawke waſhte meate twyce in a weeke, and plumage very often. But gyue hir no plumage that daye that ſhee hath waſhte meate, nor the daye that ſhe batheth.

For you muſt not breake hir of hir accuſtomed dyet all at once, and bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng lately taken, ſhee will more willingly feede on warme meates, than any thing elſe. When you feede hir, you muſte whoope and lewre as you do when you call a hawke, that ſhee maye knowe when you wyll gyue hir meate. You muſte vnhoode hir gently, gyuing hir twoo or three byttes, and putting on hir hoode agayne, you muſte giue hir as muche more. But take heede that ſhee bee well and cloſe ſeeled, three dayes beeyng paſſed, if you perceiue hir to bee eager and greedie of meate, and that ſhe fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with good appetite, then begynne to abate hir hir meate, that is to ſaye, gyue hir but lyttle at once, and often, ſo that ſhee haue not muche aboue at one time, vntill it bee euening, and beare hir late vpon your fiſte before you go to bedde, ſetting hir vpon a treſtle or ſtoole ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neare you, ſo that you maye wake hir often in the nyghte. Afterwardes you ſhoulde take hir on your fiſte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne before daye, with ſome quycke birde or ſuche like meate: and when you haue obſerued this order with hir twoo or three nyghtes, and that you perceyue ſhe beginnes to bee muche better fellowe than ſhee was wonte, and that ſhee ſeemeth to beginne to bee reclaymed, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth eagerly vpon good meate, then beginne to chaunge hir dyete, gyuing hir often, and little at ones, the harte of an Hogge or a Sheepe.

But if ſhe ſee any thing that muſlike hir, and make ſemblaunte to bee afearde, then lette hir bee carryed into ſome darke place, where you haue no more but lyght to hoode hir agayne.

And bicauſe there bee ſundrie Falcons of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry ſortes and conditions, (as ſome mewed at large in the wooddes, ſome other taken at ſtande, where they haue long vſed, and ſome other taken ſoare hawkes, (whereof we now treate) whither they bee Sorehawkes, mewed or Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſe, yet are they of ſundrye natures and properties, and therefore they muſte bee diuerſly gouerned and entred, which is the cauſe that it is harde to giue generall rules.

But when your hawke is broughte to the poynte before rehearſed, as well for the hooding, as alſo for hir eagerneſſe to feede, if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that ſhee beginne to bee acquaynted therewith, you maye vnhoode hir by daye time, farre from company, firſte gyuing hir a bytte or twoo of good meate. Afterwardes hoode hir agayne gently, gyuing hir a little meate againe hooded.

When ſhee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to bee acquaynted with companie, if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue that ſhee bee eager or ſharpe ſette, vnhoode hir, and giue hir a bitte or twoo of meate, holding hir right againſte your face and countenaunce. For that will cauſe hir to dreade no companie. And when it is night, cutte the thredde wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſhee is ſeeled, and you ſhall not neede to watche hir, if you perceyue hir bolde ynough amongeſt companie. But yet lette hir bee ſette vpon a treſtle by you, that you may awake hir twoo or three times in the nighte, and take hir on your fiſte before daye.

And if by ſuche good gouernmente, and by dealing curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſely with hir, and keeping hir from ſodayne feare, you perceyue that ſhee beginne to bee acquaynted with you, and to knowe you aſſuredly, and that ſhee feedeth eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſticketh to hir meate before companie, then giue hir waſhte meate, and beache hir in the morning, ſo that ſhee maye alwaies haue ſomewhat in hir gorge: whiche meate you ſhall laye in cleare water halfe a daye, and you ſhall cauſe hir to feede in companie, giuing hir in the morning aboute Sunne riſing the wing of a Henne or Pullette, and at euening, hooding hir againe, take the foote of a Conie or an Hare, whiche is cutte off aboue the ioynte, and flaye it, ſtripping awaye the clawes alſo, and temper and ſteepe the ſkinne in faire water, (preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and wringing it a little) the whiche you ſhall giue hir with the ioynte of the pynion of a Hennes wing. You muſte take good heede, howe you giue your hawke any fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, vntill ſhee bee throughly reclaimed. For vntill ſhee bee throughly wonne and reclaymed, ſhee dares not caſte vpon the fiſte. And on the fiſte you muſte beare hir conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, till ſhee bee throughly manned. But when ſhee makes ſemblante to caſte, vnhoode hir gently by the taſſell of the hoode. You maye giue hir two dayes waſhte meate, and the thirde daye plumage, according as ſhee is cleane or fowle within. And when ſhee hath caſte, then hoode hir agayne, gyuing hir nothing to feede on, vntill ſhe gleame after hir caſting. But when ſhee hath caſte and gleamed, then gyue hir a beaching of hotte meate, in companie gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing hir twoo or three byttes at once: and at euening make hir plume a Hennes wing in companie alſo. When you finde hir well reclaymed, and throughly manned, and eager, and ſharpe ſette, then it is tyme to feede hir vpon the lewer. And you muſte marke whither the feathers of your hawkes caſting be fowle or ſlymie, and whither the ſlyme thereof be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:23404:58"/>
yellowe or not. For if they bee, you muſte bee very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to make hir cleane with waſhte meate and caſting, and if ſhee be cleane within, then giue hir not ſo ſtrong caſtings, as Hares feete, or Connyes feete: but giue hir the pynions of an olde Hennes wing, or the plumage that is to bee taken therevpon, or the necke bone chopped foure or fiue times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ioyntes, waſhed, and ſteeped in faire water. To make an ende of this chapter, it is certayne, that it requireth more tyme to winne and to watche a Falcon once mewed in the woodde, than one whiche is taken ſore at paſſage. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is harder to winne a hawke taken at ſtande, when ſhe hath long time bene accuſtomed, than it is to make a hawke whiche hath bene handled before. (∵)</p>

And lette ſuche dogges feede alwaies with your hawke, to make them the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaynted. If you woulde make a Falcon to the Hare, hir lewre ſhould be then a Hares ſkinne ſtuffed with ſtrawe, and when ſhe is well lewred, &amp; that you would enter hir, tye the ſayde Hares ſkinne to the ende of a cryance, and faſten it to your ſaddle pommell, and when you galloppe, it will be like vnto a running Hare. Then vnhoode your hawke, and crye, Backe with the Greyhoundes, backe with the Greyhoundes. And when your hawke commeth to ſeaze the ſayde Hares ſkinne, lette go your cryance, and ſuffer hir to take it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hir well vpon it, and make the moſt of hir that you can deuiſe. And when you go about to enter hir y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond time, let not ſlyppe your cryance at the firſte, but rather pull it from hir
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:23404:67"/>
by force, and afterwardes let hir ſeaze vpon it, and ſo by little and little you ſhal teach hir to beate it and ſtowpe at it. For ſo muſt ſhe do at a wilde Hare. And you muſte feede hir alwaies amongſt the dogges, and when ſhee is well nouſled and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in this manner, take a lyue Hare, and breake one of hir hinder legges, and lette hir go in ſome fayre place amongeſt your dogges, and your Falcon wyll ſtowpe hir and ruffe hir, vntyll the dogges maye take hir. Then take hir from the dogges, &amp; caſt hir out vnto the hawke, &amp; crye backe, backe.</p>
               <p>If you woulde make your hawke fleing to the Partridge, or Feaſant, when ſhe is reclaimed and made, then euery tyme that you lewre hir, caſte your lewre into ſome lowe tree or buſhe, that ſhe may learne to take the tree, or the ſtande. And if ſhe take the ſtande before ſhee eſpie the lewre, lette hir ſtande a whyle. And after drawe the lewre out before hir, and crye,
<hi>Lo birde, lo, Hey lo birde, hey lo,</hi> and rewarde hir well. For in this manner ſhe will learne to take ſtande. But feede hir al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes on the grounde, and in ſome thicke place, for in ſuche places ſhe muſte encounter with the Feaſant at pearche. And at the firſte flee with hir at Feaſant, or Partridge that bee yong, to gyue hir the aduauntage, and afterwardes at the olde. If a Falcon wyll not take ſtande, but wyll keepe hir on wing, then muſte you flee with hir in playne places, where you may alwayes ſee hir vpon you. Sacres and Laners will commonly take ſtande bothe in a tree, and on the grounde, but the Falcon Gentle taketh ſtande more willingly vpon the grounde. And when you drawe a hawke out of the mewe, beare hir not muche in hotte weather, for feare leaſte by muche bating in heate, ſhee may gette the Pantyſe. But if there be no remedie, then keepe hir alwayes hooded, and take as good heede to hir as you can. If your hawke be coye and daunge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, then giue hir ſalte with hir meate, I meane a dramme of the Salte called <hi>Sal Inde,</hi> or <hi>Sal geme,</hi> or <hi>Salis albi pulueri-Zati,</hi> and gyue hir water, for ſhee ſhall haue neede thereof. And make hir Ieouke all nyghte in payne, and in a moyſte
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:23404:67"/>
or colde place, and ſo ſhall ſhe watche moſte of the nyght, and thereby hir greace and pryde will be abated. Sacres muſt be nowſled and entred as ſoone as they bee manned, for elſe they are very harde to bee entred. Drawe your hawke out of the mewe twentie dayes before you enſeame hir. If a Falcon truſſe and carrye, to remedie the ſame, you muſte cope hir tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantes, hir powlſe, and hir petie ſingle. Neuer rewarde your hawke vpon ryuer fowle, but rewarde hir, and make muche of hir vpon the lewre, to the ende ſhe may the better knowe it and eſteeme it. The Souldane fleeth to the Crane, wilde Gooſe, and Buſtarde, with three or foure hawkes at once (or more) from the fiſte, yea and thoſe of all kinde of hawkes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as Sacres, Gerfalcons, peregrine Falcons, and Vilanes. And afterwards a man may make them flee to the mowntie. You ſhoulde flee to the Crane before Sunne ryſing, for ſhe is ſluggiſhe and ſlowthfull, and you may caſte off to hir a caſte or a leaſe of Falcons, or you may hawke to hir with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke from the fiſte without dogges. Wilde geeſe are flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to in the ſame manner. And if you haue dogges to helpe &amp; ſuccour your hawkes, ſee that they bee ſtanche and gentle, and well made for the purpoſe, and a Greyhounde will bee moſte readily made therevnto. You ſhall flee but once in a daye at the Crane, and therevpon rewarde hir liberally, and make as muche of hir as you can. The Vyllaine ſhoulde bee lette flee downe the winde. The Almaines doe flee at the Pye with a leaſe or twoo caſte of Falcons at once, and they make them to mownte and to ſtowpe, as they doe at the Ryuer. But this muſte be in a playne, where there be no trees nor woodde, but little ſhrubbes and buſhes. If you vſe to giue your hawke a brekefaſt or beaching very timely in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, it wil make hir eager to flee at ſuche time as will be conuenient for hir to flee. And eſpecially a Falcon, whiche you woulde haue high fleeing, and thoſe ſhoulde not be highly kepte, but ſhoulde be fedde nyne dayes togyther before Sunne riſing, and at nyghte late in the freſhe or coole of the euening. So ſhall
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:23404:68"/>
you make them highe fleeing, and by that meanes they wyll euery daye get gate higher &amp; higher, ſo y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they be flowen with euermore in the playne champaygne. The Falcon gentle is commonly better inwarde when ſhe hath mewed, than in hir ſoarage. The Falcon will kill the Hearne naturally, if ſhe be a peregrine Falcon, and yet you ſhall do well to giue them traynes. A Falcon may flee ten flightes at riuer in one day, if the ſeaſon be not extreme, and that is the moſte that you ſhall flee with hir. The Falcons whiche are ryuer hawkes, ſhoulde alwaies be borne vpon the fiſte. A hawke ſhall haue forty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings before ſhe be perfectly made. For a hawke whiche hath not caſting euery nighte, will be ſurcharged with abundance and ſuperfluitie of humors, the whiche do (from the ſtomacke) ſo ouerflow their brayne, that they cannot flee ſo high as elſe they would do. And therefore all hawkes ſhould haue caſting euery night naturally, if you woulde haue them ſounde and cleane: &amp; it is good to giue them tyring or plumage at nighte, eſpecially field hawkes, but not ryuer hawkes, for weakening their backes. And euery thirde daye you ſhall preſent them to the water at the longeſt. Touche your hawkes fethers as litle as you can, for muche handling will make them out of order. The Vyllaine and the Lanerette may be ſette vpon the ſtone incontinently, as ſoone as they be made. When your hawke hath flowen or bated, feede hir not as long as ſhee panteth, or bloweth, nor vntill ſhe be in breath agayne. For if you ſhould it is perilous to bring hir into the diſeaſe called <hi>Astma,</hi> and (in a hawke) the Pantiſe. If a hawke (eyther Falcon or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) chaunce to be out of heart, and diſcouraged, (which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth oftentymes) then take ſuche paynes with hir that ſhee may kill ſome praye, and feede hir vp vpon it with a full gorge euen as long as ſhe will eate, and the ſame night ſette hir a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade, that ſhe may Ieouke in the open ayre at hir own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and on the morrowe take hir and feede hir with ſmall birdes to enſeame hir, neyther more nor leſſe than you would do with an hawke that were newe drawen out of the mewe.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:23404:68"/>
If a Falcon or other hawke will not ſeaze or gorge, take the quill of a wilde Gooſes feather, and tye it vnder hir long ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, and ſhe will ſeaze and grype. And when ſhe beginneth to feaze, take away the ſayde quyll, and ſhee will ſeaze long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. If you cannot giue couert to your Falcon, or your Goſhawke, then caſte hir off with the Sunne in hir backe. All hawkes may be made flee at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſowrce or ſpring. But in what ſorte ſoeuer you flee with your Goſhawke, lette hir haue the Sunne in her backe.</p>

For moſte commonly if a yong hawke be let flee at olde game, ſhee will turne tayle, and cowardly giue it ouer, vnleſſe you do as before is declared.

And this order muſt you keepe with your Hawke ſeuen or eight dayes togither.</p>
               <p>When you would lure hir, giue hir vnto ſome other man to holde, and call hir with a lure well garniſhed with meate on both ſydes, as you called hir to your fiſt. After you haue vſed that maner of calling ſixe dayes or thereaboutes, cauſe hir to be helde further from you, and caſt the lure about your heade, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out vpon the grounde a little from you: And if ſhe come to it roundly, then feede hir and rewarde hir bountifully. And whyles your hawke is vpon the lewre, go aboute hir fayre and ſoftly, lewring and crying: wó hó hó, as Falconers vſe. And when you haue thus done by the ſpace of certaine dayes, take your lewre garniſhed as before ſayde, and euery day call hir to you as farre as ſhee may well heare and perceyue you: and let hir be looſe from all hir furniture, that is without either loynes or cryaunce: and if ſhe come ſo farre off to you, then feed and rewarde hir well, and ſtoppe hir in hir feeding oftentymes, for that will make hir come the better: but take heede that you hurt hir not in ſo doing. You ſhall alſo ſometymes call hir on horſebacke. And when you haue vſed hir thus a moneth, or vntill ſhe come well and roundly, and that ſhee be familiar with the man without any ſtraungeneſſe or coyneſſe, then may you ſtop the lewre vpon hir, and make hir flee vpon you. But before you do ſo, it ſhall be meete to bathe hir, leaſt when ſhe is at libertie ſhe rangle to ſeeke water, and ſo you might leeſe your Hawke: and euery ſeuen or eight dayes, your Hawke ſhould be ſet to the

When you haue thus manned, reclaymed, and lewred your Falcon, go out with hir into the fieldes and whiſtle hir of your fyſt, ſtanding ſtill to ſee what ſhe will do, and whether ſhe will rake out or not. But if ſhe flee rounde vpon you, as a good Hawke ſhoulde flee, then let hir flee a turne or two: whiche done, throwe hir out the lewre, and let hir foote a henne or a pullet, and kill it, and feede hir well therevppon. Vnhoode hir often as you beare hir, and ceaſe not ſo to do vntill ſhe haue endewed and mewted ſufficiently.</p>
               <p>When your Falcon is thus made &amp; manned, go abrode with hir euery morning when the weather is fayre and calme, and chuſe a place for hir to flee in, where there is ſome narrow brooke or plaſhe of water. And when you caſt hir off, go into the winde ſo farre that the fowle may not deſcrie you. And when ſhe is caſt off, and beginneth to recouer hir gate, make you then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes the brooke where the fowle lie, alwayes wyling and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your Hawke to leane in vpon you. And when you perceiue that ſhe is at a reaſonable pitche, then (hir heade being in,) lay out the fowle, and lande it if you can, and if you cannot, take downe your Hawke, and let hir kil ſome traine, as thus. Take with you a Ducke, and ſlip one of hir wing feathers, and hauing thruſt it through hir nares, throw it out vnto your Hawke, and caſt it as high as you can right vnderneath your Hawke, that ſhe may the better knowe your hande, and you. And remember that you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer flee a yong Hawke without ſome quicke thing caryed into the field with you, that if ſhe faile at firſt to kill the wilde fowle, you may yet make hir kil that traine which you bring with you. And this you ſhall doe for a certaine time, vntill your Hawke be well entred and quarreyed, and that ſhe knowe a quarreyor ſufficiently. Some other Falcons there be of a contrarie nature, which will require great ſkill to finde their properties. And the ſame being knowne, you may keepe them high or poore, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their conditions. So ſhal you do more good with them, than if you haue no reſpect to the diuerſitie of their nature: for then you ſhould commit great errours, and ſeldome make good Hawkes. You may traine Hawkes in this wiſe. Firſt you ſhall

feede your Hawke well vpon a fowle of the ſame kinde that you woulde traine hir withall, or haue hir flee to. And you ſhall doe ſo vntill you haue acquainted your Hawke with that kinde of fowle, the which you may do in this ſort. Take that fowle that you will make the trayne of, and ſet it on foote with meate tyed vpon the backe of it, and go ſo neare it that the Hawke maye ſee it: and when ſhe ſeeth it, let hir ſeaze therevpon, and foote the fowle and kill it. Or you may thus do better: Take a Cryance, and tye the fowle (which hath the meate tyed on hir backe) by the beake, and cauſe one to ſtande cloſe which maye holde the ſame Cryance. Then vnhoode your Hawke, and ſtande a farre off, and let him drawe the fowle and ſtirre it with his Cryance, vntill your Hawke may ſee it ſtyrre. And if ſhe foote it, then may you afterwards make hir this other kinde of traine. Take a quick fowle which can flee, and when you haue half ſeeled it, and caſt it out, let your hawke flee to it, and if ſhe kil it, reward and feed hir vp well vpon it. (∴)</p>

and ſuch like. And alſo you may giue them other fleſh, but ſee that it be ſweet, cleane, and good, ſhred into ſmall pellets vpon a cleane trencher. When they beginne to waxe full ſomed, giue them Sparrowes, and other ſmall birdes whole, that they may learne to plume, foote, and tyre: and ſet them a Baſon of cleane water in a heape of ſande, that they may bathe therein and proine and picke their feathers. They that be thus dealt withall do not know how to pray and therfore you muſt enter them by traynes in this maner. Take a yong chicke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is of colour and plume like a Feaſant or Partrich, &amp; caſt it out before your Sparhawke. But if ſhe flee not vnto it, nor do foote it, then ſtrip the ſkin vpon the head of the chicken vntil it bleed, and ſhe will lightly ſeaze it, thinking that it is fleſh to feed vpon. Then feed hir vpon it well, and thus you ſhall vſe hir vntill ſhe wil ſeaze a chicken of hirſelf. When ſhe will take a chicken of hirſelf, go into ſome fayre cloſe or medow where nothing may be to interrupt you, &amp; take a yong chicken and throw it vp vnto your hawke vntill ſhe flee to it and foote it: then feede hir vp therevpon, and coy hir aſmuche as you can deuiſe: For <hi>Nyaſſe</hi> Sparhawkes are much more daungerous and coy than others be. When your Sparhawke will foote a chicken well as before ſayd, then you may trayne hir thus. Cauſe ſome of your ſeruants or others to ſtande cloſe in ſome ditche or other priuie corner, with a liue chicken in his hande: and ſtande your ſelfe with your Sparhawke vpon your fiſt a little diſtance from him: then crie and ſpeake as you would ſpeake, and cry to your Spaniels when they range the field. And when you thinke that your Sparhawke looketh that way as he that hath the traine ſtandeth, let him caſt vp the chicken, as highe as he can, and let your Sparhawke flee thereat, and ſeaze it. That done, rewarde hir, and feed hir therevpon, making much of hir, and cheering hir euermore among. Thus ſhall you do twice a day. When you haue thus trayned hir, mount on your horſebacke, &amp; giue hir like traynes in the field as before ſayd. Then ſet hir ſharpe againſt an euening, and go out to ſeeke ſome game: and if you find, ſeek to make hir one flight at aduauntage, and let hir flee but once, and ſuppe hir vp vpon the pray.

To keepe your Sparhawke in good order, ryſe early in the morning, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hir vpon your fyſt, tappe hir on the trayne with your two forefingers, and ſtroke on hir wings that ſhee may mantle and warble, and aduaunce hir ſelfe bolt vpright and delicately vpon your fyſt. Sometymes alſo take off hir hoode, and put it on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine fayre and ſoftly, for rebuking hir. When you haue kept hir two houres vpon the fiſt, then ſet hir in the Sunne to weather hir halfe an houre: that beeing done call hir to your fiſt wyth meate, and whiſtle to hir often, and chirpe with your lippes, that ſhe may learne to know that voyce when you call hir, and when ſhe commeth rewarde hir well. Thus you ſhoulde vſe hir day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vntill ſhe come well to the fyſt: remembring alwayes that you deale with hir as gently and as amiably as you can deuiſe. When ſhe is well manned, and well comming, trie if ſhe couet not the water to bathe hir.

               <p>TO feede a Sparhawke orderly, you ſhoulde giue hir good meates, as thighes of Chickens and Pullettes, yong Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, Martelettes and other ſmall byrdes. Alſo ſheepes hearts, or Lambes heartes: all theſe bee excellent meate for a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke. And thoſe you muſt gyue them cleane and hote, if it
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:23404:73"/>
bee poſſible: for with hote meates you ſhall keepe hir alwayes in beſt plighte, and leaſte daunger to abate. And to preuent diſeaſes, you ſhall giue hir euery nighte caſting of Cotton or Lint, or ſuche lyke. And yet ſome are of opinion, that it is not beſt to giue a Sparhawke caſting ſo often: But by theyr leaue, I thinke it meete: and my reaſon is, that when you gyue hir caſting, you ſhall alwayes perceyue the diſpoſition of hir gorge and pannell from tyme to tyme, by the ſignes whiche you ſhall ſee vppon the caſting, and in it: As ſometymes it will bee white, ſometymes blacke, ſometymes yellow, ſomety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes greene, and of other colours: and by this meanes know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the infirmitie of your Hawke, you maye the better prouide remedie for the ſame. Therefore I thinke it beſt to gyue a Sparhawke caſting, and it ſhall not bee amiſſe to put there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſometymes a whole Cloue, in a pellet of Cotton, whiche is a tryed medicine to drawe euill humours from a Hawkes head: Or ſometymes you maye put a chyue of Saffron in hir ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting. And aboue all things, giue hir water once in three or foure dayes: For Sparhawkes doe muche couet the water, and it is the beſte thing (with other good dyet) that can bee, to keepe a Sparhawke alwayes ſounde and in good caſe.</p>

               <p>The fleſh of a yong Calfe is good for a gorge or two: but if you giue it oftner,<note place="margin">Theſe fedings are for the most part co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>The fleſh of a Ram goat, a female goat, or a gelded goat, is good to ſet vp a hawke. But ſome are of opinion that it breedeth the goute, and moyſte watrie humours, and opilations in the gorge.</p>
               <p>Mutton is not good, for it breedeth humours in the heade, as the Rye and ſuch like: it dries vp and enflames a Hawke, and makes hir hoſe ſit cloſe to hir legges.</p>
               <p>Lambes fleſhe, and the fleſhe of a Kidde, is good giuen with Goates milk, eſpecially when your hawke is poore, and hath bene hardly delt withall.</p>
               <p>Hares fleſh, or Conies fleſh, either colde or hote, is verie good to endew, and ſounde meate for a Hawke: but take heede that you giue hir none of the braynes, nor anie of the haires or bones, for they are perillous, and breede wormes in the gorge and in the guttes.</p>
               <p>Cattes fleſhe is vnholeſome, and harde to be indewed, and breedeth perillous wormes, and ſtoppeth a Hawke in the gorge, and marreth hir winde.</p>
               <p>Rattes fleſhe is good and wholeſome: it conſumeth choller, helpeth to looſe the head, giueth good appetite and diſgeſtion.</p>

vſe it not continually, for it will make hir too ſtately, and cauſe hir forget you, in ſuche ſort, that you ſhall hardly reclayme hir from hir coyneſſe.</p>
               <p>To feede with ryuer fowle and ſuch lyke, there are ſome of them good, and ſome bad, as I will breefly declare.</p>
               <p>Some hold opinion, that the bones and bloud of a Bargan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Moorehen, and ſuch like, may be giuen to an hauke: but that the ſkinne, fleſh, or feathers of them are not good, bycauſe they breede euill humours.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a Ducke or of a Crane (as they report) is good and wholeſome.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a Partriche is moſt excellent when a Hawke is ſicke and diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a wylde Gooſe, or of a flecked Crowe, is good: but you muſt giue your Hawke but little thereof, and none at al of their bloud: for it is ſalt, brackiſh, and of an euill nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>The fleſhe of theſe fleſh Crowes, and of the Wagtayles (a Diſhwaſher as we terme them, in Latin called <hi>Motacilla</hi>) and the Cormorant, is of euill nouriſhment and diſgeſtion.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a white Storke, and alſo of the blacke Storke, called <hi>(Saracineſſa)</hi> is euill of nouriſhment, and hard to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed, and ſtinking.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Bitter, and Sea Coote, is good and ſounde, eſpecially when the Sea Coote doth feede and ſcoure hir wyth ſande, it is good to enſeame and breath a hawke: although na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally all water fowles are colde of complexion, moyſte and hard of diſgeſtion.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the white Heron, otherwiſe called the Shoueler, and of the blew or aſhe coloured Heron, is of good diſgeſtion and nouriſheth well.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of Finches, hedge Sparrowes, and ſuch like, are in maner all one: and you muſte beware that you giue not your hawke too much of them at once.</p>
               <p>The Cuckoes fleſh is indifferent good for a hawke.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of a Hearon royall, that is to ſay the gray Hearon, is reaſonable good, according to the opinion of many auncient
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:23404:75"/>
Falconers: but <hi>Ptholomeus</hi> king of Egipt doth alledge the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, ſaying, that naturally all foules which liue vpon fiſh, frogs, or ſnakes, and ſuch like venemous wormes, are euill of diſgeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that their bloud breedeth opilations and euill humours, although they ſeeme to delight hawkes to feed on them for their delicate ſweeteneſſe and taſte.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the redde Haro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is good: but you muſt giue but little of it.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of the Swan, and many other kindes of water fowles to long here to be rehearſed, are to be vſed according to the tyme and circumſtances of occaſion.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of Sea Crowes, and Rauens, Cormorants, and ſuch like, are of a brackiſhe bloud, and therefore you may nowe and then giue your hawke a gorge thereof: but you muſt not vſe it often.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of rauening byrdes, as Kightes, Puttocks, Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, Eagles, Eyrons, and ſuch like, all theſe are verie contrarie to the nature of Falcons, and are ſtinking, of euil diſgeſtion, and chollericke. Their bloud and braynes are worſt of all, for they breede perillous wormes.</p>
               <p>The fleſh of all byrdes which feede vpon ſeedes, as Feaſants, Pertriche, Quayles, and ſuch like, are the beſt that can be, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when a falcon or any other Hawke is ſicke.</p>
               <p>Doues fleſh is excellent, eyther when a hawke is ſicke, or to mew withall: for it makes a hawke to mewe well &amp; quickly.</p>
               <p>Pullets fleſhe, and Chickens fleſhe, is good at all times, and alwayes in ſeaſon, as the fleſh of that fayre fowle <hi>Bella Donna</hi> is.</p>

Falconers call ramage or ſleight Falcons. And I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that they are all made after one ſort, and are manned much a like. But by mine aduice no man ſhall much aſſure himſelfe in a <hi>Niaſſe,</hi> bycauſe ouer and beſides that (for the moſt part) they proue not well, they do alſo require great paynes and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance with extreeme pacience, to make them kill and ſtoupe a fowle well, or to flee a high pitche. Neuertheleſſe if any man will needes be doing with them, he ſhoulde firſt make a <hi>Niaſſe</hi> to the Hearon from the fiſt, I meane both the blew and redde Hearon, and to ſuche other great fowles. For as much as the
<hi>Niaſſe</hi> hawkes are naturally good ſeazers, bold, and hardy birds. And after they be well in bloud, and entered in fleeing to thoſe fowles from the fyſt, then may you make them to the Ryuer, going into ſome fayre large field, whereas there may be eyther ſome wilde Pecockes, fleſhe Crowes, or ſome other great fowle, bearing your Falcon on your fiſt: looſe hir hood in a readineſſe, drawing as neare the fowle as you can, and the firſt fowle or byrde that ſpringeth, vnhoode hir and let hir flee from the fyſt to the ſame fowle, bycauſe they may drawe your Hawke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes. And when ſhe is at a greate gate, or at a reaſonable pitche, then throwe hir out a Ducke, or a Mallarde ſeeled with a feather through the nares. And if ſhee kyll it, then rewarde hir well, and feede hir vpon it wyth as muche fauour as you can deuiſe, alwayes lewring and crying to hir to comfort and encourage hir.</p>

               <head>Of Ramage Falcons.</head>
               <p>IF a falconer chaunce to recouer a Ramage Hawke which was neuer handled before, let him immediately ſeele hir, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall let him euen then alſo put on hir Ieſſes, the which muſt bee of Shameuſe leather, or ſoft Calues leather, or ſuche other leather as maye bee gentle and plyaunte to hir legge.

For as much as when they flee out, if they chaunce to be taken vp, they may the ſooner be returned againe and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their owners, the which muſt then remember to rewarde the taker vp of his Hawke liberally. You ſhall alſo put hir on a a paire of good Belles with two propre bewets: Being thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, you ſhall go about to man hir, handling hir often gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and both to auoyde the ſharpneſſe of hir beake, as alſo the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to rebuke hir from byting and nipping: you ſhall haue a ſtreight ſmooth ſticke, as bigge as your finger, and halfe a foote long or more, with the which you ſhal gently ſtroke your hawke about the pinions of hir wings, and ſo downwardes thwart all hir trayne. And if ſhe chaunce to knappe or byte at the ſticke, let hir bite hardly, for that will rebuke hir thereof, whereas your hande being twitched away fearefully, would make hir proceed the more eagerly.

               <head>To vſe a Hawke to the hoode.</head>
               <p>IT happeneth oftentimes that Falconers haue Hawkes which come from <hi>Cyprus, Candya, Alexandria,</hi> and other farre coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:23404:77"/>
the whiche hauing beene in the handes of ſuche as coulde not well ſkill of them, become coye and verye vntowarde to be hooded, and will hardly bee woonne to abyde the Hoode by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meanes. In this caſe you muſte fyrſt ſeele youre Hawke, and beeing ſeeled, you muſte fitte hir with a large eaſie Hoode: and hoode and vnhoode hir often therewith, watching hir a nighte or twoo, and handling hir oftentymes aboute the heade as before ſayde, vntyll ſhe haue forgotten that faulte. And when ſhee once doeth leaue it, you maye vnſeale hir in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uening by Candle lighte, handling hir ſtyll ſoftly wyth your hande aboute the heade, hooding and vnhooding hir oftenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, vntill ſhee wyll well abyde the Hoode and brooke to bee handled. And here I thinke good to expreſſe myne opinion, that hee whiche taketh in hande to bee a Falconer, ought fyrſte to bee verye pacient, and therewythall to take ſyngular delyght in an Hawke, ſo that hee may ſeeme to bee in loue (as it were naturally) with his Hawke, euen that a man would ſay, it were a thing bredde ſo in the bone as it coulde neuer bee rooted oute of the fleſhe. For ſuche a man with neuer ſo little payne and induſtrye, will become an excellent Falconer: but hee whiche taketh not that delyght in his Hawke, but doeth rather exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it for a pompe and boaſt, than vppon a naturall inſtinct: or beeyng a poore manne, doeth vſe it to get hys lyuing, ſuch a man in mine opinion ſhall ſeldome proue a perfecte Falconer, but a marrehawke, and ſhall beare the bagge after a right Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. To turne to my purpoſe, when your Hawke beeing ſo ſeeled, doeth feede well, and will abyde the Hoode, and to bee handled, withoute ſtryking or byting at your hande: then in an Euening by Candlelyght you ſhall vnſeele hir, and wyth youre finger and a little ſpyttle, annoynte the place where the ſeeling threade was drawne thorough. And when you haue hooded hir, take hir on youre fyſte, and holde hir ſo all nyght vntyll daye appeare agayne, doyng off hir Hoode often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tymes, and handling hir gently wyth your hande, ſtrokyng hir ſoftly aboute the wyngs and the bodye, hooding and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooding of hir, and giuing hir ſometymes to feede, a morſell
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:23404:77"/>

But aboue all things, you muſte watche hir on the fyſte, ſo manye nightes togither, without ſetting hir downe on anye pearche, that ſhee may bee wearie, and ſuffer you to hoode and handle hir gently without anye maner of reſiſtaunce, and vntill ſhee haue alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither left and forgotten hir ſtryking and byting at your hande: but ſome Hawkes will bee long before they leaue that fault, as the more coy or ramage that they bee, the longer they will retayne thoſe ill tatches, and will not peraduenture be woonne from them in three, foure, or fyue dayes. When ſhee is well reclaymed from it, then you maye let hir ſitte vppon a pearche to reſt hir. But euerie night you ſhall doe well to keepe hir on the fyſte three or foure houres, handling hir, and ſtrokyng hir gently, and cauſing hir to tyre or to plume, alwayes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of hir, and hooding and vnhooding hir oftentymes as before ſayde.

Take a quicke Pullette, and goyng into ſome ſecrete place, where your Hawke maye well perceyue the fowle, and yet ſee no great open lyght, let hir plume and feede vppon it, as ſhee ſitteth vppon your fyſt: then chyrke wyth your voyce, and vſe thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſoundes which Falconers do to their Hawkes: and feed hir ſo hooding hir gently: then afterwardes you may let hir plume a little vpon ſome wing, beeing ſtill hooded, as well to looſe hir in the heade, and to make hir caſt water, as alſo to teache hir the better howe to ſitte on the fyſte.

Wherefore aboue all things, the high fleeing Hawke ſhould be made inwards, and (as we tearme it) fond of the lewre, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is no leſſe prayſe worthy in a high fleeing Falcon to make in and turne head at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſecond or third toſſe of the lewre, and when ſhe powreth downe like a ſtone vpon it, than if ſhe had killed: nay rather ſuche are more eſteemed than the other. And ſo is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Falconer more prayſe worthy which doth winne his Hawke therevnto. For to come vnto the lewre is a thyng taught by art and induſtrie, but to kill a fowle is the naturall propertie of a Hawke.</p>

               <head>To make a high fleeing Hawke vpwards.</head>
               <p>IT hapneth oftentimes that a Hawke (although ſhe bee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally high fleeing) will yet be long before ſhe be made vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but will fiſhe and play the ſlugge: for when ſhe ſhould get vp to couer the fowle, ſhe will ſtoupe before the fowle bee put out, the which may proceede through two cauſes. Firſte it maye be that ſhee is too ſharpe ſette, and the ſeconde cauſe
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:23404:85"/>
may be that ſhe is flowen withall out of time, eyther too ſoone or too late. So that when you ſee a Falcon vſe thoſe euill tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches without apparant cauſe, you ſhall do well to caſt hir out a dead fowle or a dead Pullet for a dead quarrey (as Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners tearme it,) and to hood hir vp without any rewarde, to the end ſhe may take none encourageme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to vſe thoſe vile tricks: for there is no greater ſpoyle to an high fleeing Hawke, than when ſhe killeth a fowle from a baſe and lowe pitche, and ſo much the greater is the loſſe of hir by how much the more, ſhe doth vſe thoſe vile buzardly parts. Therefore by my beſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, I prayſe that order, to throwe hir out a dead quarrey and hood hir vp: then afterwardes within halfe an houre, call hir to the lewre, and feede hir, and do this as often as ſhe v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to fiſhe or to play the baſe ſlugge on that faſhion, and to find whether it proceede of being too ſharpe ſette, or of fleeing out of time, the Falconer ſhall doe well with all diligence to note the naturall diſpoſition of his Hawkes: as, whiche will flee beeing high and in good plight, and whiche beſt, when ſhe is kepte lowe, whiche will flee beſt when ſhe is ſet moſt ſharpe and eager, and whyche contrary, and whiche in a meane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene both, whiche earely at Sunneriſing, and whiche when the Sunne is two houres high or more, whyche ſooner, and whiche later in an euening. For the natures of Falcons are very diuers and ſundrie, in ſuche ſorte as to flee with a hawke at hir beſt houre and time, and to flee with hir out of that time, is a thing which will ſhew as great difference, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene an excellent good Hawke and a Kight. Therefore let the Falconer haue eſpeciall regarde therevnto, ſetting hys Hawkes to flee according to their natures and diſpoſitions, and keeping them always in good order. And here it is to be noted, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all Hawkes aſwell Sorehawkes, as mewed hawkes and haggards, ſhould be ſet out in the euening two or three houres, ſome more and ſome leſſe, hauing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient regard to their nature, as it is ſtronger or weaker: and in the morning alſo, accordingly as they caſt, hooding them firſt &amp; then ſetting

               <p>THe place wherein you ſhoulde mew a hawke at the ſtocke, ſhould be a lowe parler or chamber vpon the grounde, farre from any noyſe or concourſe of people, and ſituate towarde the North or Northeaſt. Place therein a table of a conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent length, for the number of your Falcons, and let it bee fiue or ſixe foote broade at the leaſte, with little thinne bordes or planckes all alongſt the ſides and endes, nayled on foure fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers high. And lette this table be ſette on treſtles of twoo foote high, or three foote high from the grounde, and fill theſe tables with greate Sande whiche hath pretie little rounde pebble &amp; grauell ſtones in it: in middeſt whereof you may place ſome greate free ſtones a Cubite high, made like vnto a piller, flatte in the bottom, and playne &amp; ſmooth aboue, growing by pecce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meale leſſe and leſſe vnto the toppe of them. Wherevnto lette your hawkes be tyed, eyther Falcon, Gerfalcon, Myllion, or Merlyne. Then take a ſmall corde of the bigneſſe of a bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, or little more, put it through a ring, and binde it about the ſtone, in ſuche ſorte that the ring or ſwyvle may go rounde about the ſtone, without any ſtoppe or lette: And thervnto tye the leaſe of a Falcon, which may ſo ſtand vpon the ſayd ſtone being ſette in the ſande. But you muſte haue regard, that (if you mewe moe Falcons than one at once in one roome) you ſette your ſtones one ſo farre from another, that when your hawkes bate, they maye not reache one another for crabbing. The greate ſtones are ſet, for that a Falcon feeling the freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and coolenes of the ſtone, will delight to ſitte ſtill vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it, &amp; the little grauel ſtones are, bycauſe a hawke will ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tymes ſwallow them to coole hir within, and will keepe them ſome

The little corde or bende with the ring on it, are tyed about the ſtone, bicauſe the Falcon bating this way and that way, ſhe ſhall neuer twinde nor tangle, bicauſe the ring followeth hir ſtill. All daye your Falcons ſhoulde bee hooded vpon the ſtone, vnleſſe it be when they would feede, for then only you muſt take them on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiſte, vntill they haue fedde.

               <p>IF you woulde mewe your Falcon at libertie and at large, then muſt you mew but one at once in one roome, and yet if the circuite of your mewe be greate &amp; capable inough, there may two, three, or four Falcons be mewed therin wel inough (with diuiſions.) The ſcope for one Falcon muſte bee twelue foote ſquare, &amp; as muche in height, or thereabout, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> twoo win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes a foote and halfe broade, or two foote broade at the moſt.

And therwithall you muſt make hir twoo handſome perches, neare to eache windowe one, that ſitting on

Your mewe muſte alſo haue a Portall, wherein there may be a little hole bilowe to conuey in the deuiſe whereon their meate is ſerued, called amongſt Falconers, the <hi>Hacke.</hi> And that muſte bee made on this faſhion. Take a peece of thicke boorde, a foote and halfe long, and a foote broade, or thereaboutes, vnder the whiche faſten twoo little treſtles three or foure fingers hyghe. Lette them bee faſte pynned or nayled to. Then with an awger or a pearcer, boare twoo holes one eche ſide thereof, and through eche of theſe putte a ſhorte corde of the byggeneſſe of a bowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring, with the endes downewarde, through the holes and knottes faſte knitte on them vnder the button of the borde, ſo ſtrayghte knytte, that you cannot rayſe the corde aboue the boorde more than a fingers breadth, or theraboutes. And when you would giue your hawkes meate, take a little ſticke ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer than the Hacke, and as bigge as your finger, but let it be of ſtrong woodde, as Crabtree, Holly, or ſuch like. And vpon that ſticke binde your hawkes meate, &amp; put the endes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſticke vnder the cordes, vpon the Hacke, &amp; ſo conuey it into the mewe to your hawkes, bicauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hawke ſhall not truſſe or dragge hir meate away into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mew, but may feede there.

And it ſhalbe good to kepe one ſet hour in feeding your hawke, for ſo ſhal they mew ſooner &amp; better: &amp; thus may you mewe hawkes (looſe &amp; at large.) But vnleſſe it be a Falcon which is ſo hotte
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:23404:94"/>
and madbrayned, that you are forced to mewe hir ſo at large. In mine opinion it ſhall be better to mewe at the Stocke or Stone, as before ſayde, or elſe to mewe them at the Grate (as we call it.) For in that kinde of mewing we take our hawkes on the fiſte euery day, and ſo may ſee in what plight and ſtate they be. And if they be ſicke, or fallen into any infirmitie, then may you giue them ſuche medicines as ſhall be declared in the next diuiſion, the whiche cannot be done when you mewe at large. And therefore I commende the mewing at the Grate, bicauſe many times our happe is to haue Haggardes, or Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, or Lentrers, the which haue flowen either to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, or prayed for themſelues. So that it ſhall be needefull to beare them often and euery morning in the coole ayre, vntyll midde Iulie, or more, or leſſe, according as you ſhall ſee them ramage and coy, yea and to call them to the lewre, and to ride abroade with them alſo ſometimes an houre or twoo, in the freſhe ayre. And it ſhall be a thing moſte neceſſarie for a hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde or a hawke that hath prayed for hir ſelfe, eyther more or leſſe. This I haue obſerued in mine owne experience, and me thinkes it an aduertiſement woorthy the noting vnto all Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners. Sundry Gentlemen do vſe to mewe their hawkes on the pearche, whiche truely I can moſte commende, as well for that they are then aſſured to be cleane fedde, as alſo to be dayly peruſed for liſe, wormes, and other diſeaſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they are by nature ſubiect.

And when they be mewed Hawkes, you may make them do what you will: and vnderſtande you, that you ſhall not neede to take ſuch paine, nor to vſe ſuch arte in making of a Goſhawke which is taken a brauncher, as wyth a
<hi>Nyaſſe,</hi> for ſhe will alwayes knowe of hir ſelfe what to do. Yea and it ſhall be rather better to let hir bee a little rammage ſtill, than to man hir ouer much.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:23404:97"/>
them to feede firſt a bit or two vpon your fiſt, with their hoodes on, and afterwards aſmuch with their hoodes off, caſt them down fayre and ſoftly to ſome Pearche, and make them come from it to your fiſt eyther much or little, with calling and chirping to them, ſaying: <hi>Towe, Towe,</hi> or <hi>Stowe, Stowe,</hi> as Falconers vſe, and when they come feed them, crying and calling ſtill to make them acquainted with your voyce. The next day you may call them with a Cryance, ſetting them vpon a Pearche vntill they come vnto you further off, feeding and rewarding them liberally to make them loue you. And when they come to the fiſt redily and without checking or ramageneſſe, then lay a little from you a dead Pullet vpon the ground, the hawke ſitting vpon the Perch, and calling and chirping to hir, if ſhe come and ſeaze the Pullet, let hir plume hir and feede a bit or two thereon, walking aboute hir vntill you may without daunger or mouing of hir, come neare and take hir vpon your fiſt, and ſo feede hir: That beeing done, let hir tyre and plume. Here I muſt aduertiſe you that the wing of a Pullet colde, is not good feeding for a Hawke: for it will make a Hawke ſicke: But the legges eyther hote or colde may be giuen. And likewiſe you ſhall marke that I would haue you caſt out a Pullet to a Goſhawke deade and not aliue: for theſe kinde of Hawkes are much enclyned of nature to play the Poulters. So that if you ſhould vſe to throw the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out liue poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, it might make them ſometymes when they flee turne tayle to the Partridge, and ſeaze the Pullets or Chickens which they ſhall ſee in huſbandmens yardes and backſydes when they flee. Or in lyke maner when they are ſet to bathe at length of theyr loynes, the which would not onely marre them, and make them full of ill properties, but alſo might cauſe the ignorant people (as women and boyes) to kill them in ſteade of a Puttocke. When you haue thus called your Goſhawke abrode two or three dayes vntill ſhe be well cunning, you ſhall take hir on your fiſt, and get vp on horſebacke with hir, and ſo ryding with hir the ſpace of an houre or there aboutes, vnhoode and hoode hir ſometymes, and giue hir a bitte or two of meate in the preſence and ſight of your Spaniels, bicauſe ſhee ſhall not be afearde of them. That
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23404:97"/>
being done, ſet hir on a tree with a little ſhort Cryance tyed to hir loynes, and going ſeuen or eight yeardes from hir on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, call hir to your fiſt with ſuch voyce and wordes, as Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners vſe: and if ſhe come, giue hir two or three bittes for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and caſt hir vp againe to the tree, then throw out the dead Pullet eight or ten yeardes from hir. If ſhe flee to it and ſeaze it, let hir feed three or foure bittes vpon it, ryding the meane while about hir on horſebacke, and rating backe your Spaniels, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall not rebuke hir at firſt, and ſo make hir euer after fearefull of dogges. Then alight off your horſe, gently take hir vpon your fyſt, feede hir, and when you haue ſo done, hoode hir and let hir plume or tyre. Here I will ſay for mine owne opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that a deade Partridge, or a counterfeyte Partridge, made with the verie plumage, wings and tayle of a Partridge, were much better to throwe out vnto your Goſhawke, bycauſe it woulde make hir both know Partridge the better, and poultrie the leſſe.</p>

ſuch Hawkes are not greatly to be regarded. The ſame that is ſayde of Goſhawkes, is to be vnderſtoode alſo of Tercels. And alwayes remember that the next day after you haue rewarded and fedde your Hawke vpon the fowle or byrde that ſhe killeth, feede hir the nexte daye with ſheepes harte, or Hennes legges betymes in the morning, to bring hir in order agayne to flee.</p>

               <head>To make a Goſhawke flee quickly.</head>
               <p>SOre Goſhawkes (eſpecially <hi>Niaſſes</hi>) are commonly verye fonde of the man, and therefore ſhoulde bee flowne with a little more ramage, and before they bee throughly reclaymed, for elſe oftentymes wythin two or three ſtrokes with theyr wings, they will giue ouer the fowle that they flee, and returne ſtreight agayne to theyr keeper. Therefore remember to flee with them aſſoone as you can, and that vntill they be perfectlye nouſled and in bloud. They muſt alſo bee ſet in places where they ſee not manye folke, for feare they become verye fonde of the manne: But when they haue flowne, and haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led twice or thrice, then ſet them where people and Dogges frequent, the whiche ſhall bee neceſſarie, to preuent the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience whiche might happen, when they are at marke neare to a houſe, or vpon a high way, if then they ſhoulde bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged wyth ſodayne ſight of any perſone that went by. And yet by this aduertiſement of fleeyng quickly with a Sore Goſhawke or a <hi>Niaſſe,</hi> I might make ſome Falconer learne a woorſe miſchiefe, if by fleeing ouer ſoone with his Hawke, hee ſhoulde pull hir downe, or make hir poore, the whiche woulde cauſe hir to become fearefull and cowardlye, and to giue ouer a Partridge, as I haue ſeene dyuerſe, that although they were at the fyrſte verye towarde Hawkes, yet after they haue beene once pulled downe, they haue loſte theyr courage and goodneſſe. And therefore by what meanes ſoeuer a Goſhawke or Tercell ſhall become poore, it ſhall bee the Falconers parte fyrſte to ſette hir vppe agayne,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:23404:100"/>
before he flee with hir, vnleſſe it bee ſome Goſhawke (whereof there are but fewe) which will not flee when ſhee is hie, and in good plight. Then the Falconer may ſomewhat bate hir fleſhe, and pinche hir with ſcouring, waſht meate and ſuch like deuiſes: But let him alwayes rather keepe his Hawke in ſuch wiſe, that ſhee may flee when ſhe is luſtie: and therewithall let him ſet hir abroade (when it is not ouer colde) betymes in the morning for one houre or twaine. For beeing ſo weathered, when ſhee hath flowne a Partridge to the marke, ſhe will not away, vntill it be retryued by the Spaniels.</p>

               <head>That a Goſhawke being a good Partridger, be not flowen with to the Feaſant.</head>
               <p>IF your Goſhawke be once a good Partridger, beware that you let hir not flee the Poute, or the Feaſant, for the Feaſant fleeth not ſo long a flight as the Partridge doth. And therefore the Goſhawke being naturally more rauenous and deſirous of pray than any other Hawke, woulde more delight to flee a ſhort flight to the Feaſant, and will care leſſe to holde out at a Partridge. True it is that ſome are good for both, but thoſe are verie rare: And therefore you muſt haue conſideration thereof, as alſo to keepe them in good order with fleeing, bathing, weathering, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, pluming, and dyuerſe other poynts of Falconrie, the which do ſerue alſo for Tercels aſwell as for Goſhawkes.</p>

               <p>THe traynes whiche you vſe to giue Sore Goſhawkes and
<hi>Niaſſes,</hi> are not ſo requiſite for a haggarde. For the Sore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes and <hi>Niaſſes</hi> when they are made to the fiſt, and to ſeaze a Pullet vpon the grounde, will then abyde and neuer ſore away, and may immediately be flowen withall at a Partridge, ſo that you beare a liue traine Partridge with you to ſerue hir if neede be, as hath bene heretofore declared in entering of other hawkes.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:23404:100"/>
And the principall poynt of conſideration is, that you encourage any Hawke well at the firſt. In fleeing with a Goſhawke, it happeneth oftentymes that fleeing in the Snowe, and killing their pray vpon the grounde, they fill their Belles with Snowe, ſo that the Falconer cannot tell where to finde them. At ſuche tymes then, faſten a Bell vpon the two couert feathers of your Hawkes Stearne or Trayne, and that aloft neare to hir rumpe. For ſo doe the Falconers of <hi>Dalmatia</hi> vſe at all times of the yeare to flee with their Hawkes. And it is a good meane to know at all times where, and what is become of your Hawke.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:23404:101"/>
killing of a Partridge or any other fielde flight: I will alſo declare howe you maye flee to the Ryuer with a Goſhawke, and howe you may kill greate fowles wyth hir. A Goſhawke (but no Tercell) may flee to the Ryuer at Mallacde, Ducke, Gooſe, Hearon, and ſuche lyke, whether it bee bycauſe ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to the fielde, or for any other delight that ſhee or hir kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hath to the Ryuer. And you ſhal holde this order in making hir, the which doubtleſſe ſhall bring hir to perfection: For Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes do more willingly flee ſuche flightes than at any other. And yet is there great difference ſeene in the proofe of them: for ſome of them proue muche hardyer and better than ſome other doe. Well, the Falconer ſhall fyrſt make his Goſhawke to the fiſt, in ſuche ſorte as I haue preſcribed, when I taughte to flee them vnto the fielde. Then muſte hee carrie hir into the fielde wythoute Belles, with a liue Ducke gyuen vnto one of his Companions. And the Falconer muſte haue with him a little Drumme or Taberde faſtened to the Pommell of his Saddle, togither with the ſinewe of an Oxe legge dryed, whiche ſhall ſerue him to ſtrike vppon his Drumſelet or Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berde: and cauſing his Companion to hide himſelfe in a ditche,<note place="margin">There hath bene vſed a kind of flight with a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke, called the flight made to the becke, and it is like to this, but it is much ſurer and better.</note> or pitte, with the Ducke tyed to a Cryaunce, his Hawke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng vnhooded vppon his fyſt, hee ſhall drawe towardes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion whiche ſtandeth ſo hidde in couert. And when hee is neare him within two or three paces, or little more, hee ſhall ſtrike vppon his Tabarde twice or thrice: and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hearing him, ſhall throwe out the Ducke aloft. And let the Falconer caſt off his Goſhawke to it, and if ſhee take it at the Sowrce, let him rewarde hir and feede hir with a reaſonable gorge, making hir all the cheare that may be: then let him take hir vpon his fyſt and hoode hir, ſuffering hir to plume or to tyre vppon a wing or a legge of the Ducke. The next day he ſhall not flee with hir, as before I haue admoniſhed. But the thirde day hee may go againe in lyke maner with hys Companion, or elſe maye ſeeke ſome water paſhet or pitte where wylde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fowle lye, as Teales or ſuche lyke.

When they haue founde them, bothe of them ſhall drawe backe along by the Bancke, and the Hawke beeing vnhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, they ſhall trotte bothe of them ryght vppon the fowle with theyr Horſes.

And the traine muſt bee made in this wiſe: When the hawke is made to the fiſt as before ſayde, let him go on foote abroade into the fielde with his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke on his fiſt, carying with him a Wildegooſe, or a tame Gooſe of the colour of a Wildegooſe, tyed by the tayle with a Cryaunce. And hauing ſette hir on the grounde eyght or tenne Paces from him, lette hym vnhoode the Hawke, and twitche the Gooſe wyth the Cryaunce vntyll hee, make
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:23404:102"/>
it ſtirre and flicker with the wings. Then if his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke bate at it, caſte hir off, and runne in to ſuccour hir, ſo that the Gooſe beate hir not with hir wings, for diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hir. And if hee haue ſtore of traynes, then he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde and feede hir on the braynes, hearte, and thyghe of that whiche hee trayned withall. But if hee haue no ſtore, then it ſhall bee needefull to ſaue that for another trayne. This done, lette him cloſely conuey a Pygeon vnder the wing of the trayne, and rewarde his hawke therewith, as hathe beene heeretofore declared in the traynes to the Hearon. And the nexte daye lette hir not flee, but ſette hir downe, &amp;c. The thirde day he may giue hir another trayne, ſomewhat further off. And the thirde trayne he ſhall gyue it hir on horſebacke, fiftie or three ſcore paces off at the leaſte, or ſo farre off as hee maye come in to ſuccoure his hawke in tyme. His hawke beeing thus trayned and entred, he may ride out with his hawke (without belles, bicauſe the Geeſe ſhall not ryſe before the Falconer haue broughte his hawke to the vauntage) then with his Tabard to beate it vp, &amp; ſo forth, whereof I haue tolde before. And hauing founde any wilde geeſe, he ſhall ſhewe them to his hawke, who being naturally mooued, will make from the fiſte to them, and will flee lowe by the grounde, vntill ſhe come neare them. Then the Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coner ſhall ryde after apace, and ſtrike vpon his Tabarde, vntill hee rayſe the Wildegeeſe. And if his hawke ſeaze a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them at Source, hee ſhall quickely ſuccoure hir, and rewarde hir, &amp;c. But for as muche as Wildegeeſe will riſe as ſoone as they ſee any bodie. Therefore the Falconer muſte teache his hawke to take the aduauntage, whiche is thus done: As ſoone as hee hath founde them a farre off, lette him alyghte from his horſe, and carrye his hawke vnhooded behinde his horſe, ſtawking towardes them, vntill he haue gotten reaſonably neare them, holding downe his hawke couerte vnder the horſe necke or bodie, in ſuche ſorte, that ſhee maye finde the Geeſe. Then the Falconer ſhall runne
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:23404:103"/>
in apace, and ſtrike vppon his Tabarde, to rayſe the Geeſe. And if ſhe kill any of them, rewarde hir, &amp;c. Vſing his hawke in this order, ſhee may be made to kill twoo or three, or more, in a daye. And in like manner maye ſhee bee made to the Crane. And in like ſorte may he creepe to flee at fowle which lye vpon pyttes, or pondes. Firſt ſhewing them to his hawke, and letting hir drawe to them, and then running in to putte them vp with his Tabarde. But the Falconer muſte take heede, that as long as hee may finde greate flightes, hee flee not at ſmaller fowle, to the ende his hawke may continewe the more boldly to flee greate flightes. For a man maye ſoone make a hawke a cowarde and a ſlugge. Yet ſome there bee, (but thoſe are very rare) whiche fleeing at all kindes of fowles, becomme ſtill hardyer and hardyer, and better and better.

               <p>SParowhawkes are to be conſidered of as all other kinds of hawkes are, according to their age and diſpoſition. Some of them are named Nyaſſes, ſome Braunchers, ſome Soare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes, and ſome mewed hawkes: Some alſo Haggards,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:23404:105"/>
beeing mewed in the woodde, they are called Nyaſſes, which are taken in the eyree. Branchers are thoſe, that hauing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the eyree, are fedde by the olde hawke vpon the boughs and branches neare about the eyree, and therevpon they are called Branchers: afterwards they are called Soarehawkes. They are called Soarehawkes, bicauſe when they haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the woodde, and beginne to pray for themſelues, they flee vp aloft vpon pleaſure, which with vs Falconers is called ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. Mewed hawkes are all hawkes that haue once or more ſhifted their feathers: and Haggards are they whiche pray for themſelues, &amp; do alſo mewe themſelues either in the woodde, or otherwiſe at large. To beginne with the Nyaſſe, whiche is of greateſt difficultie to bring vnto anye perfection, you muſte firſte feede hir in ſome freſhe coole chamber or parler vpon the ground. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame chamber ſhold haue two windowes not very large, wherof that one ſhould open towards the North, and that other towardes the Eaſte, to take the freſhe coole ayre, or the comforte of the Sunne at hir pleaſure. Theſe windowes muſte be open, barred ouerthwarte with lathes, or thinne bordes, ſo thicke that neyther your hawkes maye gette oute, nor your Catte maye come in. And in this chambee caſte and ſtrewe Vyne leaues, and other freſhe leaues. For it refreſheth a hawke maruellouſely to reſte vppon them. And for the ſame conſideration it ſhall not bee amiſſe, to ſette twoo or three greate free ſtones in the chamber, wherevppon the Hawkes may ſitte coole &amp; freſh. You muſt alſo haue twoo or three pearches lyned or couered, one a little higher than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that the hawke as ſhe groweth huger and huger, may flee from one pearche to another, and neuer hurte hir feete. And whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe is full ſommed, ſo as ſhe can flee, then will it be meete and moſte neceſſarie to ſette ſome large baſon, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther veſſell full of water, that ſhee maye bathe hir at pleaſure therein. For that is not onely very holeſome for hir body, but alſo will make hir put out hir feathers y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, &amp; the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. And you ſhall doe well to ſhifte hir water euery three
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:23404:105"/>
dayes. You ſhall feede hir with yong Sparrowes, Marte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lettes, and yong Pygeons, and ſometimes with Sheepes heartes: and whyles ſhee is very yong and little, you ſhoulde cutte hir meate, and ſhredde it in ſmall pellettes vpon a tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, or a cleane borde for the purpoſe, ſetting it ſo neare hir, that ſhee maye reache it with hir beake, and feede. Thus you ſhall feede hir twice, or more euery daye, euen as you ſhall ſee hir endewe it, or (as Falconers ſaye) putte it ouer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that you gyue hir not gorge vpon gorge, for that wyll make hir caſte hir gorge. But when ſhee is full ſommed, and fleeth aboute, then you ſhall doe better to gyue hir whole birdes, and ſometimes to feede hir vppon your fiſte, ſuffring hir to kill and ſtrayne the lyue birdes in your hande: Yea and ſometimes to put quycke birdes into the chamber to hir, that ſhee maye learne to knowe them, to foote them, and to kill them: and lette hir feede vppon them hir ſelfe in your preſence. For that ſhall bee very good, as well to nowſel hir, as alſo to make hir leaue that vyle condition which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Nyaſſes haue, whiche is, to carry and hyde their praye in ſome hedge or ditche, or ſecrete place: and therein they will ſitte very cloſe for beeing hearde, when they heare or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue their keeper to ſeeke them. Wherevpon their keepers are oftentimes euill troubled and diſpleaſed. And alſo it ſhall not be amiſſe, euery morning to go into the ſayde chamber, and to call them to the fiſte, whiſtling and chirping with your mouth, for by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meanes you ſhal both manne them throughly, and alſo you ſhall gayne the time which you ſhould elſe ſpend afterwardes, in making them when they were ready to bee drawen out of the ſayde chamber.</p>

Afterwardes you ſhall cauſe one to hide himſelfe cloſe in a ditch or pitte, and throw hir out a Pigeon or Pullet, if ſhe take it, reward hir and feede hir vp with the braynes, hart, and a legge or a wing, whiſtling, chir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and ſpeaking to hir to encourage hir: and this order you ſhall obſerue awhile, ſtil ſeruing hir with greater and greater traynes: for by that meanes you ſhall giue hir courage to flee, yea if it were at a Feaſant, for that chickens are ſome of them not much vnlike a Feaſant poult. As alſo vſing hir to greate chickins, ſhee will neuer couet to carry as ſhee would do if you trayned hir with ſmaller birds, which is a thing woorthy the obſeruation, as you ſhall find by experience. And when you haue giuen hir ſufficient traines of chicken and ſuch like, you ſhall one day ſet hir ſharp, then take a Quayle tied in a Criance, and in a playne meadowe: Firſt ſhew hir vnto your Sparowhawke, then throw it vp aloft and caſt your Hawke off handſomly after hir, and if ſhe take it, reward hir with the braynes to nouſſe and encourage hir, but feede hir with the legge of a chicken or Pullet, and deale daintely with hir.

               <p>WHen your Sparowhawke is once made, you may goe freely into the field: and if you find any yong Quaile let hir ſlee thereat with aſmuch aduauntage as you can: and if ſhe take it, reward and feede hir &amp;c. Remember that at firſt entring of your Hawke you hold your fiſte aloft alwayes, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well bycauſe youre Hawke maye ſee the game ſpring, as alſo that ſhe may learne to haue an eye to the Dogges, the whyche you ſhall alwayes cauſe to hunt on your right hand whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they raunge, but eſpecially when they queſt and call, to the ende you maye the better and at more aduauntage caſt off youre Hawke whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you let hir flee. And when your Sparowhawke doth know hir game and how to flee, then may you flee more than one flight in a forenoone or an afternoone, ſo that always you giue hir ſome ſmal reward at euery flight that ſhe killeth. And bycauſe it behoueth muche alwayes to encourage youre Hawke, and to keepe hir well nouſled, you ſhall doe well euer to carrie a liue Quayle with you, that if you find none, or flee and miſſe, you may therewith trayne or ſerue youre Hawke accordingly: and you maye cauſe it ſo to be caſt out vnto hir, that ſhe will thinke it is ſprong with the Spanells. As alſo I would wiſh you euermore to keepe aliue the ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d Quaile that you ſhall take, and keepe it in your hawking bagge, ſo as if neede be, it may ſerue you at night or at any time to reward your Hawke with: for keeping your Hawke in this order, ſhe can neuer lightly be diſcouraged. And when youre Hawke is throughly entred and perfectly well in fleeing, and well nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſled, then you ſhall hold your hande lowe, whereas before you held it aloft. For your Hawke being much quicker ſighted tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you are, ſhe will ſooner ſee the game ſpring alſo, and bate at the whurre, as we tearme it: then before the Hawke can reeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer your fiſte, the game is flowen farre off to hir great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage: yea although you ſhould let hir go when ſhe bateth,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:23404:107"/>
yet ſhall ſhe not flee with ſuch aduauntage as you might lette hir flee when ſhe and you both ſpied the game ſpring at once. He therefore that will be a perfect keeper of a Sparowhawke or ſuch like, muſt haue a quicke eye, and a good conſideration and regard to the Spanells, keeping them ſtill as neare as he can vpon his right hand, and hold his hande lowe, bycauſe hys Hawke ſhall not bate at the game before he ſee it. And alſo it ſhall not be good to be ouer neare the Dogges, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little aboue them, that you maye let youre Hawke flee coaſting at the vantage when the game ſpringeth, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to be quicke of eye and nimble of hand, for he that is not ſo, nor regardeth the aduauntages of a flight, ſhall hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hys Hawke whereas hee myghte further and helpe hir.</p>

               <p>NOw I haue ſpoken at large of Nyaſſe Sparowhawkes, it were meete that I ſhould ſet downe ſome inſtructions alſo concerning Ramage Hawkes, and ſuche as are taken when they haue prayed for themſelues. And yet in effect the ſame precepts that ſerue for a Nyaſſe, wyll ſerue alſo for ramage Hawkes and mewed Hawkes. But yet they, (I meane ramage and mewed Hawkes) require not ſo muche payne to make them know their game nor to enter them, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue bene practiſed in praying for themſelues, and the Nyaſſes are altogether ignorant and ſimple: ſo that the Nyaſſes muſt be taught to knowe their game, in a manner, euen as they are taught by the breeder in the wood, the whyche (as I haue heard old Falconers tell) when hir yong Hawkes go out of the neſt and can hoppe or flecke from one bough to another, commeth in with ſome pray vnto them, and calling
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23404:108"/>
them altogether, ſhe fleeth aloft and lets the bird fall amongſt them, ſo that which ſoeuer of them catcheth it with hir tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, feedeth vppon it for that meale, and then returneth the olde Hawke for ſome pray, vntill ſhe haue fedde them all &amp; taughte them to foote their pray And therefore when a man hath them Nyaſſe which neuer wer taught ſo by the breeder, he muſt pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe as neare as he can like the old Hawke, to teache them to foote and to kill their pray and to know it, the which you ſhall not be troubled with in a ſoare rammage or metred Hawke. For they whiche beare thoſe names, haue learnt to praye for themſelues: and moſt of all the mewed haggard Hawkes, for they are throughly nouſled and trayned therein, yea and moſt commonly they haue learnt ſuch conditions, that with all the paynes we can take, fewe of them can be brought to any good perfection. But he whiche hathe a Haggard Sparowhawke, muſt aboue all things take paynes in weyning hir from that vile fault of carying, and that ſhall he do by ſeruing hir often with great Pullets, and other great traynes the which ſhe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carrie, and therby, ſhe will learne to abide vpon the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rey. Alſo they whiche delight in Haggards, muſt take greate heede that they offend them not, but rather coye them as much as they can with all deuiſes of fauor &amp; cheriſhing, for they wil remember fauor or iniurie muche better than any other kynde of Hawke. And of the ſame condition are Lentmers for the moſt part, the whiche are called with vs March Hawkes, or Lentmers, bycauſe they are taken in Lent with lime or ſuche like meanes. And the Italians call them <hi>Marzarolli,</hi> bycauſe they are taken in March or thereabouts: ſo that the Etymolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie of the name proceedeth all vpon one cauſe, and they are called ſo whether they be Soare Hawkes or mewed hawkes.

               <p>MAny times it hapneth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Goſhawke or a Tercell whiche was good in hir Sorage, doth become nothing ſo toward or good when ſhee is mewed: and that proceedeth bycauſe in hir ſoarage ſhe was not cheriſhed to make hir take delight in
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:23404:109"/>
hir flight: for in a manner all the ſkill of a Falconer or Oſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger conſiſteth in coying and delicate vſage of his Hawke, and ſo cheriſhing hir, that ſhe may take pride and pleaſure in hir flight. Therefore I woulde not thinke it amiſſe if hee had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at the firſt entring of his Goſhawke or Tercell, a traine Partridge in his bagge, to ſerue hir with, when neede dothe require, and ſo he ſhall winne hir loue. And therewithall lette him marke theſe obſeruations, to keepe his Hawke in good tewne alwayes. Firſt let him conſider that naturally all Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes are full of moyſt humors, and eſpecially in the head: and therfore let him plie them with tiring, and plumage, both morning and euening, for that will open them in the Head, and make them caſt water therat. Let the Goſhawkes tiring be the rumpe of a beefe, or y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vppermoſt ioynt of a wing which we call the pinion, or a chickens legge, giuen by the fire or in the warme Sunne. This will not only keepe your Hawke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the head, but alſo keepeth hir in exerciſe and vſe and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſlouthfulneſſe, which might marre hir &amp; vtterly ſpoyle hir.</p>
               <p>It is good alſo to giue hir euery nighte caſting eyther of feathers or of cotton, and then in the morning to marke whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be wrought round or not, whether it be ſweete or not, whether it be moyſte or drie, and of what colour the water is that droppes out of the caſting, for thereby hee ſhall iudge in what caſe his Hawke is. He ſhoulde alſo haue regarde to hir mewtes, to ſee whether they be cleane or not, and therevppon he may giue medecines accordingly, as ſhalbe hereafter decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. For the infirmitie of a Hawke being once knowen, it is the more eaſily cured. He hath alſo to conſider the ſeaſon: for in the winter and colde weather, he muſte ſette his Hawke or Tercell warme, in ſome place wher fire is made: he muſt rolle the pearch with cotton or ſome ſuche like thing, and the pearch muſt be ſet farre from the wall that his Hawke hurt not hir feathers when ſhe bateth: but if it be not colde, he may ſet hir euery morning in ſome place where the Sunne hath power for an houre or two.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:23404:109"/>Remember that no Hennes or pultrie come neare y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> place where your Hawke ſhall pearch, and eſpecially in Lent when Hennes haue yong chickens commonly following them.</p>
               <p>Remember alſo in the ſpring to offer your Hawke to the water euery weeke, for elſe ſhe wil ſoare away whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhe fleeth, and make you ſeeke hir.</p>
               <p>If your Hawke bathe hir at any time of hir owne accorde after hir flight, go preſently to the next houſe with hir, (if it be in Winter or cold weather) and weather hir by a fire with hir backe to the fire, and not hir gorge, for that woulde make hir ſicke. And likewiſe drie youre Hawke if you haue caried hir in the Rayne. Let a good Falconer or Oſtreger alwayes keepe his Hawke luſtie and high, and yet keepe hir in ſuche tewne that ſhe may flee beſt when ſhe is high: for doubtleſſe the plucking downe of a Hawke dothe marre hir and make hir cowardly. Aboue all things an Oſtreger muſt bee patient and neuer chollerique.</p>
               <p>A good Oſtreger muſte alſo keepe his Hawke cleane, and hir feathers whole, and if a feather be broken or bruſed, hee muſt ympe it preſently, as ſhall be taught herafter alſo in this booke, and therefore he muſt haue his ymping needles, his Semond, and ſuche other things about him euermore in a readineſſe.

would not be flowen withall too ſoone in a morning, for they ſoare willingly. Take your Sparowhawke from the pearch alwayes with ſomewhat in your hande, to make hir loue you and be fonde of you, for that is a thing of no ſmall importance and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſideration. As alſo to make your Sparow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawke foote great fowles, to the end the may not learne nor be accuſtomed to carrein. And as touching mewing of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowhawke, ſome vſe to put their Sparowhawke in the mew aſſoone as they leaue fleeing with hir, cutting off both hir be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wettes, lines, and the knottes of hir Ieſſes, and leaue hir in the mewe vntill ſhe be cleane mewed. But if you will haue hir to flee at Partridge, Quayle, or Feaſant poult, then you muſte drawe hir in the beginning of Aprill, and beare hir on the fiſte till ſhe be cleane and throughly enſeamed. Some other keepe their Sparowhawkes on the pearch vntill March, and then throwe hir into the mewe being peppered for lyſe if ſhee haue any. Hir mewe ſhould be a chamber aloft from the grounde eight or nine foote long, and fiue or ſixe foote brode, with two windowes, to the Eaſt and the North, as is before declared in the deſcription of the mewe for a Goſhawke: and ſet hir per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and al other things euen as for a Goſhawke, ſauing that the mewe muſte haue one little windowe to conuey in hir meate at. And your Sparowhawke being thus prouided of hir mewe, go in to hir in Maye in an euening by candlelight, and taking hir ſoftly, giue hir to thy companion to hold, vntill thou haue pulled out all hir traine feathers one after another, holding the principall feather with thy one hand (whiche Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coners do call the couert feather) and plucking out the other feathers with that other hande, for ſo ſhalt thou doe hir leaſt hurt: and this ſhall make hir mewe the faſter, if thou feede hir with hote meate and birds, and alwayes keepe an houre cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to giue hir hir meate. Some will ſet water in the mewe by their Sparowhawke continually, ſhifting and renewing the water euery ſecond or third day. Some ſet water before a Sparowhawke in the mewe but once in a fortnight, and then
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:23404:111"/>
take it away againe within .xxiiij. houres after they haue ſet it there. Some will neuer ſet water before their Sparow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes at all when they mewe them, ſaying that Sparow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawkes are very hote, and plucke out their owne feathers for extreame heate, and that therefore water is not to bee giuen or allowed them, bycauſe it killeth and delayeth the heate in them, which ſhould further their mewing. I like that opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But for mine owne part and experience, I woulde leaue the extremities and take the meane. And I woulde thinke it beſt to ſet water before a Sparowhawke in the mewe, once in xiiij. dayes at the leaſt, or oftner, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Hawke ſeeme to haue neede, the which you ſhall eaſely perceyue, if ſhe haue any fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or downe that ſtand ſtaring vp on hir backe, and when ſhe ſitteth alwayes as though ſhee woulde rowze, or is twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching at hir feathers with hir beake, then ſet hir water: but to ſet it by hir continually, dothe foreſlowe hir mewing: and too keepe it alwayes from hir, doth make hir that ſhe meweth not hir feathers ſo cleane or ſo gallantly, as when ſhee may haue water once in a fortnight.

If your ſicke hawke be very lowe brought in ſtate, you muſte allowe hir a gorge twice a day, but with diſcretion &amp; iudgement, not giuing hir ouermuche at one tyme. And if ſo the Feuer ceaſe not by theſe practiſes aforeſayde, it ſhalbe well done to giue your Falcon of excellent good Reubarbe, finely beaten to pouder, twoo ſcrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, in a Cotton caſting, to purge &amp; ſkowre hir choler, whiche is the very originall grounde of hir feuer. There are ſome that do will and preſcribe, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you muſt let your Falco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bloude in the thygh, whiche albeit I haue not experimented, yet doth it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de with reaſon, that it may do good, if you can finely do it: but it were much better in mine opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to open the vayne vnder hir right wing, bicauſe that would chiefely refrigerate &amp; coole the lyuer out of ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, &amp; ſo by a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole body throughout.</p>
               <p>This order aforeſaide is to be vſed, if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feuer be a hotte feuer wherewith your hawke is moleſted. But if it happen to bee a colde feuer, which you ſhall perceyue, by that your hawke will be extreme colde, if you touche hir. Hir eyes looke not of their woonted hewe, and beſides all this, ſhee ſeldome mewteth, and that with greate payne.</p>
               <p>Then you muſt ſet hir in ſome warm place, &amp; after hir fitte of colde is paſt, ſhe muſt be gently borne on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiſt.

very good at all times, howſoeuer ſhe be affected, to kepe a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable hande vppon hir, as touching hir dyet, whither ſhe be diſeaſed or in perfect ſtate. For of ouer greate gorges, and too full and liberall a hand, do procede a thouſand miſchiefes and diſeaſes to a hawke, as experience doth dayly inſtruct vs, both to the greate paynes of thoſe ſillie birdes, and the greate griefe and coſte of the vnſkilfull keeper, whoſe purpoſe and meaning perhaps, is by giuing his hawke liberally, to haue hir flee lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily, and to continue in perfect healthe and ſtate, whereas in trothe nothing doth ſo muche offende a hawke, as too greate a gorge. As in all other things, ſo in this likewiſe, <hi>The meane is beſte.</hi>

               <p>Some Falconers do preſcribe this methode for cure of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in a hawke, whiche I doe not greatly commende or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe.

               <p>The ſignes that they gyue to knowe the Feuer, are the wrything of the hawkes trayne, the coldeneſſe of hir foote, and oftentymes the caſting of hir gorge. But the firſte rules and remedies do ſatiſfie mee ſufficiently, without theſe, bycauſe I finde in them ſome more reaſon: yet doe not thinke it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, to ſette downe diuers mens opinions, bycauſe euery man maye make his choyce: for what liketh one, perhappes, contentes not another.</p>

               <head>Of diſeaſes of the heade, and firſt of the Apoplexye, or falling euill.</head>
               <p>HAuing in purpoſe to treate of the diſeaſes, wherewith hawkes thoſe fillie birds are vexed in their heades, I muſt do you to knowe, that vnder the name and terme of the heade, I do not only compriſe that part that contayneth the brayne, but alſo the eares, eyes, beake, or clappe, nares, and mouth of the hawke: all which partes are ſubiect to ſundry diſeaſes and euils. But firſte of all, I meane to ſpeake of the chiefeſt, and moſt principall part of all the reſt, &amp; of ſuch maladies as light vpon the brayne, and after that, of ſuche as happen to the externall and outward parts of the hawkes head. Among all which infirmities &amp; griefes, I account the Apoplexie (whome the Italians call <hi>Gozza</hi>) the greateſt and moſt perillous, as the which doth ordinarily cauſe and bring ſodayne death.</p>
               <p>This miſchiefe doth commonly befall hawkes, by meane of too muche greaſe, and ſtore of bloude, for that at that tyme there doth happely breake ſome one vayne or other in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> braine, which doth fill ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cauitie or hollow Cell of the brayne w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> bloude, in which Celles (as the learned do imagine &amp; affirme) the Animall ſpirites are inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred, and haue their beginning. Without which Animall ſpirites, no lyuing creature can ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue ſenſe or moouing. Wherevpon it doth follow of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neceſſitie, and by a meere conſequent, that the paſſage of thoſe ſpirites beeing ſhutte vp, and intercluded, the creature, whatſoeuer it be, muſte dye.</p>
               <p>Agayne, it may happen, for that the hawke hath bene ſette too long in the heate of the Sunne, for by that occaſion there may bee ſo muche humiditie and moyſte humour drawen vp into the brayne, as may ingender this euill, and procure this miſchiefe in the hawke.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it may chaunce, by making a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g flight at a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, or Partridge, in the heate of the daye, by meane of which the hawke hath ſurcharged hir ſelfe with ouermuche trauaile.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:23404:119"/>
Wherefore it ſhall be behoouefull and neceſſarie, ſo to vſe the matter with care and diligence, as it may be foreſeene, that hawkes incurre not this aduenture and euill. Wherevppon, for that hawkes in the mewe, are accuſtomed to gather muche greaſe, it ſhall be good, for the ſpace of fifteene or twenty daies before the drawing of them out of the mewe, to feede them with lyquide and ſlypper fleſhe, ſuch as may lyghtly be put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and paſſe through them. As namely, with the heartes of Calues, Lambes, or Goates, waſhed in luke warme water, and afterwarde dryed in a lynnen clothe, before you gyue it your hawke.</p>
               <p>Lykewiſe may you boldly feede your hawkes before they are drawen out of the mewe, with ſmall pullettes, and yong Sparrowes. When you haue thus doone, and obſerued this order of feeding them, when the tyme is come to drawe them out of the mewe, you muſte remember to drawe them very orderly, and after that to continewe the ſame kinde of fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and to keepe the ſame hande vppon them, for other twentie dayes ſpace at the leaſte, to ſkowre and diſburden your hawkes of that ſlyme and glytte, whiche doth ſurcharge them, hauing them alwayes for the moſte parte on the fiſte, and eſpecially at nyghte. Neyther ſhall it be euyll to ſkowre them, (or as our Oſtregers and Falconers do terme it) to enſeame them, by gyuing them a quantitie of waſht Aloes, allowing a Falcon as muche as the byggeneſſe of a Beane, beaten into powder, wrapped in Cotton, and ſo to make hir a ſkowring thereof, and beſides to giue hir Suger Candy, twoo or three mornings. But in any condition you muſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware not to vſe Aloes vnwaſhte, bycauſe thereof are bredde ſundry ill accidentes in hawkes. And for that occaſion is it preſcribed you, to vſe Aloes waſhe, to auoyde that vndoubted euill, whiche would otherwiſe happen.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, I haue happily, and with good ſucceſſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued this remedie. I haue gyuen ſo muche larder, or but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as I coulde well conuey into my hawkes throte, when

ſhee hath beene emptie aboue, hauing firſte prepared the larde or butter, by waſhing it ſeuen, eyght, or moe tymes in cleare water, and afterwardes letting it ſoke in Roſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſpace, and laſtely by putting vnto it of the beſte Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that I coulde gette, or Suger Candie beaten to pouder. And my order was, euer to gyue this ſkowring euery ſeuenth or eyght daye. And this is not alone to bee vſed to hawkes in the mewe, but alſo to ſuche as are kept on the pearche and ſtocke. But if it ſo fall out, that by theſe deuiſes and ſkow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings you cannot make your hawke haue a ſtomake and gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die appetite to feede, it ſhall not bee euill to pyſſe vppon hir meate, and hauing dryed it in part againe, to giue hir a gorge ſufficient, ſo muche as may ſerue hir, and as ſhe will take. For the more liquide and ſlypper fleſhe you giue hir, the ſooner wil ſhe be enſeymed. And by this meanes doe Falconers preſerue their hawkes from the falling euill, and ſodayne miſchiefe, and beſides that from ſundry other perilous accidents, that do followe thoſe ſillie birdes.</p>

Alſo it may bee perceyued by the ſmall deſire the hawke hath to mooue or aduaunce hir ſelfe by the wreſting of hir heade, and the little regarde ſhee hath to tyre and pull the fleſhe that ſhee feedeth on, as thoughe in deede tyring were verie paynefull to hir, and by that ſhee is ſcarce able to open hir clappe, and beaten after hir accuſtomed manner.</p>

               <p>As touching the generall ſkowring, I can commend and allowe you to gyue hir three or foure mornings, when ſhee hath no meate to put ouer, a pyll as bygge as a nut of But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter waſht ſeuen or eyght tymes in freſhe water, and ſteeped well in Roſe water, myngling it afterwarde with Hoonie of Roſes, &amp; very good ſuger, holding your hawke on the fiſte, tyll ſhe make one or twoo mewtes. Which being done, to diſburde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and ſkowre the head, it ſhall be excellent well done to take of Rewe ſeede foure drammes, Aloes Epaticke twoo drammes, Saffron one ſcruple, reducing and forcing all theſe to fine powder, and with a quantitie co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient of honie of Roſes, to make a pyll of that bygneſſe and ſyze, as may well be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueyed into the hawkes beake, by whiche hir brayne maye bee pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ſkowred, thruſting the pyll ſo deepe into hir throte, as you may well ſee, holding hir a ſpace after it vppon the fiſte.

               <p>But if happely there be any of the corruption and filthe in the hawkes eare, it ſhall be very neceſſarie, carefully with an inſtrument of ſiluer, or other good mettall for the nones, that the one ende bee ſharpe poynted and edged, of purpoſe to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply lynte, and on the other ende hollowe, and faſhioned like vnto the eare of a hawke, to clenze and remooue the filth that furreth the hawkes eare.

But if it ſo fall out, that the Apoſtume wyll not come to maturation, or rype, in ſorte as it may growe to ſuppuration, and be mundified in manner aforeſayde, but will reſte at one ſtaye in the heade of the hawke: then muſte you be fayne to come to cauterize the heade aloft, and beſtowe a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton there, to cauſe the humor to breathe, and to bring the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte matter thyther, remembring after this fyer and caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to remooue the eſcare, by beſtowing on it for the ſpace of eyght or nyne dayes, butter, by whiche you ſhall eaſily remoue the cruſte or eſcare, whiche is made by the fier.</p>

               <p>I haue, in the Catarre of Falcons, (as alſo of other hawkes,) diuers tymes vſed with greate good fortune and ſucceſſe, to gyue them of Agaricke twoo ſcruples, of Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon finely beaten, of the iuyce of Lyqueriſſe, of eyther one ſcruple, beeing made alſo into powder, and with a quantitie of Honie of Roſes, to make all thoſe things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſayde into a pyll, as bygge as a Beane, for the largeſt ſorte of hawke, and for other leſſe hawkes, halfe as bygge.

               <p>If with this monſtrous moyſtneſſe of your hawkes heade, there be ioyned a ſwelling, or the dropping of hir eyes: in that caſe I do thinke it beſt, to beſtow your button vpon hir head, iuſte betwixte hir eyes, obſeruing the ſame order that I haue alreadie preſcribed you.</p>
               <p>When the nares of your hawke are ſtufte with filthe, and ſurcharged with ſuche diſtillation from the heade, as I haue ſpoken of: after a conuenient ſkowring, then ſhall it be good to take Pepper and Muſtarde ſeede beaten into fine powder, and putting it in a cleane lynnen clothe, to ſtype it a ſpace in the ſtrongeſt Vyneger you can gette: and that done, to beſtowe ſome fewe droppes thereof vppon hir nares, ſo as they may enter and pierce hir nares. For truely this
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:23404:122"/>
deuiſe will ſo ſcowre and drie vp the humor, as it will doe great pleaſure. But if ſo with theſe remedies and meanes you cannot reſolue it, then muſt you be fayne to vſe the caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, not aloft vpon the head, but round about the nares, giuing hir a little touch with the fire, ſomewhat belowe the nares, to make them more large, alwayes vſing the matter ſo carefully, as you touch not the roote or (poret) of hir nares. When you haue in this maner beſtowed your fire, and actuall cauterie, vntill ſuch time the payne do ceaſſe, and the eſcarre fall away, (whiche is nothing elſe but the cruſt that is growen there, by meane of the fire,) you muſt anoynt the place with freſh but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and after that you haue ſo done, then proceede to the cure of it with the powder of <hi>Maſticke,</hi> or <hi>Olibanum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a very good remedie for the ſwelling in the head of a Hawke. Take Staueſacre, a quantitie of Pepper, and a little Aloes Epaticke, beate theſe ſayd thinges into fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and put them into the water of Rew, where when it hath bin ſteeped a ſpace in the ſaid licoure, with a little bombaſt or lint, bath your Hawkes nares twice a day, and you ſhall finde it eaſe your Hawke greatly, and ridde a greate parte of the filthie matter that breadeth the ſtoppage in hir head. If all theſe remedies which I haue alleaged generally, nor any one ſpeciall medicine will preuayle, as I ſayde before: then muſte you repoſe your chiefe truſt in the cauterie, which muſt be done either on the head with a cauterizing button, or about the nares with a nedle, or ſharpe yron, fyre hotte, or ſome golden or ſiluer inſtrument, of purpoſe made, applying after the fire, for the remouing of the Eſcare, and the cure of the ſame, the remedies aforeſaid.</p>

               <p>This euill accident dothe happen, by meane of groſſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors in the head, whiche are wont to dimme and darken the ſight, and ſometimes cleane to put out the Hawkes eye with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out redemption.</p>
               <p>It maye bee, that the hood is the cauſe and grounde of this diſeaſe, for I neuer in my life remember that I ſawe any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther byrd or fowle troubled with it but only the Falcon: and perhaps, it lights on hir, in chiefe, for that of all other, ſhee is moſte vſed to the hoode, and to be almoſt at no tyme vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooded.</p>
               <p>You muſt therefore haue an eye,<note place="margin">The Curre.</note> and eſpeciall regarde to this inconuenience, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> firſt, by giuing one or two mornings a ſkowring of Aloes, or of Agaricke, to ſkowre your Hawke withall, bycauſe if you ſhoulde aduenture vppon any ſharpe or hard painefull medicine, applying it to the eye of youre Hawke, it woulde perhaps cauſe a greate repaire of euill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and accidents to the place diſeaſed.</p>
               <p>When you haue giuen thys ſkowring of Aloes, or Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke, to remoue the matter from the eye, you muſt vſe a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der made of waſht Aloes, finely beaten, one ſcruple, and of Suger candye two ſcruples, blowing of this powder into your Hawkes eyes three or foure times in a daye, with the Pipe or quill aforeſayd. Thys is the gentleſt, and moſte ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraine medicine that you can applie to the eye in thys caſe.

and whileſt you do miniſter this receyte, it ſhall be good ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to bath the eye with the vrine of a little boy.</p>

               <p>Hawkes are of ſo noble and excellent a nature, as the moſt part of medicines that you doe applie to the hurtes and cures of men, you may boldly beſtowe on Hawkes, as things very holeſome for them, as by their working will be moſt euidently ſeene and perceyued: yet muſte there be a diſcretion vſed, in

               <p>It happeneth diuers times, that through the Catarre, and paine of the head and eyes, there lights vppon the eares of a Hawke ſo mortall and deadly an apoſtume, as ſeldome when, though there bee greate care vſed about the cure, ſhe maye be brought to perfect ſtate, or recouered. And this proceedeth, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the miſchiefe lies ſo neare a neighboure to the brayne, as before it can breake or be clenſed outwardly, it cauſeth the Hawke to periſh. Beſides that, it is very hard to applie medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in that place: but if the Hawke be of ſo ſtrong a nature, that ſhe brooke the breathing and rupture of this diſeaſe, which you ſhall perceyue by the quitture and filth that dothe iſſue from hir cares, giue hir this remedie, which is a very noble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyte, and approued of me often times, as well in men, as in Hawkes, to my great commendation and glory.</p>

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth leane, and lowe. Wherfore it ſhall bee very neceſſary to looke into hir mouth ſometimes, both in the Palat, and vnder the tong, bicauſe that many times, there eſpecially, do growe vp certaine peeces of fleſh like in ſhape to a graine of Peper, ſometimes leſſe, ſometimes bigger than a Peper grayn, which it ſhall be neceſſary to cut away, either with a payre of cyſers, if you may commodiouſly do it, or with Roch Alome burnt, or with a droppe of Oyle of Brimſton, applyed vpon a little cotton, with an yron vnto the place, taking away the corrupte fleſh. You muſt mundifie the place with honie of Roſes, and bombaſt or lynt, vntill you ſee the quicke fleſh vnderneath it, then afterwards, vnto the honie of Roſes, you may apply and adde, a little powder of Maſticke, or incenſe to conſolidate the wounde, waſhing it ſometymes among with white wyne.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, and beſides this, there is wont to happen vnto Hawkes in the mouth, a certaine frownce or impedimente, which doth hinder their feading, as the other peeces of fleſh do, of which I haue ſpoken before. This frownce may be very well perceyued and diſcerned with the eye, and will appeare alſo, by the feeding of the Hawke.</p>
               <p>Diuers times this kind of euill is cured with honie of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and with the powder of nutſhels, bound in a peece of lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen cloth, well bathed and ſtyped togyther, and thruſt vnder the whote ymbers, vntill it may bee brought vnto fine pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: thys may you continue twice a day, as long as ſhall bee needefull.</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:23404:125"/>
After you haue mortified the frownce or canker with <hi>Aquae fortis,</hi> as I haue tolde you, then muſt you mundifie and conſolidate it with honie of Roſes, which wyll cure it out of hand.</p>

                  <hi>Egiptiacum</hi> is an excellent thing to cure &amp; kill the frownce in a Hawke, which is none other thing, but a very Canker, ſuche as men are plagued withall.

But many times it ſo falleth out, that the beake of a Hawke is hindred and offended with this kind of euil, and not the mouth ſo much: in ſuch ſort, as the Hawke cannot well feede, by meane this miſchiefe doth ſo fret and eate the horne of hir chappe and beake. For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie of that, you muſt take a ſharp knife, and pare away, as muche of the beake as is corrupted: but if the maladie or frownce haue eaten very farre vnder the horne of the beake, it is not ſufficient to cut it away with a ſharpe knife, as farre as the canker hath eaten, but you muſt afterwardes anoynt the place with honie of Roſes, twice or thrice: and in ſo doing the Hawke ſhall recouer and do well, for the honie of Roſes will both mundifie and incarne.</p>
               <p>Sometimes a Hawkes beake or clappe doth ouergrowe ſo much, as it is very neceſſary to cope it with an yron, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward to ſharpen the beake with a knife, taking away ſo much as is needeful for the better feeding of your Hawke, but in any wiſe you muſte not medle with the nether clappe, by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that doth not commonly growe ſo faſt, nor ſo farre as to hinder your Hawkes feeding. Wherefore that part is to be fauored.

               <p>Beſides this remedie, there is one other very good, and that is butter, and Larde, well ſliſed, and waſhed in ſundrie wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, till they become very cleane, and whyte, whyche you maye keepe in Roſe water, vntill you haue occaſion to vſe it.</p>

               <p>I haue found by experience that Oyle of ſweete Almonds is of wonderous efficacie in the cure of this diſeaſe, giuing it in a chickens gutte as aforeſayd.</p>

two inches of a Lucerts tayle, newly cut off, conueying it into youre Hawkes gorge, and afterwardes ſetting hir in ſome darke place, till the haue caſt, and then to giue hir gotes milke, with the bloud of a Doue. Otherſome writers do will and aduiſe to let the Hawke bloud in the necke.</p>
               <p>But I for my parte, haue neyther tried the one, nor the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if I ſhall tell you the trouth of the matter, bycauſe I doe not at all like of theſe deuiſes: but doe aſſure you, that with thoſe other remedies and receytes, whiche I haue taught you in this Chapter of the Pantas, (I meane, the ſkowrings, and the cawterie,) I haue done very muche good, and recouered my Hawkes of this diſeaſe, and therefore do recommend you to them, as vndoubted experiments.</p>
               <p>Betony reduced into the forme of an Electuarie with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, is a very good remedie for this greefe, as well in men, as in Hawkes.</p>
               <p>One other remedie which I find in an Italian Author, is this. Take Mummy, Rhewbarbe, Saffron, &amp; Suger candye, make all theſe into powder, giuing it to your Hawke, for the ſpace of eight days at leaſt in a chickins ſkinne, if ſhee will take it, if not, force it into hir. And while you miniſter thys medicine vnto hir, al that time let hir not be borne on the fiſte: and withall among ſometimes, giue waſht freſh butter with ſuger candye, and ſometimes a cotton caſting with incenſe within it. But I do more commend, to giue hir bole Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acke, in a pill with honie.</p>
               <p>Theſe remedies no doubt, are very good and ſoueraigne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Pantas of a Hawke. Make you choyſe of them, but let the Cawterie be the laſt refuge, for that is an extremitie. Remember this rule of Phiſicke, that euer it is beſt to begin w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the weakeſt: for if they will profit and do ſufficient good, in vayne it were to charge nature with the ſtrongeſt receytes, which are rough, and churliſh in working.</p>

               <head>Of the infirmitie and diſeaſe in the gorge of a Hawke, when ſhe dothe caſt hir gorge.</head>
               <p>SVndry are the diſeaſes that Hawkes are peſtred withall, by meane of the indiſpoſition of the gorge, when y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> parte is out of tune: among which the moſt ordinarie and perillous is the caſting of the gorge, when a Hawke dothe caſt hir meate vndigeſted, in the ſelfe ſame forme ſhe receyued it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or elſe cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and of a lothſome ſauoure, both whiche they doe many times.</p>
               <p>If ſhee caſt it cleane, and not ſtincking, but of good ſmell, ther is no great feare of the matter, nor any great danger: by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it maye proceede by meane ſome ſmall bone is croſſed and turned in the gorge of the Hawke, whiche doth cauſe hir to caſt it againe for hir more eaſe and quiet: Wherefore in this caſe it ſhall be good for the more ſuretie, and to knowe the worſt of the accident that may happen thereby, to beare your Hawke to the water, or to offer hir a baſon of water, to trie whether ſhe wil bowze or no. For by bowzing, beſides the good that ſhe ſhall receyue by it, you ſhall haue euident proofe and vndoubted ſhewe of hir diſeaſe, and that in deede ſhee is ſicke, and dothe ſtande in neede of Phiſicke: but if ſhee bowze not at all, it argueth hir to bee in good time.</p>
               <p>Theſe accidentes are wonte to happen by meane of ouer much moyſture and humiditie, and through exceſſiue rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, engendred in the gorge.</p>
               <p>Wherefore if the Hawke caſt hir meate well ſauoring, and of good coloure, neyther ſtinking to ſmell, nor lothſome to vewe, and do bowze after it, it ſhall be good to heate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort the gorge, with the powder of Nutmegges and Cloues, with a quantitie of Muſke, all enwrapped in a peece of fine cotton, or bombaſt, giuing it to the hawke when ſhe is emptie

paneld, as cuſtome is to do, holding hir on the fiſte, vntill ſhee put ouer hir ſayd caſting into hir gorge. Then two houres after ſhe hath caſt it againe, it ſhall be very neceſſary to feede hir with yong Doues, giuing but halfe a gorge, or ſomewhat leſſe at a time: and at nighte when hee ſuppes hir, to lette hir plume a little, and if the Hawke will bowze, to giue hir leaue to doe it, for truly it will be very wholſome for hir. By this meanes, I promiſe you, I haue recouered ſundrie ſieke Hawkes, and chiefly Sparowhawkes.</p>
               <p>I haue ouer and beſides this, vſed with great good ſucceſſe, good Roſe water, altred w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a quantitie of powder of Cloues, and muſke, preparing it after this manner:</p>
               <p>I haue taken Roſe water two ownces, powder of Cloues two ſcruples, of fine Muſke fyue graines: and of this haue I giuen my Hawke fyue ownces, or there about, after that as my Hawke hath bin either poore or hie in ſtate, holding hir on the fiſte, vntill ſhe hath made a mewte.</p>
               <p>This medicine will bring hir to a good apetite, a ſweete breath, and will beſides all theſe ſcowre very well.</p>
               <p>But if that which ſhe doth eaſt, be corrupted and ſtincking: ouer and beſides the aforeſayd remedies, whiche indeede are excellent good, I can allow well that you take the roote of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidonie, or Celondine, remouing away the vpper rynde and pill off the roote, vntill it looke redde, and droppe agayne, then to infuſe it in a quantitie of luke warme water, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the roote vp and downe in the water, to cauſe it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue the effect and qualitie of the Celydonie the more. Of which roote you muſt (after you haue ſo done) conuey a pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let as bigge as a beane for the huger ſorte of Hawkes, into the beake of your Hawke, thruſting it downe with your fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger into the very gorge of hir, to the end it may the better deſcend into your Hawke. Beſides this, it is very good to open hir beake, and conuey into hir one ſpoonefull of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aforeſayd, not all at once, but at twice or thrice, cloſing

               <p>Thys beeyng done, keepe hir a ſpace vppon the fiſte, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the roote and licoure bee well ſettled in hir gorge. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whyche, caſt hir on the pearche, in ſuche a place, where is no reſorte, eyther of people, dogges, chickens, cattes, or other ſuche lyke thynges, to the ende you maye the better diſcerne hir ſkowring: and beſydes, that ſhee maye haue the leſſe cauſe to bate. There let hir ſtande, vntill ſhee hathe caſt all the roote whiche ſhee receyued, and that the water hathe made hir mewte and ſliſe ſufficiently, whyche will doe hir very greate good. Then after two houres it ſhall be well, to giue hir a yong Ratte or Mouſe, newly ſtripped out of the ſkinne hote, and for lacke thereof, a yong Pigeon, whome you ſhall kill, by throwing hir forcibly againſt the grounde, with the raines downeward, bycauſe the bloud may gather togither, and ſtande: whereof feede youre Hawke, giuing hir the hart alſo, and the reynes thereof, withoute anye more allowance of any of the Pigeons fleſhe. When ſhee hathe diſpatched and rydde this beaching of the Pigeons hart and bloud, or of the yong Ratte, then giue hir in like manner the like quantitie, onely of the dead doue: onely twice a day to a Sparowhawke, but to a Falcon or Goſhawke, foure or fyue beachings in one day, euer obſeruing the ſelfe ſame order that I haue preſcribed you.</p>
               <p>The next morning you may, if neede be, in a little lint, or flaxe, or ſuch like deuiſe, gyue a ſkowring of incenſe or Oliba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, I meane, the leaues of it brooſed in your hand, as ſmall as is poſſible, gyuing hir but a ſmall gorge, to the ende, that towardes the euening, you may allowe hir a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſupper.</p>
               <p>By this vſage and order haue I cured ſundrie Hawkes of mine owne, and other mens.</p>
               <p>You muſt note, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> theſe remedies aforeſaid, do not profit,

nor do the feate, and that the Hawke doth caſt hir, more than twice, then is it a deſperate caſe, and ſo much the woorſe, if the Hawke be lowe and poore, for then in that caſe haue I ſeene very few or none recured.</p>
               <p>Neuertheleſſe, I haue ſomtimes ſeene a meruayle wrought in this caſe, by making the greater kind of Hawkes, as Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, Gerfalcons and ſuch like, dronke with a ſponfull or two of ſtrong Malmeſie, conueyed by force into hir gorge: but to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leſſer Hawkes you muſt not giue ſo muche of the Malmeſie, but in leſſe quantitie.

               <p>Wherefore it ſhall be neceſſarie to reſpect the cure of theſe Fylanders, not by killing them (as you woulde doe other woormes, (for then happely beeyng deade, and rotting in that place, from whence they can not paſſe awaye with the Hawkes mewte, they woulde there corrupte and breede a filthie Apoſtume in hir) but the waye that you muſte take: is, by making the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> droncke with ſome medicine to entertayne them, in ſuch ſort, as they may not offend or grype the hawke.</p>
               <p>The beſte remedie that can bee deuiſed for it, is to take a Garlicke head, pyſling from the cloues thereof the vtmoſte finde: whiche doone, you ſhall with ſome ſmall yron toole, or bookine hette in the fyre, pierce the cloues, and make cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne holes in them. And afterwards ſteeping them in Oyle at leaſte three dayes, gyue your Falcon one of them downe hir throte: for the cloue of Garlicke vſed in this manner as I tell you, will ſo inrage &amp; aſtonne the Filanders, that for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie or forty dayes after they wil not at al moleſt your hawke. Wherevpon ſome Falconers, when their Falcons be low and poore, once in a moneth do of ordinarie gyue them a Cloue of Garlicke, for feare of the Filanders, to preuent the woorſte, and truely to good effecte. And for that verie purpoſe and cauſe, are ſeldom or neuer without Garlicke ſtieped in Oyle, where y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger they lye, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> better, &amp; more medicinable they are.</p>
               <p>Thus muſt you deale with thoſe Filanders, that lye in the raynes. But there is one other kind of Filanders, lying in the guts, or pannell of a hawke, which are long, ſmall, and white worms, as though they had dropt out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> raines of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hawke. If you will deſtroy thoſe Filanders, you muſt take Aloes E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paticke, fylings of yron, Nutmegges, &amp; ſo much Honie, as wil ſerue to frame a pyll, which pyll you ſhall giue your hawke in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morning, as ſoone as ſhe hath eaſte, holding hir on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fiſte for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace of an houre after.

               <p>Take Aloes Epaticke, &amp; Wormwood made into very ſmall pouder, temper the pouder with Oyle of bitter Almondes: and that done, annoynte therewith the flanckes and ſides of your hawke.

Many times this diſeaſe of the lyuer proceedes of ſome brooſe agaynſte the grounde, or in a tree, or the encounter with another fowle.</p>

               <p>If the heate of hir lyuer proceede of too muche bating, or broyling with hir ſelfe, you maye eaſily cure hir with foure or fyue good lyquide and cooling gorges, as to feede hir with the legge of a Pullette, or the hearte of a Veale, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed in water of Bugloſſe, Bowrage, Hartes tongue, and ſuche like waters.</p>

               <p>SOmetymes the arme and foote of a Hawke doeth ſwell, by meanes of yll humors that deſcende and drop downe, through weakneſſe of the foote or arme, through ouergreat trauail &amp; toile, through age, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſome blow or brooſe receiued lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g before.</p>
               <p>This miſchiefe may eaſily bee diſcerned as well by vewe of eye as touch of hande: for beſides that you ſhall plainly perceiue it in ſight, you may feele a verie great heate in the member, ſo as ſometimes the hawke is vnable to ſtande on hir legges, for paine and anguiſh thereof. Wherfore it is neceſſarie to looke to it with all care that may be, and ſo vſe the matter, as the humor breede not the goute, or the pinne, which oftentymes happeneth to thoſe poore byrdes, to their great and continuall plague.</p>
               <p>The way to cure it, is to giue the humor a vent by launſing it, and after that to recomfort the member by often annoynting it with the white of an Egge, Vinegar, and Roſe water, well beaten and coyled togither, or elſe with verie good olde Oyle of Oliues, ſuch as you can come by out of a Bottell wherein Oyle hath beene long time kept: for thoſe droppes that hardly come out of the Bottel, are farre better than any newe freſh Oyle, and are more medicinable in this caſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer beſides the ceaſing the paine, to delay the ſwelling, you ſhall finde it verie excellent good, to take the powder of
<hi>Acacia,</hi> and <hi>terra Sigillata,</hi> of either four drammes, incorporating them with vineger, the white of an Egge, Roſe water, and the iuyce of Nightſhade, as muche as will ſuffice to make this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent ſoft and delicate, and with this receyte to annoynt the hawkes foote or arme oftentimes for a ſpace: for this vnguent no
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:23404:135"/>
queſtion, will both take away the immoderate ache and paine, as alſo mollifie and delay the ſwelling, and ſo reſtore your hawk to hir former plight againe.</p>
               <p>An other approued medicine is, to annoynt the ſwelling of your hawkes foote with <hi>Olium Petroleum,</hi> (which is the oyle of a Rocke) and with Oyle of white Lillies, taking of eche of theſe like quantitie, the bloud of a Pigeon, and the tallow of a candle, heating all theſe togither a little at the fire. This vnguent will throughly reſolue the miſchiefe, or at the leaſt, by reſoluing the thinneſt humors, bring it to that paſſe, as you ſhall ſee the groſſeſt partes well digeſted, which you ſhall perceyue by the whiteneſſe and hardneſſe therof. Then muſt you make an iſſue, by launcing finely with a knife the ſkin of the hurt place, and afterwards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint it for certaine dayes with the vnguent aforeſayde, and it ſhall recouer.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, a very good remedie for the ſwelling in a hawkes foote, after a rupture made, is to vſe this cerotte that followeth. Take Gumme Arabicke, Armoniacke, <hi>Sagapeum,</hi> a gumme ſo called, of either two drammes, Greeke Pitch, and ſhip Pitche, of eche a reaſonable quantitie, Powder of Maſticke three ounces, of Oyle of Iuniper, or of the Firre tree, new waxe as much as wil ſuffice to make a Cerot, according to Art: diſſolue your gumms in Vineger, which done, ſpread of this vpon a pleggat of linnen cloth, applying it handſomly both within the foote and without, making certaine holes wherthrough to conuey the hawkes ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or talons: Alwayes remembring if the ſwollen part be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken before the application of your Cerot, to mundifie and clenſe the water and ſlime that is in the wound, and ſo euery two or three dayes to chaunge and renew your Cerot.</p>
               <p>The vertue of it is to deſiccat, comfort and mundifie the filth and quitture that is in the hurt member, whereby the hurt muſt of force be recouered.</p>

Which done, ſet the Hawke in ſome ſuch place, where ſhe ſhall haue no occaſion to bate or broyle with hir ſelfe, but bee at the greateſt quiet and reſt ſhee maye, applying medicines that haue vertue to deſiccate and ſtrengthen the hurte member, which you ſhall doe, by bathing a Linnen plegget, or a plegget of Flaxe in the white of an Egge, Oyle of Roſes, and Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, with two drammes of <hi>Saenguis Draconis,</hi> and of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes</hi> incorporated togyther, and bynding it aboute the thigh or legge whiche is out of ioynt, and faſtning ouer and aboue the ſayd plegget a ſlender roller of linnen cloth, to conſerue and kepe

This done, bynde it with a fine Linnen roller to ſtaye the playſter. Then make fine ſplets of Timber, all of one length, thinne as may be, and in faſhion like the ſcales of a Sworde ſcabbarde, whome you muſt enwrappe in Lynt for brooſing the member. Theſe ſplets beſtowe orderly aboute your Hawkes legge or thighe on euerie ſide, bynding them with the Linnen rollers or fillets artificially, but neyther ſo looſely as the bones may ſlippe out of theyr place, ne yet ſo ſtreightly, but that the hurt member may receyue hys naturall nouriſhment and comfort.

               <p>HAwkes are wont diuerſe times to receiue ſtripes and blowes by other fowles, as the Falcon by encounter with a Heron, and ſometimes by ſome other accident, as by carying hir in a hawks bag vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> occaſion, or by raſhing into buſhes and thornes, or ſuch like hurtfull places.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſtrypes and hurtes either are ſimple hurtes (as they are termed) that is to ſay in the ſkinne and fleſhe of a Hawke only, or elſe compoundes, as when a nerue and ſinewe is prickt, or cut in ſunder.</p>
               <p>The ſymple woundes and hurtes are of ſlender or no daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at all, and will bee recured lightly agayne, eyther with the iuyce of <hi>Orgium,</hi> or a bathe and lotion made of Maſticke, Aloes, and Myrrhe, two drammes, Pympernell, Comfrey, and Sage, of eyther a handefull and a halfe, of <hi>Agresta</hi> cleare and good, ſixe poundes, putting all theſe things aforeſayde,<note place="margin">Agresta.</note> into a ſtone Veſſell made verye cleane, or elſe into an earthen potte, there ſuffering it to boyle ſo long with a cloſe couer vppon it, vntill two thirde partes of the <hi>Agresta</hi> bee waſted and conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.

               <p>But in any condition I cannot allowe the vſe of Oyle of Roſes, in hurtes of the heade, as it ſeemes, that the ſayde Authour woulde haue it.</p>
               <p>If your Hawkes ſkinne of hir thigh or hinder partes be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, fretted awaye, or hurt by bearing hir in a cloſe Canuas bagge, or ſuch like, you maye eaſily recouer hir with thys de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe.

               <p>Falconers doe vſe to ridde theſe vile wormes and Life in the Winter time, by taking of pepper beaten to powder two drams, of warme water one pounde, or as much as will ſuffice, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Pepper and water well togither, and then to pepper (as we terme it) or waſhe all hir feathers with the ſayde lotion or bathe, and ſpecially thoſe partes of the Hawke whereof I ſpake before, where the Mites and Life do moſt haunte: whiche done, they ſet the Hawke on a perche, with hir trayne and backe to the Sunne ward, holding in their handes a ſmall ſticke one handfull
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:23404:140"/>
long, on the toppe whereof they faſten a peece of waxe, either red, or greene, and with that, (while the Hawke doth weather hir) they take away the Life and Mytes crawling vpon the feathers, ſo as before the Hawke be throughly dryed and weathered, what with the waxe, and their owne dropping away, there will not be a vermin left about the hawke. For the Pepper and water doth ſo much diſeaſe them, as they are enforced to leaue their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed lodgings: then the heate of the Sunne, or fire, helpes to make them ſhew themſelues: and the waxe by cleauing to them, vtterly and clearely riddes the hawke of them.</p>
               <p>I haue ſeene ſome Falconers adde vnto the Pepper and water, a quantitie of Staueſagre, as an enimie to the life and mytes, by meane of ſtrength and force that is in it: and I take it to be verie neceſſarie to be added in this medicin to the Pepper, for the better diſpatch of thoſe vile vermines, which do ſo much vex and annoy the hawke, as ſhe can by no meanes keepe hir ſelfe in good ſtate, whileſt ſhe is incombred with them.</p>
               <p>You muſt remember to pepper your hawke in this maner, as I haue ſhewed you, in a verie warme ſunnie day, when there is no winde at all blowing in the Skie. But if by fortune you bee enforced to do it in another time, when the weather is colde, and the Sunne not ſhining, then muſt you ſet your hawke by the fire to weather hir, and drie hir feathers: but neither muſt the fire be ouer hote, nor the gorge of your Hawke towardes the fire, whereof I haue giuen you aduertiſement before, in thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts which are to be obſerued of a good Falconer. For if you ſet hir with the gorge to the fire, no doubt, ſhe will receyue no ſmall harme and inconuenience thereby, and for the moſte part death enſues of it.</p>
               <p>In the Sommer time you may diſpatch your hawke of the Life &amp; Mites with <hi>Auripigmentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

(as ſome do vſe to doe) to the great hurt and miſchiefe of thoſe poore byrdes. For the bathing or ſpowting hir with water, is a meane to make the powder to frette awaye, and conſume the Hawkes feathers.</p>

               <head>Of misfortunes that happen to Hawkes in the mew. And firſt of all, of their laying egges in the mew.</head>
               <p>IN the mew Hawkes are ſubiect to ſundrie accidents. Among all which (to paſſe ouer the greſineſſe and exceſſiue glitte, that they are ſurcharged withall, hauing ſomewhat toucht that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Chapter of the Goute) the greateſt miſhap that may be is, when Hawkes fall to laying egges, and to be with egge in the mewe. For in verie deede this is a great miſchiefe, and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers tymes doth kill the hawke.</p>
               <p>You ſhall firſt perceyue it by the creaking and crying that they vſe in the mewe ſometymes, and otherwhiles on the perche, albeit now and then they do it for egerneſſe and apetite, when they are ſharpe ſet: which as it is eaſily founde, ſo is it as quickly remedied.</p>
               <p>A man ſhall knowe when they fall to lyking and laying, by this, from the necke of the Hawke, downe to the verie middle of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:23404:141"/>
hir traine, there is vpon the feather, a certaine thing like the floure of Branne, of a pale and aſhie colour.</p>
               <p>And bycauſe this accident happeneth by meane of too muche daintineſſe, and luſtfull pride of the Hawke, it ſhall bee good to keepe hir low, and to holde a hard hand ouer hir, pinching hir of hir feeding, giuing hir liquide and moyſt fleſhe, from the middle of Aprill, to the ende of May, which is the only time to be feared of all the yeare for this matter. When the Hawke doth leaue hir croaking and crying in the mewe, it is a manifeſt proofe that ſhe is with Egge, whiche you ſhall knowe, both by hir groſſneſſe and filling in the pannell, as alſo by hir ydle ſtanding withoute liſt to feede. And if happely the Egges bee growne any thing great within hir, you ſhall hardly hinder hir, but that ſhee will lay them. Therefore (as I tell you) it ſhall be good in tyme to looke vnto it, keeping hir lowe in Aprill and May. And in thoſe monethes to miniſter vnto hir, Aloes Epaticke waſht, a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Saffron lapped in Bombaſt or Cotton, wherevpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey a little Flaxe or Towe, and make a caſting or ſcouring of it, thruſting it downe hir throte into hir gorge, the Hawke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both emptie panneld, and hauing no meate aboue to put o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, keeping hir on the fiſt after it, till ſuch time the ſcouring be in hir gorge. Of this and ſuche like ſcourings may you giue your hawke euery third or fourth day, for foure or fiue times, feeding hir with liquid meates, ſuch as will lightly be indewed. And v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing this order, no doubt your hawke ſhall do well.</p>
               <p>Againe it is verie good agaynſte the ſame miſchiefe, to cauſe your Hawke in foure or fiue byttes of meate, to take a quantitie of Saffron in chyues, vſing hir after the manner and forme aforeſayde.</p>
               <p>Moreouer it is a very good way, to delay and kill the liſt and lyking of a Sparhawke, to feede hir for three, foure, or moe dayes, if you thinke good, with liquid meates waſht in water, wherin the great pilles of <hi>Ornus</hi> haue beene infuſed for the ſpare of eight or ten dayes, being finely cut to peeces. But it ſhoulde be farre better, if you cauſe thoſe rindes and pilles to bee boyled in water, ſo long vntill they become ſofte and tender, and then to

               <p>If your Hawke bee with Egge (as they terme it) ſo as you may perceiue and feele the egges within hir, beſides thoſe foreſaid remedies, it ſhall be good to annoynt hir tuell with oyle Olife: which being done, conuey in thy forefinger at hir tuell, as finely as thou canſt, to feele the egges, whiche if thou once feele, gripe thy Hawkes pannell ſoftly for hurting hir, forcing downwards the egge towardes thy finger in hir tuell, and if it be poſſible ſo bring it away cleane, and rid thy hawke of it: but if thou canſt not do it, breake it euen there right, and afterwarde beſtowe a clyſter vpon thy hawke of things lenitiue, to make hir mewt and ſliſe well: for by this meane (as my Italian Authour doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme me) thou ſhall diſcharge thy hawke of this miſchiefe, and bring hir to be in perfite ſtate againe.</p>

Wherfore to make a hawke mewe timely, the ſureſt and beſt way is to caſt hir off into a good mewe for the purpoſe, (made in maner as I haue taught you before) and there to allow hir of the beſt hote meates that may be had, as Quayles, Pigeons, and Sparrowes, and now and then among, to ſet hir in the mewe ſome veſſell, large and deepe, conueniently filled with water, wherein your hawke may bowſe and bath at hir pleaſure.</p>

But you may giue a Falcon ſixe or more at one time, holding the hawke on the fiſt, till ſhe beginne to ſliſe and mewte, and after that a ſpace feede hir with good hote meate, alwayes remembring, that if the hawke do loath the taking of them, (as happely ſhee will) or doe not verie well brooke them after ſhe hath taken them, then that you giue hir reſpite betwixte tymes, for three or foure dayes togither, to the ende ſhee may not finde hir ſelfe cloyed with them.</p>

               <p>For remedie heereof, ſome doe wyll a man to make the hole agayne, where it was before, and to open it a freſhe, with a Barlye grayne, dryed ſo as it bee not burnte.

               <p>TO keepe Falcons and all maner of birds of pray in health, the chiefe Falconers ſaye, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they muſt neuer haue a great gorge gyue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſpecially of groſſe meates, as Beefe, Porke, &amp; ſuch other y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are hard to be put ouer and endewed. Moreouer you muſt beware in any wiſe that ye feede them not with the fleſh of any beaſt that hath lately gone to rutte, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will kill them, and yee ſhall not perceiue how. I fynde by experience, that the giuing of great gorges, and the feeding of them with ſuch ſorts of fleſhe, (ſpecially colde,) dothe deſtroy and ſurfit moe Hawkes than all other miſchaunces that can happen to them. And therefore I warne all Falconers to beware howe

they ouergorge their Hawkes: and if they be driuen to feede them with groſſe fleſh for want of better, let it be well ſoaked in cleane water, and afterward ſufficiently well wroong. It muſt be done in Sommer with colde water, and in Winter with ſuke warme water, and it muſt not be wroong too muche with the hande: for the maſſineſſe of the fleſhe, and the looce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the water, will cauſe them to put ouer and to indew the ſooner and more ſpedily. And it will cauſe them to haue the larger panels, whereby they ſhall the better ſcowre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues downeward of the glitte, and groſſe humors. And thys is to be vnderſtoode of all groſſe fleſhe wherewith yee ſhall be fayne ſometimes to feede your Hawkes: but not of any other feeding that is light and of good digeſtion. For yee muſt haue diſcretion to reward your Hawke now and then with ſome good liue and warme meate, or elſe ſhee maye bee brought too lowe. Neuertheleſſe the ſeruing of your Hawkes with waſht meate (as is ſayde before) is the way to keepe them in healthe.</p>

               <head>How men ſhould make their Hawkes to tire euery day.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>I</hi> Say further, that the good Falconers and ſuche as haue a care to vſe theyr Hawkes well, and to keepe them in health, muſt make them to tire towardes the euenings before they let them iouke. When your Hawke hath put ouer and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, afterward in giuing hir caſting, you may well at youre diſcretion gyue hir (if you liſt) a little Aloes Cicotrine in hir caſting, or elſe ſome commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> pill, and that doth greatly ſcowre the head, and doe hir much good. And that muſt be done eyther once a weeke, or twice in three weekes: and the ſayd medicine is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diuers times by ſuch as like not to giue their Hawkes tiring. Neuertheleſſe I ſay that tiring in the morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Hawke hath caſt, is very good. And if the tyring be of plumage, keepe hir from eating of feathers (as well as you may) for feare leaſt ſhe take caſting before the euening: for to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night it is no daunger, for then of common courſe ſhee is to haue caſting. Let hir tire againſt the Sunne, ſnyting and ſewing hir beake a little at your diſcretion, after as you find your Hawke lowe and poore, vntill you intend to go to your paſtime. I haue knowen many Falconers that neuer make their Hawkes to tire, ſaying that it is but a cuſtome, and needeleſſe: but I ſay the contrary. For inaſmuche as the Hawke is exerciſed by reaſonable tyring, ſhee becommeth the helthyer and the lighter both of body and of head, by all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate exerciſes, yea and ſhe is the better in ſtate alſo as you may perceyue. And I beleeue that the opinion of ſuch as ſaye ſo, proceedeth of nothing but of ſlouth and of ſmall loue whych they haue to their Hawkes. Therfore forget not to make your Hawke to tyre againſt the Sunne in the morning: for it rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them the better of the watry humors that deſcend out of
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:23404:151"/>
their heads, if either before the doing of it or after, you ſet them vpon a pearch againſt the Sunne, that they may tricke and enoyle themſelues at their pleaſure. This done, ye may ſette them in their accuſtomed places. And bicauſe ſome Falconers are ſo ſlouthfull (as is ſayd afore) that they will not make their Hawkes to tire, and otherſome haue not leyſure always to do it: in ſtead of tyring, I will giue them a remedie that follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth to eaſe them of their watery humors which they haue in their heads for want of tiring. Take Agarike beaten into powder, and <hi>Ierapigra,</hi> with a little Saffron, and make a pill of it as bigge as a beane, and put a third part leſſe of <hi>Iera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pigra</hi> than of Agaricke to binde your pouder togither. Let that pill ſo made be put into hir wrapped in Cotton, towards euening when ſhe hath indued hir gorge and is emptie, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king hir to receyue it three or foure dayes togither. And you may vſe this medicine from mooneth to mooneth at youre diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſion: And by the opinion of all Falconers, ye may giue this pill for all vnknowen and hidden diſeaſes, for which you know none other remedie.</p>

               <p>THe chiefe Falconers ſaye and agree, that the diſeaſes in Hawkes heads do moſt commonly breede of giuing them too great gorges, eſpecially of groſſe and ill fleſh. For when a Hawke hath too full a gorge, ſhe cannot well put it ouer and indue it, wherevpon it falleth to corrupting and ſtincking in hir gorge by lying too long there, and ſpeciallye, more in a Hawke that is lowe and poore than in one that is high, and full of fleſh, inſomuch that ſhe is forced to caſt it all ſtincking. And if ſhe happen to put it ouer ſo ſtincking, it atteynteth and rotteth hir panell, by meanes whereof the fume and ſtinch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend vp to hir head, and there cloſe and ſtuffe vp hir eares, and the paſſages of hir pipes and head, ſo as the humors whiche were wonte, cannot paſſe away as they were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed, by reaſon whereof the head ſwelleth inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately.

That done, then by <hi>Martins</hi> aduice take pitche if you will, to the mountenance of a beane, whyche you muſt warme be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt youre handes, and afterwarde cleane it to the roofe of hir beake, rubbing it ouer with a little of the powlder of Staueſacre and Pepper, till ſhee feele the pitche well vppon hir Palate: and by and by in laboring to ſhake off the ſayde pitche and water from hir Palate, ſhee will caſt: and let hir caſt hir fill till ſhee bee throughly ſcowred.

               <p>And to recomfort youre Hawke after all theſe medicines, yee maye giue hir foure or fyue Cloues of Mace as is ſayde afore, after as the bigneſſe of them is, whyche you muſt firſte brooze a little, and put into hir caſting. For the Cloues ſo giuen are ſingularly good for Hawkes againſt all Rheumes and humors of the head, ſo that it maketh them to haue a good breath and keepeth it from ſtincking, by ſetting theyr whole bodies in a temperate heate. And the Cloues being ſo gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen euery eight daye, is ynough to keepe a Hawke from all rhewmatike diſeaſes of the head, and from all other diſeaſes that come of cold.</p>

               <p>NOw that I haue ſpoken of the diſeaſe of the head whyche commeth oftentimes of gyuing too greate a gorge or of fowle feeding, I will ſpeake of the Rhewme or poſe whyche breedeth of the coldneſſe of the brayne, and vpper parte of the head. The Hawkes that haue this diſeaſe, indure ſuche payne as they cannot holde open their eyes. And of this diſeaſe ſpring many other griefes, as the pinne and the webbe in the eye, whereby they loſe theyr ſyght: and ſometimes they loſe their ſyght withoute hauing the pinne and webbe in theyr eyes. Beſides that, there followeth the hawe in their eyes as in the eyes of a Horſe, and ſometimes alſo the pip in their tungs, and another diſeaſe whiche is called the <hi>Efforcyllons</hi> in the Frenche tong (I knowe not what Engliſhe tearme to beſtowe vppon it.) And moreouer the ſwelling of the roofe of their pallate whyche is called the <hi>Vuila,</hi> an ill diſeaſe, whereof
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:23404:153"/>
breedeth the Cancre. All theſe diſeaſes are very daungerous and put Hawkes in great hazard, if there be not ſkill to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die them betimes. And Maſter <hi>Amé Caſsyan</hi> ſayth that ſuche diſeaſes breede of flewme whiche is in the bodies of Hawkes, as I ſayd afore of the other Rhewme: and that fleume com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of ſetting them in moyſt and colde places. Alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme it commeth of bringing them home colde and wet out of the fieldes, and of ſetting them downe vppon their pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches withoute drying or warming them at the fire or in the Sunne.</p>
               <p>The remedie of thoſe diſeaſes is firſt and formoſt to caw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſe them in manner following. Faſhion a little yron with a rounde heade like a peaze, (whiche is called a button) and make it in manner redde whote in the fire, but yet not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whote: (for yron is very violent if it be too much het.) Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe hir therewith on the toppe of hir head, bycauſe the griefe and diſeaſe is there grounded. Cauſe your Hawke to be well caſt, that you maye cawterize hir at youre eaſe, and pleaſure, for you muſt beware of burning hir too deepe, and therefore that ye may be ſure to do it well, mayle your Hawke faſt, and pull off a fewe of hir feathers. Aſſoone as you haue done ſo, take another yron with a poynte as ſharpe as the tooth of a combe, and put it in the fire as afore ſayde, and therewith pierce hir nares in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> middes. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> two or three days after, take another flat yron of a finger broad, heate likewiſe red whote, and cauteriſe your Hawke againe therewith handſomly as it were betweene the eye lid and the horne of the beake, and do it with the ſharper ſide of the yron: not that the yron ought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede to haue any edge, but rather by all reaſon to be blunt. And take good heede that the fire touch nother the ball of hir eye nor hir nares, and therefore ſee that ye gard hir eye with a wet cloute to keepe it from the ſmoke. All ſuch maner of fires muſt be giuen towards the euening, before Hawkes are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, when they are emptie, for otherwiſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> handling of them would make them caſt their gorges. When all is done as it
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:23404:154"/>
ſhould be, halfe gorge your Hawke, or ſomewhat leſſe with warme meate. And the ſame daye make prouiſion of ſuche Snayles as are among vines, or among Fenill, and ſuche as haue gray ſhelles, they are the beſt, for men are wont to eate of them. Steepe fyue or ſixe of them in the milke of an Aſſe, or of a Gote, or elſe (for want of that) in womans milke, and let it be done in a good large glaſſe well couered, that they creepe not out.</p>
               <p>The next morning breake the ſhelles, and waſh them in newe milke as it commeth from the Cowe: then giue foure or fiue of thoſe Snayles to your Hawke, after that they bee of bigneſſe. And aſſoone as that is done, ſet hir againſt a fire or the Sunne, and remoue hir not away till ſhe haue muted four or fiue times. And if ſhe can abide the heate well, let hir alone ſtill, for it doth hir much good. After noone fede hir w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a Hennes legge or with ſome ſmall birds, or with a Ratte or a Mouſe, whiche are beſt of all, and then ſet hir in a warme place and giue hir not too great a gorge. When euening commes, that ſhe hath indued &amp; put ouer hir meate, take fiue or ſixe Cloues of Mace, broken aſunder, and wrapped in a peece of fleſh or a pellet of cotton, and make hir to receyue it by fayre meanes, or fowle, by opening hir beake, and conueying it into hir. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue this medicine foure or fiue dayes, and your Hawke ſhall recouer. Afterward make hir to tire euening and morning and let hir feeding be ſtyped in milke as is ſayde afore of the Snayles, for the milke ſcowreth hir body within, and is very nutritiue, and will quickly bring hir to be hie, and in fleſhe agayne.</p>

It breedeth commonly of a Rhewme, confirmed in the heade, from whence ſpring many other diſeaſes, (whereof I haue made mention in the Chapter of Rhewmes in the heade, and of the diſeaſe called (the <hi>Barbillons,</hi>) whiche breedeth in Hawkes tongues,) as the Pyppe doth, the diſeaſe of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, and the Canker, which are very daungerous diſeaſes and deadely.

               <head>The diſeaſe of the Canker which breedeth in the throtes and tungs of Hawkes.</head>
               <p>YE muſt vnderſtande that the Canker breedeth of fowle fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your Hawkes, not waſhing of their meate in colde water in Sommer, and in warme in Winter, whiche ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth in their guttes groſſe ſlimy matter. And when thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors come to be moued, they fume vp into the head, and (ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling agayne) ingender heate of the lyuer, which breaketh out in the throte and the tung, and there ingender the Canker. You ſhall diſcerne this diſeaſe by the feeding of your Hawke, for in taking hir meate ſhe letteth it fall, and afterward hath much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doe to ſwallowe it. Therefore let hir beake be anoynted, and you ſhall find the diſeaſe of the Canker. Maſter <hi>Amé Caſsian</hi> giueth this medicine for it. Take Oyle of Almonds or Oyle Olife waſhed as is ſayd afore, and anoynt well hir throte with it twice or thrice a day. That done, giue hir the ſayd medicine of Sugre, Lard, and marrowe of Beefe three dayes togither, and feede hir with Mutton or with Pullets or Hennes fleſh dipped in the foreſayd Oyle, but ye muſt not waſhe your Oyle of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds. After this, you muſt behold and regard the Canker, and if you find it white, take a ſmall yron made at the one ende lyke a Raſor, and at the other end edged and ſharp. And if hir tung be very much ouergrowen with the Canker, ſlit &amp; open it hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomly alongſt the ſide of hir tung, and with your Raſer ſcrape away the whitenes ſoftly which you ſee there. Then take a little Cotton or lint to drie and drinke vp the bloud of hir tung, and ſee that none be left. And if the other ſide of hir tung happen to be ſo too, ſlit it likewiſe: which done, take the iuyce of Mayden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heare, and lay vpon it. And for want of that herbe, take a little bineger, or rather the iuyce of a Lymon which is much better, and waſh hir meate in Oyle till ſhe be throughly recured. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
<hi>Michelin</hi> giueth another remedie which is this. Anoynt wel hir throte and tung with Sirup of Mulberies (otherwiſe called
<hi>Diamoron</hi>) two or three dayes togither, after whiche take of the foreſayd good Oyle: Then take the powder of Brimſton and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:23404:159"/>
of ſugre candie, or of other white ſuger mingled well togither of eche a like, and put a little thereof vpon the Canker: for it you ſhould lay much, it would fret the tung too ſore. And this maner of dealyng is better for a confirmed Canker, than any other. Therfore waſh hyr meate with the oyle aforeſayd, and feede hyr with mutton, or the fleſh of Hennes or pullets.</p>

M. <hi>Amé Caſsian</hi> ſayeth, that to remedie this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, you muſt caſte your hawke gently, &amp; looke vpon the tip of hir tung: and if ye finde hir to haue the pippe, ye muſt ſcoure hir with a pill made of <hi>Agarik</hi> and <hi>Ierapigra,</hi> giuen two or three dayes togither with hir caſting towards night, and that will rid hyr of the rhewme in hyr head, the rather if ſhe be made to tyre againſt the ſunne in the mornings, as is ſayd afore.

To cure your hawke of this diſeaſe, you muſte open hir beake, where you ſhall finde the roofe of hir mouth whytiſh and ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.

The remedie that M. <hi>Amé Caſsian</hi> giues for this euill, is this: The hawkes that are ſo diſeaſed muſt haue the ſayd pilles of Larde, ſuger, and maree of beefe, giuen them euery morning, one or twoo, for foure or fiue dayes ſpace togither, and aboute an houre or two after, feede them with ſome poultrie or mutton drawen through the foreſayd oyle.

               <p>AN other inconuenience befalleth Hawkes by the negligence of ſuch as kepe them: for in their feeding there cleaneth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth ſome peece of fleſh in their iawes or in the roofe of their mouth, or on ſome place or other of their beake, whiche marreth their beakes, ſo as it is enforced to fall away in ſliuers and pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.

               <p>THe chiefe Falconers ſay, that the falling ſickneſſe happeneth too hawkes, through a fumyng heate that aſcendeth vp from the liuer to theyr heads, and maketh them to fal downe vpon the ſuddayne. M. <hi>Mallopin</hi> ſayeth, that to remedie this diſeaſe, the hinder part of their head muſt be pervſed &amp; ſought, where a man ſhall finde two little pittes, whiche muſte be cauterized with a wyer of braſſe. And if that help not, then muſt you cauterize hyr dayntely vpon the head with the foreſayd round yron, or elſe you may hap to kill hir. This done, drie redde Lentils in an ouen, and make them into fine powder: then take the filyng of yron, the fineſt of it, as much of the one as of the other, and mingle the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bothe togither with honie, and make it in little balles of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of a peaze. Then giue your hawke two or three of them, puttyng them as farre into hir gorge as you can, and holde hir vpon your fiſt at the fire or in the ſunne til ſhe haue made a mute or twayne, and let hir haue no meate till noone, and then ſerue hir of a Pigeons wing, dealing ſo with hyr ſeuen or eight dayes togither: In the night let hyr be kepte alwayes abrode, and in the day times in the darke, with water continually before hir.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Amé Caſsyan</hi> teacheth another medicine: that is to wit, that the ſkinne of theyr heades muſte be launced right ouer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynſt the foreſayde pittes, where there are little veynes whiche muſte be taken vp with a ſilke threede, and annoynted ouer with the bloud of a Chicken. Whiche beyng done, ye muſt gyue hir the foreſayde pilles ſeuen or eight dayes togither, takyng good heede that ye ſet hir not neere any other hawkes, and that your hawking gloue be very cleane. For that kynde of diſeaze is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious, and will ſoone paſſe from one hawke to another, by fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding on the gloue whereon another hath bene fedde before.

<pb n="312" facs="tcp:23404:162"/>
(as I ſayd heretofore in the diſeaſes of the head) bicauſe the filthe which they haue gathered in their panels inflameth their Liuer, which doth ſo drie vp the ſubſtance of the guttes, that they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not mute, but muſt needes die of it, if they be not cured. Some ſay that this diſeaſe cometh of giuing them waſht meate whote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be throughly cold, &amp; that is like ynough: for a hawke likes not of water and bloud both togither at once. The ſtone in the fundement cometh of the filthe whiche the hawke ſhoulde mute, which thickeneth &amp; lies bakte at the tuell: by meanes wherof ſhe becomes ſo poore, that ſhe ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not mute or ſlyſe from hyr, &amp; ſo muſt needes die. Yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding I haue often ſeene, that when a Falcon is high and luſtie, ſhe will ſlyſe it out well ynough by meane of hir ſtrength. And ye may perceyue when ſhe hath the ſtone, by that ſhe muteth with peyne &amp; by drops, which is a ſigne that ſhe needeth to ſkowre that matter, whereof the ſtone dothe grow. And when ſhe muteth at twice, &amp; a third time after that, it is a token that the ſtone is throughly confirmed in hyr guttes &amp; panel. Moreouer, when ye ſee that hir tuell is chaſed, &amp; but little droppes from hyr, and that the feathers of hir trayne are much fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with hir muting, and that ſhe is euermore picking with hyr beake about hir tuell, be ye ſure ſhe hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſtone in hir tuell, which we cal the ſtone Craye.

And bycauſe ſhe cannot ridde it, ſhe is in daunger, if ſhe be not lookte too in time. The remedie thereof by the iudgement of M.
<hi>Amé Caſsyan,</hi> is this: take a ſlyce of Larde (or a pellet of Sope, wet in ſalet oyle) of the bigneſſe of a gooſe quill, and an inche long, and put theron the powder of <hi>Aloes cicotrine:</hi> which done, caſt your Hawke handſomly, and conuey it into hir tuell as ye woulde giue a man a ſuppoſitorie: and if the Larde be too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſofte to handle, ſticke it vpon a Hennes feather, ſo as the feather appeare not through the Larde (for ſo may yee do hir greate harme with the feather) and ſo conuey it vp into hyr tuell, drawyng away the feather gently, and leauing the Larde behind, and haue ſnayles in a readineſſe to giue hir immediatly
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:23404:162"/>
after ye haue applied the ſayde deuiſe. And for lacke of Snayles, giue hir the forementioned pyll of Lard, mingled with marrow and ſuger, and ſet hir in the Sunne, or by a fire, without feeding of hir till one houre after noone. And if ſhe indure well to be by the fire, or in the Sunne, let hir alone, for the heate is very good for hir. After this, giue hir ſomewhat more than halfe a gorge of a yong pullet, or if ye can come by any Myce or Rats, nothing is better. But let hir not ſtand in the ayre or in the wynde, except the weather be fayre and warme. At night when ſhe hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed well, giue hir foure or fiue cloues of Mace broken, and lapped vp in a little cotton, or in the ſkynne of a Henne: and do ſo three or foure dayes, ſauing the ſuppoſitorie or pellet afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayde, for it will ſerue twice well ynough. And thus ſhall you ſkoure your hawke throughly. Looke well to it, that ſhe caſt not vp the cloues of Mace, for they be ſingular good for hawkes in all reſpectes, ſpecially for all humors that ſurcharge their heades, and generally for all Filanders and wormes. And if you mynd to rid a Falcon cleane of the Cray, and of the ſayde diſeaſe: giue hir meate ſteeped in Goates mylke, or in other mylke, and do ſo foure or fiue dayes together: for the ſayde mylke is verie good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Cray. In the booke of the Prince, there is another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyt, for this diſeaſe of the Cray or ſtone. That is to wit: Take the gall of a Pigge of three weekes old, and conuey it into your hawkes beake, ſo as ſhe maye take it and ſwallowe it downe whole without breaking, and take heede that ſhe caſt vp none of it againe. Afterwardes, giue hir a little piece of the Pigges fleſhe, of the bigneſſe of a Beane, and let hir ſtande emptiepan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neld vpon the ſame vntill night, ſetting hir in the Sunne or by the fire. This medicine is verie good for all byrdes of praye that are encombred with the Craye or Stone. Neuertheleſſe, if a Goſſehawke or a Sparrowhawke haue that diſeaſe (ſo it be not too ſore) giue it hir nor more but once. But as for other hawkes that are of ſtronger mettel, ye maye giue it them thrice. And when euening is come, feede your hawke with a pullet, or with mutton, or with ſmall birdes, and the nexte morning ſteepe hyr meate in Goates mylke, or womans mylke, feeding hir ſo three
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:23404:163"/>
dayes together with ſmall gorges, and ſhe ſhall be ſounde. And if you will not or can not vſe the ſayde Receypt, ye may take a little oyle Olyf, and ſomewhat leſſe Honnye, and wette your hawkes meate therewith, for it is good to helpe that diſeaſe. Some put the ſayde things into a Hennes gut tyde faſt at both endes, bycauſe a hawke will take it the better: and naturally ſhe likes not oyle with hir meate.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Michelin</hi> ſets downe another medicine which is this. Take Larde, marow of beefe, Suger clarified and once boyled, and Saffron in pouder, or eache a like quantitie, prouided that the Lard be firſt ſtieped in vineger four and twentie houres, and the water ſhifted three or foure times, and ſet abroad in the open ayre. Of the which things confected together, ye muſt make pylles of the bygneſſe of a Beane, whereof you ſhall giue your hawke one or two, ſetting hir in the Sun or by the fire, and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding hir with poultrie or with mutton, allowing hir but reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable gorges, foure or fiue days together, &amp; giuing hir Maces as afore: for they can not but do the hawke great pleaſure in euery condition and part. Maſter <hi>Michelin</hi> teacheth another receipte for this diſeaſe, ſpecially for Goſſehawkes and Sparowhawkes, which I haue tryed ofte.</p>
               <p>Cut a Sheepes hart in ſmall pieces, and when ye haue let it lye ſtieping all night in Aſſes mylke, Gotes mylke, or womans mylke, put a little boylde Suger into the milke, and gorge your hawke reaſonably therwith three days together. And aſſure your ſelfe, that this medicine is very excellent for the Cray, &amp; without danger for all manner of hawkes. M. <hi>Martine</hi> ſayth in auouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this matter, that when a hawke cannot well mute with hir eaſe, it betokeneth &amp; plainely ſheweth that ſhe hath the ſtone Cray. For remedy wherof, take the heart of a Hog, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of his ſewet minced very ſmall, and make them into pouder togither, &amp; giue it the hawke in hir meate three days ſucceſſiuely.</p>
               <p>Againe, I haue ſeene ſome take the white of an egge, or the whole egge, with a little Saffron in pouder, well coyled and beaten together, which being beſtowed vpon the hawkes meate, hath cured hir.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:23404:163"/>
                  <hi>Mallopin</hi> ſets downe yet one other receit more. Put the iuice of (water Creſſyes) in a Hennes gut of one inche long, tyed at both ends, and force your hawk to receiue it. Which done, ſet hir in the Sunne or by the fire, and feede hir not till noone, at which time giue hir but halfe a gorge of hote meate, bicauſe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, which hath ſet al hir body out of temper. Let this he done two or three dayes, and if you find the medicine to haue ſcowred and take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much at the firſt of your hawke, giue hir leſſe and leſſe, and ſo ſhall ſhe recouer. The booke of Princes ſetteth downe yet one other remedie for the ſame diſeaſe, that ye might put it in vre whiche ſoeuer liked you beſte. Take a penny weight of Perſley ſeede, as much of Smallage ſeede, a dramme of boylde Suger, a penny weight of Staueſaker, of Wheaten branne one dram, and halfe the ſhell of an egge. Put them altogether into a good large pſnet full of water, and ſeethe it till it be conſumed to the one halfe, and then ſtreine it through a cloth. Then take of
<hi>Caſsia Fiſtula</hi> one dramme, and of <hi>Turbith</hi> one penny weight, of
<hi>Hermodactils</hi> two pennye weight, and of <hi>Aloes Cicotrine</hi> three penny weight. Beate all theſe into fine pouder, &amp; put them into the water, wherein the other mixture was boyled, and make thereof a Clyſter in the bladder of a Pygge.</p>
               <p>Then take a great quyll of a Gooſe or of ſome other byrde, and thereof make the necke of your Clyſterbagge faſt tyed to the bagge, that nothing maye iſſue out of it, and ſo giue your hawke the Clyſter, as you haue ſeene it giuen to men at theyr neede. This done, ſet your hawke in the Sunne or by the fire, and keepe hir emptie till noone, at which time giue hir a pullets legge, and ſo ſhe ſhall recouer no doubt.</p>

               <p>THe chiefe Falconers ſay, that all hawkes haue the Filanders at al times, &amp; are neuer w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out them, like as it is ſaide that no

horſe is without the Bottes. There are foure kyndes of Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and one other kynde of Filanders, of which I will ſpeake hereafter in their due places. And with all theſe ſortes of Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſome hawkes are more peſtered than other ſome. The cauſe of them is eyther their feeding on groſſe and foule meates, which ingender &amp; increaſe thoſe Fila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders in them, or elſe for that infly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> field, or the riuer, they breake ſome ſmal veines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their bodies, at the encounter, by ſeazing too violently vpon their praye. By reaſon whereof the bloud burſteth out into their bowels, and there dryeth and clottereth, whereof breede the ſayd Filanders in great aboundance. Afterwarde by reaſon of the ſtinch of the ſayde bloud ſo clottered and bakte, being corrupted and putrified in the bulke bycauſe it is out of the proper veſſels and vaynes where it ought to be, the Filanders runne about ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the cleaneſt places of the bodie, to ſhunne the ſayd noyſyme ſtinche, and creepe vp either into the hawkes heart, or into hir gorge, ſo as ſhe dyeth of it. Againe, ſome men ſaye, that their hawkes dye of the diſeaſes of the heade, or of the Craye, when in deede they dye of the Filanders or (which is worſſe) of the (<hi>Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnilles</hi>) a kinde of Filanders for whiche we want an engliſhe terme. I wil ſpeake firſt of thoſe Filanders that craule vp to the hawkes gorges, and from thence to the holes in their palates whereat the hawkes do breathe, and by them into their braynes, wherby they be in danger of death. Ye may perceiue this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience in the gorge by this, that when you haue fedde your hawke, the Filanders feeling the ſweetneſſe and taſt of the fleſh, doe ſtyrre and craule about in ſuche wiſe, as you ſhall ſee your hawke oftentimes gape. By reaſon wherof it commeth to paſſe that nowe and then ſhe caſteth hir gorge. Againe, ye may know by this, that your hawke will be ſtrayning at them with hir ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons. Therefore caſt hir gently, and looke into hir throate, and you ſhall ſee them crawling there. To kill the ſayde Filanders, maſter <hi>Amé Caſsyan</hi> ſayth thus: take a great Radyſh roote, and make a hole in it, and fill it with water, and ſet it in embers ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie hote, putting freſh embers to it continually by the ſpace of halfe an houre or more, till it be throughly well boyled, and as

This done, put the quantitie of a Peaze of Saffron made into pouder into the ſayde water, and waſhe your hawkes meate therewith when yee feede hir, and giue hir but halfe a gorge. And if ſhe will not feede on it, let hir be kept emptie, till ſhe be verye greedie and eger: doe thus to hir three or foure dayes together, and you ſhall kyll the Filanders, and make your hawke ſounde.</p>

               <p>THe inflamation of the Liuer happeneth ſometymes through the negligence of ſuch as haue the keeping of Hawkes. For they feede them with groſſe and naughtie fleſhe, ſuch as is ſtale and ſtinking, without making of it cleane, by meanes whereof proceedeth the ſayde inflamation of the Liuer. Alſo it happeneth for want of bathing when neede is, and for lacke of water, which they ought to haue, or with ouerfleeing of them, when they bee emptie panneld. Ye ſhall perceyue this diſeaſe by theyr feete: for they will be chafed, and the colour of their chappes will be chaunged, and looke whitiſhe through the heate of their Liuer. And if yee finde hir tongue ſcorched and ſcalded blacke, it is a ſigne of death. To remedie this miſchiefe, make the medicine of Snayles ſteeped in Aſſes milk, or Gotes milke mentioned in the Chapters of the diſeaſes of the heade, and of the ſtone: and giue your Hawkes of it three or foure days in the mornings. And if ye cannot get that medicine, ye may vſe the other that is made of Lard, Marrow of beef, and of boyled Suger, with a little Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, foure or fiue dayes togither euery morning, as is ſayde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. For the ſcouring of hir will ridde and abate hir heate. And all that while for ſeuen or eight dayes, feede hir with poultrie, or with mutton, ſteeped in milke: for milke is verie good for the heate of the Liuer. And you muſt beware you feede hir not with

Pigeon, nor with other groſſe fleſhe, for breeding hir to inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate heate. Maſter <hi>Amé Caſsian</hi> ſayth yet further, that to allay the ſayd heate in Hawkes, it is very good to ſteepe or wet theyr meate in Endiue, or Nightſhade water: and likewiſe in white whey newly and lately made. And that this maner of feeding muſt be continued foure or fiue dayes, till the Hawke be well ſcoured. And that if the hawke haue a deſire to bowze the ſayde whey, ye muſt let hir take hir fill. Maſter <hi>Amé Caſsian</hi> ſayeth moreouer, that when your medicine hath ſcoured your hawke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the maner, and hir tongue is not aught in the better tune, ye muſt take oyle Olife waſht in two or three waters, and bath hir tung &amp; throte therwith with a feather, three or foure times in the day, for foure or fiue dayes togither, and gently ſcrape hir tung and throte with a deuiſe of ſiluer, or of other mettal for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. And although ſhee neither can feede nor will, yet ſhee muſt not be giuen ouer, but haue meat gently conueyed into hir gorge by ſmall morſels, and thruſt downe lowe ynough with a fine ſticke, that ſhe may take it: for ſhe cannot ſwallowe hir meate by reaſon of the ſwelling of hir tung, and therefore ſhe muſt bee aſſiſted in maner aforeſayde.

And the next morning take the ſeedes of Ruſhes, and the ſcrapings of Iuorie, and the dung of Sparrowes, of eche two pennie weight, and make therof a powder, and ſeaſon your Hawkes meat therwith, and it will pleaſure hir.

               <p>BYcauſe many menned ſpeake of the diſeaſe of the Pantas dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſely, and yet knowe not what it is: I will ſhewe three maner of Pantaſes wherewith Hawkes are diſeaſed. The firſt in the gorge, the ſeconde commeth of colde, and the thirde is in the reynes and kidneys. The firſt kinde of Pantas commeth of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vpon the perche, or vpon the fyſt of him that beareth them, by meanes whereof ſome little veynes of the Liuer breake, and the bloud poureth out vppon the Liuer, which dryeth and clod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth into ſmall flakes, and thoſe ryſing vp afterwarde when the Hawke bateth agayne, doe ſtoppe the paſſages and windepype, and thereof commeth the Pantas. And ſometyme when the Hawke bateth, thoſe flakes doe ſo aſcende into hir throte, and lie ouerthwart it, that ſhee preſently falleth downe deade: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuche that ſome holde opinion it is the Pantas that maketh Hawkes to dye ſodenly. For proofe whereof, open your hawke when ſhee is deade, and yee ſhall finde this maladie in hir throte.

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:23404:168"/>
neither by hir throte nor otherwiſe. For the diſeaſe holdeth hir in the verie windepipe, whereby the breath paſſeth in and out. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe his counſell is to cloze vp the Hawke in ſome conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Chamber, with Lattis windowes, ſo as ſhee may not get out, and to ſet hir two or three perches, that ſhee may flee from one to another, and haue the Sunne ſhine in vpon hir if it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and ſhe muſt haue alwayes water by hir. And when yee feede hir, hir meate muſt be cut in ſmall pellets, and haue ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feather nor bone in it, leaſt ſhe ſtreyne hirſelfe in tyring, and ſhe muſt haue but halfe a gorge at once, and but once in a day.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine this diſeaſe commeth by ſtanding where ſmoke or duſt may annoy them. And ye ſhall knowe the Pantas, by your Hawkes panting, for that ſhee cannot drawe hir breath as ſhee ſhould do. <hi>Mallopin</hi> ſayth that to remedie this diſeaſe, ye muſte take the filings of yron, and meale of Lentils, of eche like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie, which you muſt temper togither with honie till it bee lyke paaſte, that ye may make it in little balles as bigge as a peaze.

               <p>Maſter <hi>Michelin</hi> giueth this medicine following: Take Maydenheare, which groweth lightly at the heades of pondes and pittes, and therewithall the rootes of Perſley, the rootes of Smallage. Of all theſe take like portions, and boyle them in a good bigge pot that is newe. Then ſtreyne the water through a Colander, and put thereto a quantitie of clarified Suger, with a

little marrow of Beefe, and ſtirre them all togither, and thereof giue your Hawke a portion in the morning, and as much at E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, with a ſmall tunnel, or otherwiſe with a ſpoone or other fitte deuice foure or fiue dayes togither, and let hir not feede till noone be paſt, then giue hir of Pullettes fleſhe without bloud, dipped in Oyle of ſweete Almondes, or Oyle Olife waſht in two or three waters: and when ye haue ſo ſowſt hir meate, let it alſo bee ſeaſoned with a little Saffron and Suger.

               <p>IT happeneth ſometymes that when a Hawke hath bene reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered of ſome great greefe by good keeping and intendance, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde ſhe waxeth euill againe, and falleth to panting, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of breedeth this diſeaſe of the reynes and kidneys, in maner of a Canker, as bigge as a beane, which ſwelleth bigger and bigger, in ſuch wiſe, that ſhee falleth to caſting ſome part of hir meate. This Pantas differeth muche from both the other: for it will leaue hir ſeuen or eight dayes, &amp; then vexe hir again more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And ſomtymes it will take hir but from Moneth to Moneth, ſo as ſhee ſhall beare it oute a whole yeare.

The Hawke that hath that diſeaſe is alwayes greedie to feede, inſomuch that when ye haue giuen hir a great gorge in the morning, ſhee will haue indewed it out of hande, and if ye giue hir another at Noone, ſhee will put it ouer by and by, and if yee giue hir the thirde at night, ſhee will diſpatch that quickly alſo, and the more ſhee feedeth, the more greedie and nippie ſhee is. This diſeaſe commeth of this, that when your Hawke is verie poore and lowe in ſtate, and you deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to ſet hir vp quickly, thinking to bring hir in good plight with great gorges, you feed hir with Pigeons and other fleſhe, which ſhe cannot indew, by reaſon of hir pouertie &amp; weakneſſe, for want of heate in the liuer: the heate whereof is the cauſe of all kindly digeſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; indewing.

               <p>Maiſter <hi>Mallopin</hi> in his booke of the Prince, ſayeth that for remedie of this diſeaſe, yee muſte ſtiepe a ſheepes heart cutte in ſmall peeces all one night in Aſſes milke or Goates milke, and the next day giue your hawke a quarter of it in the morning for hir beaching, as much at noone, and the reſt at night, forcing hir to receyue as much of the milke as ye can, and continue it fiue or ſix dayes togither, till yee ſee hir mute kindely.

               <head>Of the Teynte in a Hawkes feather, and hovve many kindes of it there be.</head>
               <p>HItherto ye haue read of the inwarde diſeaſes of Hawkes: Nowe I will tell you of the outwarde accidentes: and firſt will ſpeake of the Teynte, whiche the Frenche Falconers call
<hi>Taigne,</hi> the Italians, <hi>Zignuole</hi> and <hi>Tarmae,</hi> whereof there are three ſortes. The firſt is when theyr principalles or long fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers beginne to droppe off, by meanes whereof many Hawkes are marred and caſt awaye, without knowledge howe to helpe it. Maiſter <hi>Amé Caſsian</hi> ſayeth, that this commeth ſomety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the Lyuer, and of the exceſſiue heate of the bodye, by meanes whereof ſmall pymples ryſe vppon theyr wings, or on their traynes, whiche afterwarde cauſe theyr feathers to droppe off, and when they are gone, the holes where they ſtoode doe cloze agayne, wherethrough the Hawke doeth periſhe, if ſhee bee not remedyed. This diſeaſe is contagious, and one of them will take it of an other, and therefore yee muſte not let the Hawke that is affected with it, ſtande neare a Hawke that is ſounde, neyther muſt you touche or feede a ſounde Hawke on the Gloue whereon a ſicke Hawke hath beende fedde. And yee ſhall knowe that ſhee hath that diſeaſe, by hir often picking with hir beake vppon hir principall feathers of hir wings and trayne, and by theyr dropping awaye. Therefore caſt your Hawke, and let hir bee well peruſed, and yee ſhall fynde the ſayde diſeaſe. For remedie whereof, Maiſter <hi>Martin,</hi> and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:23404:171"/>
Maiſter <hi>Caſsian</hi> ſay, you muſt caſt your Hawke, and when you haue ſound the ſmall pimple whence the feather dropt firſt, you muſte get a little ſticke of Firre, whiche is by nature gummie and fatte, make a little pegge of it, not ſharpe at the foreende, nor thruſte it in with violence, but ſoftly as you may. And if ye can get none of that Woodde, then take a grayne of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, and cutte of the forepoynt of it, and annoynt it with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Triacle, or Oyle Olife, and conuey it into the hole, ſo as it may ſticke a little out, and the hole not cloze togyther, and ſtoppe agayne. Then with a ſmall Launce or Penknife you muſte ſlitte the pimple, and let out the redde water which you ſhall finde there. After this take <hi>Aloes Cicotrine</hi> in powder, and put it into the gall of an Oxe, coyled in a diſhe, and with thoſe two mingled togyther, annoynt the ſlitte rounde aboute: and beware that there come nothing in the hole where the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grewe, for it mighte doe the Hawke great harme. This done, take of the reddeſt Lentilles that you can come by, and leſſe than halfe ſo muche of the fylings of yron, and mingle them togyther with Honie, and thereof make Pilles as bigge as a Peaze, and giue your Hawke two or three of them euerye Morning. Then ſet hir by a fyre, or in the Sunne, and after Noone giue hir a reaſonable good gorge of a Pullet, or of Mutton, and if yee lyſt yee maye giue hir of thoſe Pilles towardes the Euening alſo. Let hir meate bee ſtieped in milke as is ſayde heeretofore, fiue or ſixe dayes togyther, and looke alwayes to the incyſions that yee made, and ſhee ſhall bee recouered.</p>
               <p>An other remedye <hi>Martin</hi> gyueth for the ſame diſeaſe. Annoynt the place wyth ſome good Bawlme where the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers fell awaye, and the Teynte will dye out of hande, and freſhe feathers ſupplie the place agayne. And hee ſayeth more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that you muſte take the powder of Petre of Alexandria whiche is ſolde at the Potecaryes, and mingle it with Vineger, and annoynt the diſeaſed place with it three or foure tymes, and it will be whole.</p>
               <p>The ſeconde kinde of Teynte whiche fretteth the principals
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:23404:171"/>
of a Hawke to the verie Quill, commeth (as the cheefe Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners affirme) of ill keeping, when they haue not their due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, beeing neyther bathed nor ſcoured, nor kept in whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome places. And therefore we are forbid to keepe a Hawke in a ſluttiſhe corner. Againe, ſometymes both in the mew and out of the mewe it happeneth that by feeding them with filthie and lothſome fleſhe, they become full of filth both within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, whereof breedeth ſuche a ſort of Wormes, as doe vtterlye frette aſunder and marre their feathers. The three chiefe Falco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſay, that for this ſeconde Teynt which fretteth the feathers of a Hawke, in ſort that they become like ſtickes, yee muſt take vine ſhredds, and make therof as ſtrong Lie as ye can, and waſh your Hawke once a day with it throughly: and when ſhe is weathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe, annoint all hir feathers with honie out of the combe. Then make powder of <hi>Sanguis Draconis,</hi> and Roch Alom verie ſmall, and powder the foreſaid Quils therwith, and your hawke ſhalbe recured. Or elſe take a Mole of that ſort which breedeth in Medowes, and put hir in a new earthen pot well couered and ſtopped, and ſet it on the fire one whole day: which done, take hir out againe as ſhe is, and make hir into powder very ſmall. And when ye haue bathed your Hawkes feathers throughly with the ſayd Lee, by and by beſtrow hir feathers with the powder of the Mole a certaine time togither, and it will pleaſure hir.</p>
               <p>The thirde kind of Teynt is knowne in Hawkes by the ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of their principal feathers throughout alongſt the vpper ſide of the webbe of them. And that happeneth commonly for want of cleane feeding, and due attendance. To remedie this, <hi>Mallo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> ſayth, that ye muſt take a greene Reede, and cleaue it all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longſt, and ſcrape oute the pithe of it, and wring oute of it as muche iuyce as yee can, wherewith you muſte moyſten the ſayde ryuen feathers all alongeſt the ryftes of them, and they will cloſe and ſhette againe as before. And if anye feather hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be dropt awaye, let a tente made of Fyrre or of a grayne of Barlye as is ſayde heeretofore bee put into the hole of it, and vſe it after the foreſayde manner, and a newe feather will growe againe out of hande. If this deuiſe to cauſe a feather
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:23404:172"/>
to growe againe be not to your liking, you ſhall in this collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finde ſuch as may content you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin</hi> giueth another Medicine and aduice for the ſame, which is this: Take twopennie weight of Orpiment, and nine graynes of Pepper, and make it into powder, and caſt it vpon hir meate, which muſt be reaſonable warme. Againe, take three ſlices of Bacon, of that which is neareſt the ſkinne, and let them bee ſo ſmal as your hawke may ſwallow them with eaſe: ſawce them with a little honie, and ſtrew of the powder of the filings of yron vpon the honie, and giue your hawke thereof three dayes togither. After which time take a yong Chicken, and before yee boyle it in wine, brooſe the breaſt of it, and open it with a ſharpe knife or other inſtrument, that the bloud may follow. Then feed hir with the ſayd Pullets fleſh warme, ſteeped in Goates milke, or other milke. Practiſe this two or three dayes, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde therevpon giue hir good warme meate, and ſhee ſhall recouer.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Hawke that indeweth not, ne putteth ouer as ſhe ſhould doe.</head>
               <p>IT falleth out ſometimes that a Hawke cannot well indew nor put ouer hir meate as ſhe ſhould doe, and that is onely bycauſe ſhe is foule within, or hath taken ſome ſurfeyt, or elſe that when ſhe was low and poore, hir keeper being deſirous to ſet hir vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to haſhly, gaue hir to great gorges, which ſhe by reaſon of hir weakneſſe was not able to put ouer and indewe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through ſhee ſurfetted and forwent hir appetite of feeding alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gither. For remedie hereof, <hi>Mallopin</hi> ſayeth ye muſt feede hir with light meates, and little at once, as with yong Rattes and Mice, or with great Rattes, for there is more ſubſtaunce in them than in the other, whereof yee muſte giue hir but halfe gorges, that ſhee maye the ſooner indewe them, and put them ouer. Or elſe feede hir wyth Chicken, or Mutton dipped in Goates milke, or otherwyſe. And for wante of thoſe, take the yolke of an Egge, and giue hir a quarter of a gorge thereof,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:23404:172"/>
and when ye feede hir with the fleſh of any liue byrde or fowle, ſteepe it well in the bloud of the ſame fowle, and it will doe hir much good. So ſhall your Hawke mount of hir fleſh apace: if beſides that, you doe alſo ſcoure hir with pilles made of Larde, Marow of beefe, Suger, and Saffron three mornings togither, and two houres after giue hir a reaſonable gorge.</p>
               <p>Another receyt which maſter <hi>Michelin</hi> giueth, ſaying. When a Hawke indewes not hir meate, ne putteth it ouer as ſhe ought to doe, but hath ſurfeyted and wanteth naturall heate: Take verie pure white wine, and ſteepe hir meate in it luke warme, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it hir by little &amp; little oft tymes in the day, alwayes chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging hir meate, and ſee that it be light of digeſtion. Doe thus to hir till ſhe be in better tune againe, giuing hir fiue or ſixe cloues of Maces in the Euening wrapped in a little cotton, or in ſome other ſuch like deuice: for that will warme hir head, &amp; all hir other partes verie well, and let the Cotton bee dipped in odoriferous olde wine.</p>

               <p>ANother miſchiefe is wont ſomtymes to light vpon Hawkes, namely that by taking ouergreat gorges, they can neyther indewe nor caſt it againe, and alſo that many tymes a Hawke ſoareth away with hir pray, and feedeth ſo greedily vpon it by reaſon ſhe was kept ouereager and ſharp, that ſhe can neither get it vp nor downe, and thervpon falleth in danger of death.

               <p>Maſter <hi>Caſsian</hi> ſayeth that for remedie thereof, ye muſt ſet cleane water in a veſſell before your Hawke, and let hir bowze thereof at hir pleaſure.

               <p>MAny tymes it commeth to paſſe that when a Hawke hath fedde, ſhe cannot keepe hir meate but falleth to caſting, as ſoone as ſhee hath receyued it. This commeth of feeding hir with groſſe, foule, and vnholeſome meate not waſhed: or elſe for that ſhe is foule in the panell, and ſo cannot indew by reaſon of the great ſtore of filth that is within hir. Therefore ye muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that ye cut not hir meate with a foule knife, or with a knife that hath cut Onions, Leeks, Chibbols, or ſuch other like things. To remedie this inconuenience, giue not your Hawke greate gorges. And to bring hir well in tune againe, ſcoure hir with the forementioned pilles of Larde, Marrow, Suger, and Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron, by the ſpace of three dayes. And aboue all things, let not the Hawke that hath caſt hir gorge be fedde a good ſpace after it, but let hir ſtande emptie in the Sunne with water before hir to bowſe at hir pleaſure, for that will doe hir muche good.

               <p>A Hawke doth ſometyme loſe hir appetite of feeding by ſome miſfortune, as by taking to greate gorges towardes Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, whiche ſhe can not well indewe, bycauſe the nyghtes are colder than the dayes.

               <p>Maſter <hi>Amé Caſsian</hi>ſayth, that for the ſame diſeaſe, when you perceyue it, you muſt giue your Hawke a liue Stockedone, allowing hir leaue to ſeaze and tire vpon it, and to take the bloud of it at hir pleaſure.

               <head>When Hawkes are low brought, a remedie.</head>
               <p>IT happeneth ſometymes that Hawkes are brought ſo lowe, that a man ſhall haue much a doe to ſet them vp againe. And that commeth through the fault of vnſkilfull keepers, rather than any other thing. For ſome giue them yll meate, colde and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſhed.

Againe ſometymes it happeneth that a Hawke ſoares awaye, and is loſt foure or fiue dayes, and ſo becommes poore for want of pray. Maſter <hi>Caſsian</hi> ſayth, that if ye will ſet hir vp againe, ye muſt feede hir a little at once and with good meate, ſuch as Rattes and Mice are, for they
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:23404:174"/>
they be lyght of digeſtion, or elſe with ſmall birdes, which are good likewiſe, and of great nouriſhment. Pultrie alſo is good, but it nouriſheth not ſo muche of his owne nature, as Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton doth.</p>
               <p>Againe ye may ſet hir vp, (when ſhe is low) in this maner folowing.

hir feete to the end of your cure. And to remedy the ſame, <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopin</hi> in his Booke of the Prince ſayth, that when a Hawke is gowty or hath the pin on hir feete, ye muſt take of Rew three ownces, of Barberies three ownces, of Colewort leaues three ownces, of Oyle of Violets a reaſonable quantitie, of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine two ownces, of Sheepes ſewet as much ſhall ſerue, of the fatte of a yong Pullet one ownce and a halfe, of Virgin waxe one ownce, of Maſticke one ownce, of white Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence one ownce, of Opopanax one ownce, and of Alome two ownces.

And if the pin open not of it ſelfe, ſlit it and open it with a little ſharp launce of ſteele made whot, then clenze the filthie matter and quitture, and ſo ſhall your Hawke recouer aſſuredly.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Caſsian</hi> ſetteth downe another good and wel tried receyte for the ſame, which is this: Take a quantitie of Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentine, halfe as much white Sope, making the Sope into powder. That done, make aſſhes of vineſhreddes, and take therof ſomewhat leſſe than of the powder of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sope.

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:23404:179"/>
the pin open of it ſelfe it is better. After this, you muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie another plaiſter of <hi>Diaculum magnum,</hi> whiche you ſhall find at the Apoticaries: for it is a great drawer, and if it haue any dead fleſh in it, lay a little Verdegrece to it, for that is a corroſiue, and a fretter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Martin</hi> ſayeth, that to ſoften the pinne on the Hawkes foote and to make it growe to a head, yee muſte take the rootes of Flower deluce, which beares the blewe leafe, drie it and beate it into powder, and make thereof a Salue with honie of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and lay it to the pinne till it be throughly whole.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Caſsian</hi> ſayth further, that if your Hawkes feete bee chafed and fall to ſwelling, take the fyling of yron beaten into powder, to the mountenaunce of a beane or twayne, and the quantitie of a beane of a gad of ſteele fyled into powder, and twice as much of the barke of an Oke as of the fyling of yron, of which barke of the Oke, you muſt take away the vttermoſt part, and of the reſt make fine powder, ſerced through a cloth. When yee haue mingled all theſe powders togither, boyle them in a new potte with a potle of good vineger, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of a third part. Then let it ſettle, and put the cleereſt of it alone by it ſelfe, and the groundes of it alſo by it ſelfe in a long narrow bagge, that the Hawke may reſt both hir feete vpon it. And with the water ye may vſe to bath hir feete euery day three or foure times aday.

And when there hapneth any rupture, take Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peeter and Alome, of each two penny weight, making it into powder, beſtowe it vpon the broken place to fret the dead fleſh away, for this is a good corroſiue for that purpoſe.</p>

Wherefore Maſter <hi>Michelin</hi> ſayth that when ye intend to caſt your Hawke into the mewe, ye muſt make three pittes of the bignes of a beane, of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayd mxture of Larde, Marowe, Suger, and Saffron, which you may giue hir three mornings togither, not feeding hir in two houres after, but ſuffring hir to gleame.

ſome good fleſh and reaſonable gorge, ſetting hir all the while at the fire, or in the Sunne. And for other three mornings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, you muſt giue hir the mountenance of a beane of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes Cicotrine when ſhe hath caſt, keeping hir likewiſe by the fire or in the Sunne, and ſhe will caſt the Aloes with groſſe ſlime and filthy ſtuffe.

               <p>Maſter <hi>Amé Caſsian</hi> ſayth that for the ſame purpoſe ye muſt conuey the quantitie of halfe a hazel nutte of <hi>Ierapigra</hi> into a hennes gutte, knitte faſt at both ends, and force it into your Falcons throte, holding hir on the fiſt by the fire or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun, till ſhe haue ſkowred, and ſo keepe hir emptie and voyde till noone, at what time ſhee muſte be allowed of ſome good hote meate a reaſonable gorge: the next morrow feede hir well and after thoſe two dayes caſt hir into the mew without any moe ceremonies or circumſtance.</p>

Truely I am of his opinion, and ſo doe perſwade you, that will mewe youre Hawkes in good order: for haſte in that caſe, maketh waſte, as in all other things.</p>
               <p>The beſt thing that you may do, when you meane to caſte hir into the mew, is firſt, to ſkowre hir well, after that manner that I haue ſhewed you in this booke, to cope hir well, and to ſet hir vp in fleſh before you caſt hir into the mew, to diſcharge hir of al diſeaſe as neare as you can, to rid hir of mites &amp; lice, being once in the mew, to ſet hir water ſometimes, to feede hir with liquide and laxatiue meates now and then, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit none of thoſe inſtructions, which I haue collected for you out of the Italian Falconers: for they are very good obſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

               <p>But in the French man <hi>Artelowch,</hi> I finde one neceſſarye note for a Haggart, which is this.</p>
               <p>The Haggart (ſaith he) is not to be caſt looſe into the mew, but to be mewed on the fiſte, for otherwiſe ſhe woulde become too coye and ſtrange, and if ſhe fall to bating and beating hir ſelfe for heate, then muſt you hood hir vp, or beſpowte hir with colde water, the nexte way to make hir leaue bating. Thus muſt you continue hir on the fiſte, till ſhe begin to ſhed hir fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, then ſhall it bee good to ſet hir downe, and tie hir to a ſtone, or pearch, as you do the reſt. And after ſhe hath mewed, and commes to flee, then if you let hir ſtand on a blocke, or bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, caſed and rolled with cloth, you ſhall do very well.</p>
               <p>Goſhawkes, Tiercels, &amp; Sparowhawkes, muſt be mewed as Falcons, ſaue that they wil not be borne on the fiſte, but be at libertie in the mewe, and very clenly ſerued.</p>
               <p>Before you draw your Hawke out of the mewe, fifteene or twenty dayes, you muſt begin to bate hir of hir diet, the ſooner and better to enſeame hir, by reſtraint of hir ful feeding, which ſhe had before, for otherwiſe, there woulde followe ſurfet and repletion, than which there is no more daungerous euill.</p>
               <p>It is no ſlender part of ſkill, ſo to vſe a Hawke in the mew, as ſhe may bee quitte of all miſhappes, that befall hir in the mewe, if ſhe bee not well attended and regarded, during the time ſhe is in the mew.</p>

Choppe ten or twelue of thoſe kernelles very ſmall and giue them to your Hawke with hir meate, finding the meanes, by ſome way or other, that ſhe may receyue them and put them ouer.

Alſo take of the Snayles that lie in running ſtreames, gyue your Hawke of them in the morning: for that wil both ſcowre hir and nouriſh hir greatly, and ſetteth hir vp, and maketh hir to mewe apace. Maſter <hi>Michelin,</hi> in his Booke of the King of Cypres, ſayth thus: Cut an adder in two partes and ſeeth him in water, and with that water and wheate togither fede your Pullets, Pigeons, Turtles, and other birds which you intende to allow your Hawkes that are ſlacke to mewe, and ſoone af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they ſhall mewe their feathers apace.</p>
               <p>Maſter <hi>Caſsian</hi> ſayth, that when a Falcon will not mewe, ye muſt take of Backes, otherwiſe called Reremice, and drie them ſo at the fire or in an Ouen, as yee may make them into powder, which you muſt beſtow vpon your Hawkes meate. Alſo take little ſucking whelpes, and feede your Hawke with the fleſh of them, ſteeped in the milke or renet, whiche you ſhall find in the mawes of them: afterward ſhred the mawe it ſelfe

ye muſt waſh hir meate, feeding hir therwith by little &amp; little, and allow hir ſuch fleſh as is laxatiue, that ſhee may haue the leſſe ioy to keepe it long, or ſtand vpon it, and to the end ſhe be not proude or ouerhaught of hir drawing out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mew. And therewithall ſhee muſt be dayly plyed and borne on the fiſte. Within few dayes after ſhe is thus drawen, ye muſt ſkowre hir and enſayme hir with the foreſayd medicine of Lard, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Maree, and Saffron, with a very little Aloes: for if ye co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

               <p>Maſter <hi>Caſsian</hi> ſayth that ſome Falconers, after they haue enſaymed their hawkes in maner aforeſaid, three or four days before they intend to flee, do giue them a pill of the bigneſſe of a beane, made in maner following. They vſe to take a little Larde, with the powder of Pepper, and aſſhes fifted and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, of each alike much, and make therof a ball, &amp; conuey it into the hawkes beake, ſo as they inforce hir to take it down, if ſhe wil not otherwiſe. Which done, they hold hir hooded by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fire or in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sunne, making hir to keepe the pill as long as they can, &amp; afterward do let hir caſt it at hir pleaſure. By this meane yee ſhall ſet y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſhe wil caſt groſſe and flegmaticke humors, wherby hir panell and bowels will be diſcharged of much glit, and ſhe become ſound and cheereful, and ready to flee hir pray. And an houre or twayne after this, they feede hir with a liue chicken: for ye muſt note, that the pill which ſhe hath receyued, hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered hir very much. Neuertheleſſe I muſt giue you war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that you muſt not ſo deale with a poore and low hawke, as ye would with a hawke that is high and in pride. In doing after this maner, your Hawke ſhall be luſtie, and enioy hir all the yeare after. For hardly ſhal y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hawke do hir parte in fleeing that yeare, whiche is not well ſkowred, &amp; carefully enſaymed.</p>

And if ye minde to keepe your Hawke from the wormes and the Filanders, giue hir the mountenaunce of a peaze of Aloes euery eyght dayes in hir caſting.

               <p>SOmetimes Hawkes are with egge in the mewe, and efte without the mewe, whereby they fall ſicke and are in greate daunger if there be not remedie had for it: whiche thing you ſhall eaſly perceiue by them in May and April, at which times they are wont to be with egge. To remedie this inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, let the Hawkes meate be waſhed in the vrine of a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child of ſixe or ſeauen yeares old, eight or nine dayes togither, and that will keepe hir from laying.

For remedie hereof take a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of Orpinent beaten into very fine powder, and hauing mingled it with halfe aſmuch powder of Pepper, lette youre Hawke be caſt handſomly, that ſhee breake not hir feathers, then powder firſt the one wing and ſo the other gently, and finally all the whole carkaſſe of hir: after which, ſet hir vppon your fiſte againe, beſpoute hir, and ſquirt a little water on hir with your mouth, and ſet hir by a fire, or in the Sunne, till ſhe be throughly wetherd. Afterward when ye intend to feede hir, waſh hir beake to take away the ſauor of the Orpiment, and beware that your Hawke be not poore, when you intende to vſe Orpiment.

other wayes to aſſiſte and ayde Falcons and Goſhawkes. Wherefore, ſeeing that hythertoo in my collection, I haue ſpoken altogyther of Hawkes, bothe for the Ryuer and field, and in my conceyte, haue lefte fewe needefull poyntes for a good Falconer, vntouchte or treated of: nowe I ſhall not do amiſſe, nor wander ouer wyde from my purpoſe, if I ſaye ſomewhat of Spanells, without the which a Falconer, (ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vſing to flee the fielde) cannot be, without mayme of his paſtime, and impayre of his gallant glee. And againe, for that they are ſubiect to many diſeaſes and plagues, (as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlye terme them) for dogges, and longer than they are without infection, we may expect from them no pleaſure, aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or recreation: I wyll onelye in this treatiſe deſcribe you their harmes, with cures due to the ſame. Among all whiche, I place the Mangie firſte, as the capitall enimie to the quiete and beautie of a brane Spanell, wherewith they poore dogges, are oftentymes greately plagued, bothe to the infection of their fellowes, and the no ſlender griefe of their maſters.</p>
            <p>The waye to cure and diſcharge a Spanell of the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,<note place="margin">The cure for the mangie.</note> is to annoynte him eyther at the fire, or in the Sunne, thryce euery other daye, with an vnguent made of Barrowe flicke one pownde, common Oyle three ownces, Brimſtone well brayed foure ownces, ſalte well beaten and brooſed, aſhes well ſyfted and ſierced, of eyther twoo ownces, boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling all theſe in a Kettle or potte of earth, mingling them well togyther, tyll the barrowe flicke bee incorporate and well compounded with the reſte. With this vnguente thus made and confected, annoynte and beſmeare all the bodie of your Spanell, and euery other parte of him, ſhifting his litter and kennell often, the oftener the better. And laſtely, hauing thus done, waſhe him ouer and ouer with good ſtrong lye, and it will mortifie and kill the Mangie.</p>
            <p>But if perhappes (as commonly it falleth out) the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell looſe hir heare, though it proceeded not of the force of this
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:23404:188"/>
vnguent and ſtrong medicine, yet it ſhalbe very good to bathe your Spanell, ſhredding his heare in this order, with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Lupines, or Hoppes, and to annoynte hym with ſtale barrowes flicke.</p>
            <p>This medicine, ouer and beſides that, it cureth and quitteth the Mangie, it alſo maketh the Spanells ſkinne beautifull &amp; fayre to looke to, and kylles the flies, the dogges diſquieters and enimies, to his eaſe.</p>
            <p>But when this foreſayde remedie is not of force ſufficient to rydde the mangie, but that it ſpreddes and getteth greater power and dominion ouer your Spanell: then doth it behooue you to deuiſe a farre ſtronger medicine, whiche is, to take of ſtrong Uineger twoo quartes,<note place="margin">Another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie more ſtrong.</note> or as muche as will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſe, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Oyle ſixe ownces, Brimſtone three ownces, ſutte of a chimnie or potte, a quantitie of ſixe ownces, brayed ſalte and ſerced, twoo handfulls: boyle all theſe aforeſayde in the Vineger, vſing the former order of annoynting your Spanell in the Sommer tyme.</p>
            <p>If neither of theſe remedies aforeſayde wil ſerue the turne, then for a laſte refuge, you muſte be dryuen to practiſe with a farre ſtronger, than eyther of both. But in any wiſe, this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine muſte not bee miniſtred in the colde of Winter, for it will then put the Spanell in greate hazard of death.</p>

Then waſhe him twice with blacke Sope, and obſeruing this order of annoynting him euery other day twyce or thrice, aſſuredly you ſhall rydde him of all Mangineſſe, whatſoeuer it be.</p>
            <p>But I muſte tell you this by the way, that this vnguente

of Quicke Siluer, will cauſe hir heare to fail away. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be requiſite, euery third or fourth day, to annoynt him with ſtale Bacon greaſe, for that will preſently make his heare to growe and come againe.</p>

With foure or fiue of theſe loaues of breade, made in manner as I tell you, haue I cured my Spanels of the mangie, and ſome other of my friendes.</p>

               <head>Of a kinde of woormes, breeding in the hurtes and mangie partes of a Spanell.</head>
               <p>SOmetymes when a Spanell hath taken a hurt or wounde, there do ingender in the wounde certaine woormes, that do hinder the cure of the hurt, cauſing it to continue at one ſtaye, or to growe woorſe and woorſe. Wherefore it ſhall be very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to endeuour to kill them, which you ſhal do aſſuredly, if you conuey into the wounde nothing but the gumme of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie,<note place="margin">The cure.</note> called in Latine, <hi>(Gumma Hederae)</hi> keeping it there for the ſpace of one day or twoo, waſhing the wound with wine, and after that annoynting it with Bacon greaſe, Oyle of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woormes, and Rewe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, a iuyce made of the greene pilles and ryndes of Wallnuttes, or the powder of dryed Lupynes is very good. Likewiſe powder of wylde Cucumbers, is excellent to kyll thoſe woormes: and not that alone, but it will play the parte of a <hi>Corroſyue,</hi> fretting awaye the deade fleſhe, and encreaſing the good.</p>
               <p>But when the woormes growe within the body of a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,<note place="margin">Of woormes within the body.</note> they muſte bee killed in this manner, with an inwarde receyte.</p>

               <p>When a Spanel is hurte, as long as hee can come to licke the wounde with his tongue, he needes no other remedie. His
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:23404:190"/>
tongue is his <hi>Surgeon.</hi> But when he cannot poſſible licke it, then ſuche woundes as bee not venemous, you maye reſolue with the powder of <hi>Matreſilua,</hi> dryed in an Ouen, or in the Sunne. And if it be the byte of a foxe, it ſhall ſuffiſe to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynte it with Oyle, wherein earth wormes and Rewe haue bene boyled togither.</p>
               <p>But if it were bytten by a madde dogge, it ſhall bee beſte preſently to thruſte through the ſkinne of his heade and poll with a hotte yron, iuſte betwixt the eares, ſo as the fire may touche bothe ſides of the hole made: And after that, with your hande to plucke vp the ſkynne of the dogges ſhoulders and flanckes backewardes, thruſting it through with the hot yron in like manner.</p>
               <p>The gyuing of this vent to the wounde, will greatly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Spanell, and is a ready way to cure him.</p>
               <p>Beſides the application of this canterie and fire, there is one other approued remedie, and that is, to cauſe your Spanell to lappe twice or thrice of the brothe of Germander, and eate the Germander it ſelfe boyled. I neede not to deſcribe the herbe, it is ſo well knowen: but my Author ſettes oowne his propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and floure. It beares a iagged leafe, and hath a purple or blew floure, and in ſhape it is like a little Oke.</p>
               <p>This herbe Germander, ſodden and confected with ſalte &amp; Oyle, eyther ſimply brooſed togither, or made into a paſte, and giuen vnto a Spanell, will do him very much good in the cure of the byte of a madde dogge.</p>

               <head>To cut off the tip of a Spanels tayle or ſterne.</head>
               <p>IT is verie neceſſarie to cutte off a little of the Spanels tayle, when it is a whelpe for ſundry occaſions: for in ſo doing, you ſhall deliuer him, and be a meane that no kynde of woorme or other miſchiefe ſhall greatly offende that parte of your Spanell: Whiche, if it be not cutte a little at the verie poynte and toppe, is ſubiect to many euils and inconueniences, and wyll be a cauſe that the dogge will not dare to preaſe ouerhaſtily into the couert after his game. Beſydes the benefite of it, the Dogge becommes more beautifull by cutting the toppe of his ſterne: for then will it buſhe out verie gallantly, as experience will teache you.</p>
               <p>It ſhall be good when Spanell whelpes are one moneth olde or ſomewhat more, to worme them vnder the toung:<note place="margin">To worme a Spanell.</note> for there haue they a ſtring verie like vnto a worme, which muſt be pluckt away by ſome deuiſe or other. This is the order of it. If it bee a whelpe of a moneth olde, they take him and open his flew and iawes with a mannes hande: but if it be a bigger Spanell, then do they conuey a rounde ſticke into his mouthe, to keepe it wyde open: which done, they plucke out the Dogges toung, and with a ſharpe knyfe of purpoſe for it, they ſlitte the toung all alongſt where the worme lyes, on bothe ſydes, and ſo verie artificially with the poynt of the knife, they rayſe vp the worme the better to pull it away. But in this caſe there muſte be care vſed, that the worme be not cut aſunder, but had cleane awaye, without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing any parte of it behynde.</p>
               <p>Some men do vſe (in the taking away of this woorme in a Spanels toung a needle or ſuche lyke inſtrument with a double twiſted threede hanging to it, two ſhaftmentes in length, thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the needle quite vnderneath the worme iuſt in the middle of it, drawing the needle ſo farre vntill the double twiſted threede be leuell with the middle of the worme, then drawing it harde with the hand, they pull it out (but by not drawyng the threede
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:23404:191"/>
artificially, many tymes the worme breakes in two peeces, and then it is a verie harde matter to come by that parte that is ſlipte and left behinde. Wherfore in myne opinion, the firſt is the better way to diſpatche him cleane. For when this worme is once quite drawne out, the Spanell will become farre the fairer, and waxe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he fatter. Many tymes the want of worming doth keepe a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell poore, and out of fleſh, ſo as he can not proue. And (as aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient writers affirme) the worming doth diſcharge the Spanell of madneſſe and freneſſe (which I can hardly credite or beleeue: the infection and biting of an other madde Dogge beeing ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemous, as it is able to worke great effecte in the Dogge, that is bitten.)</p>
               <p>Thus muche I thoughte good to write of Spanels, and their diſeaſes and cures, for that they are ſuperintendantes, and neceſſarie ſeruantes, both for the Hawke and the Falconer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whome, the ſporte woulde bee but colde, and the toyle farre more than it is to the man. Wherfore it ſhall not be amiſſe for a good Falconer, always to breede and keepe of the beſte kynde of Spanels that he may come by, and ſo to reſpect them, as they heate not at any tyme: Or if they doe by miſfortune or negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of your lackey boye, then to regarde their cure, which may be done in manner as I haue heere ſette downe: And withall to vſe due correction to the boy. For a good Spanell maketh a good Hawke, and a curſt maiſter, a carefull footeman. Farewell. (∵)</p>
