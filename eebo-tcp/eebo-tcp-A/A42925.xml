            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Negative, and that Reſolution rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in the Convocation <hi>An.</hi> 1534. an Act of Parliament
paſſed about two years after for the extinguiſhing of that
Papal Authority in this Realm. This ſuccceded ſo well
in conſequence of what the Convocation <hi>An.</hi> 1530. had
before acknowledged him, <hi>viz. The Supream Head on
Earth of the Church of England,</hi> that that <hi>Supremacy</hi>
was likewiſe after confirmed by Act of Parliament to
him, his Heirs, and Succeſſors. This is that <hi>Supremacy</hi>
here tenderly touch'd at in the firſt Chapter of the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>Abridgment,</hi> and without which all that follows
would be but inſignificant and disfigured Cyphers. When

all the Priviledges and Preheminences incident thereto,
yet no more accrued to the Crown thereby, than was le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally

that in divers Kings Reigns had ſucceſſively inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the Rights of the Crown in that moſt ſplendent Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el

the King as it were, Livery and Seiſin of the ſaid Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy)
promiſed him <hi>in verbo Sacerdotii,</hi> That they
would not from thenceforth Aſſemble in any Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

Canons or Conſtitutions without his Licenſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
nor execute the ſame until they were Ratified under
the Great Seal of <hi>England.</hi> All which was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt diminution of any Archiepiſcopal or Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Power or Priviledges, in the free exerciſe of that
Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction which they anciently enjoyed.
The whole of this Deſign being only to eject the <hi>Roman
Pontifex,</hi> and annul his Uſurpation in a matter of that
weighty Conſequence, to which the Crown was ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
Entituled: And this only in a way conſonant
to that Allegiance, which every Subject without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
owes to his lawful Sovereign in all matters, as well

Dominions;<note place="margin">Vld. <hi>Heyl. Cypr.</hi> Angl. p. 1.</note> whereby the <hi>Clergy</hi> as well as <hi>Laity,</hi> being

<hi>Ex Patriis Scriptoribus,</hi> That <hi>York</hi> was adorned with

            <p>The Decree of Faith made by the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
was attended with no leſs than Eight <hi>Anathematiſms;</hi>
the firſt whereof was againſt him that ſhall ſay, that
there is no viſible Prieſthood in the New Teſtament, nor
any power to <hi>Conſecrate, &amp;c.</hi> For in the beginning of
that Decree it is affirmed, That there is a viſible and
external Prieſthood, in which Power is given, by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Inſtitution, to <hi>Conſecrate</hi> the <hi>Eucharist, &amp;c.</hi> In
which Decree the Synod doth alſo condemn thoſe who
ſay all Chriſtians are Prieſts, or have equal Spiritual
power, which is nothing but to confound the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
<hi>Hierarchy,</hi> which is in an Order, as an Army of
Souldiers; To which <hi>Hierarchical</hi> Order do belong
eſpecially <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who are Superiour to Prieſts. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
one of the ſaid <hi>Anathematiſms</hi> did reach thoſe who
ſay,<note place="margin">Hiſt. Counc. Trent. lib. 8.</note> that there is not an <hi>Hierarchy</hi> inſtituted in the
Catholick Church, by Divine Ordination, conſiſting of
Biſhops, Prieſts, and Miniſters. The Hiſtorian of the
aforeſaid Council of <hi>Trent</hi> tells us, That the Sixth of
the ſaid Eight <hi>Anathematiſms</hi> was much noted in
<hi>Germany,</hi> in which an Article of Faith was made of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95379:9"/>
               <hi>Hierarchy;</hi> which word and ſignification thereof (<hi>ſays
he</hi>) is Alien, not to ſay contrary to the Holy Scriptures;
and though it was ſomewhat Anciently invented, yet
the Author is not known; and in caſe he were, yet (<hi>ſays
he</hi>) he is an Hyperbolical Writer, not imitated in the
uſe of that word by any of the Ancients: and following
the ſtyle of the Primitive Church, it ought (<hi>ſays he</hi>)
to be named not <hi>Hierarchy,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dict. Lib. 8.</note> but <hi>Hierodiaconia,</hi> or <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodoulia.</hi>
But <hi>Thomas Paſſius,</hi> a Canon of <hi>Valentia,</hi>
ſaid in that Council, That all doubt made of the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
<hi>Hierarchy,</hi> did proceed from groſs ignorance
of Antiquity; it being a thing Notorious, that in the
Church the People have alway been governed by the
Clergy, and in the Clergy the Inferiours by the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours,
until all be reduced unto one Univerſal <hi>Rector,</hi>
which is the Pope of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that it was plain that
the <hi>Hierarchy</hi> conſiſteth in the Eccleſiaſtical <hi>Orders,</hi>
which is nothing but an holy Order of Superiours and
Inferiours. But <hi>Francis Forrier,</hi> a Dominican of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi>
at the ſame time ſaid, That <hi>Hierarchy</hi> conſiſteth
in <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> placeth it in
that, when it ſpeaketh of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi>
and <hi>Antioch,</hi> and therefore the handling of <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchy</hi>
not to be joyned with that of <hi>Order.</hi> Others
were of a Third opinion, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Hierarchy</hi> was a
mixture of both, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> alſo.
Thus was that Learned Council divided in this high
point of <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> that though they all agreed the
thing, yet they could not agree wherein to fix it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in <hi>Order,</hi> or in <hi>Juriſdiction,</hi> or in <hi>both.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
it is generally agreed, That the <hi>Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi>
of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church is proved by the Teſtimony
of all Antiquity, and by the continual uſe of the Church,
and that it conſiſteth of Prelates and Miniſters, who are
Ordained by Biſhops, in whom reſides the power of
<hi>Conſecration,</hi> which may be a ſufficient warrant for this
digreſſion. Which <hi>Conſecration,</hi> as it refers to <hi>Perſons,</hi>
is done <hi>per impoſitionem manuum,</hi> except as to <hi>Virgins;</hi>
for they alſo by the <hi>Pontifical</hi> Law are <hi>Conſecrable</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95379:10"/>
though they be <hi>Fooliſh Virgins,</hi> yea, though they
be Polluted Virgins, provided it be not <hi>per ſpontaneam
&amp; voluntariam pollutionem,</hi> and there be but putativa
<hi>Virginitas</hi> in the caſe; and ſhall have not only <hi>Laureo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam
Virginitatis,</hi> but alſo <hi>Velum Conſecrationis,</hi> as
they call it. <hi>Cajetan. in Sum. V. Virgin. conſecrat. &amp; Leſſ.
de Just. &amp; Jur. lib. 4. c. 2. Dub. 16. &amp; alii DD.</hi> But
where the <hi>Conſecration</hi> refers to <hi>Things,</hi> as Churches,
Chappels, Bells, and other things of the like ſound,
there it is done <hi>per preces</hi> together with other Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration-ceremonies,
the Epiſcopal <hi>Order</hi> therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring:
ſo likewiſe the <hi>Conſecration</hi> of Virgins is <hi>per
preces,</hi> together with other Ceremonies uſed in the
<hi>Conſecration</hi> of Virgins, <hi>Cujus Signum eſt, quod in Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificali

the multiplicity and emergency of ſuch affairs requir'd,

of ſuch ſubordinate Ordinaries, as being experienc'd in
the Laws adapted to the nature of ſuch Cauſes, might
prove a ſufficient Expedient to prevent the avocation of

The Law takes notice of a twofold <hi>Jus Patronatus,</hi> the
one <hi>Civile,</hi> the other <hi>Canonicum:</hi> The former is that
which is introduced by the Civil Law, and refers to a
Lord or Patron in reſpect of his Bondman made Free,
and his Goods: the other, and which only is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
is, That which is inſtituted by the Church in
ſhew of gratitude to him who either Founded, built, or
Endowed ſome Church; for which reaſon the Biſhops
granted them a certain Right in ſuch Churches, which
is commonly called <hi>Jus Patronatus,</hi> and that by the
Canon Law underſtood as <hi>Honorificum, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile,</hi> &amp; <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſum.
Honorificum,</hi> in regard of that obſequious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
due from the Pariſh to the Patron, ſpecially in that
the chiefeſt Seat in his Church is granted to him: <hi>One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſum,</hi>
in that the Patron may lawfully defend his
Church, and prevent the Dilapidations both of the
Church, and of what ſhe is Endowed with according to
the way and manner preſcribed in <hi>cap. Filiis 16. q.</hi> 7.
It is alſo called <hi>Jus <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tile,</hi> becauſe that if any time
the Patron or any deſcending from him ſhall happen to
fall into decay, in ſuch caſe the ſaid Church is more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd
to ſupply the neceſſities of him and his, than of
any other Poor. <hi>c. Quaecunque cum ſequent.</hi> For this
reaſon alſo it is, and that others may be encouraged to
the like Acts of Piety, the Church (as a Mark of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial

<hi>Jus Praeſentandi,</hi> or a Right to Preſent fit perſons to the

hath the denomination of a <hi>Benefice,</hi> or Eccleſiaſtical

By the Ninth Canon of the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council under Pope
<hi>Alexander,</hi> It is prohibited to grant or promiſe any

ſuch promiſe or grant had an expectation to ſucceed him
in the Benefice.</p>

which the Canon Law calls <hi>Jus Patronatus,</hi> being a
power or right of Preſenting one to be Inſtituted to a

either by the Authority of the Pope, if it be a

of Wars, Peſtilence, or the like, the Election or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
could not be made ſo ſoon as otherwiſe it might,
the Superiour did Recommend the vacant Church to
ſome honeſt and worthy perſon; to govern it, beſides the
Care of his own, until a <hi>Rector</hi> were provided; who then
had nothing to do with the Revenues, but to govern
them and conſign them to another. But in proceſs of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:95379:21"/>
time theſe <hi>Commendataries,</hi> under pretence of Neceſſity,
made uſe of the Fruits, and to enjoy them the longer,
ſought means to hinder the Proviſion: for remdy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
order was taken that the <hi>Commenda</hi> ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
longer than Six months: But the Popes by the
plenitude of their Power, did exceed theſe Limits, and
<hi>Commended</hi> for a longer time, and at laſt for the life
of the <hi>Commendatary,</hi> giving him power to uſe the
Fruits.</p>

               <hi>the Law provides that they ſhall be ſeaſonably ſupplied

This matter of</hi> Lapſe (<hi>in the intent and purpoſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
though not by that denomination) is very Ancient:
By the Ninth Canon of the Council of</hi> Lateran <hi>under
Pope</hi> Alexander, <hi>it is provided, That</hi> Cum Praebendas,
Eccleſias, ſeu quaelibet officia in aliqua Eccleſia vacare

<hi>vid.</hi> Chron. <hi>Gervaſii</hi> de Temp. H. 2. <hi>And by the Eighth
Canon or Conſtitution of the Council at</hi> Rome <hi>in the
year 1180, under Pope</hi> Alexander <hi>the</hi> Third, <hi>it was
Ordained,</hi> That no Eccleſiastical Office ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to any man before it became vacant by the deceaſe
of the Poſſeſſor. For (<hi>ſays the Canon</hi>) it is an unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
thing to put any man in expectation of another
mans Living, whereby he may wiſh his Brothers death.
And when any place ſhall happen to be vacant, let it be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95379:21"/>
planted again within Six months, or elſe he who hath
the Right of Plantation ſhall loſe it at that time, and
the Chapter, or Metropolitan Biſhop ſhall have power
to provide the vacant place. <hi>According to the Canon

and although this be incumbent on the Biſhop
or Ordinary (when it is in order to a Benefice) before
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95379:22"/>

to effect it, ſo ſoon as the party offers his ſubmiſſion to

After this <hi>Examination</hi> and thereon the Ordinaries Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation,

Legal impediment appears to the Ordinary; yet the
Canon requires, that notwithſtanding the Biſhops Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation

both requires, that they ſhould be <hi>Incumbents,</hi> and not

by that great Convention of no leſs than One hundred

pretended for the aid of the <hi>Holy Laud,</hi> that with the
more eaſe himſelf might exact the Firſt Frutts of vacant
Eccleſiaſtical Benefices to augment his own Revenues,

<hi>Annates</hi> or <hi>Firſt-Fruits</hi> of all Eccleſiaſtical Dignities

which, though reſerved but for Two years by the

both in <hi>England</hi> and elſewhere. And thus they
remained in the Pope until an Act of Parliament entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Crown thereunto in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Eighth, which afterwards were reſtored again to the

               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:95379:26"/>
an Act paſs'd for reſtoring the Tenths and Firſt-Fruits

in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, it is moſt

by the Laws of <hi>Ina</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt Saxons,</hi> who

whereby the Kings Revenue increaſed exceedingly from

to <hi>Rome.</hi> But now the Pope being dead in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
the King was found his Heir at Common Law, as
to moſt of the Power and Profit he had uſurped, and the
Rents which the Clergy paid were now changed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with their Landlord; for Commiſſioners (whereof
the Biſhop of the Dioceſs was ever one) were appointed
to eſtimate their Annual Revenues, that ſo their Tenths
and Firſt-Fruits might be proportioned accordingly. At
this time the Oblations from the Living,<note place="margin">An <hi>Obit</hi> was at 40 <hi>s.</hi> in St. <hi>Pauls London;</hi> yet at <hi>Waltham</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, but at 2 <hi>s. 2 d.</hi> received by the Church-wardens.</note> and <hi>Obits</hi> from

by Act of Parliament exonerate the Clergy from all theſe
Firſt-Fruits, and ordered the payment of the Tenths
to Cardinal <hi>Poole,</hi> for diſcharge of Penſions allowed to
certain Monks and Nuns; but Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the

            <p>In the ſaid Chapter of <hi>Tithes</hi> there is alſo mention

wherein is ſhewed what it is, when, by and to whom,

are reduced to another Regulation, than what was in
the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Sixth.</hi> A <hi>Mortuary</hi> was
then the Second beſt Beaſt whereof the party died poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed;
but in caſe he had but two in all, then none
due. It was called a <hi>Corſe-Preſent,</hi> becauſe ever paid
by the Executors, though not alwaies bequeathed by
the dying party. All perſons poſſeſſed of an Eſtate,
(Children under <hi>Tuition,</hi> and <hi>Femes Covert,</hi> but not
<hi>Widows,</hi> excepted) were liable to the payment thereof
to the <hi>Prieſt</hi> of that Pariſh, where the dying party re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the Sacrament (not where he repaired to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;)
but in caſe his Houſe at his death ſtood in two
Pariſhes, it was then divided betwixt them both: And
it was given in lieu of <hi>Perſonal Tithes,</hi> which the party
in his life time had through ignorance or negligence not
fully paid—<hi>Lindw. Conſ. de Conſuetud.</hi> Such of the

it is <hi>Vocabulum novum &amp; harbarum;</hi> but we underſtand
it better, where of Cuſtome it is due and payable. <hi>Theſe</hi>
Mortuaries, <hi>where by the Cuſtome they are to be paid,
were ever in conſideration of the omiſſion of Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Tithes in the parties Life-time, which Perſonal
Tithes were by the Canon Law to be paid only of ſuch as
did receive the Sacraments, and only to that Church
where they did receive them, as may be inferr'd plainly
from</hi> cap. Ad Apoſtolicae de Decimis. <hi>But obſerve,</hi> ſays

paid only ot the end of the year. And in like manner
many Predial and Mixt Tithes in divers places are

            <p>Next follows the matter of <hi>Divorce,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Divorce.</note> which is the
ſeparation of Married perſons by force of the Sentence
of an Eccleſiaſtical Judge qualified to pronounce the
ſame. Adultery in either party is the common, though
not the only, cauſe of <hi>Divorce.</hi> Some there are (it
ſeems) of great Reputation in the Church (for this is
<hi>Quaeſtio tam Theologiae quam Juris</hi>) who poſitively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
it as unlawful for a Man or Woman to live with
their Husband or Wife reſpectively, if either of them be
notoriouſly guilty of Adultery. Of which Opinion was
St. <hi>Hierom,</hi> ſaying, That a man is <hi>Sub maledictione ſi
Adulteram retineat.</hi>
               <note place="margin">In Matth. 19.</note> And St. <hi>Chryſoſtome, Fatuus &amp;

is reported to be as kind-hearted in this matter, as
ever <hi>Cato</hi> was; and they are both ſaid to lend their
Wives as freely as a man lends an Utenſil: As theſe
Wife men were beyond the reach of a <hi>Diovorce,</hi> ſo they
were more ſerious than to bluſh at Cornutiſm, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Fate of ſuch Philoſophers. St. <hi>Baſil</hi> was of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That it was lawful for a Woman ſtill to cohabit
with an adulterous Husband; to which purpoſe he made
a Canon, and commanded it to be done in his Church,
as appears in his Epiſtle to <hi>Amphilochius, 1. Can. 9. &amp;</hi> 21.
This alſo was the Sentence of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to <hi>Pollentius,</hi>

                  <hi>Vid.</hi> Dr. Taylor Caſes of Conſc. <hi>lib. 1. c. 5. nu.</hi> 9.</note>
yet does not think it fit, that the man ſhould be ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
as to his Adulterous Wife. The Council of <hi>Elibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi>
refuſed to give the Sacrament to a Clergy-man, that
did not inſtantly expel from his houſe his Wife whom he
knew to commit Adultery: And by the Council of <hi>Neo-Caeſarea</hi>
he was to be depoſed from his Dignity in the
ſame caſe. In the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> there was a Canon
made, having an <hi>Anathema</hi> added to it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

upon the Article of <hi>Divorce,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Father <hi>Soto.</hi>
               </note> it was ſaid by one of the

<hi>That a Good Name is to be choſen before great Riches;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1.</note>
where by <hi>Name,</hi> nothing can be underſtood other than
a mans Credit, Fame, and Reputation in the World: So
that the Inference is clear, <hi>a Defamer is the worſt of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:95379:33"/>
Thieves, the Sacrilegious ones excepted;</hi> yet were it
not for the ſweetneſs of Revenge, and the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Law, ſuch Actions might be better ſpar'd
than what it coſts to maintain them; and ſuch ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcented
Suits do ſavour worſe being kept alive in a Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal,
than they would by being buried in Oblivion,
ſpecially if the <hi>Defamed</hi> conſidered, that to forget In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
is the beſt uſe we can make of a bad Memory.
This <hi>Defamation</hi> is not properly that, which we call
<hi>Detractio,</hi> for <hi>Detractio</hi> in its proper ſignification is
<hi>alienae famae occulta &amp; injuſta violatio;</hi> but <hi>Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
though it be an <hi>unjuſt,</hi> yet it is not an <hi>occult</hi> vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of another mans Fame or Reputation; they have
indeed both the ſame end, but they do not both take the
ſame way to that end: they both aim and deſign the
extinguiſhing or diminiſhing the Credit and Repute
which one man hath in the mind and good opinion of
another; but the one doth it more openly and publickly,
at leaſt not in ſo clandeſtine way as the other. This
<hi>Defamatio</hi> is of near affinity to that which we call
<hi>Contumelia,</hi> which is an unlawful violation of a perſons
Honour and Reputation by undecent and falſe Speeches,
Geſtures, or Actions, on purpoſe to diſgrace him:
only in this alſo they differ, that <hi>Defamatio</hi> may be of
one man to another in the abſence of the <hi>Defamed;</hi> but
<hi>Contumelia</hi> is not but to the party preſent, <hi>vel abſenti
tanquam praeſenti,</hi> that is, in the prrſence of ſuch as
have a relative repreſentation of the perſon Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly
ſo reproached. Touching Actions of <hi>Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
there are two Queſtions raiſed, rather by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuiſts</hi>
than <hi>Canoniſts;</hi> the one, Whether the Heirs of the
<hi>Defamer</hi> be obliged to make reſtitution of Dammage
to the <hi>Defamed,</hi> in caſe the <hi>Defamer</hi> died before ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
made? the other, Whether ſatisfaction for the
dammage done by <hi>Defamation,</hi> be to be made to the
Heirs of the <hi>Defamed,</hi> in caſe he died before ſuch dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
were recovered by him? Although both theſe
Queſtions are anſwered in the Negative by that known
Rule in Law, <hi>Actio perſonalis moritur cum perſona;</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:95379:34"/>

though they agree the Rule of Law, yet they deny the

Perſonal, as is commonly ſuppoſed, but doth <hi>quodam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo</hi>
affect the Eſtate of the <hi>Defamer,</hi> whether alive or
dead: He gives an Inſtance, <hi>A man ſets his Neighbours
Houſe on fire, and dies; his Heirs ſhall make good the
dammage done by that fire: A mans Good Name and
Reputation is far more precious than his habitation: he
that conſumes that Good Name and Credit without cauſe,

Can. 8. vid. Chron. Gervaſ. de Temp. H.</hi> 2. It is Reported
of the Emperour <hi>Henry,</hi> Son of <hi>Conradus,</hi> that in his
youth he accepted of a Silver Pipe from a certain Clerk
on this Promiſe and Agreement, That when he ſhould
be made Emperour he ſhould beſtow a Biſhoprick on the
ſaid Clerk, the which he after did accordingly when he
became Emperour; but not long after the Emperour
being ſurpriz'd with Sickneſs, and his Diſeaſe increaſing
he lay ſenſleſs and ſpeechleſs for three days, and ſo rapt
as it were out of the Body, that he lay as one dead, the
Biſhops appointed a Three days Faſt for the Emperours
Recovery, which having obtain'd, he doth immediately
by a Decree of the Council degrade the Biſhop whom he
had <hi>Simoniacally</hi> ſo made for a Silver Pipe; for it was
confeſſed by all that heard hereof, That he was among
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:95379:36"/>
the Devils during the ſpace of all thoſe Three daies
wherein he lay as dead, thoſe Devils all that while dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fiery Flames through a Pipe into his mouth, whereby
his whole body became but as one Firebrand, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
whereof our Material Fire here on Earth was
but as congeled Ice to it, &amp;c. As you like this, ſo you
may have more out of the ſame Infallible Author, <hi>viz.
Jo. Bromton. in Chronico ſuo.</hi> At a Council Aſſembled
at <hi>Mantua</hi> by the Emperour <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth in the
year 1066. by the Third Canon of that Council it was
Ordain'd, That <hi>whoſoever was admitted to a Church
Office, willingly and wittingly by a</hi> Simoniack <hi>perſon,
ſhould be removed from his Order:</hi> And by the Sixth
Canon of the ſame Council it was likewiſe Ordain'd,
That <hi>no Eccleſiaſtical Office or Benefice ſhould be ſold
for Money, but freely given.</hi> Alſo by the Seventh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
of the Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> conſiſting of 180 Biſhops
in the year 1180. under Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Third,</hi> it
was Ordain'd, That <hi>no Reward be taken for admitting
men to Spiritual Offices, and that no money be taken for
Bleſſing them that are Married, or for Adminiſtration
of any other Sacrament:</hi> For at this time Marriage was
counted a <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. He that
<hi>Simoniacally</hi> enters on an Eccleſiaſtical Living, aim'd at
ſomething worth money; he cannot be ſuppoſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
principally the Miniſtery of Souls, who comes to
that Office inſtructed only with a bag of Money. In
<hi>Ireland</hi> there is a Cuſtome of receiving Oblations at
the Baptiſm of Infants; but if the Prieſt ſhall refuſe to
Baptize the Infant till he be ſecured of his Money, he is
a direct <hi>Simoniack,</hi> for then he ſells the Sacrament at a
price certain. It is Recorded in Hiſtory of <hi>Henricus
Auceps,</hi> that when he fought againſt the <hi>Hungarians,</hi>
he made a Vow to God, That if he would give him
Victory, he would purge his Countrey of <hi>Simony. Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius.</hi>

The precedent Evils of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> and <hi>Simony</hi> are no

the Soul, dangerouſly infectious to others in whom but

This Council conſiſted of 318 Biſhops, by whom <hi>Arius</hi>

who deſpiſed Marriage, and taught things not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant

his Brother <hi>Conſtans,</hi> Emperour of Old <hi>Rome,</hi> by his

That <hi>he ſought no other Doctrine, than what was most

with them the Popes Vicegerents; this <hi>Carthage</hi> was
part of <hi>Charchedon,</hi> and that a Province of <hi>Africa.</hi>
(3) The Canons of the Fathers are taken (according to
the <hi>Roman</hi> computation) out of the Epiſtles partly of
<hi>Dionyſius Alexandrinus,</hi> partly of <hi>Petrus Alexandrinus,</hi>
partly of the Wonder-working <hi>Gregorius:</hi> partly alſo out
of the Epiſtles of <hi>Bazil</hi> or <hi>Baſilius</hi> the Great: partly out

of <hi>Melita:</hi> partly out of the Reſponſes of <hi>Timotheus Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandrinus:</hi>

Synod to certain Monks, <hi>Nicholaus</hi> the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch
being Preſident: partly out of the Epiſtles of <hi>Cyril</hi> or
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:95379:39"/>
               <hi>Cyrillus:</hi> and partly out of the Epiſtles of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> the
Patriach. (4) The Canons of the Holy Apoſtles (a book
falſly aſcribed to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>) are in number Eighty Five,
according to a modeſt Computation, if you have any
Faith to ſpare, at leaſt enough to believe the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in that as in other Points, infallible. <hi>But the
Canons indeed of the Apoſtles, which are of Order and
External Government, do oblige</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> ſays)
<hi>the Conſcience, by being accepted in ſeveral Churches,
not by their first Inſtitution; and were fitted only to
Times, and Places, and preſent Neceſſities: For</hi> (ſays
he) <hi>the Apoſtolical Decree of Abſtaining from Blood
was obſerved by more Churches, than thoſe of</hi> Syria <hi>and</hi>
Cilicia, <hi>to which the Canon was directed; and the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Widows or Deaconeſſes, derived it ſelf into
the manners of the Western Churches. And the Apoſtles
in their firſt Preaching and Converſation in</hi> Jeruſalem
<hi>inſtituted a</hi> coenobitick <hi>life, and had all things in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
with Believers: (indeed no man was obliged to it.)
Of the ſame nature were their Canons, Counſels, and
Advices. The Canon concerning Widows,</hi> Let not a
Widow be choſen under 60 years; <hi>and yet</hi> Juſtinian <hi>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
one of 40 years old to be choſen.</hi> Novel. 123. c. 12, 13.

narrow to contain it, therefore it extends it ſelf to the

Bodies of perſons dying under Excommunication, have
often been inhumanely exhumated and taken out of their
Parochial graves, to aſſociate with the rotten Carkaſes
of bruit Beaſts, a Preſident whereof you have in King

and Things Eccleſiaſtical, proclaimed to all the world their
<hi>Supremacy</hi> therein: The Thirteen firſt Titles of the Firſt Book of

<hi>Emperours,</hi> do treat and judge of Things and Perſons meerly
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> yea, the Emperours <hi>Areadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius</hi> ejected

By this word [<hi>Supremacy</hi>] is here underſtood, that undoubted
Right and ancient Juriſdiction over the State Eccleſiaſtical within
theſe his Majeſties Realms and Dominions (with the aboliſhing of
all Forein and Uſurped Power repugnant to the ſame) which the
Laws and Statutes have reſtored to the Crown of this Kingdom,

There were divers Laws made in the time of King <hi>H.</hi> 8.
for the extinguiſhment of all Forein Power, and for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring
unto the Crown of this Realm the Ancient Rights and
Juriſdictions of the ſame; which is the ſubſtance of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble
of the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. The expreſs Letter and
meaning whereof is, as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> obſerves<note n="a" place="margin">Co. Inſt. p. 4. c. 74.</note> to reſtore
and unite to the Crown the Ancient Juriſdiction Spiritual or
Eccleſiaſtical, where (as he ſays) the Firſt clauſe of the Body
of the Act, being to let in the Reſtitution of the Ancient
Right and Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical within the Realm, doth
aboliſh all Forein Juriſdiction out of the Realm. And then
followeth the principal Clauſe of Reſtitution and Uniting of
the ancient Juriſdiction Eccleſiaſtical, being the main purpoſe
of the Act, in theſe words, <hi>viz. Be it Enacted, That ſuch
Juriſdiction Spiritual or Eccleſiaſtical, as by any Spiritual
Power or Authority hath heretofore been, or lawfully may
be exerciſed or uſed for the viſitation of the Eccleſiaſtical State
and Perſons, and for-Reformation, Order, and Correction of

Contempts and Enormities, ſhall for ever by Authority of this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
be united and annexed to the Imperial Crown of this Realm.</hi>
This Act by a former Clauſe thereof doth Repeal the Statute of

<hi>c.</hi> 3. were repealed; ſo that the Act of Repeal being repealed, the ſaid
Acts of <hi>H.</hi> 8. were implicitely revived, whereby it is declared and
enacted, <hi>That the King, his Heirs and Succeſſors, ſhould be taken and
accepted the only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and

               <p>(5.) The Supremacy which heretofore the Pope did uſurp in this
Kingdom, was in the Crown originally, to which it is now legally
reverted. The Kings Supremacy in and over all Perſons and Cauſes
Eccleſiaſtical, within his own Dominions, is eſſentially inherent in
him; ſo that all ſuch Authority as the Pope here once uſurped,
claiming as Supream Head, did originally and legally belong to the
Crown, and is now re-united to it by ſeveral Statutes as aforeſaid<note n="g" place="margin">26 H. 8. 1. 1 El. 1. 5. El. 1. vid. <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

(7.) The King being next under God Supream Governour of
the Church of <hi>England,</hi> may <hi>Qua talis</hi> redreſs as he ſhall ſee cauſe,
in all matters of Spiritual and Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction for the
conſervation of the Peace and Tranquillity of his Realms<note n="k" place="margin">Vid. Stat, ſupradict.</note>. The
Pope, as appears by the Stat. of 25 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 21. claimed full power to

&amp;c. ſhall be granted in manner and form following, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
yet the King is not thereby reſtrained, but his power remains
full and perfect as before, and he may ſtill grant them as King, for
that all Acts of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> flow from him<note n="m" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. By the

                  <hi>An.</hi> 787. the Pope had power to grant what Immunities and
Priviledges he pleaſed in Church-matters, and they were by the
ſaid Canon to be duly obſerved: Whatever Authority the Pope pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to in this Kingdom in ſuch matters by way of Uſurpation,
the ſame may the King, as Supream Governour of the Church next
under God in his own Dominions, uſe and lawfully exerciſe by his
Regal Authority, <hi>ex juſta plenitudine Poteſtatis ſuae.</hi> Likewiſe Pope
<hi>Agathon, An.</hi> 680. in Concilio <hi>Romano-Britannico,</hi> exerciſed his Papal
Authority, in the time of <hi>Lotharius</hi> King of <hi>Kent,</hi> not only touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Reformation of Errors and Hereſies then in this Church,
but alſo as to the compoſure of differences and diſſentions that then
were among the Clergy of this Realm. Such Preſidents of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped
power of the Papal See exerciſed in this Kingdom, are now
of no further uſe, than to illuſtrate or exemplifie the Legal power
inherent in the Kings of this Realm in ſuch matters of Eccleſiaſtical
Juriſdiction; for the moſt High and Sacred Order of Kings being
of Divine Right, it follows that all perſons of what eſtate ſoever,
and all Cauſes of what quality ſoever, whether Eccleſiaſtical or
Civil, within his Majeſties Realms and Dominions, are ſubordinated
to the Power and Authority of the King as Supream. It is not
only acknowledged, but alſo conſtituted by way of an Eccleſiaſtical
Canon,<note place="margin">Can. 1. of the Synod held at <hi>London. An.</hi> 1640.</note> That the power of Calling and Diſſolving Councils both
National and Provincial, is the true Right of all Chriſtian Kings
within their own Realms and Territories.</p>

                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95379:50"/>
(8.) The Eccleſiaſtical Legiſlative power was ever in the Kings
of this Realm within their own Dominions; That in Ancient
times they made their own Eccleſiaſtical Laws, Canons and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,
appears by ſeveral Preſidents and Records of very great
Antiquity, which were received and obſerved within their own
Territories without any Ratification from any Forreign power.
One inſtance (among many) may be given of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws
of <hi>Alured Mag. Regis Anglorum, An.</hi> 887. This they did <hi>de jure,</hi> by
virtue of their own inherent Supremacy. And therefore when
Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Second, <hi>An.</hi> 1066. in the Bull, wherein he ordained
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to be the place for the Conſecration of Kings, gave
power to <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Confeſſor</hi> and his Succeſſors, to conſtitute ſuch
Laws in the Church, as he ſhould think fit, he gave him therein
no more than was his own before: For the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
might ordain or repeal what Canons they thought fit within their
own Dominions in right of their Regal Supremacy, the ſame being
inherent in them <hi>Jure Divino, non Papali.</hi> For we find that in
King <hi>AEtheldreds</hi> days, <hi>An. 1009. in Concilio AEnhamenſi Generali,</hi>
the Canons then made, and afterwards cauſed by King <hi>Kanutus</hi> to
be Tranſcribed, were called the Kings Canons, not the Biſhops;
<hi>En hujus Concilii Canones, quos in ſuas Leges paſſim tranſcripſit Rex</hi>
Canutus, <hi>Malmsburius</hi> AEtheldredo <hi>Regi, non Epiſcopis, tribuit.</hi>
And the <hi>Peers</hi> of this Realm <hi>per Synodum Landavenſem</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excommunicable,
<note place="margin">Circa An. 560.</note> 
                  <hi>niſi prius Conſulto Rege, aut ejus praecepto.</hi> Which
is a plain demonſtration, That the Kings of <hi>England</hi> Anciently had
the Supremacy and ſuperintendent Eccleſiaſtical power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
inherent in themſelves excluſively to all other, either home
or Forreign powers whatever.</p>
               <p>(9.) It is by good Authority aſſerted, That the King as <hi>Supream,</hi>
is himſelf inſtead of the whole Law, yea, that he is the Law it
ſelf, and the only chief Interpreter thereof, as in whoſe Breaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the whole knowledge of the ſame; And that his Majeſty by
communicating his Authority to his Judge to expound the Laws,
doth not thereby abdicate the ſame from himſelf, but that he may
aſſume it again unto him, when and as oft as he pleaſes. Dr. <hi>Ridl.

               <p>10. The Laws and Statutes of this Realm have been tender of
the Kings Supremacy ever ſince the Forreign power over the State
Eccleſiaſtical was aboliſhed; In the Statute of 13 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 12.
there is a <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That nothing in the ſaid Act ſhall extend to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
or diminiſh the Kings Majeſties Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical

<hi>Proviſo,</hi> That, not any thing therein contained ſhall extend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate
or avoid his Majeſties Supremacy in Eccleſiaſtical affairs;
but that his Majeſty, his Heirs and Succeſſors, may from time to
time, and at all times hereafter, exerciſe and enjoy all Powers and
Authority in Eccleſiaſtical affairs, as fully and amply as any of his
Predeceſſors have or might have done.</p>
               <p>11. As no Convocations for Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, or for

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95379:52"/>
were not to be conſidered as</hi> Introductory <hi>of a new power, which
was not in the Crown before, but only</hi> Declaratory <hi>of an old, which
naturally belonged to all Chriſtian Princes, and amongſt others to
the Kings and Queens of the Realm of</hi> England. <hi>And whereas ſome
Seditious perſons had diſperſed a rumour, that by the Act for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognizing
the Queens Supremacy, there was ſomething further aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
unto the Queen, her Heirs and Succeſſors,</hi> (viz.) <hi>a power of
adminiſtring Divine Service in the Church; which neither by any
equity or true ſenſe of the words could from thence be gathered,
ſhe thereupon makes a Declaration to all her Subjects,</hi> That nothing
was, or could be meant or intended by the ſaid Act, than was acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be due to King <hi>H.</hi> 8. and King <hi>Ed. 6. And further decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
That ſhe neither doth nor will challenge any other Authority by the
ſame, than was challenged and lately uſed by the ſaid Two Kings, and
was of Ancient time due unto the Imperial Crown of this Realm, that
is, under God to have the Sovereignty and Rule over all perſons born
within her Realms and Dominions, of what eſtate (either Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or Temporal) ſoever they be, ſo as no other Forreign Power ſhall, or
ought to have any Superiority over them. <hi>Which Declaration pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
in the Queens</hi> Injunctions, An. 1559. <hi>not giving that general
ſatisfaction to that groundleſs Cavil as was expected and intended;
the Biſhops and Clergy in their Convocation of the year 1562. by
the Queens Authority and Conſent, declared more plainly,</hi> viz. That
they gave not to their Princeſs by vertue of the ſaid Act or otherwiſe,
either the miniſtring of Gods Word or Sacraments; but that only
Prerogative which they ſaw to have been given always to all godly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in holy Scripture by God himſelf; that is to ſay, that they ſhould
Rule all Eſtates and Degrees committed to their charge by God, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they be Eccleſiaſtical or Temporal, and reſtrain with the Civil
Sword the ſtubborn and evil doers. <hi>And laſtly, to conclude this
tender point, There is in the ſaid Act, for the better exerciſing and
enjoying of the Juriſdiction thus recognized to the Crown, an Oath
(as aforeſaid) for the acknowledgment and defence of this</hi> Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy,
<hi>not only in the</hi> Queen, <hi>but alſo her Heirs and Succeſſors. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe

of the ſaid Election to make their appearance at a certain time

any: This done by an Officer of the High-Court of <hi>Arches</hi> (uſually

ſaid Citation on that Church-door, an Authentick Certificate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is by the ſaid Officer returned to the ſaid Archbiſhop and Vicar-General.
At the time and place aforeſaid the Proctor for the ſaid
Dean and Chapter exhibits the Royal Aſſent, and the Commiſſion
of the Archbiſhop, to the Vicar-General, who after the reading
thereof accepts the ſame; Then the Proctor exhibits the Proxy from
the Dean and Chapter, preſents the elected Biſhop, returns the
Citation, and deſires that the Oppoſers may be thrice publickly
called; which done, and their Contumacy accuſed, deſires that <hi>in
poenam Contumaciae</hi> the buſineſs in hand may proceed, which the
Vicar-General: in a Schedule by him read and ſubſcribed doth order.
Then the Proctor gives a Summary Petition, therein deducing the
whole Proceſs of Election and Conſent, and deſires a time may be
aſſign'd him to prove it, which the Vicar-General admits and
decrees. After this, the Proctor exhibits the Royal Aſſent again,
with the elected Biſhops Aſſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the ſaid Certificate to the
Archbiſhop, deſiring a time to be preſently aſſigned for Final
Sentence, which the Vicar-General decrees. Then the Proctor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires,
that all Oppoſers may again be thrice publickly called; which
done, and none appearing nor oppoſing, they are pronounced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious,
and a Decree made to proceed to Sentence, by a Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule
read and ſubſcribed by the Vicar-General. Whereupon the
Biſhop elect takes the Oaths of Supremacy, Simony, and Canonical
Obedience. After this, the Dean of the <hi>Arches</hi> reads and ſubſcribes
the Sentence. Next after the Confirmation, follows the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the elected Biſhop, according to the Kings Mandate, which
is ſolemnly done by the Archbiſhop, with the aſſiſtance of two o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Form of Conſecrating Biſhops, according to the Rule laid down in
the Fourth Council of <hi>Carthage;</hi> about the year 470, generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
in all the Provinces of the Weſtern Church. After the
Premiſes, there iſſues a Mandate from the Archbiſhop to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon

               <p>(16.) The Ordinary is not obliged upon a Vacancy to receive the
Clerk of him that comes firſt; for as he may take competent time
to examine the ſufficiency and fitneſs of a Clerk: ſo may he give
convenient time to perſons intereſſed, to take knowledge of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance,
even in caſe of Death, and where notice is to be taken, not
given, to preſent their Clerks to it. And perhaps, if he do receive
the Clerk of him that comes firſt, yet he may quit himſelf of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance,
becauſe he doth nothing therein but as Ordinary in Law.
But if two or more Preſent, ſo that the Title is become Litigious,
then and in ſuch caſe he cannot receive the Clerk of any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his
own pleaſure, except the Title be certain, but hath his way of ſafety
by <hi>Jure Patronatus;</hi> and when he hath uſed the <hi>Jure Patronatus,</hi> and
that finds for one party, yet he may ſtill receive a contrary Clerk
if he will, for who can lett him? but that muſt be at his own peril,
and that is at a double peril, (1.) That the Title be the better:
(2.) That the Patron, whoſe Clerk he hath received, will plead and
defend that Title; for otherwiſe he cannot do it. But though after
Inqueſt, <hi>in Jure Patronatus,</hi> the Ordinary may accept the contrary
Clerk, yet it is againſt Juſtice and the intent of the Law; For ſince
it is a Proviſion meerly for the good and ſafety of the Ordinary, and
he pretends Doubt, and therefore puts the Patron to this enquiry
to his charge and delay to ſatisfie and ſecure him, he ought to judge
and receive the Clerk according to that Verdict. And that is the
true meaning of the Books that ſay, that the Ordinary is to judge of
the better Title, that is, not to prejudge of his own Will, but <hi>ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
allegata &amp; probata,</hi> upon Verdict of the Right given, and found
according to the form of Law, to give Inſtitution which is his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and the Induction his Execution. And though it is but an
Inqueſt of Office, and therefore binds not; True it is, it binds not
but with a diſtinction, that is, it binds not the Patron in his <hi>Quare
Impedit,</hi> but is Final, even to the true Patron, that he cannot impute
diſturbance to the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> following that Verdict, and therefore it
ought to bind him to follow it. For to theſe purpoſes it is a full Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict,
never to be tried again. And if but one Preſent, if the Ordinary
make doubt of his Title, as in many caſes he juſtly may, being a
ſtranger to it, he may require ſatisfaction by <hi>Jure Patronatus</hi>

               <p>(17.) If it be demanded, whether the Ordinary can cite a man
out of his Dioceſs? the Common Law anſwers it in the Negative;
And ſo it was held by <hi>Jones</hi> and <hi>Whitlock</hi> Juſtices in <hi>Brown</hi>'s Caſe,

no complaint touching <hi>Prohibitions,</hi> but an unanimous harmony in

we have our Common Laws, and our Priviledges mentioned in

Archbiſhops and Biſhops, named in our Hiſtories.</p>
               <p>(21.) That which during the Reign of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. made the
greateſt alteration, and threatned moſt danger to the State Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical,
was the Act entituled, <hi>An Act for Election, and what Seals
and Styles ſhall be uſed by Spiritual perſons, &amp;c.</hi> In which it was
ordained, <hi>That Biſhops ſhould be made by the Kings Letters Patents,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95379:65"/>
and not by the Election of the Deans and Chapters: That all their
Proceſſes and Writings ſhould be made in the Kings Name only, with
the Biſhop's</hi> Teſte <hi>added to it; and ſealed with no other Seal than the
Kings, or ſuch as ſhould be Authorized and Appointed by him.</hi> In
the compounding of which Act there was more danger (as Dr.
<hi>Heylin</hi> obſerves) couched, than at firſt appeared. <hi>For by the laſt
Branch thereof it was plain and evident</hi> (ſays he) <hi>that the intent of
the Contrivers was, by degrees to weaken the Authority of the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal
Order, by forcing them from their ſtrong hold of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and making them no other than the Kings Miniſters only, or as it
were, his Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Sheriffs, <hi>to execute his Will, and diſperſe his
Mandates.</hi> And of this <hi>Act</hi> ſuch uſe was made (though poſſibly
beyond the true intention of it) that (as the ſaid Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)
the Biſhops of thoſe Times were not in a Capacity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
Orders, but as they were thereunto impowred by ſpecial
Licenſe. The Tenour whereof (if <hi>Sanders</hi> be to be believed) was
in theſe words following: viz. <hi>The King to ſuch a Biſhop Greeting.
Whereas all and all manner of Juriſdiction, as well Eccleſiaſtical as
Civil, flows from the King as from the Supream Head of all the Body,
&amp;c. We therefore give and grant to thee full power and Licenſe, to
continue during our good pleaſure, for holding Ordination within thy
Dioceſs of</hi> N. <hi>and for promoting fit perſons unto Holy Orders, even to
that of the Prieſthood.</hi> Which being looked on by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> not
only as a dangerous diminution of the Epiſcopal Power, but as an
odious Innovation in the Church of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> ſhe cauſed this Act to
be Repealed in the firſt year of her Reign, leaving the Biſhops to
depend on their former claim, and to act all things which belonged
to their Juriſdiction in their own Names, and under their own
Seals, as in former times. In which eſtate they have continued
without any Legal Interruption, from that time to this. <hi>But</hi> (ſays
the ſame Author) <hi>in the Firſt Branch there was ſomewhat more than
what appeared at the firſt ſight: For, though it ſeemed to aim at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
but that the Biſhops ſhould depend wholly on the King for their
preferment to thoſe great and eminent places; yet the true drift of the
Deſign was, to make Deans and Chapters uſeleſs for the time to come,
and thereby to prepare them for a Diſſolution. For, had nothing elſe
been intended in it, but that the King ſhould have the ſole Nomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of all the Biſhops in his Kingdoms, it had been only a reviver of
an Ancient power, which had been formerly inveſted in his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in all other</hi> Chriſtian <hi>Princes.</hi> If we conſult the Records
of elder Times, it will readily appear, not only that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Emperours of the Houſe of <hi>France</hi> did Nominate the <hi>Popes</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but that, after they had loſt that power, they retained the
Nomination of the Biſhops in their own Dominions. The like

               <p>(1.) <hi>COngé d'Eſlire,</hi> in French, [<hi>Leave to Chuſe</hi>] is the Kings
permiſſion to a Dean and Chapter to chuſe a Biſhop in
the time of Vacancy<note n="a" place="margin">F. N. B. 169. Term. Leg.</note>. And time was when this
<hi>Venia Eligendi</hi> was alſo the permiſſion Royal to an Abby or Priory
of his own Foundation to chuſe their Abbot or Prior<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. B. &amp; 170 B, C, &amp;c.</note>. But we
now underſtand it under no other ſignification than as his Majeſties
leave vouchſafed to a Dean and Chapter to elect a certain perſon to
ſucceed as Biſhop of that Dioceſs, whoſe Epiſcopal See is vacant.
For the better interpretation of this <hi>Congé d'Eſlire,</hi> the Modern
Pens refer themſelves to Mr. <hi>Guin</hi> in the Preface to his <hi>Readings,</hi>
where he ſaith. The the King of <hi>England,</hi> as Sovereign Patron of
all Archbiſhopricks, Biſhopricks, and other Eccleſiaſtical Benefices,
had of Ancient time free Appointment of all Eccleſiaſtical Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,,
whenſoever they hapned to be void: Inveſting them firſt <hi>Per
Baculum &amp; Annulum,</hi> and afterwards by his Letters Patents: And
that in proceſs of time he made the <hi>Election</hi> over to others, under
certain Forms and Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> That they ſhould at every Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
before they chuſe, deſire of the King <hi>Congé d'Eſlire,</hi> that is,
Leave or Licenſe to proceed to Election, and then after the Election
to crave the Royal Aſſent, &amp;c. He affirmeth alſo by good proof, out
of the Books of the Common Law, that King <hi>John</hi> was the firſt
that granted this; and that afterwards it was confirmed by <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter</hi>
1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. which Statute was made <hi>An. 3. Ed.</hi> 1. And again by

<hi>Ed. 3. Stat.</hi> 3. it is generally agreed, That the Kings of this Realm
were originally the Founders of all Archbiſhopricks and Biſhopricks
within this Kingdom, being at firſt Donative <hi>per traditionem Baculi
Paſtoralis &amp; Annuli:</hi> But afterwards King <hi>John</hi> by his Chapter,
15 <hi>Jan.</hi> in the ſeventh year of his Reign, <hi>De Communi conſenſu Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronum,</hi>
granted that they ſhould ever after be eligible. And from
that time came in the <hi>Congé d'Eſlire.</hi> Vid. Co. 5. par. 14. in <hi>Candry</hi>'s
Caſe. vid. Stat. 1 Jac. cap. 3. vid. 17 Ed. 3. cap. 40.</p>
               <p>(2.) The <hi>Congé d'Eſlire</hi> being granted to the Dean and Chapter,
they proceed accordingly to <hi>Election,</hi> which in the ſenſe here intended,
as appropriated to this Subject, is that Regular Choice, which is
made of an Eccleſiaſtical perſon to ſucceed in the office and dignity
of Biſhop, in, and of that Dioceſs, whoſe See at the time of ſuch
Election is vacant. This Election referring to an Epiſcopacy, or
the choice of a new Biſhop in a vacant See, is done by a Dean and
Chapter; but there are alſo other Elections Eccleſiaſtical relating to
a Regular choice of other perſons to other Offices and Dignities in
the Church, ſubordinate to the former; but here it is ſpecially meant
of ſuch an Election or choice of a new Biſhop, as is precedent to
Confirmation, Conſecration, and Inveſture or Inſtalment, being
made (as aforeſaid) by the Dean and Chapter of a Cathedral
Church, by vertue of the Kings Licenſe and Letters Miſſive, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Majeſties nomination and pleaſure, contained in ſuch
Letters Miſſive, in purſuance of ſuch Licenſe to Elect, under the
Great Seal of <hi>England;</hi> which Election being made accordingly,
the Dean and Chapter are to return a Certificate thereof under
their Common Seal unto his Majeſty. This Election alone and of
it ſelf, be it to an Archbiſhoprick or Biſhoprick, if the perſon Elected
were before the Parſon or Vicar of any Church Preſentative, or
Dean of any Cathedral, or held any other Epiſcopal Dignity, doth
not <hi>ipſo facto</hi> make void in Law ſuch former Benefice, or Dignity,
or Deanry, becauſe he is not compleat and abſolute Biſhop meerly
by ſuch <hi>Election,</hi> but only Biſhop <hi>Elect;</hi> And an Election only of
ſuch one to a Biſhoprick, who had before a Benefice with Cure, or
any other Eccleſiaſtical Dignity or promotion, doth not make a
Ceſſion thereof<note n="c" place="margin">20 Ed. 3. Fitz. tit. <hi>Brief.</hi> 25.</note>. And it hath been adjudged, that a <hi>Commendam

dignity Eccleſiaſtical, which the ſaid Parſon had before his Election
to the Biſhoprick, is yet good to him notwithſtanding ſuch Election,

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:95379:69"/>

Note, That before an Archbiſhop or other Biſhop is Confirmed, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated,
or Inveſted, he muſt take the Oath of <hi>Fealty</hi> unto the
Kings Majeſty only, after which the King under his Great Seal doth

unto four Biſhops within his Majeſties Dominions, thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
them to <hi>Confirm</hi> his Election, and to Conſecrate and Inveſt
the perſon Elected. After which <hi>Confirmation</hi> and Conſecration he
is compleat Biſhop to all intents and purpoſes, as well to Temporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as Spiritualties. And now he hath <hi>plenam poteſtatem tam Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis
quam Ordinis;</hi> and may therefore after his Conſecration
certifie an Excommengment; and upon his <hi>Confirmation</hi> the power
of the Guardian of the Spiritualties doth ceaſe<note n="f" place="margin">18 Eliz. Dyer 350.</note>, and a Writ for

hath been held to be good<note n="g" place="margin">22 E. 3. 13.</note>. Likewiſe the King may by
his Letters Patents, after ſuch <hi>Confirmation</hi> and before Conſecration,
grant unto ſuch Biſhop his Temporalties<note n="h" place="margin">41 E. 3. 6. &amp; 46 E. 3. 22.</note>, which Grant from his

Title, but voidable, though not actually and at preſent void. To
explain this; A Biſhop grants his Chancellorſhip by Patent to one

or the holy Oyl or holy Ointment, which was not to be applied
to any Prophane or Civil uſe, but to be appropiated to the Sons of

conſiſts in certain Benedictions and Ceremonies peculiarly requiſite
thereunto; And when after Election and Confirmation the perſon
is Conſecrated and Inveſted, he is then compleat Biſhop, as well to
Temporalties as Spiritualties, and then the power of the Guardian
of the Spiritualties doth ceaſe. Being Conſecrated he may confer
Holy Orders upon others, and may Conſecrate Churches and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels,

               <p>(3.) <hi>Touching the Conſecration of Churches, the Learned Sir</hi>
H. Spelman <hi>makes mention of a very Ancient</hi> Canon <hi>made by the</hi>
Synod <hi>held at</hi> Celichyth,<note place="margin">Celichyth.</note> 
                  <hi>in the year 816. under</hi> Wulfred <hi>Archbiſhop
of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and Preſident of the ſaid</hi> Synod, Kenulph <hi>King of</hi>
Morcia <hi>being threat alſo perſonally preſent; The Canon is to this
purpoſe, viz.</hi> Wherever a Church is built or erected, let it be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by the Biſhop of the proper Dioceſs: Let it have a Benediction from
himſelf, and be ſprinkled with Holy Water, and ſo be made a compleat
Church, in ſuch manner as is preſcribed in the Miniſterial Book. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
let the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which is Conſecrated by the ſame Biſhop, be
together with other Reliques repoſited and laid up in a Cheſt, and kept
and preſerved in the ſame Church. And we Ordain and Command,
that every Biſhop take care that the Saints, to whom their Churches are
dedicated reſpectively, be painted on the Church-walls, or in Tables, or
on the Altars<note n="g" place="margin">Spelm. <hi>Conſil. Synod.</hi> Celichyth. <hi>Can.</hi> 2.</note>.</p>
               <p>4. The Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in his care of the Church, hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcirbed
a Form of Conſecration thereof in this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> his
Law is, <hi>That none ſhall preſume to erect a Church, until the Biſhop of
the Dioceſs hath been firſt acquainted therewith, and ſhall come the lift
up his hands to Heaven, and Conſecrate the place to God by Prayer:
and erect the Symbole of our Salvation,</hi> viz. <hi>the venerable and truly

Churches, the laying of the firſt Stone was of Ancient uſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:95379:71"/>
                  <hi>in the</hi> Greek <hi>Church, as may be obſerved out of their</hi> Euchologue,
<hi>where it is ſaid,</hi> That the Biſhop, after ſome other Rites performed,
ſtanding in the place where the Holy Altar ſhall be ſet, ſaith certain
Prayers, which being ended, he giveth tho <hi>Ite Miſſa eſt,</hi> and then taketh
up one of the Stones, and having cut a Croſs upon it, himſelf with his
own hands layeth it upon the Groundwork, as the firſt Foundation-ſtone;
then be pronounceth the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſo the Workmen
begin the Building. <hi>The like Ceremonies are uſed in the</hi> Latin
<hi>Church at this day at the Conſecration of Churches, as appears by
their</hi> Pontificale<note n="i" place="margin">Pontificale, <hi>pag.</hi> 281. per <hi>Clement.</hi> 8. An. 5565.</note> 
                  <hi>There is this further touching the Conſecration
of Churches in the</hi> Euchologue <hi>of the</hi> Greek <hi>Church,</hi> That the Biſhop
having on his Formilities, fumeth the Ground-work or Foundation
with his Iacenſe Circular-wiſe, then the Singing-men ſay a kind of
<hi>Collect</hi> for the <hi>Saint</hi> to whoſe Name the Church is Dedicated, and ſome
other Services as the <hi>Chaunter</hi> ſhall appoint. <hi>So that although the
Patron might chuſe the Ground, yet the Prelate was to come and
Conſecrate it; the Patron might bring the Stones, but the Biſhop
laid the Foundation; the Workmen might with the Materials make
a Houſe, but the Biſhop by Conſecration made it a Church; It was
but the dead body of a Temple, till it received the being of a Church
by the influence of the</hi> Dioceſan. <hi>Thence it was that the priviledge
of a new Church followed not the Building, but the Conſecration
thereof, as was well obſerved by that Devout and Learned King</hi>
Alured <hi>in the fifth Canon of his</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Laws, <hi>where he ſaith</hi>
That if a man purſued by his Enemy flie to the Temple, no man ſhall
thence take him away for the ſpace of ſeven days; <hi>which Law was yet
made under a Caution,</hi> That this freedom ſhall not be granted to any
Church, but ſuch as ſhall be Conſecrated by the Biſhop.</p>
               <p>(5.) Conſecration relating to the perſon, office, and dignity of a
Biſhop (as in the former part of this Chapter) was by the Imperial
Law ſo neceſſary to the making him a Biſhop compleat, as that
without it his Election and Confirmation would not have entituled
him to any Church that ſhould be new erected within his Dioceſs,
whereunto he being Conſecrated, had a right and Title; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
not only by the Emperours Novel, but alſo more peculiarly
acknowledged by the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or the ſetting up of the Croſs
behind the Altar when he made the Conſecration. Thus the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholgue</hi>
for the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. The like alſo is obſerved in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi>
where the Ceremonies are more tedious and elaborate. By the
ſetting up of the ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Right of the new Church
was conveyed to the Patriarch or Biſhop as by an eſpecial Title, and
that not only by the <hi>Euchologue</hi> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> but alſo by the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour's
Novel in the <hi>Latin</hi> Church: Concerning which Right
and the Conveyance thereof by the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Obſervable to this
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:95379:71"/>
purpoſe is that Synodical Sentence given by <hi>Germanus,</hi> Patriarch of

               </p>
               <p>(6.) This Conſecration, ſpecially as it refers to Biſhops, is <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter

for ſome juſt cauſe he ſhould be depoſed or removed from the See,
or ſuſpended <hi>ab Officio &amp; Beneficio,</hi> both from his Spiritual Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
as to the exerciſe and execution thereof, as alſo from the
Temporalties and profits of the Biſhoprick; yet he ſtill retains the
Title of a Biſhop, for that it is ſuppoſed the Order it ſelf cannot

certifying him of the Election, and then there is an act of Aſſent to
the Election, which cannot be without his Aſſent. 4. The Kings Writ
to the Archbiſhop to Conſecrate and Inſtall the perſon Elected. 5. Then
the Archbiſhop iſſues forth a general Citation, and therein doth prefix a
certain day for the Confirmation, which is done accordingly, and then
be is Conſecrated.</hi> Then the new Biſhop ſwears Fealty to the King,

two ways or means of Creating theſe <hi>Deans;</hi> for thoſe of the

by a much ſhorter courſe inſtall'd by vertue of the Kings Letters
Patents, without either Election or Confirmation. <hi>Deans</hi> of the
Old Foundation (before the ſuppreſſion of Monaſteries) arrive to

manifeſt, that there are four ſorts of Deans or Deanaries, whereof
the Laws of this Kingdom do take knowledge. The <hi>firſt</hi> is a Dean
who hath a Chapter conſiſting of Canons and Prebendaries, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
ſubordinate to the Biſhop, as a Council aſſiſtant to him in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Spiritual relating to Religion, and in matters Temporal rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                  </note> The <hi>ſecond</hi> is a
<hi>Dean</hi> who hath no Chapter, Preſentative, having Cure of Souls;
he hath a Peculiar, and a Court with Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;
he is not ſubject to the Viſitation of the Ordinary: Such is thè
Dean of <hi>Battel</hi> in <hi>Suſsex,</hi> a Deanary Founded by <hi>William the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour</hi>
in memory of his Conqueſt; who though he be Preſentable
to the Biſhop by the Patron, and admitted to the Deanary by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
and Induction by the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> yet is exempt
from his Viſitation. The <hi>third</hi> is, whoſe Deanary is not <hi>Preſentitive,</hi>
but <hi>Donative,</hi> nor hath he Cure of Souls, but is only by Covenant
or Condition; he hath a Court and a Peculiar, holding Plea of
matters Eccleſiaſtical ariſing within his Peculiar over divers Pariſhes.
Such a Dean conſtituted by Commiſſion of the Metropolitan, is the
Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> the Dean of <hi>Bocking</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> and divers others.
The <hi>fourth</hi> is the <hi>Rural Dean</hi> aforeſaid, having no abſolute Judicial
power in himſelf, but is only by the direction of the Biſhop or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon,
to order and prepare Eccleſiaſtical affairs within his Deana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and Precinct; the power of theſe Rural Deans is at this day
nigh extinguiſhed by the Office of the Archdeacon and the Biſhops
Chancellor; yet in ſome parts of this Realm it is ſtill in force.</p>
               <p>(5.) Of theſe Four ſorts of <hi>Deans,</hi> the firſt, as was ſaid, hath a
Chapter, being an Eccleſiaſtical Governour Secular over the Canons
and Prebendaries in the Cathedral Church, as the Dean of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi>
St. <hi>Pauls, &amp;c.</hi> The Patronge of all which Deanaries is in the
Crown, and doth not belong to any Subject. Alſo, the new Deana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
(as was formerly hinted) which were tranſlated from Priories

Founded by King <hi>H.</hi> 8. or other Kings of this Realm are now
Donative, and the Deans thereof are by the Kings Letters Patents
Inſtalled: but the Ancient Deans of Chapters are (as Biſhops) by a

               <p>(3.) An Archdeaconryſhip being only matter of Function, and
(as ſuppoſed) not properly Local, nor any Indenture made of it, it
hath been ſome queſtion heretofore, whether a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> doth
lie of it, or not? But it was held in the Affirmative, for that an
Archdeacon hath <hi>Locum in choro</hi>

was derived from the Biſhop, and to him he is ſubordinate:
To which purpoſe the opinion of the Court in <hi>Hutton</hi>'s Caſe upon
a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> was, That if a Suit be before an Archdeacon,
whereof by the Statute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Ordinary may licenſe the
Suit to a higher Court; that the Archdeacon cannot in ſuch caſe
balk his Ordinary, and ſend the Cauſe immediately into the <hi>Arches:</hi>
for he hath no power to give a Court, but to remit his own Court,
and to leave it to the next; for ſince his power was derived from
the Biſhop to whom he is ſubordinate, he muſt yield it to him of
whom he received it; and it was ſaid in that Caſe, that ſo it had been

               <p>(4.) If after the Clerk hath been preſented by the Patron, and

And this Court is to be holden where and in what places the

               <p>(5.) Although by the Canon Law, if one having a Benefice with
Cure of Souls accepts an Archdeaconry, the Archdeaconry is void;
yet it is conceived, that upon the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. the Law is
qualified in that point by reaſon of a <hi>Proviſo</hi> there, viz. <hi>Provided
that no Deanary, Archdeaconry, &amp;c. be taken or comprehended under

(6.) By the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions and Canons of the Church,

expreſly entered by the Regiſter or his Deputy under ſuch Proceſs,
and both Proceſs and Names firſt ſubſcribed by ſuch Archdeacon,

affixed. And in places where both the Biſhop and Archdeacon do
by <hi>Preſcription</hi> or <hi>Compoſition</hi> viſit at ſeveral times in one and the

after the Viſitation ended that year, and the Preſentments received,
certifie under his hand and Seal to the Biſhop or his Chancellor, the
Names and Crimes of all ſuch as are preſented in his ſaid Viſitation,
to the end the Chancellor may not Convent the ſame perſon for the
ſame Crime, for which he is preſented to the Archdeacon; which
courſe the Chancellor is in like manner to obſerve, in reference to
the Archdeacon, after the Biſhops Viſitation ended. The which
was Ordained, to prevent the Proſecution of the ſame party for the

(10.) The <hi>Canon</hi> Law doth diſtinguiſh of Archdeacons; the

Otherwiſe it is in him who hath a diſtinct Limitation of his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaconry,

which the Judges took in the Caſe between <hi>Chiverton</hi> and <hi>Trudgeon,</hi>
wherein they held and agreed, That there is a Juriſdiction of one
Archdeacon, and there is the Juriſdiction of another, which is but a
peculiar Juriſdiction; for the Archdeacon is an Officer who hath a
Court of his own, in which he hath the Probat of Teſtaments <hi>de

by Preſcription, or otherwiſe:</hi> The Archdeacon is a Miniſter ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
to the Biſhop, <hi>viz.</hi> Deputy and Vicar, or an Officer under
him, for, in caſe of Induction, the Biſhops Warrant is neceſſary to
impower him to give the ſame; He hath alſo Judicial power, but it
is not excluſive to the Epiſcopal Authority, but the Biſhop is his
Superiour: Both are Judges, but the one ſubordinate to the other,

<hi>is ſuppoſed to have its derivation, even from the duty incumbent

               <p>(2.) It hath at times been ſmartly controverted, Whether <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curations</hi>
be due only <hi>ratione Viſitationis,</hi> or whether the payment
thereof may legally be enforced without the Act of <hi>Viſiting,</hi> and
not excluſively to Archdeacons in the years of <hi>Epiſcopal Viſitations?</hi>
For if ſo, then the foreſaid deſcription which <hi>Vallenſis</hi> makes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
is not adequate enough to the nature of the thing; of which
opinion grounded on ſolid Arguments, is the Learned Author of the

               <p>(3.) Anciently (as aforeſaid) theſe Viſitation-Procurations, or
<hi>Exhibitio neceſſariorum ſumptuum,</hi> as <hi>Vallenſis</hi> calls it, was no other
than <hi>Victuals:</hi> For by the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> (not the great General

               <p>(4.) The Queſtion is not, whether <hi>Procurations</hi> are due <hi>Ratione

               <p>(6.) The Ordinary may not receive above one <hi>Procuration,</hi> that is,
he may not of the ſame Church exact one Procuration from the
Rector, another from the Vicar; if he hath the Procuration <hi>in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctualibus</hi>
of the Rector, he ought to receive nothing of the Vicar,
<hi>nec è contra;</hi> for one Procuration of one Church for one day is held
ſufficient: <hi>dict. c. Foelicis, de Cenſib.</hi> Nor do the Canons allow above
one <hi>Procuration,</hi> in caſe there be more Churches than one <hi>Viſited</hi> in
one and the ſame day; the Reaſon whereof in Law, becauſe the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>
is the <hi>Principal,</hi> the <hi>Procuration</hi> is but the <hi>Acceſſory,</hi> and the
<hi>Viſitation</hi> only of one day ought not to have the <hi>Procurations</hi> of
more, nor ought the Acceſſory to exceed the Principal. <hi>Lindw. ibid.
de Cenſib. c. quamvis, &amp; gl. ib. ver. Canones.</hi> Nor ought there to be
paid above one Procuration for the Mother-Church and the Chappel
thereto belonging, when they are Viſited. <hi>Can. ibid. ver. una Eccleſia.</hi>
Yet there are <hi>Canoniſts</hi> of very good Authority, as <hi>Andraeas</hi> and
others, who holding the contrary, do poſitively aſſert, That every
Chappel dependent (if Peopled and of ability) ſhall pay its own
proper <hi>Procuration</hi> at times of the Ordinary <hi>Viſitation,</hi> for that the
Biſhop is to have a reſpect to every individual Member of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.
It is therefore diſtinguiſhed and confeſſed, that this is true,
when the Chappel dependent hath a Curate proper of its one, and
diſtinct from, or other than the Curate of the Mother-Church:
But otherwiſe when the Rector of the Superiour Church, is Curate
of both, only doth exerciſe the Cure in the ſaid Chappel by a Vicar
not Perpetual, but Temporal and removeable <hi>ad Libitum. Gl. in d.
ver. una Eccleſia. Lindwood</hi> on this occaſion puts the Queſtion,
Whether in caſe the Church be of one Dioceſs, and the Chappel
thereto annexed or united, or dependent thereon, of another;
whether in that caſe there ſhall at the <hi>Viſitation</hi> be but one Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
paid for both? He reſolves it thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That if the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
of the place where the ſaid Chappel ſtands, hath formerly had
there his Viſitation, and Procuration, <hi>ratione Viſitationis ejuſdem,</hi>
then and in that caſe the power of <hi>Viſiting</hi> the ſame, nor by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
the Procuration due <hi>ratione Viſitationis,</hi> is not taken away
from that Ordinary by ſuch union or dependency. <hi>Gloſſ. ibid. in ver.

(7.) By the aforeſaid Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> all <hi>Viſitors</hi> were limited
to a certain number of Viſitation-Attendants, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
qualities, as Archbiſhops to the number of forty or fifty men
with their Horſes; the Biſhop to twenty or thirty; Cardinals to
twenty five (though they could not digeſt ſuch an undervaluation)
Archdeacons to five or ſeven; Deans (that is, <hi>Archipresbyteri Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rales,</hi>

there is an Epiſtle of Pope <hi>Alex.</hi> 3. to certain Archdeacons and
Deans, reproving them for extorting of moneys from the Clergy

                  </note> the Kings Attorney General in <hi>Ireland,</hi> reports to
have been there Reſolved and Adjudged. The Caſe was this; The
Biſhop of <hi>Meth,</hi> before the diſſolution of Monaſteries, had a <hi>Proxy</hi>
of fifteen ſhillings four pence payable yearly out of the Commandry
of <hi>Kells</hi> in the County of <hi>Meth,</hi> parcel of the Poſſeſſions of the
Hoſpital of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>Ireland;</hi> and one other <hi>Proxy</hi>
of twenty ſhillings payable yearly out of the Impropriate Rectory of
<hi>Trevet</hi> in the ſame County, parcel of the poſſeſſions of the Abbey of
<hi>Thomaſcourt</hi> in the County of <hi>Dublin.</hi> In the thirty third year of
King <hi>H.</hi> 8. the ſaid Hoſpital and Abbey were ſuppreſſed and diſſolved,
and all the poſſeſſions of both the ſaid Houſes were veſted in the
actual poſſeſſion of the Crown by Act of Parliament: But in the
ſaid Act there is an Expreſs, <hi>Saving the Proxies</hi> to all Biſhops and
their Succeſſors. Afterwards the Biſhop of <hi>Meth</hi> and his Clergy
(for that Biſhoprick hath not any Dean and Chapter) by Deed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolled,
Dated 16 <hi>March 36 H.</hi> 8. granted to the ſaid <hi>Proxies (inter
alia</hi>) to King <hi>H.</hi> 8. his Heirs and Succeſſors; the King being at the
time of the Grant, and after, in the actual poſſeſſion of the ſaid
Commandry and Rectory, out of which the ſaid <hi>Proxies</hi> were pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.
Afterwards Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> by her Letters Patent dated
<hi>Primo Novemb.</hi> in the thirty third year of her Reign, demiſed the
ſaid Commandry and Rectory to Dr. <hi>Forth.</hi> And now whether he
ſhall be charged with theſe <hi>Proxies,</hi> and the Arrearages thereof, after
the commencement of the Leaſe, was the Queſtion; And it was
Adjudged, that he ſhould be charged therewith. In the Argument
of this Caſe there were Three points moved and debated; (1) Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Proxies</hi> were wholly extinct by the ſuppreſſion and diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſaid Religious houſes, notwithſtanding, the ſaid <hi>Saving</hi>
in the Act of <hi>Diſſolution?</hi> (2) Whether the Biſhop could grant
the <hi>Proxies</hi> to the King? (3) Whether the <hi>Proxies</hi> in the hands of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:95379:85"/>
the King were extinct by the Unity of Poſſeſſion? For the Firſt
point, it was Objected by Sir <hi>Ambroſe Forth</hi>'s Counſel, That the
<hi>Proxies</hi> were extinct by the ſuppreſſion and diſſolution of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
houſes: For that the <hi>Viſitation</hi> of the Religious houſes were
the ſole cauſe of the payment of the <hi>Proxies; Et ceſſante cauſa ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſat
effectus.</hi> For the Religious houſes being gone and diſperſed, they
ſhall not be afterwards ſubject to <hi>Viſitation,</hi> and then when the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
doth ceaſe, the <hi>Proxies,</hi> being only <hi>Exhibition given to the
Viſitor for his Travelling charges,</hi> ſhall ceaſe alſo; For <hi>Procuratio</hi> (as
the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> define it) <hi>eſt Exhibitio ſumptuum neceſſariorum facta
Praelatis, qui Dioeceſes peragrando Eccleſias ſubject as Viſitant.</hi> Yet it
was agreed, That the <hi>Viſitation</hi> doth not ceaſe immediately upon
the Surrender, or by the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which gives the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
houſes and their Poſſeſſions to the Crown; for by that their
Corporations are not diſſolved: as was held in the Caſe of the Dean
and Chapter of <hi>Norwich. Co. par. 3. 15 Aſſ. p. 8. 32 H. 8. Br. Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
78. But when the Religious perſons were diſperſed and
had relinquiſhed their <hi>Habit, Rule,</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> for which they were
<hi>Viſitable,</hi> then their Corporation was utterly diſſolved, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the <hi>Viſitation</hi> ceaſes. And in this caſe they reſembled a <hi>Proxie</hi>
due for <hi>Viſitation</hi> to an Annuity for <hi>Counſel</hi> or ſome other <hi>Service</hi>
to be done: if the <hi>Counſel</hi> or the <hi>Service</hi> be withdrawn, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
determines. So if a Rent-charge be granted for a Way, ſtop
the Way and the Rent-charge ſhall be ſtopt alſo, 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 19.

                  <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 7. So where a <hi>Corodie</hi> is granted for certain
Service to be done, the omiſſion of the Service determines the
<hi>Corody, 20 Ed. 4. fo. ult.</hi> It was alſo ſaid, That the duty is not
Annual but Contingent, and payable only upon every <hi>Viſitation.</hi>
And for the [<hi>Saving</hi>] they ſaid, it was a <hi>Flattering Saving,</hi> which
could not preſerve the <hi>Proxies</hi> in being, which the Law had extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed;
as was held 14 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 313. That the tenures of the
<hi>Obit</hi> or Chauntry-Lands held of the Subjects are extinct by the
Act of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. notwithſtanding the <hi>Saving</hi> in the ſaid Act, <hi>propter
abſurditatem:</hi> So the <hi>Proxies</hi> in this Caſe ſhall be extinct <hi>propter
abſurditatem.</hi> For as it is abſurd, that the King ſhould be ſubject
to Attendance in reſpect of a Tenure: ſo it is abſurd, that the King
ſhould be ſubject to <hi>Viſitation,</hi> or to any duty in reſpect thereof.
Of the ſame nature there are many <hi>Savings</hi> put in <hi>Walſingham</hi>'s
Caſe. <hi>Plow. Com.</hi> 563. which are there called <hi>Flattering Savings.</hi>
As to the <hi>Second</hi> point it was objected, That the Biſhop could not
grant theſe <hi>Proxies</hi> to the King for two Reaſons; the one drawn
from the perſon of the King, the other from the perſon of the
Biſhop: (1) For the King, Admit that he were capable of ſuch a
Spiritual Office, as to be a <hi>Viſitor</hi> of Religious perſons, yet he ſhall
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95379:85"/>
not have <hi>Proxies,</hi> by reaſon of the <hi>Inconveniency</hi> and <hi>Indecency,</hi> and
alſo for the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> thereof; For it is neither <hi>Convenient</hi> nor
<hi>Decent,</hi> that the poor Religious perſons ſhould bear the Charges of
the King; And it is alſo <hi>Impoſſible,</hi> for by the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, <hi>Procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
exhibenda eſt ſecundum qualitatem perſonae Viſitantis;</hi> and the
Majeſty of the perſon of the King, and the grandure of his Train
ſuch, that by preſumption of Law no private perſon can bear his
neceſſary charges, or make him entertainment anſwerable to the
quality of his perſon. (2) For the Biſhop, Although he may
grant his Temporal poſſeſſions with the aſſent of his Chapter or
Clergy, yet thoſe duties which he hath by the prerogative of his
<hi>Epiſcopal Chair,</hi> or as incident to his Spiritual Function, he may not
grant; And they by the Rule of the <hi>Canon</hi> Law are of Three ſorts,
<hi>viz.</hi> (1) <hi>Subſidium Cathedrarium,</hi> which is a duty of Prerogative
and Superiority. (2) <hi>Quarta Epiſcopalis,</hi> which was given to him
for Reparation of Churches. (3) <hi>Procurationes,</hi> for his <hi>Viſitation,</hi>
as aforeſaid, which is a perquiſite or profit of his Spiritual Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
As to the Third point, they ſaid, That although a <hi>Proxie</hi>
is a Perſonal thing, payable only in reſpect of perſons <hi>Viſitable,</hi>
yet admit that theſe <hi>Proxies</hi> are become Real, and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandry
and Rectory are charged with theſe <hi>Proxies,</hi> then the unity
of poſſeſſion doth extinguiſh them in the hands of the King, as a
Seignory, Rent-charge, Common, and the like, are extinguiſhed by
the purchaſe of the Terre-tenant, if he hath the like Eſtate in the
Land, and in the thing which charged the Land. And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
was cited the Caſe of 2 <hi>H. 4. 19. a.</hi> where a Prior had an
Annuity out of a Parſonage by Preſcription; the Parſonage is after
appropriate to the Priory, the Annuity is extinguimed for ever.
But on the other ſide, it was anſwered by the Kings Council, and
Reſolved by the Court, That the ſaid <hi>Proxies</hi> were not extinguiſhed
by the diſſolution of the ſaid Religious houſes, but were well pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
and ſaved to the Biſhop; and the Biſhop had well granted
them to the King, and the unity of poſſeſſion in the hands of the
King made but a Suſpenſion and no Extinguiſhment of the ſaid
<hi>Proxies.</hi> (1) As to the Firſt point, it was firſt obſerved, that theſe
<hi>Proxies</hi> had not their original in the primitive Church; for St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
in <hi>viſiting</hi> all the Churches which he had planted in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi>
demanded not any <hi>Proxies,</hi> but laboured with his own hands for his
ſubſiſtance, leſt he ſhould be burthenſom to the Churches. Yet long
after this, the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, which declares that <hi>Proxies</hi> are due to
Biſhops in their <hi>Viſitations,</hi> ſays, that it is agreeable to the doctrine
of St. <hi>Paul, ut à quibus ſpiritualia recipimus, eiſdem Temporaliae
communicemus. Inſtit. Jur. Can. l. 2. c. de Cenſib.</hi> It was alſo obſerved,
that that which we call <hi>Proxie</hi> or <hi>Procuracy,</hi> is called by the Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95379:86"/>
                  <hi>Procuratio,</hi> for that upon every <hi>Viſitation</hi> the perſons <hi>viſitable
procurant</hi> neceſſary Proviſions for the Viſitors; which Proviſions at
firſt were made in Victuals, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Eſculentis &amp; Poculentis,</hi> but
that was with moderation and temperance, <hi>Ne jejuniorum doctrinam
rubentibus buccis praedicant;</hi> But afterwards, when the pomp and
exceſs of <hi>Viſitors</hi> required ſuch proviſions as were grievous and
intolerable to the Churches and Religious houſes, then every
Church and ſuch Houſe was reaſonably Taxed, and for that every
<hi>Proxie</hi> was reduced to a certain ſum of money, payable yearly, in the
nature of a Penſion, to the Ordinary, who had power of Viſitation
<hi>de mero Jure,</hi> as is ſaid 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer 273. b.</hi> After the <hi>Procuration</hi>
of Victuals was reduced to a certain ſum, the Churches and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
houſes paid it to the ordinary yearly, albeit he made not any
<hi>Viſitation:</hi> And ſo the Rule of <hi>Ceſſante cauſa ceſſat effectus</hi> doth not
hold in this caſe. Theſe certain ſums of money which come in lieu
of <hi>Proxies,</hi> and retain the name of <hi>Proxies,</hi> are by ancient Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
made parcel of the certain and ſettled Revenues of the Biſhop,
do remain for ever, and are not ſubject to extinguiſhment. And
at this day the King himſelf pays and allows <hi>Proxies</hi> out of all the
Impropriations which he hath in his poſſeſſion; for which reaſon
in every Leaſe made by the King of a Rectory Impropriate, there
is a Covenant on the Leſſee's part, that he ſhall bear and pay all
<hi>Proxies, Synodals, Penſions, &amp;c.</hi> And as for the [<hi>Saving</hi>] in the Act
of 33 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 5. it is not an idle or <hi>Flattering Saving,</hi> but real and
effectual: for it was agreed before, that theſe <hi>Proxies</hi> were in being
at the time of making the Act, and are not extinguiſhed by the
Surrender of the Religious houſes; for their Corporations are not
diſſolved till the Religious perſons have relinquiſhed their houſes
and are diſperſed. And ſuch things as were in being at the time of
making the Act, may well be preſerved and ſaved by the Act;
albeit the things which were extinct before, cannot be revived by
a <hi>Saving,</hi> without expreſs words of <hi>Grant</hi> and Reſtitution. As to
the Second point, it was Reſolved, That the <hi>Proxies</hi> in their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
nature being Duties payable for <hi>Viſitation,</hi> are grantable to the
King, and the King is capable of ſuch a Grant, ſpecially when the
ſaid duties are converted to a ſum of money certain, in the nature
of a Penſion or Annuity. For by the Ancient Law of the Realm,
the King had power to <hi>Viſit,</hi> reform, and correct all Abuſes and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normities
in the Church: And by the Statutes made in the time of
King <hi>H.</hi> 8. the Crown was but remitted and reſtored to his ancient
Juriſdiction, which had been uſurped by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome. 33 Ed.</hi>
3. <hi>tit. Ayd del Roy 103, Reges ſacro oleo uncti Spiritualis Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionis
ſunt Capaces.</hi> And <hi>Proxies</hi> are profits of the Juriſdiction,
10 <hi>H. 7. 18. Rex eſt mixta perſona cum Sacerdote:</hi> So the King ſhall
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:95379:86"/>
have Tithes by the Common Law, whereof no meer Lay-perſon
was capable, 22 <hi>Aſſiſ. pl. 75. 21 H.</hi> 7. 1. The King himſelf may
<hi>Viſit</hi> his Free Chappels and Hoſpitals, 8 <hi>Aſſ. p. 29. N. Br. 42. a.</hi>
And <hi>Caſſanae,</hi> in <hi>Catol. Glo. mund. par. 5. Conſ.</hi> 24, cites a Text of
the Canon Law, viz. <hi>Quod omnes Reges dicuntur Clerici,</hi> alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Text, which faith; <hi>Quod Cauſa Spiritualis committi poteſt
Principi Laico.</hi> And whereas it was ſaid, that in reſpect of the
grandeur of the King and his Train, competent <hi>Proxies</hi> cannot be
provided for him, and by conſequence a Grant thereof cannot be
made to him; that Objection is removed, in that the <hi>Proxies</hi> at the
time of that Grant was reduced to certain reaſonable ſums of money.
Alſo the Rule of the Canon Law was not rightly and fully cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
for the Rule is, <hi>Procuratio exhibenda eſt ſecundum qualitatem
perſonae viſitantis, &amp; ſubſtantiam Viſitatorum.</hi> It was alſo Reſolved,
that the Biſhop with the aſſent of his Clergy, might well grant the
<hi>Proxies</hi> to the King, for that the Law hath qualified the perſon of
the King to receive ſuch a Grant, albeit it be ſuch a Prerogative of
the Biſhop as may not be aſſigned to any other perſon: As the
Creation-money of a Duke or Earl may be granted and ſurrendred
to the King, although it can be granted to a Subject. Alſo the
<hi>Proxies</hi> being now reduced to certain ſums of money, and ſo made
part of the certain ſettled and perpetual Revenue of the Biſhop,
may be granted by him as well as a part of the Tithes, or an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity,
or any of his Rents, Services, or other Hereditaments Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.
And as to the Third point it was alſo Reſolved and Adjudged,
That the Unity of Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Proxies</hi> with the Rectories im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
and religious Houſes, out of which the <hi>Proxies</hi> are pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
do not extinguiſh the <hi>Proxies</hi> in the hands of the King, but
ſuſpends the payment of them <hi>tantum pro tempore, quouſque,</hi> or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
the King by his Grant ſhall ſever the one from the other. To
conclude, The Caſe of <hi>Tithes</hi> is parallel to the Caſe of <hi>Proxies,</hi> and
agrees therewith in all points; For as <hi>Inſtruction</hi> was the cauſe of the
payment of Tithes: So <hi>Viſitation,</hi> which is ever accompanied with
Inſtruction, <hi>Littl. ca. de Frankalmoigne 30. b.</hi> was the cauſe of the
<hi>Proxies.</hi> And as Tithes are now due and payable to Lay-perſons
which have purchaſed Impropriate Rectories, although they do not
give any Inſtruction: So <hi>Proxies</hi> are due and payable to Ordinaries,
out of the Impropriations and Religious houſes diſſolved, although
their <hi>Viſitation</hi> ceaſes. And as none can preſcribe <hi>de non decimando,</hi>

               <p>(1.) THe <hi>Chancellor</hi> of a Dioceſs is a <hi>Church-Lawyer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Stat. 32 H. 8. cap. 15.</note> or the
<hi>Biſhops-Lawyer,</hi> or that perſon who is Commiſſionated
to be aiding and aſſiſting to the Biſhop in his Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
not confined to any one place of the Dioceſs, nor limited (as the
Biſhops Commiſſaries are) only to ſome certain cauſes of the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction;
but every where throughout the whole Dioceſs ſupplying
the Biſhops abſence, in all matters and cauſes Eccleſiaſtical within
his Dioceſs. By the Statute of 37 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 17. a Doctor of the Civil
Law lawfully deputed, may exerciſe all Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction,
and the Cenſures thereof. By this <hi>Chancellor</hi> the Biſhop within
his Dioceſs keeps his Court according to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, in
all matters pertaining to his Juriſdiction, or otherwiſe relating more
immediately to the Church or Government of the Clergy. As
Biſhops in their Epiſcopal audience have had in all Ages the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of all matters Eccleſiaſtical, as well Civil as Criminal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Juriſdiction of their Dioceſs: ſo they have ever had to that
end their <hi>Chancellors,</hi> whom the Law calls <hi>Eccleſiecdici</hi> or <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coporum
Ecdici,</hi> perſons experienced in the Civil and <hi>Canon</hi> Laws,
to aſſiſt them in matters of Judgment; and thoſe whom we now
call the <hi>Biſhops Chancellours,</hi> are the very ſelf ſame perſons in
Office, that anciently did exerciſe Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction under
Biſhops, and were called <hi>Eccleſiecdici.</hi> Papias <hi>per</hi> Gothofred <hi>in L.

Biſhops Authority every where within the Dioceſs for matters of
Juriſdiction, and in that the Biſhops and They make but one <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory</hi>)
are called the Biſhop's <hi>Vicars General,</hi> both in reſpect of their
Authority, which extendeth throughout the whole Dioceſs, as
alſo to diſtinguiſh them from the Commiſſaries of Biſhops, whoſe
Authority, as it is reſtrained only to ſome certain place of the
Dioceſs, ſo alſo to ſome certain cauſes of the Juriſdiction, limited
unto them by the Biſhops; for which reaſon the Law calls them
<hi>Officiales Foraneos, quaſi Officiales aſtricti cuidam foro Dioeceſeos

               <p>(2.) Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> in his <hi>View of the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Law</hi> ſays,
that <hi>Chancellors</hi> of Dioceſſes are nigh of as great Antiquity as Biſhops
themſelves, and are ſuch neceſſary Officers to Biſhops, that every Biſhop
muſt of neceſſity have a Chancellor; and that if any Biſhop ſhould ſeem
to be ſo compleat within himſelf, as not to need a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> yet the
Archbiſhop of the Province, in caſe of refuſal, may put a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> on
him, in that the Law preſumes the Government of a whole
Dioceſs a matter of more weight, than can be well ſuſtained by one
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95379:88"/>
perſon alone; and that although the Nomination of the Chancellour
is in the Biſhop, yet his Authority is derived from the Law. <hi>Hoſtienſ.
Sum. de Offic. Vicar. nu.</hi> 2. For which reaſon the Law underſtands
him as an Ordinary, as well as the Biſhop. <hi>Hoſtienſ. ibid.</hi> It is moſt
probable, that the multiplicity and variety of Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes
introduced the uſe and Office of <hi>Chancellors</hi> originally; for after
that Princes had granted to Eccleſiaſtical perſons their Cauſes and
their Conſiſtories, and Circumſtances varying theſe Cauſes into a
more numerous multiplication, than were capable of being defined
by like former Preſidents, neceſſity call'd for new Deciſions, and
they for ſuch Judges as were experienced in ſuch Laws as were
adapted to matters of an Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance; which would
have been too prejudicial an Avocation of Biſhops from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of their more Divine Function, had not the office of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi>
in determining ſuch matters, been an expedient to prevent
the ſaid prejudice or inconvenience.</p>

That upon the days of the Viſitation every Chancellor, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon,
Commiſſary and Official, as alſo at the ordinary time when
Church-wardens are Sworn, ſhall deliver them ſuch Books of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
as whereon to ground their Preſentments. Alſo, that they
ſhall not ſuffer any to be cited into Eccleſiaſtical Courts by any
General proceſs of <hi>Quorum Nomina;</hi> nor the ſame perſon to be
cited into ſeveral Eccleſiaſtical Courts for one and the ſame Crime,
for which end the <hi>Chancellour</hi> and <hi>Archdeacon</hi> are within one month
next after the Biſhops Viſitation, mutually to certifie each other
under their Hands and Seals, the Names and Crimes of all ſuch as
were Preſented in the ſaid Viſitation. Nor ſhall any <hi>Chancellor,</hi>
or other Eccleſiaſtical Judge, ſuffer any Judicial Act to be ſped
otherwiſe than in open Court, or in preſence of the Regiſter, or his
Deputy, or other perſon by Law allowed to ſpeed the ſame; nor
ſhall have (without the Biſhops conſent) any more Seals of Office
than one. Nor ſhall any man be admitted a <hi>Chancellor,</hi> or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
any Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, under the age of 26 years,
and learned in the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Laws, and is at leaſt a
Maſter of Arts, or Bachelor of Law, and ſhall firſt have taken the
Oath of Supremacy in the Biſhops preſence,<note place="margin">Edit. 1562.</note> or in open Court, and
have ſubſcribed the Articles of Religion, and ſwear that to the
utmoſt of his underſtanding he will deal uprightly and juſtly in his
Office, without reſpect, favour, or reward.</p>
               <p>(4.) <hi>Sutton</hi> Chancellor of the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> moved for a
Prohibition to ſtay a Suit before the Commiſſioners Eccleſiaſtical,
for that Articles were there exhibited againſt him, becauſe he being
a Divine, and having a Rectory with Cure of Souls, and never
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95379:88"/>
brought up in the Science of the Civil or Canon Laws, or having
any Intelligence in them, took upon him the Office of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor</hi>
of the Biſhop of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> whereas there were divers Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
and Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, and alſo directions from the
late King <hi>James,</hi> and from the King that now is, That none ſhould
be admitted to have thoſe Offices of Chancellorſhip to a Biſhop,
unleſs he were inſtructed and learned in the Canon and Civil Laws;
becauſe divers Caſes triable in the ſaid Court are of weight, and
the Judges there ought to have knowledge of the Laws, otherwiſe
they cannot adminiſter Right to the Kings Subjects. Upon theſe
Articles Mr. <hi>Sutton</hi> being examined, confeſſed that he was a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
and had a Spiritual Living, and that the Office of the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellorſhip
of the Biſhop is grantable for life, and that ſuch a Biſhop
of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> had granted to him the Office for his life, which the
Dean and Chapter had Confirmed, whereby he had a Freehold
therein, and ought to enjoy it during his life. And that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
this Anſwer they intended to proceed againſt him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he prayed to have a Prohibition, but the Court denied it; for
if he be a perſon unskilful in theſe Laws, and by Law ought not
to enjoy it, they may peradventure examine that; for although
a Lay-perſon, by his Admiſſion and Inſtitution to a Benefice hath a
Freehold, yet he may be ſued in the Spiritual Court, and deprived
for that Cauſe; but if he hath wrong, he may peradventure by
Aſſize try it; therefore a Prohibition was denied<note n="b" place="margin">Hill. 2 Car. C. B. <hi>Sut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's</hi> Caſe. Cro. Rep. Vid. dict. Caſe in <hi>Latch.</hi> Rep.</note>.</p>
               <p>(5.) The Conſiſtory Court of each Archbiſhop, and every Biſhop
of every Dioceſs within this Realm, is holden before the Biſhops
Chancellor in the Cathedral Church,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Litt.</hi> Sect. 133. 136. 648.</note> or before his Commiſſary in
places of his Dioceſs far remote and diſtant from the Biſhops Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtory,
ſo as the <hi>Chancellor</hi> cannot call them to the Conſiſtory with
any conveniency or without great travel and vexation;<note place="margin">24 H. 4. c. 12.</note> for which
reaſon ſuch Commiſſary is called <hi>Commiſſarius Foraneus.</hi> From
theſe Conſiſtories the Appeal is to the Archbiſhop of either Province
reſpectively.</p>
               <p>(6.) By this word [<hi>Conſiſtory</hi>] is commonly underſtood that
place or Eccleſiaſtical Court of Juſtice, held by the Biſhops Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor
or Commiſſary in his Cathedral Church or other convenient
place of his Dioceſs, for the hearing and determining of matters
and Cauſes of Eccleſiaſtical cognizance, happening within that
Dioceſs<note n="c" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Litt. ibid.</hi> Vid. <hi>Co.</hi> Inſt. p. 4. fol. 338.</note>. But when this word refers to the Province of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>
then the chief and moſt ancient <hi>Conſiſtory</hi> is the Arch-biſhops
high Court of <hi>Arches,</hi> as the Court of Appeal from all
other Inferiour Conſiſtories within the ſaid Province. The ſame
word ſometimes refers to a Synod or Council of Eccleſiaſtical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
conven'd together, or to a Ceſſion or Aſſembly of Prelates;
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:95379:89"/>
but moſt uſually to the Spiritual Court for the deciding of matters
of Eccleſiaſtical cognizance. The word Conſiſtory (<hi>Conſiſtorium</hi>)
is ſuppoſed to be borrowed of the <hi>Italians,</hi> or rather <hi>Lombards,</hi>
ſignifying as much as (<hi>Praetorium</hi>) or <hi>Tribunal,</hi> being a word <hi>utri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſque

               <p>(9.) <hi>Lindwood</hi> in the Provincial Conſtitutions upon this word

Albeit, according to the vulgar acceptation of theſe words, we
refer <hi>Tribunal</hi> to any place of Judicature, but <hi>Conſiſtorium</hi> to that
only which is of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>(10.) This Chancellor of a Dioceſs, as he is <hi>Oculus Epiſcopi,</hi>
ought to have an eye into all parts of the Dioceſs, and hath imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
under the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Juriſdiction of all matters Eccleſiaſtical
within the ſame; not only for reformation of Manners, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
of Enormities of a Spiritual nature by Eccleſiaſtical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
but alſo in Cauſes Matrimonial, and Teſtamentary as to the
Probat of Wills, and granting Letters of Adminiſtration of the
Goods of a perſon dying Inteſtate, where there are not <hi>Bona Nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilia;</hi>
In which caſe the Will ſhall be proved, or Adminiſtration
granted by the Prerogative of the Archbiſhop: And wherever
there is an Adminiſtration duly granted, there the Adminiſtrator
doth almoſt in all points repreſent the perſon of the Inteſtate as
legally, as any Executor can the perſon of his Teſtator Teſtamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily.
For this Adminiſtrator, in conſtruction of the Common
Law, is that perſon to whoſe truſt, care, conduct, and management
the Goods and Chattels, Real and Perſonal, of the Inteſtate are
committed by the Ordinary, or ſuch other as under him is duly
Authorized to grant the ſame. But under this Notion or Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of Adminiſtrator, neither the <hi>Civil</hi> nor the <hi>Canon</hi> Law
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:95379:90"/>

Governours of Perſons, Places, or Things. <hi>Decret. Can. 23. q.</hi> 5.
<hi>cap. 26. &amp; Extra. Com. cap.</hi> 11. And it is moſt probable, that the
Common Law might (as ſome conceive) take its light, as to this
Officer under this notion as now practicable with us, from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
of the Emperour <hi>Leo. I. 28. nulli licere, C. de Epiſc. &amp; Cler.</hi>
whereby it is Ordained, <hi>That the Biſhop ſhall take care to ſee ſuch
Legacies duly performed, as are bequeathed for the Redemption of
Captives, in caſe the Teſtator appoint not one to execute his Will
in that particular.</hi> This power given to the Ordinary of making
Adminiſtrators in caſe of Inteſtation, and of Authorizing them to
act as Executors, is very ancient by the Statute-Law<note n="m" place="margin">Weſtm. 2. An. 13 Ed. 1. cap. 19. &amp; 31 Ed. 3. c. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to grant the Adminiſtration of the goods of him that dieth In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate,

               <p>(11.) A lawful Adminiſtrator may render his own Goods liable
to the Inteſtates Debts either by a <hi>Devaſtavit,</hi> or by a Falſe Plea Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicially;
and his Executor or Adminiſtrator ſhall not ſucceed him
in the Adminiſtration to his Inteſtate (unleſs qualified to require
Adminiſtration of both Inteſtates) but the Adminiſtration of the
firſt Inteſtates goods is <hi>de novo</hi> to be committed to his next of Kin, as
<hi>de bonis non Adm.</hi> And if a Stranger by any Act make himſelf
Executor <hi>de ſon tort,</hi> the Creditors and Legataries may not ſue him
as Adminiſtrator, albeit it be an Adminiſtration in Fact, but muſt
ſue him as Executor in his own wrong; who notwithſtanding is
not any further liable, than to the value of the Deceaſed's Goods,
as Aſſets in his hands. But in caſe the Ordinary ſhall, without
granting any Letters of Adminiſtration, make his Letters <hi>Ad Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendum,</hi>
in that caſe he makes himſelf liable to Actions <hi>pro tanto,</hi>
as if himſelf were actually poſſeſſed of the Goods of the deceaſed.
And here Note, That Funeral expences, according to the degree and
quality of the Deceaſed, are to be allowed of his Goods before any

By the Statute of 21 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 5. as alſo by the <hi>138th</hi> Canon
of the Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions, <hi>Apparitors</hi> are called <hi>Summoners</hi>
or <hi>Sumners;</hi> by which <hi>Canon</hi> the Abuſes aud Grievances pretended
to be practiced by ſuch <hi>Summoners</hi> or <hi>Apparitors</hi> are ſufficiently
redreſſed: For as the multitude of them is thereby abridged and
reſtrained by Decreeing and Ordaining, That no Biſhop or Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon,
or their Vicars or Officials, or other inferiour Ordinaries,
ſhall depute or have more <hi>Apparitors</hi> to ſerve their Juriſdictions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively,
than either they or their Predeceſſors were accuſtomed
to have <hi>Thirty</hi> years before the publiſhing the ſaid Eccleſiaſtical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions:
So it is likewiſe provided by the ſaid <hi>Canon,</hi> That the
ſaid <hi>Apparitors</hi> ſhall by themſelves faithfully execute their Offices,
and not by any colour or pretence whatſoever cauſe or ſuffer their
Mandats to be executed by any Meſſengers or Subſtitutes, unleſs
upon ſome good cauſe, to be firſt allowed and approved by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
of the place. It is alſo further Provided by the ſaid Canon,
That they ſhall not take upon them the Office of <hi>Promoters</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers</hi>
for the Court, nor ſhall exact more or greater Fees than are
preſcribed by the <hi>135th</hi> Canon of the ſaid Eccleſiaſtical Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
And in caſe either the number of <hi>Apparitors</hi> deputed ſhall
exceed the aforeſaid Limitation, or any of them offend in any of
the Premiſſes, the perſons deputing them (if they be Biſhops) ſhall
upon Admonition of their Superiour, diſcharge the perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
the Number ſo limited as aforeſaid: But if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by Inferiour Ordinaries, ſuch Ordinaries ſhall be ſuſpended
from the execution of their Office, until they have diſmiſs'd the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerary
Apparitors by them ſo deputed; and the parties themſelves
ſo deputed ſhall for ever be removed from the Office of <hi>Apparitors:</hi>
And in caſe being ſo diſmiſs'd and removed, they do not deſiſt from
the execution of their ſaid Offices, they are by the firſt ſaid Canon
to be proceeded againſt and puniſhed by Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures as
perſons contumacious to the Juriſdiction. And finally, if upon
experience the number of the ſaid <hi>Apparitors</hi> be too great in any
one Dioceſs, in the judgment of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for

abridge them to ſuch a number, as to himſelf ſhall ſeem meet and

was not according to that Statute, and the Summons to pay them
not according to the Statute, for the Demand ought to have been
by one who hath authority to receive them, which the <hi>Summoner</hi>
had not; And they held the Demand not good, although the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
certified it was duly made. And in the Caſe between the

Biſhop, that the Incumbent refuſed to pay his Tenths, is not Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory,

muſt be at the houſe of the Incumbent, and the Refuſal there.

<hi>Apparitor</hi> under the Biſhop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> maliciouſly and without
colour or cauſe of ſuſpicion of Incontinency, of his own proper
malice, procured the Plaintiff <hi>Ex Officio,</hi> upon pretence of Fame of
Incontinency with one <hi>Edith</hi> (whereas there was no ſuch Fame,
not juſt cauſe of Suſpicion) to be cited to the Conſiſtory Court of
<hi>Exeter,</hi> and there to be at great charges and vexation, until he
was cleared by Sentence, which was to his great diſcredit, and cauſe
of great Expences and Loſſes, for which, &amp;c. upon <hi>Not guilty</hi>
pleaded, and found for the Plaintiff it was moved by <hi>Aſhley,</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant,
in Arreſt of Judgment, That in this Caſe an Action lies
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:95379:91"/>
not: For he did nothing but as an Informer, and by virtue of his Office.
But all the Court (<hi>abſente Richardſon</hi>) held, That the Action well
lies: For it is alledged, That he <hi>falſo &amp; malitioſe</hi> cauſed him to be
Cited, upon pretence of Fame where there was no offence commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
And avers, That there was not any ſuch Fame; ſo as he did it
maliciouſly, and of his own head, and cauſed him to be unjuſtly
vexed, which was to raiſe gain to himſelf; whereupon they conceived,
That he being found guilty for it, the Action well lies; And therefore
Rule was given to enter Judgment for the Plaintiff, unleſs other cauſe
was ſhewn. And upon a ſecond motion, <hi>Richardſon</hi> Ch. Juſtice being
preſent, Judgment was given for the Plaintiff<note n="p" place="margin">Hill. 7. Car. rot. 1147. B. R. <hi>Carlion</hi> verſ. <hi>Mill.</hi> Cro. Rep.</note>. The Conſiſtory

For diſturbance of the Plaintiff in exerciſing of the Officialty of

and of the Office of Commiſſary of the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi>
Upon <hi>Not guilty</hi> pleaded a ſpecial Verdict was found, That there

granted to one perſon for life until 1609, and in 30 <hi>Eliz.</hi> ſo
granted to Dr. <hi>Chippindale,</hi> and after in 1609 granted to him and
one <hi>Ed. Clerk</hi> for their Two lives, no Surrender being actually made
by Dr. <hi>Chippendale.</hi> Afterwards, 1614 both Offices were granted,
the one by the Archdeacon, the other by the Biſhop to Sir <hi>Jo. Lambe,</hi>
and to the ſaid <hi>Ed. Clerk,</hi> and theſe Grants confirmed by the
Dean and Chapter; That in <hi>An.</hi> 1622. Dr. <hi>Chippendale</hi> died, and
afterwards the Archdeacon who granted that Office, and the Biſhop
who granted the Office of Commiſſary, died; and the Biſhop of
<hi>Lincolne</hi> who now is, and the now Archdeacon, by ſeveral Patents
granted theſe Offices to the Plaintiff, who was at the time of the
Grant of the Patent a Lay-perſon, and Bachelor of the Civil Law
only: And they find the Stat. of 37 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 17. That Lay-perſons
married or unmarried, being Doctors of the Civil Law, may be
Commiſſaries, Officials, Scribes, or Regiſters, and that the Plaintiff
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95379:92"/>
exerciſed theſe Offices, and the Defendant diſturbed him. Upon this
the matter being argued at the Bar, was reduced only to theſe Two
Queſtions: (1) Whether the Patent to the Plaintiff, being a Lay-perſon,
and not a Doctor of the Law, were good, or reſtrained by
the Statute of 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. And as to that point all the Court conceived,
The Grant was good, for the Statute doth not reſtrain any ſuch
Grant: And it is but an affirmance of the Common Law, where it
was doubted, if a Lay or Married perſon might have ſuch Offices;
and to avoid ſuch Doubts this Statute was made; which explains,
That ſuch Grants are good enough; and it is but an Affirmative
Statute, and there is no reſtriction therein: And although Doctors
of the Law (though Lay-perſons or Married) ſhall have ſuch
Offices; yet this is not any reſtriction, That none others ſhall have
them but Doctors of the Law, and the Statute mentions as well
Regiſters and Scribes, as Commiſſaries, and that a Doctor of the
Law ſhall have them; yet in Common experience ſuch perſons as
are meerly Lay, and not Doctors, have enjoyed ſuch Offices. And
for this very point was a Caſe in this Court, <hi>Hill. 35 Eliz. Rot.</hi> 181.
between <hi>Pratt</hi> and <hi>Stock,</hi> where, upon Demurrer, this Statute was
pleaded againſt the Plaintiff, to whom a Commiſſaryſhip was
granted, being but a Bachelor of Law; and he having granted Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration,
the Grant was adjudged good, and the <hi>Book of Entries,</hi>
484, <hi>&amp;</hi> 489. was allowed good; wherefore they Reſolved the
Grant was well enough. And it was alſo Reſolved, That where
an Officer for life accepts of another Grant of the ſame Office to
him, and to another, it is not any Surrender of the firſt Grant.
The Second point was, Whether the office of the Officialty of the
Archdeaconry, and the office of the Commiſſary of the Biſhop, be
grantable by the Statutes of 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> becauſe it was
pretended, they were not parcel of the Poſſeſſions of the Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick
or Archdeaconry, ſo as they could have any profits by them,
and then the Statute doth not reſtrain the Grants of them. But all
the Court Reſolved, They were within the words and intent of the
Statutes; for they be <hi>Hereditaments,</hi> and are pertaining unto them;
And that a Grant of theſe Offices to Two, where they were only
grantable to One for life, and being granted in Reverſion, it is a
void Grant by the Statutes againſt the Succeſſors; For the Statutes
reſtrain all Grants of any thing to be avoidable againſt the Succeſſor,
beſides Grants of neceſſity and Leaſes for Three lives, or 21 years,
where the ancient Rent is reſerved: And all other Grants, as well
of Offices as of other things, not warranted by the Statutes, are
made void as againſt the Succeſſors, <hi>Vid. Coke 10. fo.</hi> 60. the Biſhop

of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> by the Commiſſioners 3 <hi>Jac.</hi> appointed to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
the defects of Chancellors, and that he was not read in the

that <hi>A.</hi> the Biſhop of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had made him Chancellor by Deed; and
that was Confirmed by the Dean and Chapter, by which he had
a Frank-tenement in that Office, &amp;c. And Mr. <hi>Glanvile</hi> moved for
a Prohibition, but it was denied by the Court; for it is lawful for
the Commiſſioners to deprive for Inſufficiency, that being within
their Commiſſion; But in a Suit in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for the
Profits of that Office, ſuppoſing the Grant of that by the Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
does not bind the Succeſſor; as it was in Dr. <hi>Barker</hi>'s Caſe, there
a Prohibition ſhall be awarded, becauſe the profits are Temporal. But

               <p>(20.) The Biſhop of <hi>Landaff</hi> granted the office of his Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorſhip
to Dr. <hi>Trevor</hi> and one <hi>Griffin,</hi> to be exerciſed by them either
joyntly or ſeverally. Dr. <hi>Trevor</hi> for 350 <hi>l.</hi> releaſed all his Right in
the ſaid Office to <hi>Griffin,</hi> ſo that <hi>G.</hi> was the ſole Officer, and then
after died. After this the Biſhop grants the ſaid Chancellorſhip to
<hi>R.</hi> (being a Practicioner in the Civil Law) for his life. Dr. <hi>Trevor</hi>
ſurmiſing, that himſelf was the ſole Officer by Survivorſhip, made
Dr. <hi>Lloyd</hi> his Subſtitute to execute the ſaid office for him, and for
that, that he was diſturbed by <hi>R.</hi> the ſaid Dr. <hi>Trevor</hi> being Subſtitute
to the Judge of the <hi>Arches,</hi> granted an Inhibition to inhibite the ſaid
<hi>R.</hi> from executing the ſaid Office. The Libel contained, <hi>That one</hi> R.
<hi>hindered and diſturbed Dr.</hi> Lloyd, <hi>ſo that he could not execute the ſaid
Office.</hi> Againſt theſe proceedings in the <hi>Arches</hi> a Prohibition was
prayed, and day given to Dr. <hi>Trevor</hi> to ſhew cauſe why it ſhould not
be granted. They urged, that the Office was Spiritual, for which
reaſon the diſcuſſing of the Right thereof appertaineth to the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Courts. But all the Judges agreed, That though the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

to give up his <hi>Staff,</hi> was Anſwered by him, That he would give up
his <hi>Staff</hi> only to him of whom he firſt received the ſame: And ſo
the old Biſhop went to St. <hi>Edward</hi>'s <hi>Tomb,</hi> and there offered up his
<hi>Staff</hi> and <hi>Ring</hi> with theſe words, viz. <hi>Of Thee, O holy Edward, I

the ſaid Act, the Court of <hi>Convocation,</hi> as to the making of new

(2) Reſolved by <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice, <hi>Warburton, Daniel</hi> and <hi>Foſter,</hi>
Juſtices, That the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is reſtrained by the
23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. cap. 9. to cite any one out of his own Dioceſs: For <hi>Diae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſis

Epiſcopatus, &amp; Commiſſa gubernatio unius, &amp;c.</hi> And is derived a <hi>Di,
Duo, &amp; Electio, quia ſeparat duas Juriſdictiones:</hi> And becauſe the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath a peculiar Juriſdiction in <hi>London;</hi>
for this cauſe it is fitly ſaid in the Title, Preamble, and body of the
Act, that when the Archbiſhop ſitting in his Exempt peculiar in
<hi>London,</hi> cites one dwelling in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he cites him out of the Biſhop
of <hi>London</hi>'s Dioceſs; Therefore, out of the Dioceſs. And in the
clauſe of the penalty of 10 <hi>l.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Out of the Dioceſs, &amp;c. where
the party dwelleth;</hi> which agrees with the ſignification of <hi>Dioceſs</hi>
before. 2. The body of the Act is, <hi>No perſon ſhall be henceforth
cited before any Ordinary, &amp;c. out of the Dioceſs or peculiar Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
where the perſon ſhall be dwelling;</hi> and if ſo, then <hi>à Fortiori,</hi>
the Court of <hi>Arches,</hi> which ſits in a Peculiar, may not cite others
out of another Dioceſs. And the words [<hi>out of the Dioceſs</hi>] are
meant of the Dioceſs or Juriſdiction of the Ordinary where he
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95379:98"/>
dwelleth. And from the Preamble of the Act the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
and inferrs, That the intention of the Act was to reduce the
Archbiſhop to his proper Dioceſs, unleſs in theſe five Caſes, <hi>viz.</hi>
(1) For any Spiritual offence or cauſe committed, or omitted, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Right and Duty by the Biſhop, &amp;c. which word [<hi>omitted</hi>]
proves there ought to be a default in the Ordinary. (2) Except it
be in Caſe of Appeal, and other lawful cauſe, where the party ſhall
find himſelf grieved by the Ordinary, after the matter there firſt
begun; Therefore, it ought to be firſt begun before the Ordinary.
(3) In caſe the Biſhop or Ordinary, &amp;c. dare not, or will not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
the party to be ſued before him. (4) In caſe the Biſhop or
Judge of the place, within whoſe Juriſdiction, or before whom the
Suit by this Act ſhould be begun and proſecuted, be party, directly
or indirectly, to the matter or cauſe of the ſame Suit. (5) In caſe
any Biſhop or other inferiour Judge under him, &amp;c. make Requeſt
to the Archbiſhop, Biſhop, or other inferiour Ordinary or Judge;
and that to be done in Caſes only, where the Law Civil or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
doth affirm, &amp;c. The Lord <hi>Coke</hi> takes notice alſo of Two <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſoes</hi>
in that Act, which do likewiſe explain it; <hi>viz.</hi> That it ſhall
be lawful for every Archbiſhop, to cite any perſon inhabiting in any
Biſhops Dioceſs in his Province for matter of <hi>Hereſie:</hi> By which
(<hi>ſays he</hi>) it appears, That for all cauſes not excepted, he is prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by the Act. (2) There is a <hi>Saving</hi> for the Archbiſhop, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
any perſon out of the Dioceſs where he ſhall be dwelling, to
the probat of any: Teſtament: Which <hi>Proviſo</hi> ſhould be vain, if
notwithſtanding that Act he ſhould have concurrent Juriſdiction
with every Ordinary throughout his whole Province: Wherefore
it was concluded, That the Archbiſhop out of his Dioceſs, unleſs
in the Caſes excepted, is prohibited by the 23 <hi>H. 8. c</hi> 9. to cite any
man out of any other Dioceſs: which Act is but a Law declaratory
of the Ancient Canons, and a true Expoſition thereof, as appears
by the Canon, <hi>Cap. Romana in Sext. de Appellat. &amp;</hi> c. <hi>de Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenti.

An. 1 Jac. 1603. Can.</hi> 94. who gives us further to underſtand in
this Caſe between <hi>Porter</hi> and <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> That the Archbiſhop of this
Realm, before that Act, had power <hi>Legantine</hi> from the Pope; By
which they had Authority not only over all, but concurrent Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
with every Ordinary, &amp;c. not as Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi>

               <p>(6.) The <hi>Prerogative</hi> Court of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
is that Court, wherein all Teſtaments are proved, and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
granted of the Goods and Chattels of ſuch perſons, as dying
within his Province, had at the time of their death <hi>Bona Notabilia</hi>
in ſome other Dioceſs, than that wherein they dyed; which <hi>Bona No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilia</hi>
regularly muſt amount to the value of Five pounds, ſave in the
Dioceſs of <hi>London,</hi> where it is <hi>Ten</hi> pounds by Compoſition. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat
of every Biſhops Teſtament,<note place="margin">Co. Inſt. par. 4. cap. 74.</note> and the granting of the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Goods and Chattels, albeit he hath not Goods but within
his own Juriſdiction, doth belong to the Archbiſhop. The like Court
hath the Archbiſhop of <hi>York.</hi> From this Court lies the Appeal to the
King in Chancery. If one make two Executors, one of <hi>ſeventeen</hi> years
of Age,<note place="margin">Pigot <hi>and</hi> Gaſcoin's <hi>Caſe.</hi> Brownl. <hi>Rep. par.</hi> 1. Caſes in Law, &amp;c.</note> and the other under, Adminiſtration during the Minority is
void, becauſe he of <hi>ſeventeen</hi> years old may execute the Will, if
Adminiſtration during the Minority in ſuch caſe be granted; And
if the Adminiſtrator brings his Action, the Executor may well
releaſe the Debt. One was cited to appear in the Prerogative Court
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which lived out of the Dioceſs of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95379:99"/>

which willeth, that none ſhall be cited to appear out of his Dioceſs,

yet it was ſaid, that in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. and Q. <hi>Ma.</hi> that the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had uſed to cite any man dwelling out of
his Dioceſs, and within any Dioceſs within his Province, to appear
before him in the Prerogative-Court, and this without the aſſent of
the Ordinary of the Dioceſs: But it was Reſolved by the Court,
that this was by force of the power <hi>Legatine</hi> of the Archbiſhop,
that (as <hi>Lindwood</hi> ſaith) ought to be expreſſed in the Prohibition,<note place="margin">Trin. 8 Jac. Brown l. p. 2.</note>

Inſtitutes, <hi>par. 3. cap.</hi> 69. gives us the Reſolutions upon the Statute
of 21 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 5. That if a man makes his Teſtament in paper,
and dieth poſſeſſed of Goods and Chattels above the value of 40 <hi>l.</hi>
and the Executor cauſeth the Teſtament to be tranſcribed in parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and bringeth both to the Ordinary, &amp;c. to be proved; It is
at the Election of the Ordinary, whether he will put the Seal and
Probat to the Original in paper, or the Tranſcript in parchment,
but whether he put them to the one or to the other, there can be
taken of the Executor, &amp;c. in the whole but 5 <hi>s.</hi> and not above;
<hi>viz. 2 s. 6 d.</hi> to the Ordinary, &amp;c. and his Miniſters, and 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi>

at his liberty, to refuſe the ſaid 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> and to have for writing
every ten Lines of the ſame Teſtament, whereof every Line to
contain ten inches, one penny. If the Executor deſire that the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
in paper may be tranſcribed in parchment, he muſt agree
with the party for the Tranſcribing; but the Ordinary, &amp;c. can take
nothing for that, nor for the Examination of the Tranſcript with
the Original, but only 2 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> for the whole duty belonging to
him. Where the Goods of the deceaſed do not exceed five pound,
the Ordinary, &amp;c. ſhall take nothing, and the Scribe to have only
for writing of the Probat ſix pence: ſo the ſaid Teſtament be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in writing, with Wax thereunto affixed ready to be ſealed.
Where the Goods of the deceaſed do amount to above the value of
five pound, and do not exceed the ſum of forty pound, there ſhall
be taken for the whole but 3 <hi>s. 6 d.</hi> whereof to the Ordinary, &amp;c.

leſs is to be taken. And where any perſon requires a Copy or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
of the Teſtament ſo proved, or Inventory ſo made, the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
&amp;c. ſhall take for the Search, and making of the Copy of the
Teſtament or Inventory (if the Goods exceed not five pound)
ſix pence; and (if the Goods exceed five pound, and exceed not

then two ſhillings ſix pence, or to take for every Ten lines thereof

               <p>(7.) The Court of <hi>Audience, Curia Audientiae Cantuarienſis.</hi>
The Lord <hi>Coke</hi> touching the Juriſdiction of Courts, taking notice
of this of the <hi>Audience</hi> among other of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts
<note n="n" place="margin">Co. Inſt. 4. par. cap. 74.</note>, ſays, That this Court is kept by the Archbiſhop in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,
and meddleth not with any matter between party and party of
any contentious Juriſdiction, but dealeth with matters <hi>pro forma,</hi>
and Confirmations of Biſhops Elections, Conſecrations, and the
like, and with matters of voluntary Juriſdiction, as the granting
of the Guardianſhip of the Spiritualties <hi>Sede vacante</hi> of Biſhops,
Admiſſions and Inſtitutions to Benefices, diſpenſing with Banns
of Matrimony, and ſuch like. This Court did belong to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop
of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and was in point of Authority equal with,
but in point of Dignity and Antiquity inferiour to the Court of
Arches. It ſeems that Anciently the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>
did hear divers Cauſes of Eccleſiaſtical cognizance Extra-judicially,
and at home in his own Palace, wherein, before he would come to
any final determination, his uſage was to commit the diſcuſſion
thereof to certain perſons learned in the Laws <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi>
who thereupon were ſtyled his <hi>Auditors,</hi> whence in proceſs of time
it center'd in one particular perſon ſtyled, <hi>Cauſarum Negotiorumque
Audientiae</hi> Cantuarienſis <hi>Auditor ſeu Officialis:</hi> And from hence
the Original of this Court is properly derived. With this office of
the <hi>Auditor</hi> the Chancery of the Archbiſhop is ſaid to have been
heretofore commonly joyned, not controverting any matters of
<hi>contentious</hi> Juriſdiction in any deciſions of Cauſes between Plaintiff
and Defendant,<note place="margin">

the Biſhop) have acceſs to their Dioceſan, <hi>Et quod Praelati perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95379:100"/>
not altogether improbable, but that from the practice hereof this
Court of <hi>Audience</hi> anciently had its Original, as aforeſaid; And
although it be not now in uſe as heretofore, yet conſidering the
Subject-matter it only took cognizance of, it was a good Expedient
to prevent many Suits at Law <hi>in Foro Contentioſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(8.) <hi>Faculty</hi> [or, <hi>Court of Faculties</hi>] in the ſenſe here meant
and intended, muſt not be underſtood according to its original and
genuine ſignification, but as a term of Art according to a limited
conſtruction, reſtrained under that peculiar notion and particular
underſtanding which the Law hath of it, in reference to a branch of
the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction: And ſo it is underſtood and commonly
uſed for that Priviledge or eſpecial Power, which is legally granted
to a man by Licenſe, favour, indulgence, and diſpenſation to have or
do that, which otherwiſe by the Canon Law he could not; as to
eat Fleſh upon days prohibited; to Marry without Banns firſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed;
to hold Two or more Eccleſiaſtical Benefices incompatible;
the Son to ſucceed the Father in his Benefice,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Vaugh.</hi> Rep. fo. 25.</note> and ſuch like. A <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty</hi>
granted to one, who is not Incumbent, to take a void Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
is void: But a <hi>Faculty</hi> to one, who is Incumbent of a Benefice
to retain the ſame, is good. It is called <hi>Faculties</hi> in the Statute of
28 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 16. Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> makes mention of the Court of <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi>
although it holds no Plea of Controverſie<note n="o" place="margin">Co. par. 4. Inſt. cap. 74.</note>. It belongs to
the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and his chief Officer thereof is called
<hi>Magiſter ad Facultates,</hi> whoſe power is to grant Diſpenſations to the
ends and purpoſes aforeſaid; and ſo may every Dioceſan, as to that
of Marriage, and eating of Fleſh on days prohibited. <hi>Faculty</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

and his Succeſſors to grant Diſpenſations, Faculties, &amp;c. by himſelf

but only to ſuch as have been deviſed, made, and Ordained within this

King and his Progenitors the People of this Realm have taken at their
free liberty, and by their own conſent, to be uſed among them, and have
bound themſelves by long uſe and cuſtome to the obſervance of the ſame,
not as to the obſervance of the Laws of any Foreign Prince, Potentate,
or Prelate; but as to the accuſtomed and ancient Laws of this Realm,
originally eſtabliſhed as Laws of the ſame by the ſaid ſufferance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and cuſtome, and not otherwiſe: it ſtandeth with natural equity
and good reaſon, that all ſuch human Laws made within this Realm,
or induced into this Realm by the ſaid Sufferance, Conſent, and Cuſtome,
ſhould be</hi> Diſpenced <hi>with, abrogated, amplified or diminiſhed by the
King and his Parliament, or by ſuch perſons as the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

Lond. 6, &amp; 7 Eliz. Dyer 233. a. Jo. Packhurſt</hi> being elected to the
Biſhoprick of <hi>Norwich,</hi> before that he was created Biſhop, obtained
a <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> from the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> (by
force of the Statute of <hi>Faculties</hi>) to retain a Parſonage which he
had before <hi>in Commendam,</hi> for Three years, <hi>viz. à Feſto Michaelis
An. Dom. 1560. uſque ad idem Feſtum, in An.</hi> 1563. Before the firſt
Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael, Packhurſt</hi> is created Biſhop, and afterwards he
reſigned the Benefice. And the Queſtion was, whether that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
became void by the reſignation of <hi>Packhurſt,</hi> or by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
to the Biſhoprick? And it was adjudged, That the Church
became void by his Reſignation: Which proves, That by virtue of
the ſaid <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> he continued Parſon until he had
Reſign'd. <hi>Vid. N. Br. 36. h.</hi> If a Parſon who hath a <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation</hi>
to hold his Rectory, be created a Biſhop, and after the
Patron preſent another Incumbent, who is Inſtituted and Inducted,
now the Biſhop ſhall have a <hi>Spoliation</hi> againſt that Incumbent;
which proves that his real poſſeſſion in the Parſonage always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
by virtue of the ſaid <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Diſpenſation.</hi> And in this
Caſe of a <hi>Commendam</hi> in Sir <hi>Joh. Davis</hi> Reports, this difference is
put between a <hi>Faculty to take a Benefice,</hi> and a <hi>Faculty to retain a
Benefice, viz.</hi> That a <hi>Faculty</hi> granted to one who is not Incumbent
to <hi>Take</hi> a void Benefice, is void: And a <hi>Faculty</hi> to one who is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
of a Benefice to <hi>Retain</hi> the ſame Benefice, is good. By
virtue of theſe <hi>Faculties, Diſpenſations,</hi> and <hi>Proviſions</hi> from the
Pope, <hi>Edmond</hi> the Monk of <hi>Bury,</hi> who was a Miniſter in the Court
of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. had many Benefices; as appears in the foreſaid
Caſe of the Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids, 11 H.</hi> 4. And <hi>Hankford</hi> ſaid in
the ſame Caſe, <hi>fo. 191. a.</hi> That by virtue of ſuch <hi>Faculty</hi> one and
the ſame perſon had been Abbot of <hi>Glaſtenbury,</hi> and Biſhop alſo of
another Church <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> and had the Poſſeſſions and Dignity
of both at the ſame time. Likewiſe <hi>Hen. Chichley</hi> (who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95379:102"/>
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>) being a Prebend in the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral
Church of <hi>Sarum,</hi> was elected Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his Conſecration, the Pope reciting by his Bull, that he was
elected Biſhop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> granted him a <hi>Faculty</hi> and power to
hold and enjoy all his other Benefices, till the Pope ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
order, &amp;c. <hi>Vid. Nov. Deciſ. Rot.</hi> 331. And that theſe <hi>Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
or Diſpenſations to hold Benefices <hi>in Commendam,</hi> were granted
in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> in the time of King <hi>H.</hi> 5. appears in <hi>Lindw.
de Praeb. c. Audiſtis. ver. Diſpenſatione.</hi> And although in caſe of
<hi>Hen. Beauford</hi> aforeſaid, it was held, That the Diſpenſation came
too late, it being granted after the Biſhop was created Cardinal; yet
afterwards in the time of King <hi>H.</hi> 8. Cardinal <hi>Wolſey,</hi> having, before
he was created Cardinal, obtained a Bull from the Pope, to retain
the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>York</hi> as perpetual Adminiſtrator, and the
Abbey of St. <hi>Albans in perpetuam Commendam,</hi> he held both du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
his life by virtue of the ſaid <hi>Faculty</hi> or <hi>Diſpenſation. Vid.</hi>
27 <hi>H. 8. 15. b.</hi> By theſe Preſidents and Authorities it is evident,
That before the making of the foreſaid Statute of <hi>Faculties,</hi> ſuch
Diſpenſations were had and obtained at the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> to hold
<hi>in Commendam</hi> Eccleſiaſtical Benefices in <hi>England.</hi> But the Truth
is (as in the foreſaid Caſe <hi>de Commenda. Davis</hi> Rep.) ſuch <hi>Faculties</hi>
or Diſpenſations granted by the Pope touching Eccleſiaſtical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
in <hi>England</hi> were ever contrary to the Law of the Realm, for

and the nature of the <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> is to exempt him from the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

<hi>B.</hi> who moves for a Prohibition, becauſe he had there pleaded
<hi>Plene Adminiſtravit,</hi> and proved that by one Witneſs, and they
would not allow it. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> before the Statute of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. the
proper Suit for Tithes was there, and if they allow not one Witneſs
to prove payment, a Prohibition ſhall be granted. And he put

it was Ruled; if the Eccleſiaſtical Court will not allow that Plea
which is good in our Law, a Prohibition ſhall be granted, as in the
Caſe of Tithes. And he ſaid, the Caſe of a Legacy is all one.
<hi>Crook,</hi> When one comes to diſcharge a thing by due matter of
Law, and proves it by one Witneſs; if it be not allowed, no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
ſhall be granted there. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> Our Caſe is proof of
<hi>Plene Adminiſtravit</hi> pleaded, which goes in diſcharge: But if

<hi>Hutton</hi> ſaid, That properly for a Legacy the Suit is in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Court: although they may ſue in the <hi>Chancery</hi> for it,
yet the proper Court is the Eccleſiaſtical Court. And they ſaid, that
they uſed to allow one Witneſs with other good Circumſtantial
proofs, if they be not in ſome Criminal cauſes, where of neceſſity
there muſt be two Witneſſes. In one <hi>Hawkin</hi>'s Caſe, Farmor of
an Appropriation, Libels for Tithes of Lambs for ſeven years:
And there payment was proved by one Witneſs, and a Prohibition

was granted for Non-allowance. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> There may be a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
where the Suit is meerly Eccleſiaſtical for a Sum of Money,
as for a Legacy, there the payment of the Legacy is of the nature
of the thing, and the Eccleſiaſtical Court ſhall have Juriſdiction
of the proof and matter. But if one gives a Legacy of twenty
Oxen, and the other pleads payment of as much money in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
there they cannot proceed, but at Common Law, for that,
that the Legacy is altered; And if a proof of one Witneſs is not
accepted, a Prohibition ſhall be granted, for now it is a Legal

                  <note place="margin">Co. Inſt. par. 4. cap. 74.</note> there
lies an Appeal to this Court of <hi>Delegates.</hi> Of this Subject of
<hi>Appeals</hi> the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays, That an Appeal is a Natural defence,
which cannot be taken away by any Prince or power, and in every
Caſe generally when Sentence is given, and Appeal made to the
Superiour, the Judge that did give the Sentence is obliged to obey
the Appeal, and proceed no further until the Superiour hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
and determined the cauſe of Appeal. Nevertheleſs where
this Clauſe (<hi>Appellatione remota</hi>) is in the Commiſſion, the Judge
that gave Sentence is not bound to obey the Appeal, but may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
his Sentence and proceed further, until the Appeal be received
by the Superiour, and an Inhibition be ſent unto him: For that Clauſe
<hi>Appellatione remota</hi> hath Three notable effects; (1) That the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Judge <hi>à quo</hi> is not by the Appeal ſuſpended or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
for he may proceed the ſame notwithſtanding. (2) That for
proceeding to Execution or further proceſs, he is not puniſhable.
(3) That theſe things that are done by the ſaid Judge after ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
cannot be ſaid void, for they cannot be reverſed <hi>per viam Nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis.</hi>
But if the Appeal be juſt and lawful, the Superiour Judge
ought of right and equity to receive and admit the ſame; and in
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:95379:106"/>
that caſe he ought to reverſe and revoke all mean Acts done after the
ſaid Appeal in prejudice of the Appellant.<note place="margin">Dyer. Co. ubi ſupr.</note> At the Parliament held

and it hath always been clearly held, That if the

to which of them the ſame doth belong; This is a Suit proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

which Allegation the Eccleſiaſtical Court refuſing to admit,
a <hi>Prohibition</hi> was thereupon prayed in <hi>B. R.</hi> In this caſe <hi>Doderidge</hi>
Juſtice ſaid, That the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is as well due to the Parſon,
as Tithe is at the Common Law; and if the Parſon do Libel in the
Eccleſiaſtical Court for a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> (as he may do) and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Modus</hi> is there alledged, and this refuſed, the Eccleſiaſtical
Court may try and determine this matter touching this <hi>Modus,</hi> and
no cauſe to grant a <hi>Prohibition</hi> for this Refuſal: But if the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Court doth deny to admit the Allegation for the <hi>Modus</hi> upon
this ground only, becauſe the practice of the Eccleſiaſtical Law
and our Law do differ in the manner of <hi>Proof;</hi> as for default of
two Witneſſes, one being allowed at Common Law, but not at the
Eccleſiaſtical Law: In this Caſe a <hi>Prohibition</hi> is grantable; but
otherwiſe the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction may as well try the <hi>Modus
Decimandi,</hi> as the Right of Tithes. But if a Parſon doth Libel
there for Tithes in kind, and a <hi>Modus</hi> is alledged and there pleaded,
but refuſed to be admitted or allowed: in that Caſe a <hi>Prohibition</hi>
is grantable upon ſuch Refuſal. <hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice, In this Caſe a
<hi>Prohibition</hi> ought to be granted, otherwiſe in ſuch caſes, upon
every ſmall difference alledged in the <hi>Modus,</hi> that Court may try
and determine the validity of every <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> which the
Eccleſiaſtical Court cannot do by the Law: for that Court is not
permitted by our Law to try a <hi>Modus Decimandi;</hi> and therefore that
Court proceeding to try this <hi>Modus,</hi> which is determinable by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, and not in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, a <hi>Prohibition</hi> ought
to be granted. But <hi>Doderidge Contra,</hi> No <hi>Prohibition</hi> is in this
caſe to be granted, for the Eccleſiaſtical Court may well try and
determine this <hi>Modus</hi> by that Law; The Libel being there origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
for the <hi>Modus:</hi> But if touching the Proof of this <hi>Modus,</hi> as
aforeſaid, the difference of proceedings between the two Laws,
(one Witneſs being ſufficient at the Common Law, not ſo at the
Eccleſiaſtical) be the ground of the Refuſal of the Allegation, then
a <hi>Prohibition</hi> is to be awarded, ſo is 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. and 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. but if the
Eccleſiaſtical Court only proceed to try the <hi>Modus,</hi> for which the
Libel was there, this by Proof may well be there examined.
<hi>Croke</hi> Juſtice, at this time delivered no opinion at all in this Caſe.
Afterwards, this Caſe being moved again, <hi>Doderidge,</hi> If a Parſon
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95379:111"/>
do Libel in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for a <hi>Modus,</hi> whereas in truth
there was no <hi>Modus,</hi> but only a compoſition of late time between
the Parſon and the Pariſhioners, to pay ſo much yearly for Tithes,
and not otherwiſe: In this Caſe, becauſe that the Common Law
and the Eccleſiaſtical do differ in the point of <hi>Preſcription,</hi> (Ten
years continuance being a good Preſcription by that Law, but not
ſo by Ours) in this caſe a <hi>Prohibition</hi> is grantable. <hi>Houghton,</hi> A
<hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is properly to be tried and determined by the
Common Law, and not in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, for that theſe
two Laws differ in many things, as in point of proof of a <hi>Modus,</hi>
and in the point of Preſcription. <hi>Croke,</hi> A Special <hi>Modus</hi> being
Libelled for in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, is there to be tried. <hi>Dode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge,</hi>
If the Eccleſiaſtical Court doth refuſe to allow of the Proof,
allowable at the Common Law, a <hi>Prohibition</hi> lies to ſtay proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
for Tithes there: And where there is a <hi>Modus,</hi> if they refuſe
to pay this, the Parſon may ſue for this <hi>Modus</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical
Court, and this is to be tried there; But if in ſuch caſe where there
is a <hi>Modus,</hi> if the Parſon will Libel to have his Tithe in kind, and
the other ſhews there this <hi>Modus,</hi> which they will not allow of, a
<hi>Prohibition</hi> lies, and this ſhall be tried by the Common Law. <hi>The
Court declares,</hi> That they would ſee the Suggeſtion, and therefore
by the Rule of the Court they were to make their Suggeſtion, and
to ſhew the ſame to the Court, as they would ſtand unto it; and

in <hi>Ireland</hi> it was obſerved, That after the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>
had aſſumed or tooken upon him to be the Spiritual Prince or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of all the World, he attempted alſo to give Laws to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as one real Mark or Signal of his Monarchy; but they
well knowing, <hi>Quod ubi non eſt condendi authoritas, ibi non eſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendi
neceſſitas,</hi> did not impoſe their Laws at firſt peremptorily on
all Nations without diſtinction, but offered them <hi>timide &amp; precario.</hi>
And therefore he cauſed certain Rules in the firſt place to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
for the Government of the Clergy only, which he called <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creta,</hi>
and not <hi>Leges vel Statuta;</hi> Theſe <hi>Decrees</hi> were publiſhed in
<hi>An.</hi> 1150. which was during the Reign of King <hi>Stephen.</hi> And
therefore what the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> obſerves in the Preface to the Eighth
part of his Reports, <hi>Quod</hi> Rogerus Bacon, <hi>frater ille perquam Eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditus,
in Libro De impedimentis Sapientiae, dicit, Rex quidem</hi> Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus,

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95379:112"/>
and intended of thoſe <hi>Decrees</hi> which were then newly compiled
and publiſhed: Yet theſe <hi>Decrees</hi> being received and obſerved by

never received any of theſe Rules or Canons, <hi>Kelw. Rep. 7 H.</hi> 8.
<hi>fo.</hi> 184) the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> attempted alſo to draw the <hi>Laity</hi> by
degrees into obedience to theſe Ordinances: and to that purpoſe, in
the firſt place he propounds certain Rules or Ordinances for <hi>Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,</hi>
or days of Faſting, to be obſerved as well by the Laity as the
Clergy, which were upon the firſt Inſtitution thereof called by the
mild and gentle name of <hi>Regationes,</hi> as <hi>Marſilius Pat. lib. Defenſor.
Pacis, par. 2. cap.</hi> 23. hath obſerved; and thence, it ſeems, the Week
of Abſtinence, a little before the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> was called the
<hi>Rogation-week,</hi> that time of Abſtinence being appointed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
by that Ordinance which was called <hi>Rogatio,</hi> and not <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptum
vel Statutum.</hi> Now when the Laity out of their devotion
had received and obeyed theſe Ordinances of <hi>Abſtinence,</hi> then the
Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> proceeds further (<hi>De una praeſumptione ad aliam
tranſivit Romanus Pontifex,</hi> as <hi>Marſil. Pat.</hi> there ſays) and made
many Reſcripts and Orders <hi>per Nomen Decretalium,</hi> which were
publiſhed in the year 1230. which was in the Fourteenth year of
King <hi>H.</hi> 3. or thereabout. <hi>Vid. Matth. Par. Hiſt. mag.</hi> 403. and theſe
were made to bind all the Laity, and Sovereign Princes as well as
their Subjects, in ſuch things as concerned their Civil and Temporal
Eſtates; As that no Lay-man ſhould have the Donation of an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Benefice: That no Lay-man ſhould marry within certain
Degrees, out of the degrees limited by the <hi>Levitical Law:</hi>
That all Infants born before Marriage, ſhould be adjudged after
Marriage <hi>Legitimate,</hi> and capable of Temporal Inheritance:
That all Clerks ſhould be exempt from the Secular power; and
others of the like nature. But theſe <hi>Decretals</hi> being publiſhed, they
were not entirely and abſolutely received and obeyed in any part of
Chriſtendom, but only in the Pope's Temporal Territory, which
by the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> is called, <hi>Patria obedientiae.</hi> But on the other hand,
many of thoſe Canons were utterly rejected and diſobeyed in <hi>France</hi>
and <hi>England,</hi> and other Chriſtian Realms, which are called <hi>Patriae
Conſuetudinariae;</hi> As the Canon which prohibited the Donation of
Benefices <hi>per manum Laicam</hi> was ever diſobeyed in <hi>England, France,</hi>
the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> and divers other Countries and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths;
And the Canon, to make Infants Legitimate that were
born before Marriage, was ſpecially rejected in <hi>England,</hi> when in
the Parliament held at <hi>Merton, omnes Comites &amp; Barones una voce
reſponderunt, Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari, quae hucuſque uſitatae
ſunt, &amp;c.</hi> And the Canon, which exempts Clerks from the Secular
power, was never fully obſerved in any part of Chriſtendom.

                  <hi>Kelw. 7 H. 8. 181. b.</hi> which is one infallible Argument, That theſe
Ordinances had not their force by any Authority that the Court of
<hi>Rome</hi> had to impoſe Laws on all Nations without their conſent, but
by the approbation of the people which received and uſed them.
For by the ſame reaſon whereby they might reject one Canon, they
might reject all the other. <hi>Vid. Bodin. lib. 1. de Rep. cap.</hi> 8. where he
ſaith, That the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> on the erection of all Univerſities
there, have declared in their Charters, that they would receive the
Profeſſion of the Civil, and Canons, to uſe them at their diſcretion,
and not to be obliged by theſe Laws. But as to thoſe Canons which
have been received, accepted, and uſed in any Chriſtian Realm or
Common-wealth, they by ſuch acceptation and uſage have obtained
the force of Laws in ſuch particular Realm or State, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
part of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of that Nation; And ſo thoſe
which have been embraced, allowed, and uſed in <hi>England,</hi> are made
by ſuch allowance and uſage, part of the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
By which the interpretation, diſpenſation, or execution of
theſe Canons, being become Laws of <hi>England,</hi> doth appertain ſole
to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and his Magiſtrates within his Dominions,
and he and his Magiſtrates have the ſole Juriſdiction in ſuch caſes,
and the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> hath nothing to do in the interpretation,
diſpenſation, or execution of thoſe Laws in <hi>England,</hi> although
they were firſt deviſed in the Court of <hi>Rome;</hi> No more than the
Chief Magiſtrate of <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Lacedemon</hi> might claim Juriſdiction
in the Ancient City of <hi>Rome,</hi> for that the Laws of the XII. Tables
were thither carried and imported from thoſe Cities of <hi>Greece;</hi>
and no more than the Maſter of <hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſhall have
Command or Juriſdiction in <hi>Kings-Colledge</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> for that
the private Statutes whereby <hi>Kings-Colledge</hi> is governed, were, for
the moſt part, borrowed and taken out of the Foundation-Book of
<hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford:</hi> And by the ſame reaſon the Emperour
may claim Juriſdiction in Maritime cauſes within the Dominions of

the Body of the Church without ſhewing ſome ſpecial reaſon for the
ſame. All which appears in the Caſe of <hi>Boothby</hi> againſt <hi>Baily,</hi>
where <hi>Boothby</hi> being Executor of <hi>Gilbert,</hi> brought a Prohibition
againſt <hi>Baily,</hi> and his Surmize was, That whereas Sir <hi>Bernard Whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton</hi>
was ſeized of the Mannor of <hi>Woodford-Hall,</hi> and that he and
thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath in the ſame, had uſed time out of mind,
to have a peculiar Pew in the Body of the Church, and that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant
by Suit in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, ſought to diſpoſſeſs them
of the ſame. And by the Opinion of the whole Court, this was no
ſufficient ground of a Prohibition; for though the Church and
Church-yard be in Law the Soyl and Freehold of the Parſon, yet
the uſe of the Body of the Church, and the repair and maintenance
thereof is common to all the Pariſhioners. And for avoiding of
confuſion, the diſtribution and diſpoſing of Seats and charges of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
belong to the Ordinary, and therefore no man can challenge a
peculiar Seat without a ſpecial reaſon. But if it had been Preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed,
That Sir <hi>Bernard Whetſtone, &amp;c.</hi> had uſed time out of mind at
their own coſts to maintain that Pew, and had therefore had the
ſole uſe thereof, the Preſcription might have ſtood and been warrant
for a Prohibition, though the Pew were in the Body of the Church.
And ſo it is in the like caſe of an Iſle or Chappel adjoyning to the

Croſs-Bill between the parties, for pulling down of painted Glaſs,
Pictures and Arms, in a Window in an Iſle of a Chappel in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
of <hi>Wellington</hi> in <hi>Somerſet,</hi> theſe points in the Caſe were Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:
(1.) If an Inhabitant there, and his Anceſtors time out of
mind, &amp;c. have uſed to Repair an Iſle in a Church, and to ſit there
with his Family, &amp;c. and to bury there, that makes that Iſle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and peculiar for his Family; Otherwiſe if he had not uſed to
Repair it at his own coſts, but with the charge of the Pariſh; then
the Ordinary may appoint who ſhall ſit there from time to time,
notwithſtanding a uſe to ſit there, only, to the contrary. (2.) If
any Superſtitious Pictures are in a Window of a Church, or Iſle,
&amp;c. it is not lawful for any to break them, &amp;c. without Licenſe of
the Ordinary; and if any does to the contrary, he ſhall bind him to
his good Behaviour. And ſo it was in <hi>Prickett</hi>'s Caſe. (3.) That
the Ordinary or Church-warden cannot Licenſe a Pariſhioner to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:95379:116"/>
Bury within the Church: But it ought to be Licenſed by the Parſon;
for the Franktenement is in him only. (4.) If Coats of Arms are
put in a Window, or upon a Monument in the Church or Church-yard,
they may not be broken by the Ordinary, Parſon, or Church-wardens,
or any other; for the Heir ſhall have his Action upon the
Caſe for that, 9 <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. 14. for they belong to him, 30 <hi>Ed. 3. 9. b. c.</hi>
(5.) If one be Aſſaulted in the Church, or within a Church-yard,
he may not beat the other, or draw a Weapon (although it be in his
own defence) there; for it is a Sanctified place, and he may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
for that by 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. And ſo if in any of the King's Courts,

               <p>(7.) Where Preſcription is alledg'd for Right to a Seat in a

cognizance thereof, as in the caſe of <hi>Carleton</hi> againſt <hi>Hutton,</hi> where

him in a violent manner; and the Biſhop of the Dioceſs ſent an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition

cutting of the Timber in ſmall pieces, and carrying them away, &amp;c.
The Defendant pleads in Bar, That they were the Church-wardens:

the Ordinary, and it was an hindrance to the Pariſhioners, &amp;c. and
that, they as Church-wardens, the ſaid Seat, &amp;c. the which is the

Of this there ſeems to be three ſorts; the one ſuch as adjoyns to the
Church, as parcel of the ſame, built by Perſons of Honour, <hi>ut
ibidem Familiaria Sepulchra ſibi conſtituant;</hi> Another, that which
is ſeparate from the Mother-Church in a Pariſh of a large extent,
built for the better eaſe and convenience of ſuch Pariſhioners whoſe
habitations are remote and far diſtant from the Pariſh-Church, and
thence vulgarly called a <hi>Chappel</hi> of <hi>Eaſe,</hi> being ſerved by ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Curate at the charge either of the Rector, or of ſuch as for
whoſe convenience it is, according to the cuſtome or compoſition.
A <hi>Chappel</hi> of <hi>Eaſe</hi> is where there is a Parochial Church in the ſame
Pariſh, wherein the Sacraments are adminiſter'd, and not in the
Chappel. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 32. which appertains to the Parochial Church,
and the Parſon thereof. <hi>Ibid.</hi> And a Parochial Church cannot be a
Chappel. 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 37. The Third is that which is called a <hi>Free-Chappel,</hi>
which in point of Maintenance and endowment, as alſo

differ from both the former,<note place="margin">If the King grant a Free Chappel to one, he ought to be put into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff, 14 <hi>H. 4. 11. b. and Rol.

or not, and endowed with Maintenance by the Founder, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

obtained a Prohibition on a Surmize, which not appearing to be

ſhall attend on God's Service in the place. In which <hi>Collation</hi> there
is alſo that which ſeems to bear ſome conformity with the Acts of

was only for his Contempt: And it is lawful for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
to grant ſuch an Inhibition for the peace of the Church. And
<hi>Doderidge</hi> agreed, That if the Biſhop did Inhibit any from making
a diſturbance in the Church, it was good; and therefore would not
grant a Prohibition for well-doing. <hi>Crew &amp; Jones, &amp;c.</hi> but here he
had not done well. <hi>Doderidge è contra.</hi> Then it was ſaid, That here

claimed by Preſcription, and the priority therein likewiſe claimed
by Preſcription, is Triable in this Court by an Action upon the Caſe,
and not in the Spiritual Court. And at laſt it was agreed by the
parties, that <hi>H.</hi> ſhould remain in poſſeſſion till the matter were

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:95379:121"/>
That the charge was for the making of new Bells, where there were
Four before, whereby it appears that it is meerly matter of curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity,
and not of neceſſity, for which the Pariſhioners ſhall not be
liable to ſuch Taxations, and herein it was relied upon 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 19.

pay but Eleven ſhillings for any Reparation of the Church. But
the Prohibition was denied; and by <hi>Doderidge</hi> in the Book of 44

meerly Temporal, for which the Prohibition was granted <hi>&amp; per

becauſe it laid a burden upon the reſt of the Pariſh. <hi>Littleton</hi>
of Counſel of the other ſide, Suppoſe the Church falls, ſhall he pay but

it was a double vexation, and the party ſhall not have Coſts for

a thing may fall out Triable at the Common Law. But there the
Principal was tried at the Common Law; for they had it as in right.
<hi>Hutton,</hi> Seats in the generality are in the power of the Ordinary to

were good; and the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, that it is contrary to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

ſhould be diſcharged of repairing the Mother-Church;<note place="margin">Hill. 19 Jac. B. R. Rot. 922. <hi>Peeter</hi> verſ. <hi>Roſe Edmonds</hi> Wid. Roll. Rep.</note> and it may
be that the Church being built with Stone, it may not need any
Reparation within the memory of man, and yet that doth not
diſcharge them without ſome ſpecial cauſe of diſcharge ſhewed.
The ſecond point was the taking away of an Objection, as
they ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Preſcription which is incident to
Eccleſiaſtical things, ſhall be tried in the Eccleſiaſtical Court,
and ſo that Objection removed, and commonly the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens
are choſen in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, yet the Lord

appertains to a Spiritual thing.</p>
               <p>(34.) <hi>Note,</hi> that in the caſe of Churchwardens, the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid,
That for the repairing the Fabrick of the Church the charge is real,<note place="margin">Hill. 20 Jac. B. R. Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens Caſe. <hi>Roll'.</hi> Rep.</note>
&amp; charges the Land and not the perſon; but for the Ornaments of the
Church it is perſonal, and there if a man be not an Inhabitant with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Pariſh, he is not chargeable in reſpect of his Land, for ſuch
Tax doth charge the Goods only. And to this <hi>Chamberlain</hi> Juſtice
agreed, and none denied it; but where there is a Farmor of the
Land, there the Farmor alone ſhall not be charged, for it is not
reaſon that a poor Husbandman, who paies Rent for his Land, and
perhaps to the utmoſt value, ſhould build Churches; but it may be
unknown to the Pariſhioner and the Churchwardens who hath the
Fee in reverſion, and therefore they may impoſe the whole Tax
on the Farmor, and he by way of Anſwer may alledge in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Court that he is but the Farmor, and thereupon the Tax
ſhall be divided between him and his Landlord, according to the
Rate which the Land is worth more than the Rent, and on the
Landlord according to the quantity of the Rent; <hi>quod quaere,</hi> for
in <hi>Jeofferie</hi>'s Caſe 5 <hi>Coke</hi> it is Reſolved, That the Farmor alone is
chargeable, and that a Conſultation was granted, but not for that
reaſon, but for that the Reverſioner had pleaded an inſufficient plea
in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, <hi>viz.</hi> That he was not an Inhabitant
within the Pariſh, which is not a good plea, as alſo for the great
delay which he had uſed, having made or brought two Appeals,

did rate and tax them of the Chappel of Eaſe, towards

to pay this Tax, they were libelled againſt in the Eccleſiaſtical

Foreigners there not inhabiting, as of all others, is liable thereunto,
and this is ſo by the general cuſtome of the place; and this is to be

<hi>Haughton</hi> Juſtice, This Diſpoſition of Pews in the Church belongs
of right to the order and diſcretion of the Ordinary; and to this
purpoſe is the caſe of 8 <hi>H. 7. fo.</hi> 12, and Sir <hi>William Hall's</hi> caſe againſt
<hi>Ellis. Doderidge</hi> Juſtice, I moved this caſe in the Court of <hi>C. B.</hi>
and it was for a Seat in the Church: An Action there brought for
Diſturbance, and I there cited <hi>Hall</hi>'s caſe; and 9 <hi>E. 4. fo.</hi> 14. The
Caſe of the Grave-Stone and Coat-Armor: for the taking of which
an Action of Treſpaſs lies at the Common Law, and therefore by
the ſame reaſon an Action of Treſpaſs ſhould lie for ſuch a Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
in a Seat of a Church; but there the Judges did all of them
ſay, That they would not meddle with the deciding of ſuch Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies
for <hi>Seats</hi> in the Church, but would leave the ſame to them,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:95379:126"/>
to whom more properly it belonged. <hi>Croke</hi> Juſtice, <hi>Hall</hi>'s caſe was
this, where a man did build an entire Iſle in the Church, and was at
continual charge to repair it; if he be diſturbed in the uſe of this,
he ſhall for this Diſturbance have his remedy at the Common Law,
and ſo it hath been adjudged; But the Judges all ſaid, We are not
here to meddle with Seats in the Church. <hi>Doderidge</hi> Juſtice, This
Appeal here is like unto a Writ of Error at the Common Law;
but it doth differ in this, By the Appeal the firſt Judgment or Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is ſuſpended, but after a Writ of Error brought, the firſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſtill remains until it be reverſed. <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice, It was
<hi>Pym</hi>'s Caſe in the <hi>Common Bench,</hi> and 8 <hi>H. 7. fo.</hi> 12. that the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Court hath Juriſdiction and power to diſpoſe of Pews and
Seats in the Church; But if there be an Iſle built by a Gentleman,
or by a Nobleman, and he hath uſed to Bury there, and there hath
his Enſigns of Honour, as a Grave-ſtone, Coat-Armor, or the like,
which belongs not unto the Parſon; if he take them, the Heir may
well have an Action of Treſpaſs: Otherwiſe it is, where the ſame is
repaired at the Common charge of the Pariſh, there they have the
diſpoſing of them: <hi>Ellis</hi> and <hi>Hall</hi>'s Caſe remembred, a <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Caſe,
there the Seat was repaired by him, and was belonging to his Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Meſſuage by Preſcription, and ſo triable at the Common Law:
And ſo where the Caſe is Special, that the party doth wholly and
ſolely repair the ſame, in ſuch a caſe, if a Suit be there concerning
ſuch a Seat, a Prohibition well lieth, but not otherwiſe: But if a
Nobleman comes to dwell in the Countrey, he is now within the
ſole order and diſpoſe of the Ordinary for his Pew and Seat in the
Church; and upon the former difference was <hi>Pym</hi>'s caſe adjudged
in the <hi>C. B.</hi> in this principal Caſe, a Prohibition was denied by the
whole Court.</p>

proceeded in the proſecution of the Suit, and upon this the
Defendant procured a Prohibition; upon which matter ſhewed
therein was a Demurr joyned. <hi>Davenport</hi> moved for a Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The Queſtion was, where two Churchwardens ſue in the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Court for a Tax, and one of them Releaſe, whether that
Releaſe ſhall barr his Companion or not? It ſeem'd to him, that
this Releaſe ſhall not be any barr to his Companion, or impediment
to ſue; for he ſaid, That Churchwardens are not parties intereſſed
in the Goods of the Church, but are a ſpecial Corporation for the
benefit of the Church; for which he cited the Caſe in 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 6.
The Churchwardens brought Treſpaſs for the Goods of the Church
taken out of their poſſeſſion, and they counted <hi>Ad damnum Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chianorum,</hi>
and not to their proper dammage; and the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 12.
12 <hi>H. 7. 27. 43 H.</hi> 7. 9. where it is ſaid expreſly, That the Wardens
of a Church are a Corporation only for the benefit of the Church,
and not for the diſadvantage thereof; but this Releaſe ſounds to
diſadvantage of the Church, and therefore ſeems to be no Barr:
Alſo this Corporation conſiſts of Two perſons, and the Releaſe of
one is nothing worth; for he was but one Corps, and the moiety
of the Corps could not Releaſe; and for theſe Reaſons he prayed a
Conſultation. <hi>Yelverton</hi> to the contrary, and he took a difference
and ſaid, That he agreed, that if the Wardens of the Church have
once poſſeſſion of the Church, there in Action of Treſpaſs brought
for theſe Goods one Warden cannot Releaſe: But this Tax for
which they Sue is a thing meerly in Action, of which they have not
any poſſeſſion, and there he cannot Sue alone; and therefore this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe
ſhall barr his Companion. The Court interrupted him and
ſaid, That clearly Conſultation ſhall be granted; <hi>Fleming</hi> Chief
Juſtice, We have not need to diſpute this Releaſe, whether it be
good or not? and there is a difference where Suit is commenced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
us, as if Churchwardens brought Treſpaſs here for Goods of
the Church taken, and one Releaſe, then we might diſpute whether
this Releaſe were good or not; but when the matter is originally
begun before them in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and there is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
place to ſue for this Tax, and not any where elſe, we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do with this Relaſe; for which reaſon by the whole Court
a <hi>Conſultation</hi> was granted. In an Action in the Eccleſiaſtical Court
by two Churchwardens, if the Defendant plead the Releaſe of one
of them, that ſhall be tried there, and no <hi>Prohibition</hi> ſhall be granted.

               </list>
               <p>(1.) <hi>COnſolidation</hi> is the uniting, combining, or conſolidating
of two Churches or Benefices in one<note n="a" place="margin">Broo. tit. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> 37 H. 8. c. 21.</note>. This cannot
be done without the conſent of the Biſhop, the Patron,
and the Incumbent. This word thus uſed in an Eccleſiaſtical ſenſe,
takes its denomination from what the Civil Law intends by conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidating
the Intereſt of Poſſeſſion and Property together, which in
that Law is called, <hi>Conſolidatio uſusfructus &amp; proprietatis;</hi> As when
a man having the Uſufruct of certain Lands by way of Rent, Deviſe,
or otherwiſe, doth then and at the ſame time purchaſe the Fee or
Inheritance thereof; <hi>hoc caſu Conſolidatio fieri dicitur. Inſtit. de <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

§. 3. So that in ſuch Secular concerns, according to that Law,
it properly ſignifies an Uniting of the poſſeſſion, occupation, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
with the Property of the thing ſo prepoſſeſſed; which is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
called an <hi>

                  <note place="margin">37 H. 8. c. 21. 1 Ed. 6. c. 9. 17 Car. 2. c. 3.</note> being a Joynt-poſſeſſion of two

of two Churches in one, whereof the value of the one was
not above ſix pounds in the King's Books of the <hi>Firſt-Fruits,</hi> and
not above one mile diſtant from the other. And by a late Statute of
17 <hi>Car. 2. cap.</hi> 3. it may be lawful for the Biſhop of the Dioceſs,
Mayor, Bayliffs, &amp;c. of any City or Town Corporate, and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
or Patrons, to unite two Churches or Chappels in any ſuch City,
Town, or the Liberties thereof; provided the Churches ſo united
exceed not the annual value of an hundred pounds, unleſs the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners
eſire otherwiſe.<note place="margin">St. 17 Car. 2. c. 3.</note> See the Statute at large.</p>

(2.) By this Conſolidation or Union of Churches one of the
Benefices becomes void, yea extinct in Law, <hi>Illud enim quod alteri

               <p>(3.) There are ſeveral Cauſes or Reaſons in the Law for this
Conſolidation, Incorporation, Annexation, or Union of Churches;
and they are chiefly theſe five, (1) An unlawful dividing of thoſe
Churches or Eccleſiaſtical Benefices, precedent to their reintegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or intended reconſolidation, as when ſuch as had been formerly
united, were illegally divided. <hi>Otho. Conſtit. Ne Eccleſia una,</hi> c. <hi>cum

of Pariſhioners, as when one of the Churches is deprived of her
people by ſome incurſion of an Enemy, or by ſome mortal Diſeaſe
or Sickneſs, or the like. 11. q. 1. <hi>

other cauſes of Conſolidation are aſſerted by the <hi>DD.</hi> may be all
referr'd to one or other of the foreſaid Reaſons. Likewiſe, there
are certain Solemnities required by the Canon Law, to be uſed and
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:95379:132"/>
obſerved in the conſolidation and union of Churches and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Benefices, the impracticability whereof in this Realm, having
otherwiſe provided in ſuch caſes, can have no ſuch malign influence
in Law, as to invalidate the thing for want of ſome Circumſtantials,
ſo long as there is a retention of the Eſſentials, according to the
Laws and Conſtitutions of this Kingdom. <hi>

ought to be known, as well of that which is to be united, as of that

iſſue a Commiſſion of Enquiry touching the ſaid cauſe and value,
at which all perſons pretending Intereſt, are to be or may be preſent

               <p>(5.) This Form touching Conſolidations and union of Churches
and Eccleſiaſtical Benefices is practiced in <hi>France;</hi> which, though
there appears nothing therein but what ſeems conſonant to Reaſon,
yet the Statute-Laws of this Realm have herein made other provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

for which reaſon the Interpreters of the Canon Law are the leſs po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive

               <p>(2.) Cardinal <hi>Othobon</hi> in his Canon [<hi>De Domibus Eccleſiarum re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiciendis</hi>]

(3.) By the Gloſs on that Canon it is inferr'd, That a Parſon may
be guilty of Dilapidations, or of a Neglect in that kind two waies,
<hi>viz.</hi> either by not keeping the Edifices in good repair, or by not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing
them being gone to decay. That <hi>Canon</hi> chiefly refers to the
Manſion-houſes of all Benefices Eccleſiaſtical, and that not only of
all Parſonages and Rectories, but alſo of all Biſhopricks, and of all
Curates and Prebends, and of all others having Eccleſiaſtical Livings;
but not ſpecially (by the words of this <hi>Canon</hi>) unto their Farm-houſes,
though they alſo are by the Canon Law provided for in caſe
of <hi>Dilapidations.</hi> And ſuch as neglect the Reparations aforeſaid,
may be accuſed and convicted thereof before the Dioceſan, who
hath power to ſequeſter the Fruits of ſuch Benefice for the Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
aforeſaid, <hi>Gloſſ. in ver. ceſſaverit. in dict. Can.</hi> ſuch Fruits thereof
being in conſtruction of Law, as it were tacitly hypothecated by a
certain kind of Priviledge for ſuch Indemnity; and for that reaſon
the Biſhop in ſome caſes may for that end ſequeſter the ſame.</p>
               <p>(4.) And whereas in the aboveſaid <hi>Canon</hi> it is ſaid, That <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels</hi>
ſhall be kept in repair by ſuch as are thereunto obliged, it is to
be underſtood, that that is ſpoken by way of alluſion to the common
Cuſtome in <hi>England,</hi> whereby the Body of the Church is uſually
repaired by the Pariſhioners, and Chancels by the Rectors, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ought to be at the care, though not at the coſts, of the
other alſo; he being annually accountable to the Biſhop for the
ſame, if the Biſhop ſo pleaſe; for which reaſon the Rector hath
power to audit the Accounts of the coſts and charges about the
ſame, as alſo what ſhall be given or bequeathed by way of Legacy
for that end and purpoſe. And where this cuſtome prevails, That
the Pariſhioners ſhall repair the Body of the Church, it is not to be
underſtood, that this is incumbent on them as a <hi>Real,</hi> but as a <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi>
duty or burden; yet every Pariſhioner proportionably to that
quantity of Land which he holds within the Pariſh, and number of

Four, <hi>viz.</hi> the Biſhop, the Patron, the Parſon, and the Pariſhioners,

the Leſſee brought Debt upon the former Leaſe, who pleaded the
Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which made all Leaſes void, where the Parſon is
not reſident, or abſent for 80 daies: It was Adjudged, That the
Leaſe was void by the death of the Incumbent; for the Juſtices
ſaid, The Statute doth provide againſt <hi>Dilapidations,</hi> and for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
of Hoſpitality; and therefore provided the Leaſes ſhall be
void not only for <hi>Non-reſidence,</hi> but by death or reſignation; for
otherwiſe <hi>Dilapidations</hi> ſhould be in the time of the Succeſſor, and
he cannot maintain Hoſpitality.</p>
               <p>(8.) The waſting of the Woods belonging to a Biſhoprick, is in
the Law underſtood as a Dilapidation, as was formerly hinted.
Note, By <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice, a Biſhop is only to fell Timber for
Building,<note place="margin">What Timber a Biſhop may fell, and for what purpoſes.</note> for Fuel, and for his other neceſſary occaſions, and there
is no Biſhoprick but the ſame is on the Foundation of the King; the
Woods of the Biſhoprick are called the <hi>Dower</hi> of the Church, and
theſe are alwaies carefully to be preſerved; and if he fell and deſtroy
this, upon a motion thereof made to us (ſays the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>) we
will grant a Prohibition: And to this purpoſe there was a great
Cauſe which concerned the Biſhop of <hi>Dureſm,</hi> who had divers Cole-Mines,
and would have cut down his Timber-Trees for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and upholding of his Works; and upon motion in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
concerning this, for the King, Order was there made, that the
Judges ſhould grant a Prohibition for the King; and we will here
(ſays he) revive this again, for there a Prohibition was ſo granted.
And ſo upon the like motion made unto us in the like caſe, we will
alſo for the King grant a Prohibition by the Statute of 35 <hi>E.</hi> 1. If a
Biſhop cut down Timber-Tres for any cauſe, unleſs it be for neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
Reparations (as if he ſell the ſame unto a Stranger) we will
grant a Prohibition: And to this purpoſe I have ſeen (ſaid he) a
good Record in 25 <hi>E.</hi> 1. where complaint was made in Parliament
of the Biſhop of <hi>Dureſm</hi> (as before) for cutting of Timber-Trees
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:95379:135"/>
for his Cole-Mines, and there agreed that in ſuch a caſe a Prohibition
did lie;<note place="margin">Mich. 12 Jac. B. R. <hi>Chapman</hi> verſ. <hi>Jane Barnaby.</hi> Bulſtr. Rep.</note> and upon motion made a Prohibition was then granted;
and the Reaſon then given, becauſe that this Timber was the Dower
of the Church; and ſo it ſhall be alſo in the caſe of a Dean and
Chapter; in which caſes, upon this ground we will grant (as he ſaid)
Prohibitions; and the whole Court agreed with him herein. Alſo
in <hi>Sakar</hi>'s caſe, againſt whom Judgment being given for <hi>Simony,</hi> yet
he being by aſſent of parties to continue in the Vicarage for a certain
time, this time being now paſt, and he ſtill continuing in poſſeſſion,
and committing of great Waſte, by pulling down the Glaſs-windows,
and pulling up of Planks, the Court granted a Prohibition, and ſaid,
That this is the Dower of the Church,<note place="margin">Mich. 13 Jac. B. R. <hi>The King againſt</hi> Zakar. Bulſtr. par. 3.</note> and we will here prohibit
them, if they fell and waſte the Timber of the Church, or if they
pull down the houſes: And Prohibition to prevent Dilapidations,
and to ſtay the doing of any Waſte, was in that caſe awarded accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>
               <p>(9.) In a Prohibition, the Caſe was this: A Vicar lops and cuts
down Trees growing in the Church-yard; the Churchwardens hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in the carriage of the ſame away,<note place="margin">Mich. 13 Jac. B. R. <hi>Knowll</hi> and <hi>All.</hi> verſ. <hi>Harvey.</hi> Bulſtr. par. 3.</note> and they being in Trial of
this Suit: The Churchwardens by their Counſel, moved the Court
for a Prohibition to the Vicar, to ſtay him from felling any more.
<hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice, This is a good cauſe of Deprivation, if he fell
down Timber-Trees and Wood, this is a <hi>Dilapidation;</hi> and by the
Reſolution in Parliament, a Prohibition by the Law ſhall be granted,
if a Biſhop fells down Wood and Timber-Trees. The whole Court
agreed clearly in this, to grant here a Prohibition to the Vicar to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit
him not to make ſpoil of the Timber, this being (as it is called
in Parliament) the Endowment of the Church. <hi>Coke,</hi> we will alſo
grant a Prohibition, to reſtrain Biſhops from felling the Wood and
Timber-Trees of their Churches. And ſo in this principal Caſe, by
the Rule of the Court a Prohibition was granted.</p>

(4.) Suppoſe that a Parſon be deprived by the Ordinary, or reads
not his Articles: In which caſes the Church is void, yet notice muſt
be given to the true Patron for that time, or elſe the Lapſe incurs
not (which is inconvenient for the Church, and a prejudice to the
Ordinary) for how ſhall he in this caſe aſſure himſelf of a ſufficient
Notice? For if he give notice to him that is not Patron, for this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
turn, his Notice is vain, and the true Patron perhaps knows not
of the Deprivation, or if he knows it, needs not Preſent without
notice given him. In this Caſe Sir <hi>H. Hobard</hi> Chief Juſtice holds,

the Ordinary may Collate, though that ſhall not bind the <hi>very</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,

matter ſhewed: But if the other ſuppoſed Patron preſent, and the
ſix months incur, <hi>Quaere</hi> if the true Patron be bound, ſince there
was no Notice given him. And the Opinion of <hi>Hob.</hi> is, that though
without Notice the Patron is not bound by the Lapſe; yet that is
nothing to ſave the Uſurpation of another pretended Patron, who
is not ſubject to give Notice<note n="a" place="margin">Paſch. 17 Jac. C. B. Rot. 877. Caſe Sir <hi>W. Elvis</hi> verſ. Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and others. <hi>Hob.</hi> Rep.</note>. Alſo if a Suit be depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

but it ſeems he is moſt properly ſo called, that hath a Parſonage

<hi>Perſona</hi> is the Patron, or in whom the Right of Patronage is, for
that before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council he had Right to the Tithes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

did not do his duty in Preaching; but againſt his Oath and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical

3. That he took the Cups and other Veſſels of the Church, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated

Barm in the Cups, that they were ſo polluted, that the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants

one <hi>Stepheſon</hi> in one of the Chappels of Eaſe, who was a man of ill
Life and Converſation, <hi>viz.</hi> an Adulterer and a Drunkard. 6. That
he did not Catechize according to the Pariſh-Canon: but only

Commiſſions were directed to him, to compel any perſon in his
Pariſh to do Penance, he exacted money of them, and ſo they were
diſmiſſed, without inflicting any penalty upon them, as their Cenſure
was. And that he and his Servants uſed divers Menaces to his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners,

Couple in a private Houſe, without any Licenſe: And that he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
divers to Preach, which peradventure had not any Licenſe,
and which were ſuſpected perſons, and of evil Life. It was ſaid by

               <p>(18.) It will not be denied, but that the Clergy of <hi>England</hi>
have had in all Ages certain Priviledges, which the Laity never
pretended to: To which purpoſe there have been Laws Enacted,
and Caſes Ruled by perſons learned in the Laws. In <hi>An. 22 H.</hi> 8.
<hi>cap.</hi> 5. it is Enacted, That the decayed Bridges in every County,
where it cannot be known who in right ought to repair the ſame,
ſhall be repaired by the Inhabitants of the ſaid County, Town Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate,
or Riding where the Bridge is, by the Aſſeſſment of the
Juſtices of Peace, who may appoint Collectors to levy the ſame
by Diſtreſs. Now the Queſtion is, Whether the Parſons and the
Vicars may be charged by the general word of the <hi>Inhabitants,</hi>
and Diſtreſs taken on their Spiritual Livings? In order to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of this Queſtion, it muſt be premiſed, That it is moſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that the Clergy are by the Common Law of this Kingdom a
divided Eſtate both for their Perſons and Spiritual promotions from
the Laity of this Land. (1) For their Perſons, <hi>Fitz. N. B. fo.</hi> 175.
That Clerks ſhall not be choſen Bayliffs or Beadles for the Lands
in their poſſeſſions, although the Land before it came to the hands
of the Clerk, was charged therewith by tenure. (2) A Clerk ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95379:144"/>
before a Temporal Judge for Felony, may plead the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Court; The Clergy-men, by reaſon of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiance,
are not bound to the Leet; nor to follow <hi>Hugh</hi> and <hi>Cry.</hi>
(3) That their Spiritual Livings are alſo diſcharged from the general
charge of this Realms Laity, appears by the <hi>Regiſter, fo. 260. &amp;
F. N. B. fo.</hi> 227. That Spiritual perſons ſhall not be charged to pay
Toll, <hi>Pontage,</hi> or <hi>Murage,</hi> but may diſcharge themſelves by Writ.
Alſo the Sheriff, who by the Law is the King's general Officer to
ſerve Proceſſes in every County, may not intermeddle with the
Clergy in reſpect of their Spiritual promotions, but return <hi>Quod
Clericus eſt Beneficiatus in Epiſcoparu, non habet Laicum foedum in
baliva mea;</hi> and then the <hi>Proceſs</hi> muſt be to the Biſhop, as appears
34 <hi>H. 6. &amp; 21 H.</hi> 6. This Priviledge is confirmed to them by
<hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and divers Grants and Statutes, viz. <hi>Articulis Cleri,</hi>
9 <hi>Ed. 2. cap.</hi> 9. Likewiſe no Diſtreſs ſhall be taken in the Ancient
Donations of the Church. The like Grant is made unto them by
King <hi>Ed. 1. 24. Proteſtation</hi> 2. That the Sheriff or Miniſter of the
King ſhall not meddle with the Goods, Chattels, or Carriages of
the Clergy; and in <hi>Purveyors, 12. An. 14 Ed.</hi> 3. there is a Statute,
that <hi>Purveyors</hi> ſhall not meddle with the Clergy, &amp;c. <hi>Ed. 1. cap.</hi> 1.
1 <hi>R. 2. cap. 2. 1 H. 4. cap.</hi> 3. Statute <hi>Spiritualties</hi> 2. Priviledges,
Grants, Immunities of the Clergy are confirmed. So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
both by the Common Law and the Statutes, that the Clergy
are not to be burthened in the general charges with the Laity of
this Realm, neither to be troubled or incumbred, unleſs they be
eſpecially named and expreſly charged by ſome Statute. And di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
Statutes heretofore expreſſing themſelves with the like general
words, have never been expounded to extend to the Clergy, as by
the uſage of them appears by the Statute of <hi>Winton. An. 13 Eliz.</hi> 1.
Again, the people dwelling in a Hundred where any Robbery is
committed, ſhall either bring forth the Felon, or agree with him
that is robbed, yet hath it never been taken, that <hi>Parſons</hi> and
<hi>Vicars</hi> ſhould be Contributors thereunto; yet the words [<hi>Gentes
demorantes</hi>] viz. <hi>the People dwelling,</hi> are as general words as
[<hi>Inhabitants</hi>]. In the ſame Statute there are the like general
words [<hi>Watching, &amp;c.</hi>] yet the Clergy thereby are never char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.
Alſo the Statute made for the High-ways, <hi>An. 2 &amp; 3. P. &amp;

hath never been taken by uſage to charge the Clergy, viz. the

being bound in a Statute-Merchant, ſhall not be taken by his Body:

                  </gap> where there is no Goal, to be Taxed

been charged by reaſon of theſe general words [<hi>Reſiants, &amp;c.</hi>]
1 <hi>Ed. 1. 18 Ed. 3. 4. 1 R.</hi> 2. 1. For theſe Reaſons it is ſuppoſed, that
the general words in the aforeſaid Queſtion will receive in Law the
like Expoſition, as the other ſaid recited Statutes have done; And the
<hi>Parſons</hi> and <hi>Vicars</hi> ſhall not thereby be charged, the rather for that

being no other than a certain part or portion of a
Parſonage, allowed to the Miniſter for his Maintenance, introduced
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95379:145"/>

them, are called the Patron's Clerks. The <hi>Vicar</hi> is uſually appointed
and allowed to ſerve the Cure, by him who hath the Impropriation
of the Parochial Tithes; for at the Original of ſuch Impropriations
a certain portion of the Parſonage was allotted and ſet apart from
the reſt to maintain the Vicar, who was to ſerve the Cure<note n="a" place="margin">Plow. 495.</note>; So
that now the Prieſt of a Parochial Church, where the Predial Tithes
are Impropriated, is called the Vicar, <hi>h. e. vice Rectoris.</hi> And it

the Parſon <hi>habitualiter,</hi> the Vicar <hi>actualiter;</hi> and although the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carage

it ſeems the Freehold of the Glebe of the Vicarage is in the Vicar

and Parſon are ſevered, and each of them ſhall have ſeveral Writs
concerning their reſpective Rights, and ſhall not joyn in one Writ

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:95379:150"/>
they are within the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction; and therefore although
the Patron may have his Action againſt the Ordinary in a Temporal
Court by a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> for rejecting his Clerk, yet the Ordinary
may Decree a Proceſs <hi>de Jure Patronatus</hi> in the caſe, to enquire by a

or Right of Patronage according to the Laws and Cuſtomes of
the Church.</p>
               <p>(2.) There is an uſual difference taken, between <hi>Advocatio medie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis
Eccleſiae,</hi> and <hi>Medietas Advocationis Eccleſiae:</hi> The <hi>former</hi> is
where two Patrons be, and every of them having Right to Preſent
a ſeveral Incumbent to the Biſhop, to be Admitted into one and the
ſame Church, (for divers may be ſeveral Parſons, and have Cure of
Souls in one Pariſh) and ſuch <hi>Advowſon</hi> is alike in every of theſe
Patrons, but every of their Preſentments is to the moity of the ſame
Church; and therefore it is called <hi>Advocatio Medietatis Eccleſiae,</hi> or
as the caſe may be, <hi>Advocatio Tertiae partis Eccleſiae,</hi> and the like.
The <hi>latter,</hi> viz. <hi>Medietas Advocationis Eccleſiae,</hi> is after partition
between Parceners; for although the Advowſon be entire, amongſt
them, yet any of them being diſturbed to preſent at his Turn, ſhall
have the Writ of <hi>Medietate,</hi> or of <hi>Tertia,</hi> or of <hi>Quarta parte Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocationis
Eccleſiae,</hi> as the Caſe is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this difference is taken and
obſerved only in the Writ of Right, which is altogether grounded
upon the Right of Patronage. But in the <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> which
is only to recover Dammages, no ſuch diverſity is conſidered, but
the Writ is general, <hi>Praeſentare ad Eccleſiam.</hi> Doderidge, <hi>of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſons,

The other <hi>Appendant</hi> or Dependant, or depending on a Mannor, as
appertaining or belonging thereto, which is by <hi>Kitchin</hi> termed an
Incident that may be ſeparated from the Subject. Again, Sometimes
the word <hi>Advowé</hi> or <hi>Avowé</hi> is alſo uſed for him who hath a Right

               <p>(3.) Conſonant to the practice at this day touching <hi>Advowſons,</hi>
was the Emperour's <hi>Novell,</hi> Decreed about 1100 years ſince, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the end of the Fifth Century, to this purpoſe, <hi>That if any
man ſhall erect an Oratory, and his deſire be to Preſent a Clerk there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
by himſelf or his Heirs; if they furniſh the Clerk with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:95379:150"/>
and Nominate to the Biſhop ſuch as are worthy, they may be
Ordained: But if thoſe who are intimated by them be rejected by the
Canons, as unworthy of the Miniſtry, then let it be the care of the moſt
Reverend Dioceſan of the place, to Preſent ſuch as in his diſcretion he
ſhall conceive better of</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Novell.</note>. And <hi>Panormitan</hi> clearly interprets the
Emperour's mind herein, and gives us the very meaning and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
of the Patron's Right in this point of Advowſons; he ſays,
That this is <hi>Jus honorificum, oneroſum, &amp; utile,</hi> belonging to any in
the Church, for that with the <hi>Dioceſans</hi> conſent he hath Founded,
Built, and Endowed a Church, he hath given a piece of Ground<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

c. <hi>Monaſterium.</hi> and Endowed it, <hi>C. Piae mentis, ibid.</hi> and was
therefore qualified with the Right of Patronage. And indeed the
Dioceſans conſent herein is ſo requiſite, that by the Canon Law it
ſeems ſcarce feazable for a man to be a Patron without it, <hi>Si quis

And by what is Recorded in the Life of Biſhop <hi>

the Biſhop's prudent compliance with Lay-Patrons in this matter
was not in thoſe days without good reaſon, if we conſider what a
paucity of publick Churches there then were, inſomuch that for

               <p>(5.) An Advowſon, being a right of Preſentation (as aforeſaid)

               <p>(6.) The Right of Patronage is, it ſeems by the Common Law,
a real Right fixed or veſted in the Patron or Founder in the Church,
wherein he hath as abſolute a property and Ownerſhip as any man
hath to his Lands and Tenements, or any Freehold whatever<note n="i" place="margin">Vid. 8 Aſſ. 29. 13 Aſſ. 22. 11 H. 4. 84. Paſch. 9 Ed. 3. Quare Imp. 30. Co. 2. par. Inſtit. acc. &amp; 38 Aſſ. 22. <hi>The Prior of</hi> Plymton<hi>'s Caſe.</hi> Co. 2. par. Inſt. acc.</note>:
And that the Advowſon or Patrons Right to Preſent is a Temporal
and not a Spiritual Inheritance. For at the firſt Creation of a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
if Lands were given to erect a Church thereon, the Advowſon
thereof became appendant to that Mannor, and reputed as parcel
thereof, which being Temporal, the other became ſo alſo, as an

it hath been ever held, That by the Common Law an Advowſon
is a Temporal Inheritance, for that it lieth in Tenure, and may be

been held of the King in <hi>Capite,</hi> or in Knights Service<note n="m" place="margin">Vid. 12 H. 17. 19. 21 Ed. 3. 5.</note>. And

beneficial qualification, than that which is Appendant; and that
which is Appendant, may by ſeverance become an Advowſon in

granting one Acre belonging to that Mannor <hi>unà cum Advocatione

the Queſtion was, whether the Advowſon did paſs as
Appendant to the Acre, or as an Advowſon in Groſs? And the
better Opinion was, That by that Grant the Advowſon was ſevered
from the Mannor, and was become in Groſs; for that the Deed
ſhall be taken moſt beneficial for the Grantee to have the Advowſon

(9.) If the King makes a Leaſe for life of a Mannor, to which
an Advowſon is Appendant, without making any mention of the
Advowſon, the Advowſon remains in the King as in Groſs; as was
granted by the Juſtices: And it was ſaid by them, That in ſuch caſe by
Grant of the Reverſion, <hi>Habendum</hi> the Reverſion with the Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
the Advowſon paſſeth not to the Patentee, for that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon

in another Caſe, where it was found before Commiſſioners, That <hi>A.</hi>
was ſeized of a Mannor, to which an Advowſon was appendant,
and that he was a Recuſant convict; whereupon two parts of the
Mannor were ſeized into the Kings hands, who leaſed the Mannor,
with Appurtenances, and all profits and commodities, and Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taments
to the ſame belonging, unto <hi>J. S.</hi> for 21 years, if <hi>A,</hi> &amp;c.
and afterwards the Church became void. In this Caſe it was held,
That albeit there was no mention in the ſeizure of the Advowſon,
yet the Preſentment belonged to the King, and that the King alone
ſhould Preſent. Secondly, That there were no words in the Kings
Grant to <hi>J. S.</hi> to carry away the Advowſon from the King, and
that notwithſtanding that Grant, the Advowſon remained ſtill Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant

contrary to the nature of an Advowſon regularly; and therefore

afterwards the Church became void, and ſo they by the Statute

was appendant to a Mannor, and that two parts of the
Mannor were ſeized into the Kings hands by Proceſs out of the

Two parts to the Defendant with the Appurtenances, and granted
alſo all Hereditaments (but Advowſons were not mentioned in the

It was Reſolved, That the Advowſon did not paſs by the

<hi>Adeo plena &amp; integra, &amp; in tam amplo modo &amp; forma;</hi> as the Recuſant

               <p>(11.) In caſe a Patron be Outlawed, and the Church becoming
void a Stranger doth uſurp, and preſents his Clerk to the Avoidance,
and Six months paſs, and afterwards the King, being entitled to the
Avoidance by reaſon of the Outlawry, bring a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> againſt
the Incumbent as being in wrongfully, and remove him: By this
means the Advowſon is recontinued again to the Rightful Patron,
whereof he was ouſted by the Uſurpation, who upon the reverſal

was, Whether, notwithſtanding all this matter, the Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
did remain Appendant or not? And it was Adjudged by the
Court, That the Advowſon remained Appendant, notwithſtanding
the Queens preſentation of <hi>J. D.</hi> For it appeared, there was no
colour of Title to the Queen to preſent; no Lapſe, for the Preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
Inſtitution, &amp;c. were all in the ſame month, wherein the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance
was: And it was no Uſurpation by the Queen, becauſe the
Preſentation ſuppoſed a Right where none was, and ſo was void;
for the Queen meant to do no wrong: And upon the ſame reaſon
the Preſentation of <hi>R.</hi> afterwards by the King was void. And it
was then further holden by the Court, That the Preſentation of
<hi>J. D.</hi> being void, it was but a Collation of the Biſhop, which makes
no diſappendancy, nor ſo much as a plenarty againſt the Rightful
Patron, but that he may bring his <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> when he will;
and if the Biſhop receive his Clerk, the other is out <hi>ipſo facto</hi>

               <p>(14.) Although an Advowſon be a kind of Reverſion of a right
of Preſentation to a Living or Benefice called Spiritual, yet it is now
in the nature of other Temporal Inheritances; and therefore he
that hath this Right in him, may either deviſe it by Will, or grant
it by Deed, in Fee, or for life, or for years, as other things<note n="m" place="margin">Co. 5. 56. 15 H. 7. 8.</note>.
And in regard an Advowſon or <hi>Jus Patronatus</hi> refers to and reſpects

Endowment thereof; if therefore any debate or controverſie ſhould
happen to ariſe touching any of theſe laſt mentioned, it might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Patron as to his Right to the Advowſon; but if the
controverſie be only touching the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Oblations or

relying on the Book of 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. where <hi>Shard</hi> ſaid, That if the

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:95379:155"/>
doth remain in the Parſon, becauſe the ſame is parcel of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowſon

and his Endowment originally only as a Maintenance for
him in officiating the Cure for the caſe of the Parſon, whoſe
Concern it is to ſee that he be a fit and able perſon ſufficient
for the Cure, it ſhould thence ſeem rational that the Parſon
ſhould be his Patron, to Preſent ſuch an one to the Vicarage as

called a <hi>Demeſne,</hi> for that it is not ſuch a thing as a man hath
a Manual occupation or poſſeſſion of, as he hath of Lands, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nements,

lies not, as the other, in Manual occupation: And therefore in the

to be Appendant to Rents, Services, and the like, becauſe ſuch things
are extinguiſhable<note n="p" place="margin">Co. 4. <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringham</hi>'s Caſe.</note>. And although an Advowſon be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly

the Law (which hath the cleareſt proſpect of Caſualties at a

ſuch an Advowſon is exempt from divers prejudicial Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
which the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the Appendant, cannot well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void.

caſe of the King, who may grant the Advowſon notwithſtanding

granted the Mannor to <hi>J. D.</hi> after the death of <hi>J. S. Habendum

may be diſpoſſeſſed of his preſent Preſentation, he cannot be ſo of
his Advowſon, and therefore he may ſtill grant it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               </list>
               <p>(1.) IT is a queſtion at this day undecided, Whether Princes or
Popes were the firſt Authors of Appropriations? the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
whereof by each of them is of great Antiquity;
but whether in imitation of <hi>Charles Martell</hi>'s Sacrilegious Preſident
(the firſt by whom Tithes were ever violated in the Chriſtian
World) is but a Suppoſition rather than any Aſſertion among Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:95379:157"/>
It was long ſince Traditionally Recorded in Hiſtory, that
about the year 650. when the ſaid <hi>Charles Martell,</hi> Father of <hi>Pipin,</hi>
after King of <hi>France,</hi> in defence of his Country againſt the <hi>Hunnes,
Gothes,</hi> and <hi>Vandals,</hi> had ſlain no leſs than 34500 of thoſe Infidel
<hi>Sarazens</hi> in one Battel, he did not reſtore to ſuch of the Clergy of
<hi>France</hi> their Tithes, as from whom under a fair pretence of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
the charges of the War thereby, he had (upon a Promiſe
of Reſtitution thereof ſo ſoon as the War ſhould ceaſe) obtained
the ſame; but inſtead thereof gratified ſuch of the Nobility, as
had aſſiſted him in the War, by the grant thereof to them and their
Heirs for ever. But whether this Sacriledge (if it be true) had
ſuch a malign influence upon ſucceeding Princes in After-ages, and
other Kingdoms, and alſo upon the Popes, as ſome Hiſtoriographers
do more than conjecture, is not ſo evident as that which is report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Ingulphus</hi> Abbot of <hi>Crowland,</hi> touching Eight Churches to
have been Appropriated to that Abbey by ſeveral <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings;
and though by their Charters, yet whether by ſuch excluſively
to all Eccleſiaſtical Authority, is not ſo certain, as that <hi>William</hi> the
<hi>Conqueror,</hi> without asking leave of the Pope, Appropriated three
Pariſh-Churches to the Abbey of <hi>Battaile,</hi> which he built in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of his Conqueſt; and his youngeſt Son <hi>H.</hi> 1. nigh twenty in
one day to the Cathedral of <hi>Sarum</hi> by his Letters Patents, together
with the Tithes of thoſe Pariſhes which his elder Brother <hi>William,</hi>
Sirnamed <hi>Rufus,</hi> had depopulated and diſeccleſiated in <hi>New-Forreſt</hi>
in <hi>Hantſhire.</hi> Notwithſtanding which, the Pope (who underſtood
his Supremacy in matters Eccleſiaſtical better than to part with it
upon any Preſidents of Temporal Uſurpations) doth frequently in
his Decretals, without any contradiction, rather aſſume than arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
this Right unto himſelf, as a Prerogative of the Apoſtolick
See, and granted to ſeveral Religious Orders this Priviledge of
taking Eccleſiaſtical Benefices at Lay-mens hands by the mediation
of the Dioceſan, who at a moderate and indifferent rate (as one
Moity of the Annual profits of the Benefice) was to be a Medium
or Expedient between the Religious Houſe and the Incumbent;
but in proceſs of time, partly by the remiſneſs of the Biſhops in that
point, and partly by the Covetouſneſs of the Monks and Friers in
thoſe days, the Incumbents proportion became at laſt ſo inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
that Pope <hi>Vrban</hi> the Fifth by his Legate <hi>Othobon,</hi> about the
year 1260 was forced to inhibit all the Biſhops here in <hi>England</hi>
from Appropriating any more Churches to any Monaſtery or othes
Religious Houſes, ſave only in ſuch caſes where Charity might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
in derogation of Law; and under this <hi>Proviſo</hi> alſo, That the
Biſhops ſhould aſſign a competent proprotion of the Parochial
Fruits for the Maintenance of the Incumbent, according to the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:95379:158"/>
annual value thereof, in caſe the new Appropriators did it not within
Six months next after ſuch Appropriation; but this Conſtitution
not taking the effect expected, a convenient Maintenance for the
Vicar was otherwiſe provided for by Two Statutes, the one made
by <hi>R.</hi> 2. the other by his Succeſſor <hi>H.</hi> 4. So that upon the whole it
may be rationally inferr'd, that theſe Appropriations originally
came, partly by the Act of Eccleſiaſticks, and partly by the Laity.
But what way ſoever they came, this is and hath been held for Law
within this Realm, That albeit the Pope takes upon him to be
Supream Ordinary, yet no Appropriations made by him, or by
any Authority derived from him,<note place="margin">Coke. 5. par. 11, 2, 13. acc.</note> were ever allowed or approved of
by the Laws of this Realm; it being held, That no Appropriations
within this Realm can be made but by the King, or by Authority
derived from him, and by his Licenſe, and that all other Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
are void in Law. An <hi>Appropriation</hi> may be by the King
Sole where he is Patron, but it may not be by the Patron Sole:

in a Caſe of <hi>Commendams</hi> it was long ſince held, That an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
made by the Pope, could not be good without the
King's Licenſe. The like in a Caſe of <hi>Avoidance</hi> was vouched in
<hi>Cawdrie</hi>'s Caſe, That the Entry into a Church by the Authority of
the Pope only, was not good, and that he could not Appropriate a
Church to <hi>Appropriatees</hi> to hold to their own uſe. And in <hi>Gyen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>'s
Caſe it was Reſolved by the Juſtices, That the Ordinary, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
and King, ought to be aſſenting to every <hi>Appropriation;</hi> and
that the Authority which the Pope had uſurped in this Realm, was
by Parliament, 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. acknowledged to be in the King,<note place="margin">Paſch. 19 El. C. B Plowd. Comment. 496. 497 &amp;c. <hi>Grendon</hi>'s Caſe.</note> who as
Supream Ordinary may Appropriate without the Biſhop's Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
               <p>(2.) It ſeems therefore without any contradiction moſt evident,
That <hi>Appropriation</hi> or <hi>Impropriation,</hi> at the Original thereof was,
when the Religious Houſes of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, and the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
perſons, as Abbots, Priors, and the like, had the Advowſon of
any Parſonage to them and their Succeſſors, obtaining Licenſe of
their Holy Father the <hi>Pope,</hi> as alſo of <hi>Kings,</hi> and of their <hi>Ordinaries,</hi>
that they and their Succeſſors ſhould from thenceforth be the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:95379:158"/>
thereof, that it ſhould thenceforth be a Vicarage, and that a
Vicar ſhould ſerve the Cure. So that at the beginning of this Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Monopoly of <hi>Appropriations,</hi> they were made only to ſuch Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
perſons as were qualified to Adminiſter the Sacramental Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances,
and perform Divine Service. Afterwards the Grant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
was gradually enlarged, and extended to Deans and Chapters,
though Bodies Politick, and as ſuch not capable of performing ſuch
Divine Services; yea, and (which was moſt Ridiculous as well as
Impious) to <hi>Nunus,</hi> which were Prioreſſes to ſome Nunnerics, but
not Female-Preachers, as in theſe daies. All which was under a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of maintaining Hoſpitality; and to ſupply all defects hereby
occaſioned, there muſt be the Invention of a Vicar, as the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priators
Deputy, to ſerve them and the Cure, for which he had and
hath the Tithe of <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> and ſuch other ſmall oſſals
of Tithes, as might be ſpared out of the weightier Granaries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
without breach of the Laws of Hoſpitality, thereby Sacrilegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
robbing the Church to enrich themſelves. Thus the poor
Vicar ſhall have ſomething like a certain portion of the Benefice,
whilſt the Abbot and the Covent, and their Lay-Succeſſors, ſhall
be the Parſons, and receive the main Profits, and ſo live by the Altar
without waiting on it, and be Re-baptized by the Law with the
name of <hi>Parſons Imparſonces.</hi> This was that Anciently, which we
now call <hi>Appropriation,</hi> which cannot be made to begin in the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's
Life-time without his Aſſent; and is ſo called, becauſe they
hold the Profits <hi>ad proprium ſuum uſum;</hi> but if ſuch Advowſons
happen to be recovered by Ancient Title, then and in ſuch caſe the
Appropriation of the Parſonage is annulled<note n="a" place="margin">Terms of Law, <hi>verb.</hi> Appropriation.</note>.</p>
               <p>(3.) So that from the Premiſſes it is evident, That this <hi>Appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>Impropriation</hi> is an Annexation of an Eccleſiaſtical Benefice
(which originally was as it were <hi>in nullius Patrimonio</hi>) to the <hi>proper</hi>
and peculiar uſe and benefit of ſome Religious Houſe, Biſhoprick,
Dean and Chapter, Colledge, &amp;c. <hi>Quod Divini juris eſt, id nullius eſt

as are <hi>Impropriators</hi> are ſo denominated, for that now and hereby
they are as Owners of a Feeſimple by reaſon of the perpetuity of their
Title, whence called <hi>Proprietarii,</hi> whereas the Parſons of any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical

but <hi>Vſuſructuarii,</hi> nor were they any other Originally, and not

That in every Licenſe of Appropriations to be thenceforth granted

the Dioceſan of the Place ſhould take care to provide an Annual

and paid out of the Parſonage-Fruits of that Pariſh towards the

to an Appropriation, after the Kings Licenſe firſt had and

               <p>(4.) Although <hi>Appropriations</hi> at their Original were tolerated
only to perſons Eccleſiaſtical, and that in order to their better
Hoſpitality, yet now they are become as Lay-Inheritances, and
adapted as well to perſons Secular as Eccleſiaſtical, and to Bodies
Corporate as well as to perſons Private or Individual, who by
virtue of their Right and Title to a Parſonage or Spiritual Benefice,
may take the Profits thereof to their own proper uſe, maintaining
only a Vicar upon the place to ſerve the Cure. Anciently and Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
theſe Appropriations came from the Pope, afterwards tolerated
by Kings, and with the conſent and approbation of the Ordinary. So
that now Appropriators and Appropriations are no other than Lay-Parſons
&amp; Lay-Parſonages; which Lay-Parſons as they are the Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etaries,
the Common Law allows them to be called the <hi>Incumbents,</hi>
and him, that hath the Church by Appropriation, <hi>Parſon Imparſonee;</hi>
and although they are ſaid to be perpetually Appropriate<note n="g" place="margin">Co. 11. 10. Plow 49. 6.</note>; yet
may be Diſſolved and become <hi>Propriate</hi> again, as in caſe a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

Advowſon ſhould be Recovered by a Title more Legal and more
Ancient than that of the Appropriation; which as it was original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tollerated only to Spiritual perſons, ſo never without the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary's
Conſent and approbation; conſonant whereunto are the
Seventh and Eighth <hi>Canons</hi> of the Council held at <hi>Gangra,</hi> where

Nor was it ever in the Primitive times held lawful for meer
Lay-men and Secular perſons to have any thing to do with the

c. 44. And in the filling of ſuch vacant Appropriations as were
granted to Religious Houſes, the Biſhop was impower'd by Law
to oblige the Proprietaries to ſet out for the Vicar Incumbent ſuch

               <p>(5.) Whereas it hath been formerly hinted, §. 5. that Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
have heretofore been granted to <hi>Nunneries, Hobard</hi> Chief
Juſtice is expreſs againſt it, That a Benefice with Cure could not be
Approprietated to a Nunnery, though the Pope made many <hi>de
facto,</hi> Citing <hi>Dyer</hi> in <hi>Grindon</hi>'s Caſe, ſaying, That it was a thing
Abominable, both againſt the Law of God<note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 34.</note>, and the Law of
this Realm;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 11, 12.</note> for <hi>Beneficium non datur niſi propter Officium.</hi> Nor is
it a ſufficient Anſwer to ſay, the Cure might be ſerved by a Curate
for them; for the queſtion is not, How they might make a Curate,
but how themſelves were capable; for it muſt radically veſt in the
firſt Grantee, before it can go in title of Procuration or Deputation
to any other: For the proper and operative words which make an
Appropriation, are ſuch as muſt make the Patron and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
perpetual Parſons; yet if a meer Lay-man, or one wholly
illiterate be Preſented, Inſtituted, and Inducted: this is not a meer
Nullity, but he is a Parſon <hi>de facto,</hi> as having all the Ceremonies
to make him ſuch, and his Inſufficiency muſt receive Examination,
yet no Diſpenſation can make him a lawful Parſon, not ſubject to
Deprivation, becauſe it is <hi>Malum in ſe;</hi> but in the other Caſe the
Incapacity appears in it ſelf<note n="i" place="margin">Mich. 10 Joc. rot. 2642. C. B. <hi>Coli</hi> and <hi>Glover</hi> verſ. Biſhop of <hi>Cov.</hi> and <hi>Lichfield.</hi> Hob. Rep.</note>. Nor are Appropriations regularly
grantable over, neither can they endure longer than the Bodies,
whereunto they were firſt Appropriate; becauſe it carries not only
the Glebe and Tithes (which may be granted away) but it doth
alſo give them the Spiritual Function, and doth make the Parſons
of the Church, and doth ſupply (ſo <hi>Hobart</hi> Chief Juſtice) Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and Induction, which being the higheſt parts of Truſts, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be eſtranged: And therefore the Inſtrument of Appropriation
runs in theſe words, <hi>viz.</hi> That they and their Succeſſors (not
their Aſſigns) ſhall be Parſons, or by <hi>Periphraſis</hi> hold the Church
in proper uſe<note n="k" place="margin">Hill. 15 Jac. Rot. 1510. <hi>W. Wright</hi> verſ. <hi>Gilbert Gerrand</hi> and <hi>Hilderſham.</hi> Hob. Rep.</note>. Likewiſe when an Appropriation was made
by the King as the Supream Ordinary, or by a Biſhop as the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
under him, the Inſtrument thereof did run in theſe or the
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95379:160"/>
like words, <hi>viz.</hi> (if by the King) <hi>Authoritate noſtra Regali;</hi> (if

which purpoſe it was Reſolved in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
in Chancery by <hi>Egerton</hi> Lord Chancellor of <hi>England,</hi> being aſſiſted
with the Principal Judges, That although an Advowſon doth not
paſs by the Grant of the King in ſtrictneſs of Law, by the words
<hi>cum pertinentiis;</hi> yet it ſhall be intended in reſpect of the Ancient
and continued poſſeſſion, that there was a lawful Grant of the
King to <hi>H. B.</hi> &amp;c. and all ſhall be preſumed to be done, which
might make the Ancient Appropriation good: And the Reaſon
thereof there given is, for that if the Appropriation had been
drawn in queſtion in the Life-time of any of the Parties to it, they
might have ſhewed the truth of the matter: But after ſo many
Succeſſions of Ages, in which the Church was eſteemed to be
rightfully Appropriated, the Appropriation ſhall not now be
drawn in queſtion<note n="m" place="margin">Hill. 4 Jac. in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, <hi>Predle,</hi> and <hi>Beard,</hi> &amp; <hi>Wingfield</hi>'s Caſe. Co. 12. par. 5.</note>. For the ſame reaſon a <hi>Procedendo</hi> was
refuſed to be granted in <hi>Chancery</hi> in the Caſe of the Lord St. <hi>John</hi>
of <hi>Bletſo</hi> and the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> the Court then
giving for Reaſon, becauſe the Defendant and thoſe from whom
he claimed, time out of mind had had the poſſeſſion of a Parſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
as Impropriate (ſaving for ſome ſhort time;) and becauſe it
ſhall be a dangerous Preſident for Owners of Impropriations, to
maintain the Appropriations to be Perfect in all points and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
requiſite to an Abſolute Appropriation, the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations
being made of Ancient time<note n="n" place="margin">Trin. 29 Eliz. in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery. Lord <hi>St. John</hi> and the Dean and Chapter of <hi>Glouceſter</hi>'s Caſe. Vid. Co. 12. par. 3. acc.</note>. The like Reſolution
was given by the Court in <hi>Hunſton</hi> and <hi>Cockett</hi>'s Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That

               <p>(7.) An Appropriation cannot in any caſe be made by the Patron
himſelf only; yet where the King is Patron, it may be made
by him Sole. And although upon every Appropriation there
ought to be an Endowment of a Vicar, yet a Vicarage it ſelf En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed,
may (as hath been held by the whole Court) be Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated,

any thing therein during the life of the Incumbent, it will be void;

               <p>(8.) Touching <hi>Appropriations</hi> there were Three conſiderable
Points in Law, Reſolved by the Juſtices in <hi>Grendon</hi>'s Caſe:
(1) That none is capable of Appropriation but a Body Corporate
or Politick Spiritual, which hath a Succeſſion: For that the effect
of an Appropriation as to the firſt Inſtitution thereof, was to make
the Body Politick perpetual Incumbent, and to have the Rectory,
and that he hath the Cure of all the Souls of the Pariſhioners:
and therefore he muſt be a Spiritual perſon. (2) That the King,
Ordinary, and Patron, ought to be aſſenting unto every Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation;
and that the Authority which the Pope had uſurped in
this Realm, was by Parliament, <hi>An. 25 H.</hi> 8: acknowledged to be
in the King; and the King being Supream Ordinary, might of his
own Authority and Juriſdiction make an Appropriation without
the Aſſent of the Biſhop. (3) That an Appropriation may be
made by Apt words, when the Church is Full (as to ſay) That
the Parſon who is a Spiritual perſon, after that the Church ſhall
be void, ſhall be Parſon, and may retain the Glebe, and the Fruits
of the Church to his proper uſe; and that the ſame ſhall be a
good Appropriation, when the Church ſhall be void by death or
otherwiſe<note n="s" place="margin">Paſch. 19 Eliz. C. B. Plowd. Com. 496 to 501, &amp;c. <hi>Grendon</hi>'s Caſe.</note>.</p>
               <p>(9.) It is brought by way of Report to us, That it was the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
of the Maſter of the <hi>Rolls</hi> in the great Caſe of Conſultation,
which was argued in the Exchequer Chamber, the 18 <hi>H. 6. 21. a.</hi>
That an Advowſon could not be Appropriate without a Succeſſion,
although that the Incumbent purchaſed the Advowſon by Licenſe
to hold to his Own uſe. Where it was further ſaid, That if a
Prior were ſeized of an Advowſon to him and his Heirs, and he
purchaſe Licenſe of Appropriation, and that he and his Succeſſors
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:95379:161"/>
might hold the Advowſon to their own uſe; yet the Advowſon
ſhall deſcend to his Heirs: But in ſuch caſe, if he would have the
Appropriation to be good, it were beſt to alien the Advowſon, and
after to re-purchaſe it to him and his Succeſſors; and then the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation
will be good<note n="t" place="margin">Hugh. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgm. verb. <hi>Appropriat.</hi>

conſiſting of meer Lay-men, or Lay-Corporations. And in
<hi>Alden</hi> and <hi>Tothil</hi>'s Caſe it was in queſtion, Whether the King, ſince
the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. might by his Letters Patents Appropriate a
Church Parochial, which was before Preſentative, unto a Lay-Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
all the Members of the Corporation being meer Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:

Church which is Appropriated to a Spiritual Corporation, may
become diſappropriate, if the Corporation be-diſſolved<note n="x" place="margin">Vid. 3 E. 7. 4. Finch. Comment. 14. acc.</note>.
Alſo if the Advowſon of a Church were by Licenſe granted to
a Prior and his Succeſſors, and afterwards the ſame Church were
Appropriated to him and his Succeſſors, ſo as thereby they became
perpetual Parſons Imparſonees: In that Caſe if the Wife of a
Grantor were endowed of the Advowſon, and Preſented a Clerk,
who was Admitted, Inſtituted, and Inducted, the Appropriation
would be defeated for ever; for the whole Eſtate of the Parſon
Imparſonee is thereby avoided: And ſo it was Adjudged, 2 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 8.

(12.) A Prior was ſeized of the Advowſon of a Parſonage; the
Church being void, the Biſhop gave him Licenſe to hold it to his

The Jury found the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. of <hi>Appropriations:</hi> and of

               <p>(1.) <hi>COmmendam (Eccleſia Commendata</hi>) is a Benefice or
Eccleſiaſtical Living, which being void, is <hi>commended</hi>
to the charge and care of ſome ſufficient Clerk, to be
ſupplied until it may be conveniently provided of a Paſtor: And
this was the Original of what we now commonly call <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams.

Church is thus <hi>Commended,</hi> hath the Fruits and Profits thereof
only for a certain time; whereby the nature of the Church is not
changed, but is as a thing depoſited in his hands as it were in Truſt,
being concredited only with the care and cuſtody thereof, which
may be revoked. Thus when a Parſon of a Pariſh is made the

conſequently repugnant to the nature of a Benefice, which is Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual:

               <p>(3.) In the Caſe of <hi>Colt</hi> and <hi>Glover</hi> againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Coven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi>
and <hi>Lichfield,</hi> according to Sir <hi>Hen. Hobart</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice,
out of the Canons, <hi>Commendams</hi> are ſaid to be of Three Degrees,
one <hi>Semeſtris,</hi> another <hi>Perpetua vel ad vitam,</hi> a third <hi>Intermedia</hi> or
<hi>Diuturna, ſed Limitata;</hi> and ſometimes called <hi>Temporaria</hi> or <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralis,
vel ad certum Temporis ſpatium Limitata. Clem. v. Extra.</hi>
l. 3. <hi>de Praebendis,</hi> c. 2. The <hi>Commenda Semeſtris</hi> did ariſe out of
natural equity, that in the time of the Patrons reſpite given him to
Preſent, the Church ſhould not be without a Proviſional Paſtor,
which was a Law of Neceſſity agreeable to the Law of Nature.
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95379:163"/>
But after the Lapſe juſtly incurred, the <hi>Commendam</hi> is to ceaſe, or
then the Ordinary may Collate. The <hi>Commenda Perpetua vel ad
vitam,</hi> is that which cannot be for a leſs time than for the life of
the <hi>Commendatary</hi> abſolute. And the <hi>Commenda Intermedia, diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turna,
or Temporalis, vel ad certum temporis ſpatium Limitata,</hi> is,
when a <hi>Commenda</hi> is to a perſon not for his life abſolutely, but ſo
long as he ſhall be Biſhop of ſuch a place, or the like. Each of
which Degrees of <hi>Commendams</hi> doth refer to the <hi>Commendam ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere,
capere, &amp; apprehendere.</hi> A Diſpenſation <hi>Commendam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere,</hi>
which ſhall make a Title, ought to have three Incidents;
(1) It ought to be, <hi>Recipere &amp; convertere in uſus proprios.</hi> (2) It
ought to be <hi>ad utilitatem Eccleſiae, vel Parſonae.</hi> (3) It ought to
have the Aſſent of the Patron. And he that is but <hi>mere Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarius</hi>
is Accountable to the Ordinary. <hi>Vid. Caſe</hi> Evans <hi>and</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cough,

in truth is no <hi>Commendam,</hi> though commonly ſo called; but is
only a Faculty of Retention and Continuation of the Benefice in the
ſame perſon and ſtate wherein it was, notwithſtanding ſomething
intervening, as a Biſhoprick or the like, which without ſuch a Faculty
would have avoided it.</p>
               <p>(4.) The <hi>Semeſtral</hi> Commendatary is not reputed <hi>Praelatus,</hi> but
<hi>Procurator &amp; Adminiſtrator, habens titulum Canonicum;</hi> It doth
make <hi>Fructus ſuos,</hi> but <hi>ad providendum ſibi &amp; Miniſtris;</hi> and what
remains, is to be converted to the uſe of the Church. <hi>Greg.</hi> X. <hi>in

certain that is then Full; for there is no difference betwixt a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendam</hi>
and a <hi>Preſentation,</hi> but that the one Preſents the Parſon
to the Church, the other commits the Church to the Parſon, both
being incompatible when the Church hath his proper Rector;
The Canons alſo ſpeaking of <hi>Commendams,</hi> rely much upon <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias

Likewiſe, it is further aſſerted by Sir <hi>Hen. Hobart</hi> in the Caſe
aforeſaid, That the Temporary <hi>Commenda</hi> brings with it ſo many
Incongruities, Inconveniences, and Abſurdities in Law, as cannot be
born; for thereby the Church is neither altogether void, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in the Caſe of a <hi>Commendam Semeſtris,</hi> which is but a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration
of Fruits and Cure till the Patron Preſents; neither is

The Canon Law, to which only we are beholding for the cleareſt

is now veſted in the King <hi>de jure;</hi> yet it will be agreed on

<hi>John Horſefall,</hi> then Biſhop of <hi>Oſſery,</hi> That the ſaid Biſhop <hi>unum

ratified and confirmed by Letters Patents under the Great Seal of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Statute of 28 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 16. After this, <hi>viz.</hi>
20 <hi>May, An. 38 Eliz. Patrick Fynne</hi> the Incumbent died, whereby
the ſaid Vicarage being void, and ſo continuing void by the ſpace of
<hi>Six months,</hi> whereby the Biſhop had power to Collate thereunto
by <hi>Lapſe,</hi> the ſaid Biſhop by virtue of the ſaid Faculty or Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<hi>adeptus eſt, occupavit, &amp; retinuit</hi> the ſaid Vicarage <hi>perpetuae
Commendae titulo,</hi> and took the Fruits thereof to his own uſe, until
the 13 <hi>Febr. An.</hi> 1609. on which day the Biſhop died: After whoſe
death the ſaid <hi>Cyprian Horſefall,</hi> having purchaſed the next Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of that Vicarage, Preſented the ſaid <hi>Wale,</hi> who was Admitted,
Inſtituted, and Inducted: And afterwards the King Preſents one
<hi>Winch,</hi> who being diſturbed by the ſaid <hi>Horſefall</hi> and <hi>Wale,</hi> the
King brought a <hi>Quare Impedit.</hi> Whether the ſaid Biſhop, when he
obtained and occupied that Vicarage by virtue of that Faculty or
Diſpenſation, were thereby made compleat Incumbent thereof, ſo as
the Church being full of him, no Title by <hi>Lapſe</hi> could devolve to
the King during the life of the Biſhop, was the Principal point mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
and debated in this Caſe. And in the Argument of this point
(which was argued at the Bar firſt by the Counſel at Common Law,
and then by two Advocates well verſed in the Canon Law, and at
the Bench by all the Juſtices) Two things were chiefly conſidered
by thoſe who argued for the Kings Clerk: (1) Whether the Biſhop
could by any Law have and hold that Benefice without ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
or Faculty. (2) What effect or operation that Faculty
or Diſpenſation ſhall have by the Law. As to the Firſt, they held
clearly for Law, That a Biſhop by the Ancient Eccleſiaſtical Law
of <hi>England,</hi> may not hold another Benefice with Cure in his own
Dioceſs: and if he hath ſuch Benefice before his promotion to the
Biſhoprick, that it becomes void when he is created a Biſhop. And
this is the Ancient Law of <hi>England,</hi> as is often ſaid in the Biſhop of
St. <hi>David</hi>'s Caſe, 11 <hi>H. 4. &amp; 41 Ed. 3. 5. b.</hi> agrees therewith. The
Reaſon is, for that the Biſhop cannot viſit himſelf, and he that
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95379:166"/>
hath the Office of a Sovereign ſhall not hold the Office of a Subject
at the ſame time; as <hi>Hankeford</hi> ſaid in the ſaid Caſe of 11 <hi>H.</hi> 4.
And on this Reaſon it is ſaid in 5 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. 9. That if a Parſon be
made a Dean, the Parſonage becomes void, for that the Dignity and
the Benefice are not compatible. So no Eccleſiaſtical perſon, by
the Ancient Canons and Councils, could have Two Benefices, with
Cure <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> but the firſt would be void by taking aſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
And this was the Ancient Law of the Church uſed in
<hi>England</hi> long before the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">21 H. 8. c. 13.</note> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. which was
made in Affirmance of the Ancient Law, as appears in <hi>Holland</hi>'s
Caſe. <hi>Co. par.</hi> 4. And with this agrees the Books of 24 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
33. 39 <hi>Ed. 3. 44. a. &amp; N. Br. 34. l.</hi> And the Text of the Canon
Law, which is the proper Fountain of this Learning, proves it
fully; <hi>Decretal. de Praeben. &amp; Dignit.</hi> c. <hi>de multa:</hi> Where it is
ſaid, <hi>De multa providentia fuit in</hi> Lateranenſi <hi>Concilio prohibitum,
ut nullus diverſas Dignitates Eccleſiaſticas, vel plures Eccleſias
Parochiales reciperet, contra Sanctorum Canonum inſtituta, &amp;c.
Praeſenti Decreto ſtatuimus, ut quicunque receperit aliquod Beneficium,
curam habens animarum annexam, ſi prius tale Beneficium habebat, eo ſit
ipſo jure privatus, &amp; ſi forte illud retinere contenderit, etiam alio ſpolie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,
&amp;c.</hi> And with this agrees the Text in <hi>Decret. Cauſ. 21. q.</hi> 1. viz.
<hi>In duabus Eccleſiis Clericus conſcribi nullo modo poteſt.</hi> So that it is
evident, that the Biſhop could not by any Law have or retain
that Benefice within his Dioceſs without a Diſpenſation, which
is <hi>Relaxatio Juris,</hi> and permits that to be done, which the Law
had before prohibited. It is to be obſerved, That <hi>Commenda eſt
quaedam proviſio,</hi> and therefore <hi>Gomez. in Reg. de Idiomate,</hi> ſaith,
That <hi>Commendare eſt Providere, &amp; quod Commenda comprehendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur
ſub quibuſcunque regulis de Proviſione loquentibus.</hi> And by
the Canon Law the Conſent of the Patron is requiſite, where a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
is given <hi>in Commendam. Lib. 6. Decretal.</hi> c. <hi>Nemo.</hi> where
the Gloſs ſaith, <hi>Ad Commendam vacabitur Patronus, &amp; ſi qui alii
ex tali Commenda laeduntur.</hi> Alſo in <hi>Conſtit. Othob. de Commendis</hi>
it is ſaid expreſly, That <hi>Conſenſus Patroni ad Commendam requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritur.</hi>
The <hi>Canon</hi> Law holds theſe <hi>Commendams</hi> as very prejudicial,
and that in divers reſpects; and therefore ſays, That <hi>Experientia
docet, occaſione Commendarum cultum Divinum minui, Curam ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marum
negligi, hoſpitalitatem Conſuetam &amp; debitam non ſervari,
ruinis aedificia ſupponi, &amp;c. 6. Extra. cap Paſtoris.</hi> And whereas
it is ſaid of a Biſhop, That he is to be <hi>unius uxoris vir;</hi> the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noniſts
expound it, That he ſhall have but one Biſhoprick, or
only one Cure, for they ſay, that <hi>per Commondam Bigamia con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahitur
in Eccleſia:</hi> Therefore it was well Reſolved by that good
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95379:166"/>
and pious Biſhop, who (when another Benefice was offered him
to hold <hi>in Commendam</hi>) ſaid, <hi>Abſit ut cum Sponſa habeam Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cubinam.</hi>
But for the clearer underſtanding of the nature and
difference of theſe <hi>Commendams,</hi> it is further to be conſidered,
That <hi>Commenda Eccleſiae</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>Commendatio Eccleſiae
ad Cuſtodiam alterius;</hi> and therefore <hi>Decret. cauſ. 21. q. 1. Qui
plures,</hi> the Gloſs there ſaith, <hi>Commendare nihil aliud eſt quam
deponere.</hi> This <hi>Commenda</hi> or <hi>Commendatio Eccleſiae</hi> is divers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the nature of the Church, and the Limitation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the <hi>Commenda:</hi> for a <hi>Commenda</hi> may be of a Church
either <hi>Curatae</hi> or <hi>non Curatae;</hi> and it may be either <hi>Temporanea,
viz.</hi> for a time certain, as for Six months, or <hi>Perpetua, viz.</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the life of the <hi>Commendatary.</hi> A Church <hi>with Cure</hi> may
not be given <hi>in Commendam,</hi> unleſs upon evident neceſſity, or
the benefit of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſupply the Cure till provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
be made of a ſufficient Incumbent: And therefore by the
Council of <hi>Lions</hi> it was provided, That a Parochial Church
ſhould not be given <hi>in Commendam, niſi ex evidenti neceſſitate, vel
utilitate Eccleſiae; &amp; quod talis Commenda ultra ſemeſtris tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris
ſpatium non duraret: &amp; quod ſecus factum fuerit, ſit irritum
ipſo jure, &amp;c. 6. Decretal.</hi> c. <hi>Nemo.</hi> But a Benefice without Cure
may be given by the Canon Law for the ſubſiſtence of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatary,
<hi>vel ad menſam:</hi> In that ſenſe the Canoniſts ſay, That
<hi>Commenda</hi> is <hi>quaſi comedenda, quia Eccleſiae quae traditur in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendam
quaſi comeditur &amp; devoratur,</hi> and ſuch a Benefice may
properly be given <hi>in perpetuam Commendam. Summa ſummar. tit.</hi>
Commenda, <hi>art. 1, &amp;</hi> 2. And by the Rule of the Canon Law,
he that comes in <hi>per Commendam,</hi> is not <hi>Praelatus, ſed Procurator
tantum, &amp; eſt niſi Cuſtos, ſeu Adminiſtrator, &amp; jus in Eccleſia
non habet. 6. Decretal.</hi> c. <hi>Nemo. &amp; Conſtit. Othobon. de Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis,
fo.</hi> 65. And therewith agrees 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 15. where it is ſaid,
That the Cardinal of <hi>York</hi> had the Abbey of St. <hi>Albans</hi> in <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondam,</hi>
and yet was not the Abbot. In this Caſe of a <hi>Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi>
in <hi>Davis</hi> Rep. the Original or invention of a <hi>Commendam</hi>
is aſcribed to Pope <hi>Leo 4. An. Dom. 848. aut eo circiter,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<hi>lib. Decretal. cauſ. 23. q.</hi> 2. where it is ſaid, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nde Leo 4. ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
Qui plures Eccleſias retinet, unam quidem Titulatam, alteram
vero ſub Commendatione tenere debet:</hi> For by the Ancient Canons
and Councils a man could have but one Benefice, and yet it is by
experience found convenient, that ſometimes, <hi>viz.</hi> in caſe of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity</hi>
or <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tility</hi> of the Church, a man may have the Charge and
Fruits of more Benefices than one; therefore was that Diſtinction
invented and allowed, that although a man ſhall have but one Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:95379:167"/>
                  <hi>in Titulo,</hi> yet he may have other Benefices <hi>in Commenda,
viz.</hi> That another Benefice may be commended and committed to
his Cuſtody and Cure, until it be provided with an able Incumbent.
But afterwards, there being great Abuſes found in the granting
of theſe <hi>Commendams</hi> by the Ordinaries (for <hi>omnium rerum qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
eſt uſus, poteſt eſſe abuſus, virtute ſolum excepta,</hi> ſays <hi>Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi>)
another Canon was made in the Council of <hi>Lions, An. Dom.</hi>
1274. for reformation thereof, as appears <hi>lib. 6. Decretal. de Elect. &amp;
Elect. poteſta. c. Nemo. Nemo deinceps Parochialem Eccleſiam alicui non
Conſtituto in legitima aetate vel Sacerdotio Commendare praeſumat;
nec tali, niſi unam, &amp; evidenti Neceſſitate vel <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tilitate Eccleſiae
ſuadente. Hujuſmodi autem Commendam rite factam declaramus
ultra Semeſtre temporis ſpatium non durare, &amp;c.</hi> But the Gloſs there
ſaith, That <hi>Iſta Conſtitutio non comprehendit Romanum Pontificem,
ideo Romanus Pontifex poteſt Perpetuo Commendare.</hi> So that the
Pope, notwithſtanding that Canon, had power to give Benefices
<hi>in perpetuam Commendam.</hi> And indeed after the ſaid Council of
<hi>Lions,</hi> as the Pope had reſerved to himſelf the ſole power of
giving Benefices <hi>in perpetuam Commendam,</hi> ſo he reduced that
power into act, and uſed and practiſed the ſame in all Realms of
Chriſtendom: Specially the Popes that were reſident at <hi>Avignon</hi> in
<hi>France</hi> in the times of King <hi>H. 2. Ed. 1. Ed. 2. Ed.</hi> 3. were very
liberal not only in granting theſe <hi>Proviſions</hi> (contrary to our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes
made in the times of King <hi>Ed. 1. &amp; Ed.</hi> 3.) but in giving all
ſorts of Eccleſiaſtical Benefices <hi>in Commendam perpetuam.</hi> And as
at firſt it was done for the ſupport of the Dignity of Cardinals, as
Pope <hi>Clement.</hi> 6. profeſſed in his Epiſtle to <hi>Ed. 3. Hiſt. Walſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
fo. 150. b.</hi> yet afterwards theſe Favours were purchaſed by
other Eccleſiaſtical perſons of all degrees, in all Nations, ſpecially
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And whereas the Canon Law ſays, That
a man hath a Cononical Title by virtue of a <hi>Commendam,</hi> that
muſt be underſtood <hi>de Commenda perpetua,</hi> and not <hi>de Commenda
Temporali;</hi> for the <hi>Commenda Temporalis</hi> is but a kind of Seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
and may be granted by every Ordinary <hi>pro tempore Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtri;</hi>
and therefore ſuch a Commendatary <hi>non eſt Praelatus, nec
Maritus Eccleſiae, nec facit Fructus ſuos, ſed eſt Adminiſtrator tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,
&amp; Cuſtos Eccleſiae.</hi> And ſuch a <hi>Commenda non eſt titulus, nec
facit titulum, ſed eſt quoddam depoſitum,</hi> until the Church be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with a ſufficient Incumbent; and therefore ſuch a <hi>Commenda</hi>
is commonly granted when the Patron doth not Preſent an able
perſon, or when the Church is Litigious. But the <hi>Commenda
perpetua,</hi> which continues during the life of the <hi>Commendatary,</hi>
cannot be granted by any inferiour Ordinary, but only by the Pope
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95379:167"/>
in ſuch Countries where he hath Juriſdiction, or by the King or
his Delegates in this Realm, or ſuch whoſe power therein is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

to a void Benefice, from the Original Patron
neglecting to Preſent (within Six months next after
the Avoidance) to the Ordinary. Whence it is commonly ſaid,
That that Benefice is in Lapſe or Lapſed, whereunto he that ought
to Preſent, hath omitted or ſlipped his opportunity<note n="a" place="margin">An. 13 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. c. 12.</note>. This
Lapſe may happen and be, the Patron being ignorant of the Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as well as if he were acquainted therewith or privy thereto,
except only upon the Reſignation of the former Incumbent, or the
Deprivation upon any cauſe comprehended in the Statute of 13 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</hi>
cap. 12. In which caſes the Biſhop ought to give notice thereof

Patron, upon whoſe default (1) the Biſhop of the Dioceſs,

Preſent, for that he is Patron <hi>paramount</hi> of all the Benefices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his Realms; as alſo becauſe the King and his Progenitors, Kings
of <hi>England,</hi> have had Authority time out of mind to determine
the Right of Patronages in this Realm in their own Courts, whence
lies no Appeal to any. Foreign pretended Power. The <hi>Roſell Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi>
indeed makes more Gradations in this matter, as from the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron</hi>
to the <hi>Chapter,</hi> from the <hi>Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> from the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>

And although the Law is, That the Ordinary ſhall Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
in caſe the Patron doth not within Six months; yet the Law
withal is, That if the Patron Preſent before the Ordinary put in
his Clerk, the Patron of right ſhall enjoy his Preſentation<note n="b" place="margin">Dr. &amp; Stu. cap. 36.</note>.
And if the Ordinary ſurceſs his time limited, he loſes his power
as to that Preſentation, ſpecially if it be devolv'd to the King:
And when the Preſentation is in the Metropolitan, he ſhall put in
the Clerk himſelf, and not the Ordinary; and ſo there is no default
in the Ordinary, though he Preſent not the Clerk of the Patron,
if his time be paſt, in which caſe there is no remedy for the Patron

(3.) The Continuance of a Voidance of a Church by the ſeveral
Lapſes of Patron, Biſhop, and Archbiſhops, derives the Title of
Preſentation at laſt to the King as Patron paramount of all the
Churches in <hi>England;</hi> and wherever the Original Patron by Law
ought to take notice of a Voidance at his peril, there and in ſuch
caſe by a Non-Preſentation within <hi>Six</hi> months from the time of
ſuch Voidance the Lapſe will ever incurr: And generally by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,

               <p>(1.) <hi>COllation</hi> in its proper ſignification, is the beſtowing of a
Benefice by a Biſhop that hath it in his own proper
right, gift, or patronage; diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>Inſtitution</hi>
only in this, That <hi>Inſtitution</hi> into a Benefice is at the inſtance, motion,
or Preſentation of the Patron, or ſome other having <hi>pro tempore</hi> the
Patrons Right, performed by the Biſhop. <hi>Extra. de Inſtit. &amp; de Conceſſ.
Praeben. &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Collation</hi> is, not only when the perſon is Admitted
to the Church or Benefice by the Biſhop or other perſon Eccleſiaſtical,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:95379:173"/>
but alſo when the Biſhop or that other Eccleſiaſtical perſon is the
rightful Patron thereof; or when the Biſhop or Ordinary hath right
to Preſent for Lapſe of the Patron: and yet ſometimes <hi>Collation</hi> is
and hath been uſed for <hi>Preſentation</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">St 25 Ed. 3. 6.</note>. And ſo <hi>Preſentation, Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>

ſubſtance one and the ſame thing, as aforeſaid<note n="d" place="margin">27 E. 3. 64.</note>: But to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,
<hi>Collation</hi> is where the Biſhop himſelf doth freely give a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
which is of his own Gift by right of Patronage or Lapſe<note n="e" place="margin">25 Ed. 3. 6. 1 Ed. 4.</note>.
This word [<hi>Collation</hi>] ſeems alſo to be frequently uſed when the
King Preſents; and hence it is that there is a Writ called [<hi>Collatione
facta uni poſt mortem alterius, &amp;c.</hi>] directed to the Juſtices of the
Common Pleas, Commanding them to direct their Writ to a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
for the Admitting one Clerk in the place of another Preſented
by the King, which Clerk (during the Suit between the King and
the Biſhops Clerk) is departed this life: For Judgment once given
for the Kings Clerk, and he dying before his Admiſſion, the King
may beſtow his Preſentation on another<note n="f" place="margin">Reg. of Writs, fo. 31. b.</note>. This <hi>Collation, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,</hi>
and <hi>Nomination,</hi> are in effect <hi>Synonima,</hi> being diſtinguiſhed
only in reſpect rather of Perſons, than of Things.</p>
               <p>(2.) Yet there may be a great difference betwixt <hi>Preſentation</hi> and
<hi>Collation,</hi> which gains not the Patronage from the King, as appears
in the Caſe of the Queen againſt the Biſhop of <hi>York,</hi> where the
Queen brought a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> againſt the ſaid Biſhop, and one
<hi>Monk,</hi> and counted upon a Preſentment made by King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in the
right of his Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and ſo conveyed the ſame to the
Queen by Deſcent: The Biſhop pleaded, That he and his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
have <hi>Collated</hi> to the ſaid Church, &amp;c. and <hi>Monk</hi> pleaded the ſame
Plea, upon which there was a Demurrer. And it was moved by <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>
Serjeant, That the Plea is not good, for a <hi>Collation</hi> cannot gain
any Patronage, and cannot be an Uſurpation againſt a Common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
much leſs againſt the Queen, to whom no Lapſes ſhall be aſcrib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

By theſe <hi>Collations</hi> the Queen ſhall be put out of poſſeſſion, and
put to her Writ of Right of Advowſon; but the ſame ought to
be intended, not where the Biſhop <hi>Collates</hi> as Ordinary, but where
he <hi>Collates</hi> as Patron, claiming the Patronage to himſelf, for ſuch
a <hi>Collation</hi> doth amount to a <hi>Preſentation;</hi> and here are two or
three <hi>Collations</hi> pleaded, which ſhould put the Queen out of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſion,

his Writ of Right of Advowſon, which <hi>Anderſon</hi> denied. And it was
holden by the whole Court, here is not any <hi>Preſentation,</hi> and then no
poſſeſſion gained by the <hi>Collations:</hi> and although the Biſhop doth
Collate as <hi>Patron,</hi> and not as <hi>Ordinary,</hi> yet it is but a <hi>Collation.</hi> And
there is a great difference betwixt <hi>Collation</hi> and <hi>Preſentation;</hi> for
<hi>Collation</hi> is a giving of the Church to the Parſon, but <hi>Preſentation</hi>
is a giving or offering of the Parſon to the Church, and that makes
a <hi>Plenarty,</hi> but not a <hi>Collation</hi>

not Election to take any turn other than the Firſt, when the Church

loſt the benefit of his Grant; and the ſubſequent words in the Grant
are but only an Explanation of the words precedent, and relate to
the next Avoidance<note n="q" place="margin">Tr. 8 Jac. B. R. <hi>Starkey</hi> and <hi>Pole</hi>'s Caſe. Bulſtr. 1. par. 26, 27. Hughes Abr. ver. Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Sect. 6. §. 13.</note>.</p>
               <p>(6.) The Right of <hi>Preſentation</hi> is a Temporal thing, and a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Inheritance, and therefore belongeth to the Kings Temporal
Laws to determine, as alſo to make Laws who ſhall Preſent after
Six months as well as before, ſo as the Title of Examination of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi>
or <hi>Nonability</hi> be not thereby taken from the Ordinary. The
Law is the ſame touching Avoidances, for it ſhall be judged by the
Kings Temporal Laws, when and whether the Church may be ſaid
to be void or not; the cognizance whereof doth not belong to the
Kings Eccleſiaſtical Laws; and therefore where a Parſon is made a
Biſhop, or accepts another Benefice without Licenſe, or Reſigneth,
or be Deprived: In theſe caſes the Common Law would hold the
Church void, albeit there were any Eccleſiaſtical Law to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<note n="r" place="margin">Dr. &amp; Stu. cap 36.</note>: And it is ſufficient for the Ordinary's diſcharge, if the
Preſentee be able, by whomſoever he be Preſented; which Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is acknowledged on all ſides to have been ever inherent in the
Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction: But as to the Right of <hi>Preſentation</hi> it
ſelf, to determine who ought to Preſent, and who not, and at what
time, and when the Church ſhall be Judged to become void, and
when not, all theſe appertain to the Kings Temporal Laws. And in
caſe it happen that the King Preſent not, where of Right he may,
in ſuch caſe the Ordinary may <hi>pro tempore</hi> depute a fit perſon to ſerve
the Cure; as in like caſe he may, where there is a default or neglect
in other Patrons to Preſent, and do not<note n="s" place="margin">Dr. &amp; Stu. ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>(7.) If the Patrons be Joynt-tenants, or Tenants in Common of
the Patronage, and they vary or differ in their Preſentations, the
Ordinary is not in that Caſe bound to Admir either of their Clerks,
nor him that is Preſented by the Major part: And if the Six months
expire ere they agree, the Ordinary may Preſent by the Lapſe; but
within the Six months he may not; for if ſo, and the Patrons ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
they may bring a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> againſt him as a Diſturber,
and remove his Clerk. But in caſe the Patrons have the Patronage
by Deſcent as Coparceners, then is the Ordinary obliged to Admit
the Clerk of the Eldeſt Siſter, who hath the precedency by Law in
the <hi>Preſentation,</hi> if ſhe ſo pleaſe, after which and at the next Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
the next Siſter ſhall Preſent, and ſo in order by turn one Siſter
after another till all the Siſters or their Heirs have Preſented, and
then the Eldeſt Siſter ſhall Preſent again, and this is called a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95379:175"/>
by <hi>Turn,</hi> which holdeth alwaies between Coparceners of an
Advowſon, unleſs they agree to Preſent together, or in ſome other
manner by way of Compoſition, which if ſo, then the Agreement
ought to hold good. Yet here note, That if after the death of the
Common Anceſtor, the Church happening to be void, the eldeſt
Siſter together with another of the Siſters, Preſents, and the other
Siſters ſeverally and each in her own Name, or joyntly and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
In this caſe the Ordinary is not obliged to receive any of their
Clerks, but may ſuffer the Church to run into the Lapſe; for there
is no obligation on the Ordinary to admit the Clerk of the Eldeſt
Siſter, but where ſhe Preſents in her own Name only. And in ſuch
caſe of variance or difference among the Patrons touching the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,</hi>
the Church is not properly ſaid <hi>Litigious,</hi> obliging the
Ordinary at his peril to direct a Writ to enquire <hi>de jure Patronatus,</hi>
which Writ lieth only where Two or more Preſent under pretence
of ſeveral Titles, but in this caſe all the Patrons preſent under one
and the ſame Title; for which reaſon the Ordinary may, if he pleaſe,
ſuffer it to paſs into the Lapſe<note n="t" place="margin">Dr. &amp; Stu. cap. 30.</note>.</p>

ought to receive the Clerk of the Teſtator, or of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors?
The Opinion of the whole Court: was, That the Biſhop
ſhould have Election therein<note n="u" place="margin">Trin. 13 Eliz. C. B. <hi>Smalwood</hi> verſ. Biſhop of <hi>Lichfield.</hi> Leon. Rep.</note>. And in caſe an Agreement be

he to whom at the next Avoidance the Second <hi>Preſentation</hi> doth

ſome other in his ſtead: In ſuch caſe it is provided, That ſuch ſo
diſturbed ſhall not be put to the <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> but their reſort

Agreement be found, the Sheriff ſhall be commanded, That he

(9.) In the Caſe of <hi>Evans</hi> and <hi>Aſcough</hi> it was the Opinion of
<hi>Doderidge,</hi> That a Biſhop hath no more in a Church by <hi>Election,</hi>
than a Parſon hath by Preſentation. And that if a man Preſent to
a Church, yet any time before Inſtitution he may revoke it, and
Preſent another; and if in that caſe the Biſhop will Inſtitute the
Firſt, a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> will lie againſt him<note n="y" place="margin">Caſe <hi>Evans</hi> and <hi>Aſcough.</hi> Latch. Rep.</note>. But if the Patron
preſent one, and he be Admitted by the Ordinary, he cannot in that
caſe vary from his Preſentation: as was alſo held by <hi>Doderidge</hi> in

out of all queſtion at the Common Law, that before Admiſſion by
the Ordinary the Lay-Patron may revoke his <hi>Preſentation;</hi> becauſe
a <hi>Preſentation</hi> is no other than a Commendation, which may be by

the <hi>Preſentation,</hi> the <hi>Preſentation</hi> and <hi>Nomination</hi> are all
one. It was then ſaid by <hi>Whitlock,</hi> That in the <hi>Canon</hi> Law it is
allowed to a Lay-man to vary, but not to a Spiritual man; but at
the Common Law it is all one. <hi>Doderidge</hi> and <hi>Jones</hi> ſeemed to
give the Reaſon thereof, when they ſaid, That it may be intended,
that a <hi>Lay</hi>-man cannot at firſt ſo well judge, or is able to diſcern of
the ſufficiency of the party Preſented, but a <hi>Spiritual</hi>-man may.
<hi>Quaere;</hi> If after Admiſſion of the Patrons Preſentee he doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
again Preſent another to the Ordinary, and the Ordinary
Admit, Inſtitute, and Induct the laſt Preſentee, what Remedy for

of the Second<note n="a" place="margin">Caſe. ibid.</note>?</p>
               <p>(10.) To the ſame purpoſe with the premiſſes is that which is
Reported in <hi>Stoke</hi>'s Caſe againſt <hi>Sykes;</hi> the Caſe is this, <hi>viz.</hi> A

death of one <hi>Stokes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">See this Caſe in <hi>Noy</hi>'s Rep.</note> Father of the Plaintiff, then Incumbent of the

And now <hi>Stokes</hi> obtains a Diſpenſation <hi>Non obſtante</hi> the Canon.

Juſtice <hi>Gawdy,</hi> as alſo in the time of Juſtice <hi>Coke</hi> in the Common
Pleas, where both Parſons claimed by one Patron: But <hi>Doderidge</hi>
there held, That the <hi>Canon</hi> before-mentioned doth not hold in this
Church; and ſo ſaid <hi>Doderidge</hi> was the Opinion of a Learned <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilian:</hi>
So by the <hi>Canon</hi> Law a man cannot have that Woman in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:95379:176"/>
Marriage, whom he had in Avowry before; yet that Canon doth
not hold in our Church. <hi>Doderidge</hi> ſaid, that the <hi>Civilians</hi> hold,
That a <hi>Lay</hi>-Patron cannot revoke his <hi>Preſentation,</hi> but he may
<hi>cumulando variare,</hi> and ſo the Ordinary hath Election to Inſtitute
which of them he will; but that a <hi>Spiritual</hi> Patron cannot <hi>vary</hi> at
all. But he ſaid, that at the Common Law it is out of queſtion,
That a Patron before Inſtitution may revoke his <hi>Preſentation:</hi> And
if the Patron preſent one, and the Ordinary admit him, but will
not give him Inſtitution, <hi>Duplex Quaerela</hi> lies againſt the Ordinary,
to enforce him to do his duty: But if both Parſons claim by one
Patron, and the one ſues a <hi>Duplex Quaerela,</hi> a Prohibition lies not
before Inſtitution. But <hi>Jones</hi> denied it, and ſaid, That it had been
Reſolved to the contrary. <hi>Doderidge</hi> ſaid, That in that caſe the Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

the Book contrary; but it ſeems to be in reaſon that the Law
is clear, That a <hi>Lay</hi>-Patron may change, although that a <hi>Spiritual</hi>
Patron cannot, and the reaſon is (as aforeſaid) becauſe a <hi>Lay</hi>-perſon
did not know his Sufficiency perhaps at the firſt; but a <hi>Spiritual</hi> perſon
by intendment may inform himſelf thereof well enough, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was vouched 18 <hi>H.</hi> 7. and 1 <hi>H. 8. Kellway</hi>'s Reports, which

by him ought not to be admitted after Inſtitution: And by <hi>Dyer</hi> 339.

becauſe he is a Favourer of the Religion of <hi>E. 6. B.</hi> preſented <hi>D.</hi>
who after is deprived, and <hi>C.</hi> reſtored. The Church void by the

that it did not lie: And it was Agreed, That if Two have

               <p>(33.) <hi>A.</hi> the Defendant had been Parſon for Three years, and

<hi>B.</hi> Preſents his Clerk, who is likewiſe Inducted, and after is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived.
The Biſhop <hi>Collates</hi> without giving notice of the Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<hi>A.</hi> grants his Advowſon to <hi>J. S.</hi> in Fee; the Clerk <hi>Collated</hi>
by the Biſhop died: <hi>B.</hi> Preſenteth, and is diſturbed. <hi>Reſolved,</hi>
(1) When <hi>A.</hi> had right to Preſent upon the Deprivation, as in his
Turn (although the <hi>Collation</hi> of the Biſhop was not good) yet it
was but a thing in <hi>Action;</hi> and when he had granted the Advowſon
over, the Grantee could not have this thing in Action, nor the
Grantor could not have it, for he had deſtroyed it, and ſo none could
have it. (2) <hi>Reſolved,</hi> although the Grant was ſufficient to paſs
the Advowſon in Fee, yet the <hi>Collation</hi> of the Biſhop was good
againſt all, but againſt the very Patron, ſo as he might have remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
the Incumbent by a <hi>Quare Impedit;</hi> but when he doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move

underſtood not the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the <hi>Preſentee</hi> could not ſpeak <hi>Welſh,</hi>
and therefore he refuſed him: It was the Opinion of all the Juſtices,
That it was a good cauſe of <hi>Refuſal</hi> of him, for he cannot inſtruct
his Flock according to his duty and charge.<note place="margin">

held, That Notice ought to be given to the Patron himſelf, if he
be within the County, if not, publick Intimation to be on the
Church-door.</p>
               <p>(37.) In a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> brought in a Caſe between <hi>La.</hi> and <hi>Le.</hi>
it was held, That the King cannot be a Diſturber; but the Biſhop
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:95379:181"/>
may be a ſpecial Diſturber; and in that caſe it was ſaid, It is good
policy upon every <hi>Preſentation</hi> by Uſurpation, to bring a <hi>Quare Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedit</hi>
as ſpeedily as may be; and it is as good policy to name the
Biſhop in the Writ,<note place="margin">Mich. 3. Jac. B. R. <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> and <hi>Low</hi>'s Caſe. Cro. par. 2.</note> for then he ſhall not Collate for Lapſe, if the
Church remain void Six months; nor ſhall the Metropolitan Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,

to be a Rule, That the Metropolitan ſhall never Collate for Lapſe,
but when the immediate Ordinary might have Collated, and hath
ſurceaſed his time: and in ſuch caſe the Ordinary cannot Collate,
becauſe he is made party to the Writ.</p>
               <p>(38.) In a Caſe between <hi>Benet</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Norwich</hi> it
was Adjudged,<note place="margin">Cro. par. 1.</note> That if the next Avoidance of a Church be granted

               <p>(39.) If the Biſhop ſhall for Inſufficiency refuſe the Clerk that is
Preſented to him,<note place="margin">Paſch. 26 El. B. R. the Biſh. of <hi>Hereford</hi>'s Caſe. Cro. par. 1.</note> he may not afterwards Admit him: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
where the Patron Preſented <hi>J. S.</hi> his Clerk to the Biſhop, and
upon Notice by the Biſhop given to the Patron of the Inſufficiency
of the Clerk, the Patron Preſented another Clerk, and then the
Biſhop Admits the firſt Clerk which was Preſented within Six
months: In this caſe it was Adjudged, That the Biſhop was a
Diſturber for having once refuſed him for Inſufficiency, he cannot
afterwards accept of him.</p>

               <p>(1.) <hi>EXamination</hi> is that Trial or Probation, which the Biſhop
or Ordinary makes before his Admiſſion of any perſon
to holy Order or to a Benefice, touching the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch perſons for the ſame reſpectively. So that there are
Two certain times or ſeaſons eſpecially, wherein this <hi>Examination</hi>
is required; the one before an <hi>Admiſſion</hi> to <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> the other
before an <hi>Admiſſion</hi> to a <hi>Benefice.</hi> The former of theſe is expreſly
enjoyned by the <hi>35th Canon</hi> Eccleſiaſtical, whereby it is required,
That the Biſhop, before he Admit any perſon to Holy Orders, ſhall
diligently Examine him in the preſence of thoſe Miniſters that ſhall
aſſiſt him at the Impoſition of hands, or in caſe of any lawful Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment
of the Biſhop, then the ſaid Examination ſhall be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performed by the ſaid Miniſters, provided they be of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Cathedral Church, if conveniently it may, otherwiſe by at
leaſt Three ſufficient Preachers of the ſame Dioceſs. And in caſe any
Biſhop or Suffragan ſhall Admit any to Sacred Orders, who is not
Examined as is before ordained, then ſhall the Archbiſhop of the
Province, having notice thereof, and being aſſiſted with one Biſhop,
ſuſpend the ſaid Biſhop or Suffragan from making either Deacons
or Prieſts for the ſpace of Two years<note n="a" place="margin">Canon 35. Eccleſiaſtical.</note>. So alſo when the Clerk
is Preſented by the Patron of the Advowſon, before he be Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
as Clerk to ſerve the Cure, the Ordinary is to Examine him of
his Ability: For if upon his Examination he be found unable to
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:95379:182"/>
ſerve the ſame, or be <hi>Criminous,</hi> the Ordinary may refuſe to Admit
and Inſtitute him into the Benefice<note n="b" place="margin">Co. 5. par. <hi>Specot</hi>'s Caſe.</note>. By the Ancient <hi>Cannons</hi>
the Biſhop hath Two months time to enquire and inform himſelf
of the ſufficiency and quality of every Clerk Preſented to him, as
appears by the Canon in 1 <hi>Jac. cap.</hi> 95. But by the ſaid Canon it is
Ordained, That the ſaid Two months ſhall be abridged to 28 days
only<note n="c" place="margin">Rol. Abr. ver. <hi>Preſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>tm.</hi> lit. X.</note>. Upon ſufficient enquiry and Examination the Ordinary
may accept or refuſe the Clerk Preſented, and regularly all ſuch
matters as are cauſes of <hi>Deprivation,</hi> are alſo cauſes of <hi>Refuſal</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Co. 2. <hi>Specot.</hi> 58.</note>;
but for a Preſentce to have another Benefice, is no cauſe of Refuſal,
for that is at his own peril; and poſſibly the Second Benefice is more
worth than the former, which only is void in ſuch caſe<note n="e" place="margin">14 H 7. 28. b. <hi>Cariae.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>(2.) If the Biſhop doth demand of the Clerk his Letters of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Letters Teſtimonial of his good behaviour, and the Clerk
requires time to ſhew them, as the ſpace of a week or the like, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he hath them not there with him; and the Biſhop doth there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Refuſe him to the Church, and Preſents another: the Biſhop
in ſuch caſe hath been adjudged to be a Diſturber; for the Statute
of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> doth not compel the Clerk to ſhew his Orders, nor
Letters Teſtimonial of his good Behaviour: And ſo it was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
<note n="f" place="margin">Paſch. 33 Eliz. C. B. <hi>

                     </hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Peterborough</hi>'s Caſe. Leon. 230.</note>. Yet by the <hi>39th Canon</hi> it is by way of Caution expreſly
Ordained, That no Biſhop ſhall Inſtitute any of a Benefice, who hath
been Ordained by any other Biſhop, except he firſt ſhew unto him
his Letters of Orders, and bring him a ſufficient Teſtimony of his
former good life and behaviour, if the Biſhop ſhall require it.</p>
               <p>(3.) Examination of the Clerk is to be done at a convenient
time within the Six months; for the Ordinary cannot refuſe to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the Clerk during all the Six months, and ſo ſuffer a Lapſe to
incurr to himſelf; for by ſo doing the Patron ſhould loſe his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation,</hi>
and the Ordinary take advantage of his own wrong. But
if the Ordinary, when the Clerk comes to be examined, <hi>Sedet circa
curam Paſtoralem,</hi> he is not then obliged to leave the buſineſs in
hand, and preſently Examine the Clerk; but he may appoint a
convenient time and place for the Examining of him<note n="g" place="margin">Mich. 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Jac. C. B. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judg'd. vid. acc. 5 H. 7. 7. C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>(4.) A <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> was brought by <hi>B.</hi> againſt the Biſhop of
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who pleads, that he claims nothing but as Ordinary;
and yet pleads further, That the Clerk which the Plaintiff Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
had before contracted with the Plaintiff <hi>Simmiacally,</hi> and
therefore becauſe he was <hi>Simoniacus</hi> he refuſed, and that the Church
was then void, and ſo remained void; whereupon the Plaintiff had
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:95379:183"/>
a Writ to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who returned that before
the coming of this Writ, <hi>viz. 4. July</hi> the Church was Full of one
Dr. <hi>Grant, ex Collatione</hi> of the ſaid Biſhop of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> who had
Collated by Lapſe, and this Return was adjudged Inſufficient:
Firſt, it is clear, That though the Six months paſs, yet if the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron
Preſent, the Biſhop ought to Admit, although it be after the
Title devolved unto the <hi>Metropolitan:</hi> And it ſeems alſo Reaſon,
that he ought to Admit, though that the Title by Lapſe be accrued

quaere.</hi> But in this Caſe the Biſhop who is the Defendant is bound
by the Judgment, and the Writ is, notwithſtanding the claim of
the Biſhop, that he Admit the Clerk; for the Biſhop ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute
the Proceſs of the Court. It was urged by Serjeant <hi>Henden,</hi>
that there is a <hi>Canon</hi> in <hi>Lindwood,</hi> That if the Church be vacant

Adding withal, That Benefices void ought to be granted
within Six months after knowledge of the Voidance thereof, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
the Grant thereof devolves and comes to the Superiour; and

(9.) Albeit the Cogniſance of this matter of <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> is ſo
properly and connaturally inherent in the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction,
yet the Temporal and Common Law it ſeems hath in ſome caſes
took notice thereof<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for it is there Reported, That every Rectory

for when the Biſhop upon Examination finds him able,

the Law underſtands as an Acceptance and the having of a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;

of another Benefice with Cure, and is Inducted in the ſame; the
Firſt Benefice is void by the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For the words of
the Statute are, <hi>A Parſon, having one Benefice with Cure, &amp;c. Accept

the Law doth annex a Condition to it, but a collateral Condition can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not

And if the Second Inſtitution be void, the Sentence cannot make it
good; for the Eccleſiaſtical Court ought to take notice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

               </list>
               <p>(1.) <hi>AVoidance</hi> is, when a Benefice or other Eccleſiaſtical Living
is void of a lawful Incumbent: which generally may
be ſaid to be Twofold; either in <hi>Fact</hi> and in deed, as
when the Incumbent is dead, or actually deprived: or in <hi>Law,</hi> as
when the ſame perſon or Parſon hath more Benefices than one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible,
having no Diſpenſation, nor qualified for Plurality<note n="a" place="margin">Bro. tit. <hi>Quare Imp.</hi> nu. 51.</note>.
Or an Avoidance is either <hi>Temporal</hi> or <hi>Spiritual:</hi> (1) Temporal,
as by death of the Incumbent. (2) Spiritual, as by Reſignation,
Deprivation, Creation, Ceſſion. The <hi>Temporal</hi> is an Avoidance <hi>de
facto;</hi> the <hi>Spiritual</hi> is an Avoidance <hi>de jure.</hi> Of this latter or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
Avoidance the Eccleſiaſtical Court takes cognizance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines,
and therefore the Supream Head may ſo diſpenſe there,
that ſuch Avoidance in <hi>Law</hi> ſhall never come to be an Avoidance in
<hi>Deed;</hi> and of this Avoidance in <hi>Law</hi> no Title accrues to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,
unleſs ſomething be thereupon done by the Eccleſiaſtical
Court, as a Declaratory Sentence, or ſuch like. But upon Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in <hi>Deed,</hi> Preſentment accrueth to the Patron preſently. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
when a Biſhop was alſo the Parſon of any Benefice, either in
right of his Biſhoprick, or that the Benefice was annexed to his
See, for the proviſion of his Table, or the better maintenance of
Hoſpitality, the Fruits of ſuch Benefice or Parſonage, during every
vacancy or <hi>Avoidance</hi> of ſuch Biſhoprick, where the Biſhop was
both Lord of a Mannor, and Parſon of a Parſonage thereto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
did not come to the King (as they now do, whereby the
Parſonage and Mannor are both conſolidated into one, being now
both holden to be Temporalties,) but the Parſonage came to the
Archbiſhop of the Province, as a Spiritualty granted to his See by
Priviledge, during the vacancy of the Sees of ſuch Biſhops as were
in his Province, as may appear by the Records of the Lord Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop

(2.) There is in operation of Law a wide difference between
<hi>Avoidance</hi> and <hi>Next Avoidance;</hi> the former is <hi>in eſſe,</hi> the other is
only <hi>in paſſe;</hi> the former is the want of an Incumbent upon a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice
<hi>de praeſenti:</hi> the other is the Grant of a ſupply of that want
<hi>de futuro,</hi> and is the Grant of a <hi>Next Avoidance</hi> in a Parſonage
or other Spiritual promotion, which is Grantable whiles there is an
Incumbent actually in being, and is in the nature of a thing in
Action, and therefore will not paſs without Deed. But a preſent <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidance,</hi>
though it be not meerly a thing in Action, yet it is not
Grantable in that kind as the other: The preſent <hi>Avoidance</hi> is not
valuable, and therefore ſhall not be Aſſets; it may be otherwiſe
with a <hi>Next Avoidance</hi> in ſome Caſes, for the <hi>Next Avoidance</hi> is but

For an Advowſon or the Patron's Right of Preſentation to a
Church, is not a Spiritual, but a Temporal Inheritance, grantable
by Deed, and (if Appendant) as the Mannor it ſelf to which it is
Appendant, as an Acceſſory to its Principal.</p>
               <p>(3.) The Cognizance of <hi>Voidance</hi> of Benefices is Eccleſiaſtical
by the Statute 25 <hi>Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 8. it being the want of an Incumbent on
a Benefice (as aforeſaid) and is oppoſed to <hi>Plenarty.</hi> This <hi>Voidance</hi>
may be either by Death, Deprivation, Law or Act of Parliament,
Ceſſion or Plurality, <hi>Reſignation,</hi> Creation, Incapacity, Union, Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment
of Tenths, &amp;c. So that a <hi>Voidance</hi> may happen to be ſuch
either in <hi>Law,</hi> or in <hi>deed;</hi> virtually, or actually. Reſignation
is <hi>Juris proprii ſpontanea Refutatio,</hi> or the voluntary yielding up of
the Incumbent (into the hands of the Ordinary) his intereſt and
right, which he hath in his Benefice. Touching the Form of <hi>Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi>
and Proteſtation, which muſt be when the party will Reſign,
<hi>vid. Regiſt. fo. 302. F. N. B. fo.</hi> 273. and this Reſignation, which is
one of the cauſes of <hi>Avoidance,</hi> is to be made to the Ordinary;
for it is a Rule in the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, <hi>Apud eum debet fieri Renunciatio,
apud quem pertinere dignoſcitur Confirmatio.</hi> The <hi>Next Avoidance</hi>
is only a Power legally granted to another by the right Patron to
Preſent a Clerk to the Church, when it ſhall next become void<note n="d" place="margin">
                     <hi>Broo. tit.</hi> Quare Imp. nu. 51.</note>.
And during ſuch <hi>Voidance</hi> of a Parſonage, the Franktenement of the
Glebe thereof is ſaid ſo be in no man, but is ſaid to be in <hi>Abeyance,</hi>
that is, only in the remembrance, intendment, and conſideration of
the Law, that though for the preſent, during the time of ſuch Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy,
it be not actually in any perſon, yet it is by way of <hi>Abeyance</hi>)
in hope and expectation belonging to ſuch one as ſhall next enjoy
the ſame. The word <hi>Avoidance</hi> hath Two ſignifications in the
Law; the one (and that here intended) is when a Benefice or any
Eccleſiaſtical Living becomes <hi>Void</hi> of an Incumbent; the other

in <hi>

               <p>(7.) In a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> the Caſe was, The Plaintiff counted,

became void, and after during the <hi>Avoidance H. B.</hi> releaſed to the
Plaintiff, and ſo that it belongs to him to Preſent. Upon this
Count the Defendant did demurr in Law; for it appeareth upon
the Plaintiffs own ſhewing, that <hi>H. B.</hi> ought to have joyned with
the Plaintiff in the Action, for the Releaſe being made after the
Church became void, is not of any effect, but utterly void. So is
the Grant of the Preſentment to the Church where the Church is
void, for it is a thing in Action. <hi>Vid.</hi> the Lord <hi>Dyer, 28 H.</hi> 6. 26.

               <p>(8.) Touching <hi>Avoidances</hi> there is a wide difference between the
Judgment of the <hi>Common</hi> Law, and that of the <hi>Canon;</hi> for if a

the Church remains void according to the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſuch Preſentation; but at the <hi>Common</hi> Law, albeit
this be a meer nullity there alſo, and void, yet it doth adjudge the
Church to be Full according to the publick Admiſſion, Inſtitution,
and Induction, and not according to the capacity of the perſon,
which is a thing ſecret, until ſuch an one be deprived for it by
Sentence in the Spiritual Court; and ſo the Church in conſtruction
of Law (underſtand it of the Common Law) is held void but
from the time of Deprivation, of which notice ought to be given
to the Patron<note n="n" place="margin">Hill. 36 Eliz. B. R. Poph. Rep.</note>. So that according to the <hi>Canon</hi> Law there
cannot be a Plenarty by the Preſentation, Admiſſion, Inſtitution,
and Induction of a meer Lay-man to a Church; it is otherwiſe at
the Common Law, which doth not ſo much conſider the Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
or Incapacity of the perſon Inſtituted and Inducted, as the
Inſtitution and Induction it ſelf, until ſuch time as there is a Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

               <p>(9.) <hi>Ceſſion</hi> is when an Eccleſiaſtical perſon Beneficed is Created

               <p>(1.) <hi>PLurality,</hi> according to the Common acceptation of the
word, is where one and the ſame perſon is poſſeſſed of
Two or more Eccleſiaſtical Benefices with Cure of
Souls, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſemel.</hi> It was long ſince condemned by the general
Council of <hi>Lateran</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">An. 1215.</note>, whereby it was Ordained, That whatever
Eccleſiaſtical perſon, having one Benefice with Cure of Souls, doth
take another ſuch, ſhall <hi>ipſo jure</hi> be deprived of the former; and if he
conteſt for the retaining thereof, ſhall loſe both<note n="b" place="margin">Concil. Later. To. 4. 221. cap. 29. 24 E. 3. 33. 39 E. 3. 44. F. N. B. 34. L. Co. 4. par. 75.</note>. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which <hi>Canon,</hi> it was heretofore uſual with the Pope to uſurp a
power of Diſpenſation in this matter, the which <hi>de jure</hi> was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
practiſed by Kings, as Supream, and as the original Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors
of Benefices and Eccleſiaſtical Dignities; witneſs <hi>Edmond</hi> that
Monk of <hi>Bury,</hi> who by virtue of ſuch Diſpenſations held ſeveral
Eccleſiaſtical Benefices at one and the ſame time. The ſaid Canon
(as to the ſubſtance thereof, relating to <hi>Pluralities</hi>) is now Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the Statute of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 13. which limits the former
Benefice with Cure of Souls to the yearly value of Eight pounds
or upwards, and the time of Avoidance thereof to be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after poſſeſſion, by Induction into the other with Cure of Souls;
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:95379:193"/>
with power of Preſentation <hi>de novo</hi> granted to the Patron of the
former Benefice, and all benefit of the ſame to the Preſentee, as
if the Incumbent had died or reſigned. <hi>Q.</hi> Whether the ſaid
yearly value of Eight pounds or above, ought to be computed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the valuation in the Kings Books, as returned into the
Exchequer, and now uſed in the Firſt-Fruits Office, or according
to the juſt and true value of the Benefice<note n="c" place="margin">Dyer 237. p. 29. Cro. Eliz. 853.</note>. <hi>Q.</hi> likewiſe, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Parſon of a Church Impropriate, with a Vicar perpetually
endowed, accepting of a Preſentation unto the Vicarage without
Diſpenſation, be a <hi>Pluraliſt</hi> within the Canon and Statute aforeſaid?
The Negative is ſuppoſed to give the beſt Solution to the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<note n="d" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Parſs Law,</hi> cap. 21.</note>
               </p>
               <p>(2.) The ſame power of granting Faculties, Pluralities, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendams,
&amp;c. which anciently the Pope exerciſed in this Realm
by Uſurpation, is by the Statute of 21 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 13. and 1 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
transferr'd unto and veſted in the Crown <hi>de jure;</hi> alſo from and
under the King, in the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries
by Authority derived from the Crown: The Pope an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
granted to Biſhops after Conſecration, Diſpenſations <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere
&amp; obtinere Beneficium cum cura animarum,</hi> to hold the ſame
in <hi>Commendam,</hi> the which he did in this Realm by Uſurpation,
and which the Crown may now do <hi>de jure;</hi> for the ſame power
(as aforeſaid) which the Pope had, is by the Acts of Parliament in
25 <hi>H. 8. &amp; 1 Eliz.</hi> in the King <hi>de jure.</hi> But there is a very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
difference between the Diſpenſations anciently here granted
by the Pope, and thoſe at this day by the King and Archbiſhop,
Confirmed by the Kings Letters Patents, which are not good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
than to ſuch as are Compleat Incumbents at the time of
granting thereof,<note place="margin">Ibid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> whereas it was ſometimes otherwiſe with the
other; whence it is obſervable, that in <hi>Digbie</hi>'s Caſe the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
came too ſoon: <hi>A.</hi> is Inſtituted and Inducted into a Benefice
with Cure, value Eight pounds <hi>per ann.</hi> Afterwards the King
preſenting him to another with Cure, he is Admitted and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:
Afterwards the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> grants him Letters
of Diſpenſation to hold Two Benefices; the King confirms the
ſame: Afterwards he is Inducted into the Second Benefice. In
this caſe the Diſpenſation comes too late, becauſe by the Inſtitution
into the Second Benefice the Firſt Benefice was void by the Stat. of
21 <hi>H.</hi> 8.<note n="e" place="margin">Co. 4. par. 79. <hi>Digbie</hi>'s Caſe.</note>.</p>
               <p>(3.) The Acceptance of a Second Benefice, with a Diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
comes not under the notion of prohibited <hi>Pluralities,</hi> in caſe
the Firſt were vnder the annual value of Eight pounds, or <hi>ſine
cura.</hi> And what perſons are qualified either for the Granting or
receiving <hi>Pluralities,</hi> appears by the Stat. of 21 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 13. In which
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:95379:194"/>
there is not any limitation of Number of Chaplains to be retained
by the King, Queen, and Prince, and other the King's Children;
for which reaſon they may retain as many Chaplains as they pleaſe,
and each of them qualificable by a Diſpenſation for <hi>Plurality:</hi> But
if either of the King's Chaplains be Sworn of his Majeſties moſt
Honourable Privy Council, ſuch may purchaſe a Diſpenſation to
hold Three Benefices with Cure of Souls. The Perſons ſpecially
qualified by Diſpenſations for <hi>Pluralities,</hi> are either (1) Such as
are retained as Chaplains to Perſons of <hi>Honour:</hi> Or (2) Such as
are qualified thereto in reſpect of their <hi>Birth:</hi> Or (3) Such as are
dignified with ſome certain <hi>Degrees</hi> in either of the Univerſities of
this Kingdom. In reference to the firſt
of theſe, every <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> and <hi>Duke</hi>
may have Six Chaplains; <hi>Marqueſs</hi> and
<hi>Earl,</hi> Five; every <hi>Viſcount</hi> and other
<hi>Biſhop,</hi> Four; <hi>Lord Chancellor,</hi> Three;
<hi>Knight</hi> of the <hi>Garter,</hi> Three; <hi>Baron,</hi>
Three; <hi>Dutcheſs, Marchioneſs, Counteſs,</hi>
and <hi>Baroneſs</hi> (being Widows,) Two;
<hi>Treaſurer</hi> and <hi>Controller</hi> of the Kings
Houſe, Two; the Kings <hi>Secretary</hi> and

and <hi>Maſter</hi> of the Rolls, Two; the
<hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> of the Kings Bench, and
<hi>Warden</hi> of the Cinque Ports, One.
In reference to the <hi>Second</hi> qualification,
<hi>viz.</hi> By <hi>Birth,</hi> the <hi>Brothers</hi> and <hi>Sons</hi> of
all Temporal Lords, and of Knights,
born in Wedlock, may purchaſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations

with Cure of Souls. In reference to

               <p>(4.) Although by the Letter of which Act the Firſt Living is
not void until Induction into the Second, the words being [<hi>If the
party be Inſtituted and Inducted in poſſeſſion of the Second Living,
that then the firſt ſhall be void:</hi>] yet to avoid the great inconveniency
(as Sir <hi>Simon Degge</hi> obſerves in his <hi>Parſons Counſellor</hi>) that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
would enſue,<note place="margin">Par. 1. chap. 4. Co. 4. 79. b. Hob. 166.</note> it has been held, That the Firſt Living is void
upon the bare Inſtitution into the Second; and ſo it ſhould ſeem the
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:95379:194"/>
Law was before the making of this Act, where the party had no
Diſpenſation. The ſufficiency of qualification for <hi>Plurality</hi> relates
as well to the Diſpenſation as to the Perſon; for if the Diſpenſation,
after its being had from the Maſter of the Faculties, be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> other qualifications will
not ſuffice. Nor are the ſupernumerary Chaplains of any perſon of
Honour, retained by him above the Number allowed by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
qualified for <hi>Plurality. Co.</hi> 4. 90. B. <hi>verſus</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi>
and <hi>Saveacre. Anderſ. More,</hi> 561. The death, attainder,
degradation, or diſplacing of a Chaplains Lord, or his diſcharging
his Chaplain, unqualifies him for a Plurality of incompatible Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
<note n="i" place="margin">Co. 4. 17. b.</note>; otherwiſe of the Chaplain of a Dutcheſs, Marchioneſs,
Counteſs, or Baroneſs, in caſe of After-marriage<note n="k" place="margin">Id. 4. 118.</note>. A double
Capacity in one and the ſame perſon of Honour to qualifie his
Chaplains, doth but capacitate him to qualifie his Number of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains
only according to his beſt qualification<note n="l" place="margin">Ibid.</note>. A Perſon of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
having retained his full Number of Chaplains, and diſcharging
them after their preferment, may not during their Lives qualifie
others<note n="m" place="margin">Co. 4. 90. a.</note>.</p>
               <p>(5.) The Queſtion was formerly put, Whether the 8 <hi>l.</hi> yearly

the Preſentment of one man to the Parſonage and Vicarage was

               <p>(7.) In ancient times the Pope uſed to grant Diſpenſations of
the Canons in this Realm, and ſo might the King have done. The
firſt Statute that reſtrain'd the power of the Pope, was that of 21
<hi>H. 8. of Pluralities:</hi> That the Church ſhall be void, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any Grant of the Pope: Alſo the power of the Pope was taken
away by the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Before that of the 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. the
Pope might have diſpenſed with a man to have twenty Benefices; and
ſo might the King. The 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was the firſt Statute, or Law,
which gave allowance for <hi>Pluralities;</hi> afterwards by the 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
the power of the Pope was given to the King: But as it was ſaid
and agreed in the Caſe of <hi>Evans</hi> and <hi>Aſcough,</hi> that was not by way
of <hi>Introduction,</hi> but <hi>Cumulutive</hi> and by way of Expoſition. And
by that Statute the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had in this matter a

who by the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> was Collated to a Benefice with Cure,
is (it ſeems) the ſtanding Preſident; in which caſe it was Agreed,

               <p>(5.) Among the many Cauſes of <hi>Deprivation</hi> forementioned you
do not find that of Marriage in the Prieſt, which was anciently pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticable,
as appears by what the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> reports touching an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
in the time of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. who being Deprived in Queen
<hi>Maries</hi> daies, partly becauſe he was a Married perſon, and partly
becauſe of his Religion, was reſtored again in the time of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth.</hi> In whoſe Caſe it was Adjudged, That his Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was good until it was voided by a Sentence of Repeal, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he became Incumbent again by virtue of his Firſt Preſentation
without any new Preſentation, Inſtitution, or Induction<note n="o" place="margin">Co. 4. par. 102. <hi>Windſor</hi>'s Caſe.</note>. In
thoſe days it was held, That the Marriage of a Prieſt was a ſufficient
cauſe to <hi>deprive</hi> him of his Benefice. <hi>Mich. 4. Ma. Dy.</hi> 133.</p>
               <p>(6.) In the Caſe where a meer Lay-man is Preſented, Inſtituted,
and Inducted, he is (notwithſtanding his Laity) ſuch an Incumbent
<hi>de facto,</hi> that he is not Deprivable but by a Sentence in the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical
Court; but then the Ordinary is in that caſe to give Notice
of ſuch <hi>Deprivation</hi> to the Patron; otherwiſe, in caſe the Ordinary
for that cauſe refuſed him, when he was Preſented by the Patron
<note n="p" place="margin">13 Eliz. Dy. 292.</note>. But where Non-age is the cauſe of <hi>Deprivation,</hi> as when one
under the age of 23 years is Preſented, Notice is to be given, it
having been Adjudged, That no Lapſe ſhall incurr upon any Depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<hi>ipſo facto</hi> without Notice, ſeeing the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 12.
ſays nothing of Preſentation; which remaining in force, the Patron
ought to have Notice<note n="q" place="margin">Trin. 18. Car. B. R. the B. of <hi>Hereford</hi> and <hi>Okoley</hi>'s Caſe. <hi>Marſh. 119. Huge</hi>'s Abridg. verb. <hi>Deprivation.</hi>

ſo in reference to both, the Law takes care to diſtinguiſh between
that which is only <hi>Malum prohibitum,</hi> and that which is <hi>Malum in

a general Notice of Incapacity not ſufficing; in which caſe

               </p>
               <p>(8.) It is evident from the Premiſſes, That a <hi>Deprivation</hi> from
an Eccleſiaſtical Benefice will follow upon a Diſgrading or Degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
from the Eccleſiaſtical Function or Calling, for this <hi>Degrada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is the Incapacitating of a Clerk for diſcharge of that holy Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
for it is the puniſhment of ſuch a Clerk, as being delivered
to his Ordinary, cannot purge himſelf of the Offence, whereof he
was convicted by the Jury: And it is a Privation of him from thoſe
holy Orders of Clerkſhip which formerly he had, as Prieſthood,
Deaconſhip, &amp;c.<note n="t" place="margin">Stanf. Ple. Cor. fo. 130, &amp; 138.</note>. And by the <hi>Canon</hi> Law this may be done
Two waies, either <hi>Summarily,</hi> as by Word only; or <hi>Solemnly,</hi> as
by deveſting the party degraded of thoſe Ornaments and Rites,
which were the Enſigns of his Order or Degree<note n="u" place="margin">Vid. Seld. <hi>Tit. of Hon.</hi> fo. 787.</note>. But in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
Criminal Princes anciently have had ſuch a tender reſpect for
the Clergy, and for the credit of the whole profeſſion thereof,
That if any man among them committed any thing worthy of
death or open ſhame, he was not firſt executed or expoſed to Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
diſgrace, until he had been degraded by the Biſhop and his
Clergy; and ſo was executed and put to ſhame, not as a Clerk, but
as a Lay-Malefactor; which regard towards Eccleſiaſticks in reſpect
of the dignity of the Miniſtry, is obſerved by a Learned Author
to be much more Ancient, than any Papiſtical Immunity<note n="x" place="margin">Ridl. View. p. 2. cap. 2. Sect. 3.</note>; and
is ſuch a Priviledge as the Church, in reſpect of ſuch as once waited

               <p>(9.) <hi>Robert Cawdry</hi> Clerk, Rector of the Church of <hi>L.</hi> was <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived</hi>
of his Rectory by the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> and his Collegues,
by virtue of the high Commiſſion to them and others directed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he had pronounced and uttered ſlanderous and contumelious
words againſt and in depravation of the Book of <hi>Common Prayer;</hi>
but the Form of the Sentence was, That the ſaid Biſhop by and
with the aſſent and conſent of Five others of the ſaid Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
his Companions, and namely which Deprived him. It was not
ſound that the Commiſſioners were the Natural born Subjects of the
Queen, as the Statute Enacts that they ſhould be. And it was
moved, That the <hi>Deprivation</hi> was void; (1) Becauſe, that whereas
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:95379:202"/>
the Commiſſion is to them, or any Three of them, of which the
ſaid Biſhop to be one amongſt others, it ought to have been the
Sentence of them all (according to the Authority given to them,
which is equal) and not of one with the aſſent of the other.
(2) Becauſe it is not found, that the Commiſſioners are the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
born Subjects of the Queen, as by the words of the Statute they
ſhould be. (3.) Becauſe the puniſhment, which the Statute pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
for thoſe of the Miniſtry which deprave this Book, is to loſe
the profits of all their Spiritual promotions but for a year, and to
be Impriſoned by the ſpace of Six months, and not to be Deprived
till the Second offence, after that he had been once committed;
and therefore to deprive him for the Firſt offence was wrongful and
contrary to the Statute. But the whole Court, for the Form of the
<hi>Deprivation,</hi> it is that which is uſed in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts,
which alwaies names the chief in Commiſſion, that are preſent at
the beginning of the Sentence, and for the other they mention them
only as here; but of their aſſent and conſent to it, and in ſuch caſes
we ought to give credit to their Form, and therefore it is not to be
compared to an Authority given at Common Law by Commiſſion.
And it is to be intended, that the Commiſſioners were the Natural
born Subjects of the Queen, unleſs the contrary appear: But here
at the beginning it is found, That the Queen <hi>Secundum tenorem &amp;
effectum Actus praedict.</hi> had granted her Commiſſion to them <hi>in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis
Eccleſiaſticis,</hi> and therefore it appeareth ſufficiently, that they
were ſuch as the Statute wills them to be. And for the <hi>Deprivati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
they all agreed that it was good, being done by Authority of
the Commiſſion; for the Statute is to be underſtood, where they
proſecute upon the Statute by way of Indictment, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
the Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, being alſo but in the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
And further, by the Act and their Commiſſion they may
proceed according to their diſcretion to puniſh the Offence proved
or confeſſed before them, and ſo are the words of their Commiſſion
warranted by the Clauſe of the Act. And further, the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Juriſdiction is ſaved in the Act. And all the Biſhops and Popiſh
Prieſts were deprived by virtue of a Commiſſion warranted by this
Clauſe in the Act. <hi>Vid. Hill. 33 Eliz. Rot.</hi> 315.<note n="x" place="margin">

               <p>(10.) Before many Noble-men, Archbiſhops and Biſhops, and
the Juſtices and Barons of the Exchequer, (1) agreed, That the
<hi>Deprivation</hi> of Minſters for Non-conformity to the laſt Canons
was lawful by the High Commiſſioners: For by the Common Law

only, &amp;c. and the King may delegate it to Commiſſioners: And the

of the Clergy: and that ſuch a Deprivation <hi>ex officio,</hi> without

               <p>(11.) By the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12. it is Enacted, <hi>That
every perſon, &amp;c. to be Admitted to a Benefice with Cure, except that
within Two months after his Induction, he publickly Read the ſaid
Articles</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">The 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> 
                  <hi>in the ſame Church whereof he ſhall have Cure, in the time
of Common Prayer there, with declaration of his unfeigned aſſent
thereto, &amp;c. ſhall be upon every ſuch default</hi> ipſo facto <hi>immediately
deprived.</hi> Then follows afterwards a <hi>Proviſo</hi> relating to this clauſe,
viz. <hi>Provided alwaies, That no Title to conferr or Preſent by Lapſe,
ſhall accrue upon any Deprivation</hi> ipſo facto, <hi>but after</hi> Six months
<hi>after Notice of ſuch Deprivation given by the Ordinary to the Patron.</hi>
Thus the Patron immediately upon ſuch <hi>Deprivation</hi> may Preſent,
if he pleaſe, and his Clerk ought to be Admitted and Inſtituted; but
if he doth not, no <hi>Lapſe</hi> incurrs until after <hi>Six months</hi> after Notice
of the <hi>Deprivation</hi> given to the Patron by the Ordinary, who it ſeems
is to ſupply the Cure until the Patron Preſent. In the laſt Caſe of the
Lord <hi>Dyer 23 El.</hi> it was Reſolved, That where a man having a Living
with Cure under value, accepted another under value alſo, having
no Qualification or Diſpenſation, and was Admitted, Inſtituted and
Inducted into the Second, but never Subſcribed the Articles before
the Ordinary, as the Statute of 13 of <hi>El.</hi> requires. Upon Queſtion,
whether the Firſt Living <hi>vacavit per mortem</hi> of him or not? the
Court Reſolved, That the Firſt Living became <hi>vacant</hi> by his death,
and not by accepting the Second, becauſe he was never Incumbent
of the Second, for <hi>not Subſcribing</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> before the Ordinary,
whereby his Admiſſion, Inſtitution, and Induction into the Second
Living became void, as if they had never been. This differs from
the Caſe of not <hi>Reading</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> within <hi>Two months</hi> after In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction:
For the not <hi>Subſcribing</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> makes, that he never
was Incumbent of the Second Living, and conſequently no cauſe
of loſing the Firſt; but the <hi>not Reading</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> within <hi>Two
months</hi> after Induction, doth cauſe a deprivation of that whereof
he was Incumbent. For as an Incumbent, that without <hi>qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or <hi>diſpenſation</hi> doth take a Second Living, doth thereby loſe
the Firſt: ſo the ſame Incumbent for <hi>not Reading</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

and thereby loſe both, <hi>viz.</hi> the Firſt by taking a Second with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

a Parſon for his Benefice; if preſently upon this Judgment
he makes his Appeal, the Church is not void, but he remains Parſon
during all the time of this Appeal; for if by this he doth reverſe
the Judgment,<note place="margin">Trin. 13 Jac. B. R. <hi>Hornigold</hi> verſ. <hi>Bryan.</hi> Bulſtr. par. 3.</note> he ſhall need no new Inſtitution and Induction:
As if a Judgment be given of a Divorce in the Eccleſiaſtical Court;
and this is after reverſed by an Appeal, there ſhall need no new
Marriage. And in this Caſe <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice ſaid, That 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3.
hath the ſame Caſe: And that if an Appeal be from a Sentence of
Divorce, they are now by this <hi>Baron</hi> and <hi>Feme</hi> again: So if a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
be <hi>deprived,</hi> and Appeals, he is by this Parſon again, and may
have an Action of Treſpaſs. And as touching Appeals in reference
to <hi>Deprivation,</hi> there was a famous Caſe in the Court of <hi>C. B.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
5 or 6 <hi>Jac.</hi> a <hi>Worceſterſhire</hi> Caſe, between <hi>Lechmere</hi> Plaintiff
and <hi>Carr</hi> Defendant, in an Action of Treſpaſs, and upon <hi>Non
Culp.</hi> pleaded, a Special Verdict was found, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Bonner</hi>
was made Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in the time of King <hi>H.</hi> 8. and ſo
continued until 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. at or about which time a Commiſſion
iſſued forth to the then Lord Chancellor and others, to Convent
Biſhop <hi>Bonner</hi> before them, and to examine him; and if they found
him to be Contumacious, and would not Anſwer them, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
were impowerd then to Impriſon him, or to Deprive
him: The Commiſſioners upon this did firſt Impriſon him, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:95379:204"/>
afterwards proceeded further againſt him, to Deprivation: <hi>Bonner</hi>
from this Appealeth (and his Appeal not heard) <hi>Nicholas Rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>
is made Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who makes a Leaſe of the Park and
Mannor of <hi>Buſhley,</hi> under which Leaſe the Defendant claimed.
Afterwards, <hi>viz. Primo Mariae, Ridley</hi> is declared to be an Uſurper,
and <hi>Bonner</hi> by a Sentence Definitive is reſtored again to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick
of <hi>London,</hi> and makes a Leaſe of the Premiſſes demiſed
to the Plaintiff. Upon which Special Verdict the Points ſtirred
were theſe: (1) Whether the Deprivation of <hi>Bonner</hi> was lawful
or not; the Authority by the Commiſſion being in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctive,
<hi>viz.</hi> to Impriſon or to Deprive him; and (as it was
urged) they firſt Impriſoning of him, had thereby executed their
Authority, and ſo then the Deprivation void. (2) Admitting
the Deprivation void, then <hi>Bonner</hi> ſtill continued Biſhop of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don:</hi>
And then <hi>Ridley</hi> was never Biſhop; for that there could not
be two Biſhops of <hi>London ſimul &amp; ſemel,</hi> and ſo the Leaſe by him
made to the Defendant was a void Leaſe. (3) Admitting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>privation
good, then <hi>Quid operatur</hi> by the Appeal, whether it did
not ſuſpend the Sentence of Deprivation: And if ſo, then again,
<hi>Ridley</hi> was no lawful Biſhop; and ſo the Leaſe, under which the
Defendant claimed, was void. This Caſe was Learnedly Argued
by Common Lawyers, and alſo by Civilians, and the Judges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to be of Opinion for the Plaintiff. But the Defendant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
this, preferred his Bill in Chancery, and there obtained a
Decree againſt <hi>Lechmere.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(18.) If a meer Lay-perſon, who is altogether incapable of a
Benefice, be Preſented, Inſtituted, and Inducted; yet the Church
is not therefore ſaid by the Common Law to be void, as if no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
had been, but is ſtill by that Law full of an Incumbent <hi>de
facto, licet non de jure,</hi> until by Sentence Declaratory in the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical
Court for want of Capacity the Church be Adjudged void;
and upon this no Lapſe ſhall incurr againſt the Lay-Patron, without
Notice (of ſuch Incapacity and Sentence of Deprivation thereupon)
to him given. King <hi>H.</hi> 4. Preſented one that was Incapable of his
Preſentation, and the Preſentee was thereby Admitted, Inſtituted,
and Inducted,<note place="margin">Doderidge <hi>of Advowſons,</hi> Lect. 14.</note> and afterward the Pope enabled the Preſentee by his
Bull; yet the King had a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> and thereby recovered his
Preſentation again, becauſe the Incumbent was not capable when he
was Preſented.</p>
               <p>(19.) If the Parſon or other Incumbent be Excommunicate, and
he ſo remaineth in his Obſtinacy for the ſpace of 40 daies, he is for
this <hi>deprivable</hi> of his Benefice, and yet the Church is not void in
Deed, without Sentence of Deprivation given againſt him; and if
before ſuch Deprivation, the King as Supream Ordinary grant him
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:95379:204"/>
a Diſpenſation, he ſhall hold his Benefice. Alſo Dilapidation, or
ſpoil of the Church Benefice hath at Common Law been held wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy<note place="margin">Doderigd. ib.</note>
of Deprivation; which Law as it adjudgeth not the Church
actually void (Death excepted) without a Sentence of Depriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
So though ſuch Sentence of Deprivation be meerly wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
yet by that Law, as well as by the <hi>Canon,</hi> the Dignity is void,
and the Sentence remaineth in force until it be reverſed by Appeal;
and therefore if the party deprived within due time Appeal (upon
ſuch Sentence of Deprivation given againſt him) ſuch is the nature
thereof, that it will hold the Sentence (upon which it was firſt
brought) in ſuſpence: ſo that if it be brought upon Deprivation, it
voideth the vigour thereof, and reviveth the former dignity; for
ſuch Church ſhall not be void until the firſt Sentence of Deprivation
happen to be affirmed in the Appeal. Touching <hi>Deprivation</hi> by

               <p>(1.) <hi>INcumbent,</hi> from <hi>incumbere</hi> (ſignifying as well to poſſeſs and
keep ſafely, as to endeavour earneſtly) is a Clerk duly
Poſſeſt of and Reſident on his Benefice with Cure<note n="a" place="margin">Co. on L. fo. 119. b.</note>.
For the faithful diſcharge whereof he is to employ his ſtudy and
utmoſt endeavour<note n="b" place="margin">10 H. 6. 7.</note>: For which reaſon eſpecially he is ſo deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated.
There are Four things preparatory to the being of a
Compleat Incumbent: (1) The Patron's Preſentation, or his free
Gift or Commendation of his Clerk to the Parſonage or Vicarage
by writing in his favour to the Biſhop. (2) The Biſhop's Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of ſuch Clerk by his allowance or approbation of him after due
Examination, and by making a Record of his Name accordingly.
(3) The Clerks Inſtitution to ſuch Benefice or Vicarage by the
Biſhops words, <hi>Inſtituto te, &amp;c.</hi> (4) The Clerk's Admiſſion or
Induction, whereby he is put into Actual poſſeſſion thereof by the
Archdeacon's or others delivery to him of the Ring or Keys of the
Church-door, ringing the Bells, &amp;c. And until theſe things be done,
he is not a <hi>Compleat Incumbent</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">Art. Cle. ch. 13, 14 H. 7. 28. Dyer 326. Co. 5. 58. 4. 79.</note>. After which, and poſſeſſion
Six months, there is ſuch a Plenarty as gives ſuch a Title to that
Preſentation, as will barr <hi>pro hac vice</hi> any others in a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">21 El. 4. 34. &amp; Kelw. 88. Co. 4. 79. 7. 38. on Litt. 344.</note>. So that thoſe things that are to make a perfect <hi>Incumbent</hi>
(after Preſentation had) do depend upon the duty of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary;
as (1) Admiſſion, which requireth Examination of the
Clerk; whereupon ſometimes enſueth Refuſal, and thereupon either
Notice or no Notice (as the caſe requires) is to be given to the
Patron. (2) Inſtitution. (3) Induction. Upon the Patron's not
Preſenting within the time limited, the Lapſe incurrs to the Biſhop,
from him to the Metropolitan, and from him to the Crown, where
it reſteth. But if the Biſhop take his time, then is his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
a Collation, and in the Right of the Patron him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>(2.) The <hi>Incumbent</hi> is that perſon in Law, to whom the Fruits
of any Eccleſiaſtical Benefice do belong, inſomuch that the Fruits
taken during the vacation or vacancy of a Benefice, ſhall be reſtored
to the next Incumbent<note n="e" place="margin">St. 28 H. 8. c. 11.</note>, who ſtands charged to the King for the
Firſt-Fruits, to be accounted immediately from and after the Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
or Vacancy of any ſuch Benefice or Spiritual promotion<note n="f" place="margin">Ibid.</note>;
and for that end, and towards the payment of the ſaid Firſt-Fruits,
the next Incumbent ſhall have a reſtitution, of the Tithes, Fruits, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
Obventions, Emoluments, Commodities, Advantages; Rents,
and all other Revenues, Caſualties, and Profits whatſoever, certain and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:95379:206"/>
uncertain, belonging to any Archdeaconry, Deanary, Prebend, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage,
Vicarage, Hoſpital, Wardenſhip, Provoſtſhip, or other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
promotion, Benefice, Dignity, or Office, growing or ariſing
during the vacancy of any of the ſaid Spiritual promotions<note n="g" place="margin">Stat. ibid. &amp; Coke pla. fo. 368.</note>;
and every Archbiſhop, Biſhop, Archdeacon, Ordinary, or any other
perſon, having to his or their uſes received the ſame, that ſhall
refuſe to render and reſtore the ſame to the next Incumbent,
ſhall forfeit the treble value of what he hath ſo received<note n="h" place="margin">St. ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>(3.) If any Incumbent happening to depart this life during the
Incumbency or Plenarty, ſhall before his death have cauſed any of
his Glebe Lands to be manured and ſowed at his proper coſt and
charges with any Corn or grain, he may in that caſe make his laſt
Will and Teſtament of all the profits of the Corn growing upon
the ſaid Glebe-Lands by him ſo manured and ſown<note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. 21 H. 6 fo. 20. 34 H. 6. fo. 38.</note>. And if
one be put into a Place, then removed, and another put in, the
firſt ſhall have the Tithe happening in ſuch Vacancy<note n="k" place="margin">Hil 18 Jac. <hi>Wood</hi>'s Caſe.</note>; for the
ſucceeding Parſon ſhall have the Tithes happening during the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy,
deducting the charges of collecting the ſame, and ſerving
the Cure during ſuch Vacancy. Alſo if an Incumbent be removed
in a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> the Plaintiff ſhall not have the main profits<note n="l" place="margin">

tried. But by the Court a Prohibition was denied, becauſe that he was
now Incumbent. And the Judges would not take notice of the
ill Preſentation of the King: But in caſe of <hi>Simony</hi> the Statute
makes the Church void, and then the Judges may take notice of
that, and grant a Prohibition, if the Parſon ſues for Tithes. But if a

               <p>(7.) A Libel was againſt <hi>H.</hi> Vicar of <hi>S.</hi> in the High Commiſſion-Court

when the High Court viſited, ſpoke ſo loud, that he was offenſive to
many, and being reproved for that, he gave a Scornful Anſwer:
And that there was one <hi>Wright</hi> in the Pariſh, who had a Seat in the
Church, and that the Vicar would Spit in abundance into the ſaid
Seat, and that when <hi>Wright</hi> and his Wife were there. And that in
his Sermon he made Jeſts, and ſaid, <hi>That Chriſt was laid in a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
becauſe he had no mony to take up a Chamber, but that was the
knavery of the Inn-keeper;</hi> he being then in contention with an
Inn-keeper in the Pariſh. And that in time of Divine Service he
thruſt open the door of <hi>Wright</hi>'s Seat, and ſaid, That he and his
Wife would ſit there, in diſturbance of Divine Service. And for
that a Prohibition was prayed and granted; for the High Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

and that the Manſion-houſe of the ſaid Rectory was in good
Repair, and that Dr. <hi>N.</hi> held that in his hands and occupation with
his own proper Goods, and did not Lett it to any other, and that he
inhabited in the ſaid Meſſuage, and not in the Parſonage. The
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:95379:207"/>
Statute of 21 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 13. provides, That every Parſon promoted
to any Parſonage, ſhall be Perſonally reſident, and abiding in, at,
and upon the ſaid Benefice: And in caſe any ſuch Spiritual Parſon
keep not Reſidence at his Benefice, as aforeſaid, but Abſent himſelf
wilfully by the ſpace of a Month together, or two Months to be

or abiding in any other places by ſuch time, that then he ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
for every ſuch default Ten pounds, the one half to the King,
the other half to the Informer. The Queſtion was, Whether the
ſaid Dr. <hi>N.</hi> were <hi>Non-Reſident,</hi> and incurred the penalty of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute?
It was Argued by <hi>Houghton,</hi> that he had incurred the penalty
of the Statute, and was <hi>Non-Reſident</hi> within the intent thereof; he
ſaid, that to ſome intent all the Pariſh may be ſaid the Benefice of
the Parſon, for that he hath Benefit out of it, and he is called Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of ſuch a Town or Pariſh; but this is not the Benefice that the
Statute intends, upon which he ought to be <hi>Reſident, &amp;c.</hi> Alſo he
ſaid, That there were Seven cauſes of making the ſaid Statute,
whereof but Two are to our purpoſe; the one is <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> the
other <hi>Relief</hi> of the <hi>Poor,</hi> and theſe are to be done in the Parſonage-houſe,
for this is the Free Alms of the Church: And ſo it was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
34 <hi>Eliz. B. R. Broom</hi> and <hi>Hudſon;</hi> and 40 <hi>Eliz. B. R.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Goodall. Coke 21. b.</hi> That he ought to be <hi>Reſident</hi>
upon the Parſonage-houſe, and not elſewhere; and he agreed, That
Impriſonment without deceit, and Sickneſs, are good Excuſe. For
the Defendant, <hi>Barker</hi> Serjeant argued, That it appears by the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
Verdict, that Dr. <hi>N.</hi> held the Parſonage-houſe in his own hands,
and did not Lett it; whence he inferr'd, That his Servants were
reſident upon it, &amp;c. and that by the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> all the
Pariſh is made the Benefice of the Parſon, &amp;c. Alſo, that before
the ſaid Statute every Spiritual man was obliged and compellable
by the Eccleſiaſtical Law to be Reſident; yet if he were in the
Kings Service, or an Officer of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> he ſhould be excuſed,
as appears in the <hi>Regiſter, fo. 51. b.</hi> though that he were Dean, the
which Office meerly requires his <hi>Perſonal Reſidence,</hi> as it is there
ſaid. This Caſe was compounded by the Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> but he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
this was <hi>no Reſidence</hi> within the Statute, for this was not his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice,

have acceſs to him, as oft as the Pariſhioners have need of
his Miniſtry, and ſo as on all requiſitions he be ready to adminiſter

ſuch Reſidence aims as well at Hoſpitality as at the diſcharge of the

aſſumpſit</hi> pleaded, a <hi>Special Verdict</hi> was found, upon which the Caſe
appeared to be this: The Defendant by Indenture did Demiſe unto
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:95379:208"/>
the Plaintiff all his Tithe of Corn and Hay, and the Agreement
between them was this,<note place="margin">Paſch. 7 Jac. B. R. <hi>Shepherd</hi> verſ. <hi>Twolſie.</hi> Bulſtr. Rep. par. 1.</note> the Plaintiff ſhould pay him for the Tithe
fifty five ſhillings, and this by agreement was to be paid at a day
certain, then following: The Defendant having this Tithe, paſſed
the ſame in this manner to the Plaintiff, and upon this Agreement
and Promiſe, being not performed, the Plaintiff brought his Action.
It was found, that the Defendant confeſſed the Agreement to be
ſo, but in Barr he pleaded the Statutes of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 20. and of
14 <hi>Eliz, cap.</hi> 11. for the avoiding of Leaſes made by a Parſon, by
his Abſence from his Living by the ſpace of eighty daies in one
year, and alſo ſhews that one <hi>Stallowe</hi> who was Parſon of <hi>Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi>
to whom theſe Tithes did belong (and in whoſe Right the
Defendant claimed them) was Abſent from his Parſonage by the
ſpace of <hi>eighty daies in one year,</hi> and ſhews in what year, and ſo by
this his intereſt determined, and Agreement with the Plaintiff by
this made void; but they found further (as the Plaintiff made it to
appear) That <hi>Stallowe</hi> the Parſon of <hi>Sharrington</hi> was not <hi>Abſent</hi> in
manner as it was alledged, for that they found, that he did dwell
in another Town adjoyning, but that he came conſtantly to his
Pariſh-Church, and there read Divine Service, and ſo went away
again: They did alſo find, hat he had a Parſonage-houſe in <hi>Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington</hi>
fit for his habitation; and whether this were an Abſence
within the Statute, as to avoid his Leaſe, they left that to the
Judgment of the Court. <hi>Yelverton</hi> Juſtice, This is a good <hi>Non-Reſidency</hi>
within the Statute of 21 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 13. but not an Abſence
to avoid a Leaſe made within the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 20. It
cannot be ſaid here in this Caſe, that he was Abſent, for he came
four daies in every week, and in his Pariſh-Church did read Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Service. <hi>Williams</hi> Juſtice, upon the Statute of 13 and 14 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</hi>
the Parſon ought not to be Abſent from his Church eighty
daies together in one year (<hi>à Rectoria ſua;</hi>) but this is not ſo here,
for he came to his Church, and read Divine Service there every
<hi>Sunday, Wedneſday, Friday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday,</hi> and therefore clearly
this cannot be ſuch an Abſence, within the ſcope and intention of
theſe Statutes, as thereby to avoid his Leaſe. <hi>Yelverton</hi> Juſtice, he
ought to be Abſent <hi>eighty daies together, per ſpatium de Octogin.
diebus &amp; ultra,</hi> and <hi>this to be altogether at one time,</hi> and ſo the ſame
ought to have been laid expreſly, the which is not ſo done here,
for that it appears here, that he was at his Parſonage-houſe, and
did read Prayers every <hi>Sunday, Wedneſday, Friday,</hi> and <hi>Saturday;</hi>
and ſo the whole Court were clear of Opinion, that this Abſence
here, as the ſame appeared to be, was not ſuch an Abſence by the
ſpace of eighty daies in one year, to avoid his Leaſe within the ſaid
Statute, and ſo the Defendants Plea in Barr not good, and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:95379:209"/>

That he took the Farm for the maintenance of his Houſe and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily:
And this alſo is juſtifiable by the Opinion of the whole
Court. <hi>Crooke</hi> moved the Court for the Defendants, That the
Plaintiff was a Common Informer, and that he did prefer this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
againſt them, only for their vexation, and ſo to draw
them to compound with him, as formerly he hath ſo done by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
for which they proſecuted an Indictment in the Countrey,
upon the Statute of 18 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5. made to puniſh Common In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers
for their Abuſes. The <hi>whole Court</hi> did adviſe them to
proſecute this Indictment againſt him. <hi>Crooke</hi> moved for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants,
That in regard the Informer is a man of no means, that
the Court would order him to put in ſufficient Sureties to anſwer
Coſts, if the matter went againſt him, and that then the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
would preſently anſwer the Information. <hi>Williams</hi> Juſtice,
<hi>nullam habemus talem legem,</hi> this is not to be done; but the Rule
of the Court was, That the Defendants ſhould not anſwer the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,

That the Plaintiff ſhould have his Tithes of certain
Lands for thirteen years; and that afterwards he Reſigned, and
another Parſon Inducted, by which means he was ouſted of his

pleads in Barr the Statutes of 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 20. and 14 <hi>Eliz.
cap.</hi> 11. for <hi>Non-Reſidency,</hi> upon which Plea the Plaintiff de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murr'd
in Law. It was urged for the Plaintiff, That the Plea
in Barr was not good, becauſe it is not averred, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
had been Abſent from his Parſonage by the ſpace of Eighty
daies in a year, for otherwiſe the Covenant is not void by the
Statutes. For the Defendant it was alledged, That the pleading
of the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> is idle, but by the Statute of 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi>
this Covenant is made void; for by the Statute, all Covenants
ſhall be all one with Leaſes, made by ſuch Parſons: And in this
caſe, if this had been a Leaſe, this had been clearly void by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of the Parſon; and ſo in caſe of a Covenant. <hi>Doderidge</hi>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:95379:209"/>
and <hi>Houghton</hi> Juſtices, The Statutes of 13 and 14 <hi>Eliz.</hi> do not
meddle with Aſſurances at the Common Law, nor intended to
make any Leaſes void, which were void at the Common Law;
and therefore this Covenant here is not made void by the Statute,
unleſs he be Abſent <hi>Eighty</hi> daies from his Parſonage. <hi>Coke</hi> Chief
Juſtice agreed with them herein. They all agreed in this Caſe for

Spiritual Fathers were ſuſpected of old to incline to the Fleſh all

               <p>(4.) The <hi>Abbot,</hi> or the chief Head of <hi>Abbies,</hi> being together

Prieſt ſhall have, the King ſhall have the Land, for otherwiſe he
ſhall have nothing. (3.) If Land of 20 <hi>l.</hi> is given for finding

if a Prieſt have but a Stipend, the King ſhall have but the Stipend.
(5.) When a certain Sum is limited to a Prieſt, and other good uſes

Pariſh of <hi>S.</hi> and their Succeſſors, That the Churchwardens ſhould
receive the Profits thereof, and therefore ſhould find a Chaplain

an <hi>Anniverſary,</hi> expending yearly on it 13 <hi>s. 4 d.</hi> and the Reſidue
of the profits thereof to be expended and employed about the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
of the ſaid Church; which were done accordingly. The
Queſtion now was, Whether theſe Meſſuages were given to the
King by the Statute of 1 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. of <hi>Chaunteries.</hi> It was ſaid, part
of the Profits were given for a good uſe, and that ſhould ſave the
Lands: But Reſolved, becauſe that was incertain, for it is (<hi>ſi quid

and the Quit-rent did amount to the full value of the Meſſuages;
and the value ſhall be taken as it was at the time of the making of

the opinion of the Court, (1) That Lay-Corporations are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
out of the Statute for their Lands, which they have to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their Treaſure for the good of the Corporation, but not for
Lands which they have to employ to Superſtitious uſes. (2) Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,
That all the money which was given for the <hi>Obit,</hi> and the
finding of a Prieſt, was a Superſtitious uſe, and given to the King by
the Statute; but that which was given for the maintenance of the
Poor men, and although it was appointed them to pray for his Soul,
which was a Precept ſuitable for that time, and which was given
for the Reparation of the Meſſuages, was not given to the Crown
by the ſaid Statute: And <hi>Turner</hi>'s Caſe was vouched to be Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged,
where Land was given to the intent, that his Feoffees ſhould
keep an <hi>Obit</hi> with ſo much of the Profits of it as they ſhould think
fit in their diſcretion, that the Land thereby was not given to the
Crown, but ſo much of the yearly Rent as the Feoffees employed
to that purpoſe; and if they had employed nothing that way, then
nothing was given to the Crown: In the principal Caſe it was Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged

the Queen and <hi>Palmer</hi> it was ſaid by <hi>Anderſon</hi> Chief Juſtice,
That where a Gift is made to ſuſtain Poor men and Maſs-Prieſts,
without limiting a certain quantity, how much to one uſe, and how
much to the other uſe, there the Queen ſhall have the whole Land:
But if the quantity was appointed as to one uſe, and how much to
the other uſe, there the Land is not forfeited, but only ſo much as is
employed to the Superſtitious uſes<note n="s" place="margin">Paſch. 30 Eliz. <hi>More</hi>'s Rep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>(10.) In order to the better execution of the Premiſſes, there
was a Court eſtabliſhed, commonly called the Court of <hi>Augmentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
erected as a Court of Record, by Authority of Parliament <hi>An.</hi>
27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which was to have one Great Seal, and one Privy Seal;
conſiſting of a Chancellor as the chief and principal Officer thereof,
a Treaſurer, Attorney, Sollicitor, Clerk, Uſher, and Meſſenger. All
Lands, &amp;c. belonging to Monaſteries, Priories, and other Religious
Houſes, and Purchaſed Lands were within the ſurvey and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Court; which (as the Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ſays) could not be
erected but by Parliament, becauſe a Chancellor and a Court of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
were conſtituted<note n="t" place="margin">Co. Inſt. p. 4. cap. 15.</note>. There were alſo other Miniſterial Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
that had relation to this Court; for there were Ten Auditors,
called Auditors of the Revenues of the ſaid Augmentations, and
Seventeen particular Receivers of the ſaid Revenues<note n="u" place="margin">St. 27 H. 8. c. 27.</note>. This
Court of Augmentations, together with the Court of General Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyers,
being repealed, diſſolved, extinguiſhed, and determined by
King <hi>H.</hi> 8. by his Letters Patents in the <hi>38th</hi> year of his Reign, a
new Court of Augmentations was erected by his Letters Patents;
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:95379:214"/>
which Repeal and Diſſolution thereof was held void in Law, becauſe
they had been erected by Authority of Parliament: For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
alſo the new Erection of the new Court of Augmentations was
held likewiſe void; and therefore the ſaid Letters Patents, as well
for the diſſolution of the former, as for the erecting of the latter
new Court of Augmentations, were after confirmed and eſtabliſhed
by a Statute enacted by King <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.<note n="x" place="margin">St. 7 E. 6. c. 2. vid. <hi>the Re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

according to the power given her for diſſolution of the ſaid Court by

1. <hi>Jan. in primo Regni,</hi> and the day next following by other Letters
Patents united the ſame to the Exchequer, which was utterly void,
becauſe ſhe had diſſolved the ſame before: So as ſhe purſued not her
Authority; and ſo it was Reſolved by all the Judges<note n="y" place="margin">Co. ibid. &amp; Dyer 4 E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. 16.</note>. The end
and intent of this Court was, that the King might be juſtly dealt
with touching the profit of ſuch Religious Houſes; and the Court
took its name from this, that the Revenues of the Crown were ſo
much augmented by the ſuppreſſion of the ſaid Religious Houſes
and their Lands; for by the ſuppreſſing of ſome, and the ſurrendring
of other Religious Houſes, the Royal <hi>Intrado</hi> was ſo much increaſed
in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 8. that for the better managing of it, the King e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

                  </hi> But in ſhort time, what by the profuſeneſs of ſome, and

               <p>(1.) <hi>ALtarage</hi> or <hi>Altaragium,</hi> a word though now ſomewhat
obſolete, yet in ſignification of Eccleſiaſtical cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
and in the intent thereof practicable at this day.
Mr. <hi>Blount</hi> in his <hi>Nomo-Lexicon</hi> takes notice thereof, as a word
which comprehends not only the Offerings made upon the <hi>Altar,</hi>
but alſo all the profit which accrues to the Prieſt by reaſon of the
Altar, <hi>Obventio Altaris.</hi> And for further proof and illuſtration of
this matter, there cites a Preſident out of the Orders and Decrees
of the Exchequer in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> to this effect,
That upon hearing of the Matter between <hi>R. T.</hi> Vicar of <hi>Weſt-Haddon,</hi>
and <hi>E. Andrewes,</hi> it was ordered, That the ſaid Vicar
ſhould have, by reaſon of the words (<hi>Altaragium cum manſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petenti</hi>)
contained in the Compoſition of the Profits aſſigned for
the Vicars Maintenance, all ſuch things as he ought to have by theſe
words, according to the Definition thereof made by the Reverend
Father in God, <hi>John</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> upon Conference with
the <hi>Civilians,</hi> viz. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all Doctors of Law, <hi>h. e.</hi> by <hi>Altaragium,</hi>
Tithes of Lamb, Wool, Colt, Calf, Piggs, Goſlins, Chicken, But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

Oblations, Obventions, and Offerings, which in effect
ſeem to be but as one and the ſame thing, and that which may be
called meerly Spiritual, the Oblations being ſuch things Real or

ſeem to be included in Obventions; the other Profits conſiſting in

               <p>(2.) In Cardinal <hi>Otho</hi>'s daies, about 170 years ſince, this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue
of <hi>Altarage</hi> was moſt groſly abuſed by many of the Clergy
inſomuch that he made a moſt ſevere Canon or Conſtitution againſt
the Offenders in that kind; for in theſe daies (as he obſerves in the
Canon) theſe Miſerable Prieſts (for ſo he there calls them) to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
the profits of their Vicarages out of their ravenous Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,
by the exceſſive gain of their <hi>Altarages,</hi> would admit
none to their Penitential Confeſſions, unleſs they firſt depoſited
ſome Money, in purſuance of a precedent Compact (as the <hi>Gloſs</hi> has
it) by way of a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> extortion, far exceeding the allowed
and accuſtomed Altarages or Oblations of the Altar: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
firſt declaring them not only unworthy of all Eccleſiaſtical
Benefices, but alſo of the Kingdom of God, did Decree, That the
Biſhops in their reſpective Dioceſſes ſhould make a moſt exact En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
touching this horrid abuſe, and that all ſuch as were ſound
guilty thereof, ſhould be removed from and deprived of the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
they poſſeſſed, and for the future be render'd incapable of all
Eccleſiaſtical Preferments, and wholly ſuſpended from their Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
for ever. <hi>Conſtit.</hi> Otho. <hi>Nè aliquid exigatur pro Sacramentis,

<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95379:217"/>
was then alſo Decreed, inhibiting and forbidding all ſuch
Farms of <hi>Altarages</hi> in any kind for the future: Where <hi>John de
Aton</hi> in his Gloſs upon that Canon ſays, it was Conſtituted for the
prevention of <hi>Simony;</hi> and there takes the occaſion to put the
Queſtion, Whether it be lawful to allow a Parochial Chaplain for
his ſtipend the Annual Obventions of <hi>Altarage</hi> in whole, or in part?
the Negative ſeems (ſays he) to be in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Canon; but in his own opinion he is of another judgment, becauſe
it matters not, whether his Salary be paid in Money or any other
Eccleſiaſtical thing; and concludes, that an Aſſignment of ſuch <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarages</hi>
may ſafely be tolerated; and that the Prieſt to whom <hi>Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages</hi>
are due, may appoint his Proctor to collect the ſame, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo Collected, may lawfully be aſſigned him for his Stipend: And
although the Canon forbids the Letting to Farm the <hi>Altarages,</hi> and
other profits of the Church, yet the Gloſs holds that the Temporal
Provenues of an Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction may be ſold or lett to
Farm; but not the Spiritual Right of the Juriſdiction it ſelf. <hi>Ibid.

which is offered at the Altar, and <hi>Minutae Decimae</hi> are the Small

And this is the Queſtion here, Whether the Vicar by this word
[<hi>Altaragium</hi>] hath Title to the Tithe-Wood? <hi>Crook</hi> Juſtice,
This word <hi>Altaragium</hi> doth not carry the Tithe-Wood, which are
great Tithes, but <hi>Minutas Decimas,</hi> which are petit ſmall Tithes;
<hi>Minutae Decimae &amp; Altaragia,</hi> the Vicar, as was urged, is to have
them by his Compoſition, and that by theſe words he is to have
Tithe-Wood. <hi>Fleming</hi> Chief Juſtice, There is an Uſage here
laid in the Vicar to have the Tithe-Wood, by reaſon of theſe
words, <hi>Altaragia &amp; Minutae Decimae,</hi> the which the Vicar can no
waies have, but by Preſcription or by ſuch a Uſage; and ſo the
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:95379:218"/>
ſame may paſs by theſe words <hi>Altaragia &amp; Minutae Decimae,</hi> and
the Uſage had accordingly: Alſo Sheaves of Corn have paſſed by
Uſage to the Vicar, by the words <hi>Altaragia &amp; Minutae Decimae,</hi>
and ſo it was Adjudged in the Court of Exchequer. <hi>The Judges
all agreed in this,</hi> That by theſe words <hi>Altaragia &amp; Minutae Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae,</hi>
by Uſage, Tithe-wood may well paſs; and ſo hath the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of all the <hi>Civilians</hi> been. <hi>Fleming</hi> Chief Juſtice, and the reſt
of the Judges agreed in this, That by Uſage, the word <hi>Altaragia</hi>
ſhall be accounted <hi>inter Minutas Decimas. Williams</hi> Juſtice, By
the word <hi>Altaragia</hi> Tithe-Wood doth not paſs; but if the
Vicar have uſed to have the ſame, time out of mind, This
is good, and ſhall paſs under the words of <hi>Minutae Decimae. Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming</hi>
Chief Juſtice, Though the Law be againſt it, that Tithe-Wood
doth not paſs by theſe words, yet by Uſage it hath been
allowed good, to carry Tithe-Wood by theſe words, being of ſmall
value; and by ſuch Uſage Tithe-Wood may paſs, though the Law

                     <hi>Cawdrey</hi>'s Diſcourſe of Patronage, p. 8.</note> which in this Infancy of the Goſpel
the Presbyters had out of the Contributions of the Converts. And
the <hi>Fratres Sportulantes</hi> mentioned by him in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 66. were the
Clergy which received ſuch allowance. Theſe Converts (after the
Converſion of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour) many of them being
Governours and Nobles, ſettled great and large Demeſn-Lands
upon thoſe who Converted them; and that (according to Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi>
conjecture) the firſt Oratories or places of Publick Worſhip,
were built in the Lands beſtowed on them; which firſt Oratories
were called <hi>Cathedrals, Sees,</hi> or <hi>Seats,</hi> from their conſtant Reſidence
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:95379:221"/>
thereon. That the Chriſtian Church even in times of Perſecution
laid claim to Tithes as due <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> is partly confeſſed by Mr.
<hi>Selden</hi> himſelf, citing ſome paſſages in the Ancient Fathers to that
purpoſe. But when the Empire became <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> then the Chriſtian
Clergy did more earneſtly preſs the Donation of <hi>Tithes;</hi> and in
proceſs of time they prevailed, not only by Preaching and Canons,
but by the Edicts of Emperours and Kings, to have Tithes given
to the Church. And it appears, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it did reduce any Conquered Countrey <hi>in formam Provinciae,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
the Farmers of the Cuſtomes, to collect among other Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions

all who occupied any Land in the Conquered Province, either as
immediate Tenants to the Empire, or as Sub-Tenants under them.
The <hi>Publicans</hi> therefore who collected theſe Tributes were called
<hi>Decumani,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Selden, pag.</hi> 39. of his Hiſtory of <hi>Tithes</hi> doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
out of <hi>Appian.</hi> But whether theſe Tenths were received by
the Senate or Emperours, upon a Civil or Religious account, is not
liquid and clear: For the Emperours alwaies till Chriſtianity came
in (nay <hi>Conſtantine</hi> and other Emperours even after Chriſtianity
was received, till <hi>Gratian</hi>'s time, as the Noble and Learned <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleſſy</hi>

the Barons of the Realm with ſuch Juriſdiction as the Court Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron

were the King Demeſns, that <hi>Ethelwolph</hi> the Second Monarch of
the <hi>Saxon</hi> race (his Father <hi>Egbert</hi> being the firſt, which brought the
former Heptarchy under one ſole Prince) conferred the Tithes of
all the Kingdom upon the Church by his Royal Charter. Of which
<hi>Ingulph</hi> Abbot of <hi>Crowland, An.</hi> 855. ſaith, That King <hi>Ethelwolph</hi>
with the conſent (<hi>gratuito conſenſu</hi>) of his Prelates and Princes,
did firſt enrich the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Tithes of all his
Lands and Goods. Many other Laws of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings for the
payment of Tithes are recited by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> as entirely the Gift
of Kings: And ſo ſaith King <hi>Elred, Nemo auferat à Deo, quod ad

Anciently was in a large ſenſe a <hi>Paroecia,</hi> and the income of it

(by Contributions firſt, and by Tithes alſo afterwards) was the
Common ſtock of all the Clergy of the Dioceſs; and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>
aſſerts it to be the general Opinion of all the Common Lawyers,
That before the <hi>Lateran</hi> Council, under <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. every man might
have given his Tithes to what Church he would (probably within
the Dioceſs) becauſe they were not the Propriety as yet of any
one Presbyter, but the Common Patrimony of all the Dioceſan
Clergy. So that Tithes are a Tenth part of all increaſe Tithable,

That by the <hi>Moral Law</hi> the rate or proportion of Tithes is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
to be the Tenth part of the Fruits; which the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
Opinion holds to be both Erroneous and Miſchievous; and
that by the Law of God and Nature, no Cuſtome deviating from
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:95379:222"/>
the exact rate and proportion of the Tenth of the Fruits, ought to
prevail any longer than by the free and mutual conſent of Parſon
and Pariſhioner: For which reaſon it is ſuppoſed, That the paying
of a Halfpeny for a <hi>Lamb,</hi> or a Peny for a <hi>Calf,</hi> by ſuch as have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
Seven in one year, is now become an unreaſonable Cuſtome, in
regard the value of ſuch Lambs and Calves is now raiſed four times
higher, than in Ancient times. This ſeems far remote from Tithes,
the very <hi>Quotity</hi> whereof ſeems to be <hi>Moral</hi>
                  <note n="g" place="margin">Levit. 27. 30.</note>, rather than <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi>
or <hi>Judicial;</hi> and not only allowed or approved, but even
commanded by our Saviour himſelf<note n="h" place="margin">Matt. 23. 23. &amp; Luke 11. 42.</note>: Yea, by the very Law of
<hi>Nature</hi> (which is the ground of the Moral Law, and long before
the Levitical) Tithes appear to be due, in that <hi>Abraham</hi> paid it to
<hi>Melchiſedec:</hi> And God himſelf (who is the beſt Interpreter of his
own Law) calls the detention of Tithes <hi>Sacriledge</hi>
                  <note n="i" place="margin">Mal. 3. 8, 9. 10. vid. Pro. 3. 9, 10.</note>. And that
Command of Chriſt, affirming that <hi>Tithes</hi> ought to be paid of all,
even to the very Herbs, ſpoken by him at the period of the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
Law, ought not to be reſtrained only to the Prieſthood of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron;</hi>
for it doth now remain in force as to Prieſts under the Goſpel, as
that other part of the Moral Law, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding
of Tithes being expreſly interpreted <hi>Theft</hi> and <hi>Robbery</hi> by
the Prophet<note n="k" place="margin">Mal. ibid.</note>. And leſt it ſhould be thought a meer Human
Intereſt, or in the power of Man to alienate, God himſelf hath
vouchſafed to take Tithes upon his own account in his Miniſters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.
Theſe Tithes could not be meerly Ceremonial (as ſome would
have it) for they prefigure nothing, nor are they repealed by any
one Text in the Goſpel, but reinforced as aforeſaid: ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was commanded in the Old Teſtament, and grounded on
the Law of Nature, and being not Repealed in the New, muſt yet
ſtand in force, as a Duty of the Moral Law. And if it be Objected,
That Tithes were not paid in the Primitive times of the Chriſtian
Church; the Reaſon is, not becauſe they were not then due, but
becauſe there was not then any ſuch ſettled Order for things of this
or the like nature in the Church.</p>
               <p>(3.) Wherefore all the Common Objections made againſt the
payment of Tithes in the Chriſtian Church may be reduced to one
of theſe Four: (1.) That our Saviour gave no Command to his
Apoſtles to take Tithes, but rather on the contrary ſaid, <hi>Freely ye
have received, freely give.—Anſw.</hi> Yet our Saviour ſays, <hi>Theſe
things</hi> (ſpeaking of Tithes) <hi>ought you to have done</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">Matth. 23. 23. &amp; Luke 11. 42.</note>. And ſays,
<hi>The workman is worthy of his meat</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 10. 10.</note>. And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>The
Labourer is worthy of his Reward</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 18.</note>. Where hath Chriſt <hi>in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem
verbis</hi> forbidden Sacriledge? wilt thou therefore commit it,
becauſe he hath not <hi>in terminis terminantibus</hi> forbidden it? <hi>Thou
that abhorreſt Idols, doſt thou commit Sacriledge</hi>
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 2. 22.</note>? (2) Tithes
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:95379:222"/>
were not paid till about three hundred years after Chriſt, as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,
Origen,</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> do teſtifie. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Theſe Fathers do
withal acknowledge, that during that time the Churches Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was the Peoples free Contribution; which probably might
have continued to this day, had not that Contribution in proceſs of
time turned into a Sacrilegious <hi>Century</hi> by Covetouſneſs, inſtead of
a Commanded <hi>Decuma</hi> as a Duty Morally enjoyn'd. (3.) That
Tithes came firſt into this Kingdom by the power of the Pope, as
by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> in the time of <hi>Offa</hi> King of <hi>Mereia,</hi> during <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands
Heptarchy,</hi> in <hi>An.</hi> 786.—<hi>Anſw.</hi> Poſſibly it might be ſo;
what follows thence? does a thing lawful in it ſelf become unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
becauſe a Pope enjoyns it? what if he had commanded Alms
to be given inſtead of Tithes? muſt we therefore be neither honeſt
in payment of the one, nor charitable in giving the other, becauſe
there was a Command of a Pope in the caſe? (4.) That <hi>AEthelſtane,
Edmond, Edgar, Canutus,</hi> and <hi>AEthelwolfe,</hi> Kings of <hi>England,</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
the payment of Tithes meerly to pacifie their Conſciences,
and thereby to make Atonement for their Blood-guilty Souls.—
<hi>Anſw.</hi> Admit it were Hiſtorically true, yet the final Cauſe of any
Action, or the End for which a thing is done, alters not that quality
that is inherent naturally in the thing: A thing lawful in it ſelf
commanded for a wrong End, perverts the Action, not the thing;
if a man gives Alms that the Poor may be drunk, though that be
no Alms, yet it doth not render Alms as unlawful, nor alter that
quality of Charity which is inſeparable from Alms.</p>
               <p>(4.) Tithes Anciently were Fourfold, as (1) That which the
People paid to the <hi>Levites</hi>
                  <note n="p" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hierom. ſup.</hi> Ezek. 14 45. &amp; Num. 18. 26.</note>. (2) That which the <hi>Levites</hi> thence
paid to the Prieſts<note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 14. 22.</note>. (3) That which the <hi>Jews</hi> reſerved for
Expence in their Solemn Feaſts, when they went to the Tabernacle
or Temple<note n="r" place="margin">Deut. 14. 23.</note>. (4) A Third years Tenth, which was then laid
up for the <hi>Levite</hi> and the Poor<note n="s" place="margin">Deut. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 28.</note>. The firſt of theſe is held a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
Moral, and Divine Tribute; the ſecond and third Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial;
the fourth Judicial. The <hi>Jews</hi> had alſo their <hi>Theruma,</hi> which
was not properly Tithe, but a ſecond kind of Firſt-Fruits: There
were two kinds hereof, the one called the Great <hi>Theruma,</hi> the exact
quantity whereof was not defined by <hi>Moſes;</hi> but the Ancient Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
determin'd, that it might not be leſs than the fourtieth, fiftieth,
or at leaſt the ſixtieth part of the kinds already dreſs'd and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared,
as <hi>Wheat</hi> Fann'd, <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> Corn in the Ear taken from

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.</note>. The other was the Leſſer
<hi>Theruma,</hi> which was, that when the former was taken away for
the Prieſts, the reſt of the Heap was Tithed for the <hi>Levite,</hi> the <hi>tenth</hi>
part whereof the <hi>Levites</hi> gave to the Prieſts, which was called the
<hi>Tithe of the Tithe,</hi> or the <hi>Theruma</hi> of the Tithe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="352" facs="tcp:95379:223"/>
(5.) Becauſe the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> hath been divided into Three
parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Moral, Judicial, and Ceremonial, ſome of the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
have thence conceived, That <hi>Tithes</hi> admit the like diviſion,
whereof the <hi>Moral</hi> part was only a neceſſary Maintenance for the
Miniſter, and therefore natural and perpetual: The <hi>Judicial</hi> part
was the number of Ten, as fit only for the <hi>Jews,</hi> and therefore
poſitive and remotive: The <hi>Ceremonial</hi> part was the Myſtery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in this Number of Ten, which being (as they taught) but a
ſhadow only, was vaniſh'd and aboliſh'd with the Law it ſelf; and
thence inferr'd, that the <hi>Quotity</hi> or preciſe number of Ten being
taken away by reaſon of the Ceremony, a competency now only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
for the Miniſter out of the Tithes: This Conceit hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
no ſmall prejudice to the Church, although it hath no more
probability of truth in it, than that whereon it is grounded, <hi>viz.</hi>
That the Number of <hi>Ten</hi> is a type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that the inferiour
Digits do ſignifie the People. <hi>Levi</hi> himſelf paid Tithes to the firſt
Prieſt we ever read of, that is, he paid them in <hi>Abraham,</hi> which
being urged by the Apoſtle againſt the <hi>Levitical</hi> Ceremonies, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,
that they are more than meerly <hi>Levitical</hi> and Ceremonial;
indeed if we conſider their aſſignment to <hi>Levi</hi>'s Tribe, they are ſuch,
but not otherwiſe. The Sabbath and Tithes were both before the
Law in their very Numbers reſpectively<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 2. 3. &amp; 14. 20. &amp; 28. 22. Heb. 7. 4.</note>, and were but repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by <hi>Moſes</hi> under the Law, becauſe they had been approved of God
before the Law in the ſelf-ſame Numbers. The Sabbath is ſaid to
have a Moral and a Ceremonial part: The <hi>Moral</hi> is perpetual and
unalterable, which is, that God ſhould have a Seventh day; the
<hi>Ceremonial</hi> being Typical of our Reſt in Heaven is only poſitive, and
not ſo unalterable, but that it might be (as it is) changed from the
Seventh day of the Creation, to the Seventh after our Saviours
Reſurrection: So Tithes, they alſo have a Natural and a Poſitive
part; the Natural is permanent and unalterable, which is, that
God hath reſerved to himſelf a Tenth of the increaſe, &amp;c. for the
Maintenance of his Miniſters; in which ſenſe immediately after
the diſſolution of the <hi>Jews</hi> policy, the Chriſtians of the Primitive
Church, as ſoon as they could get any outward form of a Church,
and peace from Perſecution, received it in the very <hi>Quotity:</hi> the
Poſitive is, That the Lord annexed thoſe Tithes by <hi>Moſes</hi> to the
Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> for their maintenance, during the diſpenſation
of the Myſteries under the Law, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

but that the Quotity ought to remain as a perpetual Right due to

to be paid or required in a Proteſtant Church, becauſe they have been
ever ſo upheld in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> ſuch may as well argue,
they ought not to be paid in a Chriſtian Church, becauſe they are
paid to <hi>Mahumetan</hi> Princes, for ſo they are, and that becauſe they

muſt be paid in kind, if there be Corn now where Wood grew

And the Law allows the Parſon a convenient time to remove the

after <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who died in the year 693<note n="u" place="margin">Ridl. ibid.</note>. And ſuch as have
followed the courſe of Antiquity in this matter, conceive that the
original of Pariſhes had its Preſident from the practice of ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<hi>Roman</hi> Biſhops, it being (as ſome would have it) recorded in the
<hi>Pontifical</hi> of <hi>Damaſus;</hi> but in <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi>'s <hi>Bibliothecar,</hi> it is found,
That when <hi>Peter</hi> had appointed and ordained Prieſts, &amp;c. and <hi>Cletus</hi>
had reduced them to a certain number, Pope <hi>Euariſt</hi> aſſigned to each
of them his Pariſh; and as to the time when thoſe Pariſhes were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
by <hi>Euariſt,</hi> it muſt be about the beginning of the ſecond <hi>Century,</hi>
which was many Centuries before the C. of <hi>Lateran,</hi> as alſo was the
practice thereof here in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Honorius,</hi> as aforeſaid, the truth
whereof is approved by <hi>Cambden.</hi> But <hi>Cavendum, &amp;c.</hi> ſaith <hi>Marſil</hi> in
his Book <hi>De Red. Eccl. c.</hi> 12. heed muſt be taken as to the word <hi>Pariſh,</hi>
for it is equivocal, having various acceptations, as ſometimes when
nothing is named but a Pariſh, the whole Dioceſs is underſtood, which
notion of the word often occurs in the Councils; in which ſenſe <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batia</hi>
ſpake a wide word for the Pope in his <hi>Tract. de praeſt. Card.</hi> when

Sometimes a Pariſh is taken for ſuch a part of the Dioceſs, as was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd

to whom ſuch a Pariſh paid all their dues, and he to his Clergy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> about

we now have, and were in uſe with us before <hi>Edgar</hi>'s daies, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
by the <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws of that time.</p>
               <p>(9.) The Ancient Kings and Sovereign Princes of this Realm,<note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Laws, cap. 1.</note>
both before and ſince the Conqueſt, have ever made ſpecial Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for the due payment of Tithes unto the Church, and that ever
ſince there was any Church-Government in this Land; witneſs that
Law made before the Conqueſt by King <hi>Aethelſtane,</hi> That every man
ſhould pay his Tithes in manner as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, that is, <hi>of all that
God ſhould give him.</hi> The like did King <hi>Edgar</hi> and King <hi>Edmund</hi>
command on pain of Excommunication. And about the Seventh
Century <hi>Ina</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> made a Law, That the
<hi>Church-Sceat</hi> be paid at <hi>Martlemaſs,</hi> on pain of paying twelve times
as much in caſe of Refuſal: this <hi>Church-ſceat Fleta</hi> interpreteth
<hi>Church-ſeed,</hi> and therefore calls it <hi>Certa menſura bladi Tritici, &amp;c.</hi>
Others read <hi>Church-ſcet,</hi> that is, the <hi>Church-ſhot</hi> or Church-due:
Alſo the ſaid King <hi>Aethelſtane</hi> in the Ninth Century made a Law
by the Advice of <hi>Walfehelme</hi> his Archbiſhop, and his other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<hi>Commanding all his Reeves throughout all his Kingdom in the
Lords name, and of all Saints, that in the firſt place they pay the
Tithe of his own Revenues, as well in Living Cattel as the yearly

preſent, made a Law, <hi>Commanding all Chriſtian men by their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
to pay Tithes, Church-ſceat, and Almes-fee; if any refuſe to
do it, let him be accurſed.</hi> This Alms-fee or Alms-money was that,
which was called the <hi>Peterpence;</hi> for when <hi>Ina</hi> the <hi>Weſt-Saxon</hi> King
went in Pilgrimage to <hi>Rome,</hi> he made it a Law to his Subjects; That
every Houſe ſhould pay a peny to the Pope; and this was to be
tendred at St. <hi>Peters</hi>-tide, as appears by <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Law, <hi>nu.</hi> 4. In
the Laws alſo of King <hi>Edgar</hi> it was Decreed in the firſt place, That
Gods Church ſhould have all her Rights, and that every man
ſhould pay his Tithes to the Elder Miniſter (or Mother-Church)
where he heareth the Word, <hi>cap.</hi> 2. of <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Laws. And in the
<hi>Eighth Chapter</hi> of King <hi>Rnutes</hi> Laws it is Ordained, That care be
taken rightly to pay Gods Rights every year, <hi>viz.</hi> the Plough-Alms
fifteen Nights after <hi>Eaſter,</hi> the Tithe of young Cattel by <hi>Whitſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide,</hi>
and the Fruits of the Earth by <hi>Allhallentide;</hi> otherwiſe, the

               <p>(21.) The Caſe was, A Church in which there had been a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
and Vicar time out of mind, and the Parſon uſed to have the
Great Tithes, and the Vicar the Small, and for the ſpace of forty
years laſt paſt, it was proved that the Parſon had Tithes paid him
out of a Field of twenty acres of Corn, and now the Field is ſowed
with Saffron, and the Vicar ſued for the Tithes of Saffron in the
Eccleſiaſtical Court, and the Parſon had a Prohibition. <hi>Coke,</hi> I
conceive the Parſon ſhall have the Tithes,<note place="margin">Tithe of Saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fron.</note> for by the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi>

although the ground be otherwiſe employed, yet the Parſon ſhall
have the Tithes: And ſo was it in <hi>Norfolk</hi> in the caſe of a Park,
where the Parſon preſcribed <hi>Pro modo Decimandi</hi> to be paid 3 <hi>

               <p>(23.) On the Stat. of 2 <hi>Ed. 6. c.</hi> 13. for ſetting out of Tithes, the

                  </hi> but in the Declaration it is not
ſhewn <hi>how long</hi> the Corn remained on the ground.<note place="margin">Tithe Corn.</note> And by the Court,
it is not good, inaſmuch as it doth not appear that the Owner of the
Land had any Dammage at all, for he doth not ſhew <hi>how long</hi>
the Corn remained on the ground. And the uſual courſe in ſuch
caſes is, if Tithe be ſet out, and the Parſon take it not away in
due time, the party ſhall have an Action on the Caſe. By the Court,
a man cannot diſtrain <hi>Shocks</hi> of Corn, but he may diſtrain a <hi>Stack
Dammage feaſant.</hi> But in this caſe it is not ſhewn how long it remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on the ground, and therefore it doth not appear that he was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified.
And ſo after the Tithe is clearly ſet out, the Parſon may by the
Statute have an Action of Treſpaſs, if any take them away; but if
only a meer Stranger ſet out the Tithe, that ſettles no property in
the Parſon, ſo as that he cannot have any Action for the taking there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

That although it was parcel of the Glebe, yet when it was Leaſed

But <hi>Godfrey</hi> ſaid, that thoſe words would diſcharge him: But <hi>Wray</hi>
on the contrary, for that this Tithe is not iſſuing out of the Land,
but is a thing collateral; and if a Parſon do Releaſe to his Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners

him for Tithes, and <hi>D.</hi> pray'd a Prohibition upon the ſaid Contract.
And if this were ſufficient matter for a Prohibition, was the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
becauſe it was by word only, and without writing, which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
only to a Cauſe of Action upon a Promiſe for <hi>C.</hi> but no
Action for his Leſſees: neither can this amount to a Releaſe of
Tithes; for as Tithes cannot be Leaſed without Deed, ſo they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be Releaſed or diſcharged without Deed. <hi>Gawdy</hi> Juſtice, Tithes
cannot be diſcharged without Deed, unleſs by way of Contract for a
Sum of money, and he cited the 21 <hi>H. 6. 43. Fenner,</hi> for that year in
which the Diſcharge was made, it was good by way of Diſcharge
without Deed, becauſe the Parſon for that year had as it were an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
but ſuch Diſcharge can have no continuance for another year,
for default of a Deed: and ſo a Promiſe being no Diſcharge, it is
no cauſe of a Prohibition. But <hi>Gawdy</hi> held as afore. And the

held, that the Agreement being by parol, was not good: and <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi>

               <p>(38.) B. Farmer of a portion of Tithes for five years, without
Deed, Demiſes a Farm which he had in the ſame Pariſh to <hi>F.</hi> for
years; and afterwards he Libells againſt him in the Eccleſiaſtical
Court for the Tithe of that Farm. And <hi>F.</hi> ſaid, he was not Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.

Leaſe for Tithes is without Deed: but he may be Diſcharged of his
own Tithes without Deed,<note place="margin">Diſcharge of Tithes.</note> as was Adjudged before in this Court.
(2.) The Leſſee is not to pay Tithes for the Farm; for although the
Parſon makes a Leaſe of the Gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>be, the
Leſſee does not pay Tithes. But the Court denied the Caſe of the
Leaſe of the Parſonage Impropriate; and ſaid, That the Caſe of
<hi>Perkins</hi> and <hi>Hinde</hi> was Adjudged to the contrary in that very point.
And alſo if he purchaſe other Lands in the Pariſh (which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of Tithes in his hands) and he Demiſes them, yet the Leſſee
pays him Tithes. And the Opinion of the Court was, If one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
with the Parſon for Diſcharge of the Tithes of his Lands for
years, and Demiſes his Lands to another; yet he ſhall not have
Tithes, but the Diſcharge runs with the Land. But if one take a
Leaſe of his Tithes by Deed, and makes a Demiſe of his Land, he
hath Tithes of the Leſſee. And the Direction was, That the Leſſee
of the Farm ought to ſhew expreſly in the Eccleſiaſtical Court,
that the Farmer had not a Leaſe by Deed: and a Prohibition was

               <p>(52.) The Defendant here in the Prohibition Libels for Tithes of
Hay in the Eccleſiaſtical Court. The Plaintiff ſuggeſts, that the
Hay was growing upon <hi>Greenskips, Deals,</hi> and <hi>Headlands,</hi> and that
there is a Cuſtome, that the Pariſhioners in a Meadow there uſed
to make the Tithe-Hay for the Parſon, and in conſideration of that
to be diſcharged of all Tithes of Hay growing <hi>ut ſupra;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tithe-Hay.</note> and alſo
that for the Hay of the Land, no Tithe ought to be paid of ſuch
Hay, but does not averr, that that Hay was growing upon <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skips,
&amp;c.</hi> And an Exception was taken by <hi>Henden:</hi> (1.) That the
Exception is double; the Cuſtome, and the Common Law: And by
<hi>Yelverton,</hi> That is not material; for you may have twenty Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to maintain the Suggeſtion of the Court: but <hi>Richardſon</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that, that a Suggeſtion might be double here, for the Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Common Law is a Surpluſage: As in <hi>Farmer</hi> and <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich</hi>'s
Caſe here lately, One Preſcribes to be diſcharged of Tithes,
where the Law diſcharged him, and ſo was diſcharged by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:95379:234"/>
Law. Second Exception is, That he doth not apply the Cuſtome
to himſelf in the Suggeſtion; for he that lays the Cuſtome, does not
ſhew that the Hay grew upon the Skips, upon which a Plough might
turn it ſelf: and for this cauſe by the whole Court the Suggeſtion is
naught. And here <hi>Richardſon</hi> moved, how that Two ſhould joyn in
a Prohibition. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> If they are joyned in the Libel, they may
joyn in the Prohibition, and that is the common practice of the Kings
Bench. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> The wrong to one in the Eccleſiaſtical Court by
the Suit, cannot be a wrong to the other. <hi>Hutton,</hi> They may joyn in
the Writ, but they ought to ſever in the Declaration, to which <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>
agreed. <hi>Yelverton,</hi> The Prohibition is the Suit of the King, and he
joyns <hi>tant.</hi> as in a Writ. <hi>Richardſon,</hi> But it is as the Suit of the party
is, and if any joyn here, I think good cauſe of a Conſultation. It is
againſt the profit of the Court to ſuffer many to joyn. And it is uſual
in the Caſe of Cuſtomes of a Pariſh in debate to order Proceedings
in the two Prohibitions, and that to bind all the Pariſh and Parſon.
And it was ſaid by them all, That the Conſideration of making Hay
is a good Diſcharge, becauſe it is more than they are bound to

If it was meer Waſte-ground, and yield nothing, it is excuſed by the
Statute of payment of Tithes for ſeven years: But if Sheep were
kept upon it, or if it yield any Profit, which yield Tithes, then Tithe
ought to be paid:<note place="margin">Tithe-Hay on Heath. 222</note> As the Caſe in <hi>Dyer.</hi> And for the Pidgeons, which

paid of Right; wherefore then of Pidgeons? <hi>quod nemo dedixit.</hi>
And a day was given to ſhew cauſe wherefore a Prohibition ſhould
not be granted. And the Court agreed, That it was Felony to take
Pidgeons out of a Dove-houſe. And afterwards a Prohibition was
granted, but principally, That the Pidgeons were ſpent by the
Owner. But by <hi>Henden,</hi> They ſhall be Tithable, if they be

Reverſion, to pay Tithes according to that rate. (3) That a Rent

brings the Prohibition, to prove his Suggeſtion within Six months,
otherwiſe a Conſultation by the ſaid Statute is grantable. (2) When
a Conſultation is granted for the Reaſon aforeſaid, yet the party may
have a new Prohibition upon the ſame Libel; for that the Statute

of a Suggeſtion within Six months, but where a Conſultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is granted upon the matter of a Suggeſtion: And ſo the Chief
Juſtice declared the Opinion of the Four Juſtices, and thereupon a
Rule given, That the Prohibition ſhould ſtand, and the Defendant
notwithſtanding ſuch Plea aforeſaid in Barr of the Prohibition, may
plead in chief to the matter of the ſaid Suggeſtion, and if he will

<hi>Paſch. 14 Jac. B. R.</hi> in the Caſe between <hi>Witt</hi> and <hi>Buck,</hi> in a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition

<hi>Barren</hi> and Heath-ground, of which after improvement, no Tithes
to be paid the ſpace of Seven years next after the Improvement:
For a Prohibition it was ſhewed, That this Land, for which the
Parſon Libelled for Tithes,<note place="margin">Bulſtr. par. 3.</note> was Marſh and Sandy Land, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with Salt water, ſo that time out of mind no Graſs had been
known there to grow, nor any profit at all made of this, until now
of late time, by and with the great coſts, charges, and induſtry of
the Tenant, this ground had been lately gained from the Sea, and
from its overflowing, by repairing and making new Banks and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>walls,
and by continual repairing of them, and ſo he had now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
the ſame into Arable Land, where he had Corn, and of this
Land the Parſon Libels for Tithes in the Eccleſiaſtical Court: And
upon this matter thus ſhewed, a Prohibition prayed, being to be
diſcharged from payment of Tithes of this Ground for Seven years;
this Statute being thus made for the encouragement of Tenants to
make improvement of their Lands. <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice, It was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
in one <hi>Farrington</hi>'s Caſe upon this Statute of 2 <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. that
Wood-ground is not Barren ground within this Statute: This was
there Adjudged, That if one do ſtock and grub up Wood-ground,
and after convert this into Arable ground, he hath by this meliorated
his Land, but with great coſt and labour, yet he ſhall pay Tithes for
this ground preſently; for that Heath and <hi>barren-ground,</hi> intended
to be within the Statute, ought to be ſuch Land as is <hi>ſuapte natura
ſterilis,</hi> and Barren. <hi>Dederidge</hi> Juſtice, A Salt Marſh, if this be
fenced and ſo made good Meadow, ſhall pay Tithes preſently; yet
before this was ſo fenced, no Tithes thereof payable. <hi>Coke,</hi> This
Land ſhall be out of the Statute, out of the clauſe of Diſcharge for
Seven years, notwithſtanding this charge the Tenant hath been at
in gaining this Land from the Sea; for to have this Land within the
clauſe of Diſcharge within the Statute, it ought to be <hi>Suapte natura</hi>
Barren, which here it is not, but by accident, and by the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing
of the Sea. <hi>The whole Court</hi> agreed in this, That by this
Statute <hi>Barren</hi> ground is ſuch ground as will not bear Corn of it
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:95379:241"/>
ſelf, without very great coſt in the extraordinary manuring of it;
and therefore, that this is no ſuch <hi>Barren</hi> ground within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
as ought to be diſcharged from payment of Tithes, but that
Tithes ought to be paid for the fame, and that the Parſon had juſt

                     <hi>Compoſition</hi> Real, is one of the waies or means whereby Tithes
may be diſcharged: It is where the Incumbent, Patron, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
by Deed or Fine, do agree that ſuch Lands ſhall for ever be
freed and diſcharged of all manner of Tithes paying an Annual
payment, or doing ſome other thing for the profit or advantage of
that Parſon or Vicar to whom the Tithes did belong<note n="k" place="margin">Co. 4. 44. a. 2 Inſt. 655. Dr &amp; Stud. l. 2. c. 55. &amp; Hob. 176.</note>, from
which Compoſitions all Preſcriptions <hi>de Modo Decimandi</hi> have, or

as to oblige the Succeſſor of the Parſon or Vicar that made the

whereby they are prohibited from making any Grant for above
21 years or three Lives, and that with the accuſtomed yearly Rent
reſerved. And if the Parſon or Vicar make any Compoſition with
his Pariſhioner without his Patron and Ordinary, it ſhall bind only
for the Parſons life, and during his Incumbency. This <hi>Compoſition</hi>
is either between Parſon and Pariſhioner, or <hi>inter Clericos;</hi> if it
be between Parſon and Pariſhioner, and it be touching Tithes paſt,
the Compoſition is good, though it were without any Conſideration
at all; but if it be touching Tithes to come, it may be good as to
a payment of Tithes only in part, but not good as to a non-payment
of any Tithes at all; nor is it good in part without the Biſhops
approbation and confirmation. If the Compoſition be <hi>inter Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricos,</hi>
and the Tithes be Perſonal Tithes, it holdeth not: but if they
be Predial Tithes, the Compoſition holdeth, the Approbation of

Enacted, That at the Tithing time of Predial Tithes, it ſhall be
lawful for any to whom Tithes are payable, or for his Deputy or
Servant to ſee the ſaid Tithes to be ſet forth and ſevered from the
Nine parts, and quietly to take and carry them away. And as the
Parſons Rights are hereby ſecured from the danger of having his
Predial Tithes ſubtracted: ſo likewiſe the Law hath provided nor
only for the prevention of his being defrauded therein, and for his
quiet removal and carrying the ſame away; but alſo for an open,
free, and unmoleſted way and paſſage through which to carry the
ſame away, as appears by <hi>Halſey</hi>'s Caſe. The Caſe was this: <hi>H.</hi>
procured a Prohibition againſt <hi>H.</hi> and declared, that the Defendant
had ſued him in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for a Way or Paſſage;
he was Proprietor of Tithes in the Pariſh of <hi>M.</hi> and that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
way to carry the Tithes out of the Plaintiffs Land was by a
Cloſe called <hi>S.</hi> and that the Plaintiff had ſtopt it up, when in very

were abſolutely Diſcharged of Tithes by Preſcription, whilſt the
Lands were in his hands, his Demiſing thereof to a Lay-man
could not make the ſame chargeable therewith<note n="n" place="margin">Co. ibid.</note>. For in

had held the ſaid Mannor, and the Demeſns thereof time out of
mind for him, his Farmers, Tenants for years or at will, Diſcharged
and acquitted from payment of Tithes for theſe Lands; the Biſhop
made a Leaſe for years of parcel of the Demeſns: The Farmer of the
Rectory Libelled in the Eccleſiaſt Court againſt the Leſſee for Tithes;
all which matter he pleaded in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and the Judge
there refuſed to allow of the Allegation in Diſcharge of the Tithes:
It was held in this caſe, (1) That if the Lands of the Biſhop

<hi>cap.</hi> 24. given to the King: It was Reſolved, That the King and
his Patentees ſhould pay Tithes of thoſe Lands, although the
Lands <hi>propriis ſumptibus excolantur,</hi> becauſe the Priviledges to be
Diſcharged of Tithes were proper to Spiritual perſons, and ceaſed
when the perſon Spiritual was removed: And the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi>
8. of Diſſolutions did not extend to ſuch Lands as came to the
King by Special Act of Parliament, as thoſe Lands of St. <hi>Johns</hi> of
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> did. And <hi>Mich. 6. Jac. C. B.</hi> in a Caſe <hi>de Modo Decimandi</hi>
it was ſaid, That one may be Diſcharged of Tithes five waies:
(1) By the Law of the Realm, <hi>viz.</hi> the Common Law, as tithes
ſhall not be paid of Coles, Quarries, Bricks, Tiles, &amp;c. <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 53.
and <hi>Reg.</hi> 54. nor of the After-paſture of a Meadow, &amp;c. nor of
Rakings, nor of Wood to make Pales, or Mounds, or Hedges, &amp;c.
(2) By the Statutes of the Realm, as 31 <hi>H. 8. 13. 45. Ed.</hi> 3. &amp;c.
(3) By Priviledge, as thoſe of St. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>England,</hi>
the <hi>Ciſtertains, Templers, &amp;c.</hi> as appears 10 <hi>H. 7. 277. Dyer.</hi> (4) By
Preſcription; as by <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> annual recompence in ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.
(5) By real Compoſition. By all which it appears, that
a man may be Diſcharged of payment of Tithes; yet a Lay-man
ought not to preſcribe <hi>in non Decimando,</hi> albeit the may <hi>in modo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimandi.</hi>
And this in effect agrees with <hi>Tho. Aquinas</hi> in his <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunda
Secundae, Quaeſt. 86. art. ult.</hi> vid. <hi>Dr. &amp; Stu. lib. 2. c. 55. fo.</hi> 164.
And the Cauſes why the Judges of the Common Law permit not
the Eccleſiaſtical Judges to try <hi>Modum Decimandi,</hi> being pleaded in
their Courts, is, becauſe that if the Recompence which is to be
given to the Parſon in ſatisfaction of his Tithes, doth not amount
to the value of this Tithes in kind, they might overthrow the ſame:
And that appears by <hi>Lindwood,</hi>

diſallowed. The whole Court agreed, that this <hi>Modus</hi> between him
and the Parſon, will not diſcharge him from payment of Tithes, as
to the Vicar; and therefore by the Rule of the Court a Conſultation
was granted. Alſo the Court was of Opinion, That where a Biſhop
holds Lands diſcharged of Tithes, and he makes a Feoffment of
the Land, the Feoffee ſhall be diſcharged of Tithes; and the like,
if the King hath ancient Foreſt Lands diſcharges of Tithes,<note place="margin">Mich. 9 Jac. C. B. Brownl. Rep. par. 1. <hi>Caſes in Law,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and
the King grants this Land, the Grantee is diſcharged of Tithes:
And it is a General Rule, That he which may have Tithes, may be
Diſcharged of Tithes. So long as the Land is occupied by him who
hath the Fee-ſimple, which did formerly belong to the Order of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtertians,</hi>
it ſhall pay no Tithes;<note place="margin">Brownl. ibid.</note> but if he lett it for years or life,
the Tenant ſhall pay Tithes. For anciently there were many large
Eſtates wholly exempted from paying Tithes, as Land belonging
to the ſaid <hi>Ciſtertian</hi> Monks to the <hi>Knights Templers,</hi> and Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallers:
As in the Earl of <hi>Clanrickard</hi>'s Caſe, who Libelled in the
Eccleſiaſtical Court for the Tithes of Hay of a certain Meadow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Dame <hi>Denton,</hi> who pleaded, That the Prior of <hi>A.</hi> was
ſeiſed of that Meadow as parcel of the Poſſeſſions of the Priory,
and that they held it diſcharged time out of mind, &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Iſſue was joyned upon a Prohibition, and it was found for
the Plaintiff; for that the Land was only diſcharged when it was
in the hands of the Priory, and not when it was in the hands of
their Farmers, and they were of the Order of <hi>Ciſtertians,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
a Conſultation was granted: And now a new Prohibition
was prayed, for that in the Eccleſiaſtical Court they had added to
the former Libel, when the Statute of 50 <hi>Ed. 3. cap.</hi> 4. is, <hi>That
whereas a Conſultation is duly granted upon a Prohibition, that the
ſame Judge may proceed in the ſame caſe by virtue of the former
Conſultation, notwithſtanding any other Prohibition.</hi> Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies,
that the matter in the Libel of the ſaid cauſe be not altered,
enlarged, or otherwiſe changed; Dr. <hi>Pope,</hi> Doctor of the Civil Law
ſaid, That there was not any enlarging or changing in ſubſtance of
the Libel in queſtion; for whereas in the former Libel it was, <hi>That
they had uſed to pay Tithes time out of mind,</hi> now in the ſecond Libel
is added, <hi>That although the Prior was diſcharged, yet they,</hi> viz. the Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
<hi>have paid Tithes for 20, 30 or 40 years, and time out of mind.
Montague</hi> Ch. Juſtice ſaid, That it ſeem'd that that was not an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
but <hi>Doderidge</hi> and <hi>Houghton</hi> Juſtices held, That that was an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of the Libel; for now by that laſt Libel, <hi>They could fetch
them in for Tithes, though they were diſcharged in the hands of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot:</hi>
and for that the Tithes had been paid for 20, 30 or 40 years ſince

charge the Land with Tithes in whoſe ſoever hands they are, when by
the Statute it ought to be diſcharged only in the hands of ſome, <hi>viz.</hi>
the Priors; and afterwards Dr. <hi>Pope</hi> pulled off the Addition, which
he had made to the former Libel, off from the ſecond Libel. And
the whole Court ſaid, That if he proceeded upon that Addition,

the poſſeſſions of the Hoſpital of St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> upon Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
that the Prior of the ſaid Diſſolved Houſe of St. <hi>Johns</hi> had
this Priviledge from <hi>Rome,</hi> which was by divers Councils and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons;
<hi>viz.</hi> That the Lands of their Predeceſſors, which by their
own hands and coſts they did Till, they were not obliged to pay
Tithes. In this Caſe it was agreed, That this Hoſpital was not
Diſſolved by the Statute of 31 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 18. of <hi>Diſſolutions,</hi> but by a
Special Act made 32 <hi>H. 8. c.</hi> 24. by which their Corporation and
Order was Diſſolved, and their Poſſeſſions given to the King, with
all the Priviledges and Immunities thereto belonging, which the

ſhould hold them Diſcharged of the payment of Tithes was the
queſtion. <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant urged, That this Immunity was annexed

and affirmed the Book of 10 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 277. 60. to be good Law;
and that the aforementioned Caſes of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>

32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 24. gives the King not only the Mannors, Houſes, &amp;c. but
alſo all Liberties, Franchiſes, Priviledges, &amp;c. In this Caſe it was
Confeſſed, that it came by reaſon of the Order of the <hi>Ceſtertians,</hi>
as appears by the Canon: And <hi>Hutton</hi> Serjeant arguing for the
Defendant, ſaid, that it appears by the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 4. that it
is Perſonal, and that it differs from the Lands which came to the
King by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For by that the King is Diſcharged
of payment of Tithes, and ſo are his Patentees; but that this Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge
is Perſonal, and if ſo, then it is determined by diſſolution of
the other, and a perſonal Priviledge in caſe of Tithe is not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to the King. <hi>Barker</hi> Serjeant for the Plaintiff in this caſe
ſaid, That it was Ordained by <hi>Edgar,</hi> King of this Realm, that
Tithes ſhall be given to the Mother-Church: Alſo <hi>Edmund, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelſtone,
William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror,</hi> and the Council of <hi>Magans,</hi> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
provided that Tithes ſhould be paid, but did not appoint
when they ſhould be paid. But the firſt Law which appointed the
quantity, was made in the time of <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and this Ordained when
they ought to pay the Tenth with the fear of God. And before
the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> every one might pay his Tithes to what
Parſon he would, and then were paid to Monaſteries as Oblations.
If a Parſon in one Pariſh claim Tithes in another, as portion of
Tithes due by Preſcription to his Rectory, he ought to ſhew the
place eſpecially, <hi>viz.</hi> the place where the Tithes lie. In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth
year of <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. the Order of the Templers was diſſolved,
and their Poſſeſſions annexed to St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> and they
did not claim by any Bull of the Pope, nor other Spiritual Canon,
but by Preſcription, which is Priviledge and private Common Law,
as appears by the Statute of <hi>Weſtm. 2. cap.</hi> 74. And <hi>Menham</hi>'s Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non

In the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s Caſe, 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> it was Reſolved,
That at the Common Law none had capacity to take Tithes but
Spiritual perſons,<note place="margin">Coke 2. The Biſh. of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi>'s Caſe. 38 Eliz. fo. 43.</note> or <hi>Perſona mixta,</hi> as the King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and regularly no
meer Lay-man was capable of them (except in ſpecial Caſes;) for
he could not Sue for them in the Court Chriſtian; and regularly a
Lay-man had no remedy for them until the 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. A Lay-man
may be Diſcharged of Tithes at the Common Law by Grant, or
by Compoſition, but not by Preſcription; for in the Books of the
Common Law it is commonly ſaid, That a Law-man may Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
<hi>In Modo Decimandi,</hi> but not <hi>In non Decimando:</hi> And the
reaſon is, becauſe he is not (except in Special Caſes) capable of
Tithes at the Common Law, before the Statute of 32 <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 7.
And therefore without Special matter ſhewed, it ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
that he hath any lawful Diſcharge, and in favour of the
Holy Church (although it may have a lawful Commencement)
the Law will not ſuffer this Preſcription, <hi>In non Decimando,</hi> to put
it to the Trial of Lay-men. A Spiritual perſon that was capable
of Tithes at the Common Law in Pernancy, may Preſcribe to be
Diſcharged of Tithes generally, or to have a portion of Tithes in
the Land of another. Before the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> every
man might give his Tithes to any Spiritual perſon that he would;
and if the Lands of the Biſhop were Diſcharged in his hands
abſolutely by Preſcription, the Demiſing it to a Lay-man cannot
make it chargeable, and the Biſhop might reſerve the greater Rent.</p>

a Prohibition would not lie in that caſe: for that <hi>De Molendino de novo

But in the other Caſe of the Fulling-Mill aforeſaid, where the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
Libelled in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for the Tithes thereof, and
ſuggeſting, that the <hi>Miller</hi> Fulled every week 40 Clothes, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid,
and gained two ſhillings of every Cloth, demanded Tithes
for them: A Prohibition was granted in that caſe; for it was ſaid
by the Juſtices, That by the Law of the Land he ought not to pay

time out of mind, &amp;c. for which 6 <hi>s. 8 d.</hi> have been paid for the
Tithes time out of mind, &amp;c. and after in continuance of time the
Mill-Stream doth change his courſe, and goes another way at a little
diſtance from the ancient Stream, and thereupon the Owner of the
Mills pulls down one of the ancient Mills, and new builds it in that
other place where the Stream now runs: In this caſe it ſhall be
diſcharged of any Tithes by force of the ancient <hi>Modus,</hi> for that
happened by the act of God, and not by the act of the party;
and Prohibition was granted accordingly, <hi>Mich. 11 Car.</hi> B. R.
<hi>Johnſon</hi> and <hi>Dawbridge</hi>'s Caſe, Reſolved <hi>Per Curiam.</hi> But withal
the Court held, that if the Stream had been altered by the Owner,
Tithes ought to have been paid as of a new Mill. In another Caſe
it being Libelled in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for Tithes of a Griſt-Mill
and of a Fulling-Mill, <hi>Crook</hi> agreed, That for a Griſt-Mill
Tithes ſhall be paid; but he ſaid, That the Statute <hi>De Articulis
Cleri,</hi> which ſpeaks <hi>de Molendinis non fiat Prohibitio,</hi> ought not to
be meant or intended of a Fulling-Mill, for the profit that accrues
by that, is by the Labour of men, and therefore not intended within
the general words of the Statute <hi>De Molendinis,</hi> for which reaſon
he prayed a Prohibition. <hi>Calthroppe</hi> ſaid, that it was the opinion
of Juſtice <hi>Warburton</hi> and <hi>Nicholls, 12 Jac.</hi> That Tithes ſhall be
paid of Fulling-Mills, <hi>viz.</hi> the Tenth-peny of the gain or profit;
but of Griſt-Mills the Tenth-diſh of Corn ſhall be paid, for that is
in the nature of a Predial Tithe: And ſo it was held 5 <hi>Jac.</hi> in the
Caſe between <hi>Vbi</hi> and <hi>Lux, Vid. Lindw. Provin. Conſtit.</hi> But yet
<hi>Doderidge</hi> held, That if there be not a Special Cuſtome alledged
for the payment of Tithes of a Fulling-Mill, Tithes ſhall not be
paid thereof; for he had ſpoken (as he ſaid) with the <hi>Civilians,</hi> who
held that Tithes ſhould be paid of ſuch a <hi>Mill;</hi> but they could not
agree what manner of Tithe it is, for ſome ſaid it is a Predial
Tithe, Others, that it is a Perſonal Tithe; but he ſaid it could not
be a Predial Tithe, for it wholly accrues by the Labour of man; and
if ſo be that he ſhould have that Tithe as a Predial Tithe,
then another Tithe would be demanded of him who Sheers
the Cloth, and alſo of the Dyer thereof, and ſo Tithes ſhould
be paid many times for the ſame Cloth: But the Uſage or Cuſtome
of the Countrey is to be conſidered. And for Tin-Mills, or
Lead-Mills, or Plate-Mills, Ragg-Mills, or Edge-Paper-Mills,
no Tithes ſhall be paid; and to this agreed <hi>Doderidge, Houghton,</hi>
and <hi>Croke:</hi> And therefore as to the Griſt-<hi>Mill,</hi> a Conſultation was
granted, and as to the Fulling-<hi>Mill,</hi> there was a Prohibition. <hi>Paſch.</hi>

Alſo in another Caſe where it was moved for a Prohibition, upon a

This <hi>Modus</hi> cannot go to this new <hi>Mill;</hi> for an ancient <hi>Mill</hi> your
<hi>Modus</hi> ſhall be allowed, but not for the <hi>Mill</hi> newly erected, the

Tenth of the Fruit ſhall be ſet out and delivered, when they are
newly gathered; for the omiſſion whereof, if loſs come to the

If a man pay Tithes for the Fruit of Trees, and after cut down the

The manner of right Tithing is regularly thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Tithes</hi>

to the Uſage and Cuſtome of the place, where they are paid:
And of Predial <hi>Tithes,</hi> the Tenth is to be ſet apart from the Nine
parts in the place where they grow, before the ſaid Nine parts are
carried away; which Separation from the Nine parts is to be
done in preſence of the Parſons Servant, upon ſeaſonable Notice

it was urged in ſtay of Judgment, that he ought to have brought
ſeveral Actions, being grounded upon ſeveral Leaſes, as his Title is
ſeveral. But it was Reſolved, That the Action was well brought,

happened that the Vicar died before the <hi>Tithe</hi> was ſevered, and his
Executors did cut and carry away the Corn; and he that had the
Parſonage appropriate brought the Action: The Counſel of the
Defendant prayed the Opinion of the Court, whether he might
plead <hi>Nihil debet:</hi> But the Court refuſed to deliver their Opinion
in it, becauſe it hanged in Suit before them<note n="u" place="margin">Tr. 15 Jac. B. R. <hi>Horne</hi> &amp; <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Caſe. Hob. 387.</note>. In the Caſe of

pretending that neither the Vendor, becauſe he did not
carry them away; nor the Vendee, becauſe he had no property in

                     <hi>Wool</hi> of Sheep is Tithable proportionably to the time they are in

Laws were made againſt Adultery, according to the ſeveral qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
and conditions of the Perſons offending reſpectively; beſide
Excommunication againſt all ſuch; if the Adulterer were an Alien, he
was to depart the Land, and to take his Sins and his Eſtate away
with him: If a Soldier, then to be fin'd five pounds: If a Ruſtick
or Countrey Husbandman (known in the Law by [<hi>Paganus</hi>])

Strangling to dead Corps, which being after burnt, the Adulterer

(5.) In the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of <hi>Keneth</hi> King of <hi>Scots, an.</hi>
840. By the 14<hi>th.</hi> and 15. <hi>Canon</hi> thereof it is ordained, That he
who deflowrs a Virgin, ſhall dye for it, unleſs ſhe deſires him for
her Husband; and that he who Adulterates another mans Wife not
diſſenting, Both ſhall ſuffer the ſevereſt puniſhment, unleſs ſhe
were under a force, in which caſe ſhe ſhall be acquitted. By the
Eccleſiaſtical Laws of <hi>Hoel Dak</hi> King of <hi>Wales, an.</hi> 940. it was a
ſufficient cauſe of Divorce, if a Woman did but kiſs any other man
than her Husband. <hi>l.</hi> 18. Yea ſhe muſt loſe her Dower and all her
Rights by that Law, and only for a kiſs; and by the ſame Law
Adultery in the Man was held as a kind of Hoſtility. In the time
of the latter <hi>Saxons</hi> by the Eccleſiaſtical Laws of King <hi>Edmund, an.</hi>
944. Adulterers and Murderers had one and the ſame puniſhment, and
both alike denied Chriſtian Burial. After him, by the Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical
Laws of King <hi>Knute, an.</hi> 1032. Adulterers and ſuch as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the Chaſtity of a Widow or a Virgin, were to be baniſhed

Real as well as Perſonal, and ſhe to have her Noſe and Ears
cut off, and an indelible Blot with perpetual Infamy to remain
upon her Family.</p>
               <p>(6.) The <hi>Arabians</hi> (as <hi>Strabo</hi> relates) though they uſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous
Copulation with Siſter and Mother, yet puniſhed Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
with death; but that only was Adultery in their account,
which was out of the ſame Linage or Kindred, for otherwiſe All
of the ſame Blood to uſe the ſame Woman, was but their (<hi>Ince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuous</hi>)
Honeſty. And by the very <hi>Alchoran</hi> not only is an unchaſt
Look on another mans Wife forbiden, but alſo if a Wife be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed
of Adultery by the teſtimony of four Women, ſhe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd
to perpetual Impriſonment in her own houſe till ſhe dyes, and
none ſuffered to come at her: And in ſome parts of the Grand
Signiors Territories the Turks have a cuſtom to thruſt the Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
head into a Dung-Wallet of the Panch of a Beaſt new killed,
and ſo to carry him through the Streets; but for a Chriſtian to have
Carnal knowledg of any of their women, is death, unleſs he

(as aforeſaid) an unlawful acceſs <hi>ad alterius thorum,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it properly refers to one or both ſuch as is or are in a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial
State, yet by abuſe of words it is alſo commonly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
of corrupting or violating the Chaſtity of a Virgin or a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;
as when we uſually ſay, ſuch or ſuch natural things are
adulterated, when by reaſon of ſome Artifice they are corrupted
and become not truly natural; and ſuch Wares and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
are adulterated, when there is ſome Fraud in the caſe, and
ſo Adultery is repugnant to the very Nature of Matrimony,
which of Two makes One, when as the other of One makes
Two: The puniſhment whereof was anciently by the Civil Law,
Capital as to the Man: But by the latter Laws of the Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
the Women are firſt whipt, then thruſt into Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
and by the Canon Law it is Excommunication.</p>
               <p>(9.) <hi>Plato</hi> made a Law, that whoever kill'd an Adulterer,
ſhould go unpuniſhed. The Inhabitants of <hi>Arabia Foelix</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it with death. <hi>Seleucus,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Nicanor,</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi>
that ſucceeded <hi>Alexander</hi> in the Government of that part of the
Empire, decreed that whoever was apprehended in Adultery
ſhould be exoculated, or have his eyes pluck'd out, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
happened to be impartially firſt executed on his own
Son<note n="o" place="margin">AElianus.</note>. And albeit according to the proper Conſtruction of words
there is a difference put between <hi>Adulterium</hi> and <hi>Stuprum,</hi> the
former referring to perſons married, the other to Widows or
Virgins. <hi>Modeſtin. in l. inter Stuprum ff. de verb. Sig.</hi> Yet by
the <hi>Julian</hi> Law the word [Adultery] is uſed indifferently in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to both: <hi>Id. Modeſt. in L. Stuprum. Ad L. Jul. de A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult.</hi>
But to ſpeak properly, they are not <hi>Termini convertibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
for though all Adultery be Whoredome, yet every Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
is not Adultery; each of which have their reſpective pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
according to the Laws and Cuſtoms of the place where
they are committed. <hi>Grotius</hi> out of <hi>Leſſius</hi> affirms, that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterer
and Adultereſs are not only obliged to indemnifie the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
party as to all charges of Alimentation of the unlawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten,
but alſo to make good what dammage the Legitimate
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:95379:284"/>
Children may thereby ſuffer in their Inheritance, and whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
doth leſſen the Reputation of a Virgin either by force or
inſinuations, ſhall refund to her as much as ſhe is thereby fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
in value, upon the hopes or expectation of her Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in Marriage: But if by his Sollicitations he hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the uſe of her body under a promiſe of Marriage, he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to marry her accordingly. <hi>Grot. de jur. bel.</hi> lib. 2. cap.

               <p>(10.) Although this Sin of Adultery, is properly and of
right belonging to the Cognizance of the Eccleſiaſtical Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
yet it will not be denied, but that as it is an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
againſt the peace of the Realm (for which reaſon ſome are
of opinion that <hi>Avoutry</hi> or <hi>Bandry</hi> is an offence Temporal as
well as Spiritual) the Juſtices of the Peace may out of their
Seſſions require Surety for the good Behaviour of ſuch as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
therein, as alſo of ſuch as by Common Fame are reputed
Reſorters to houſes ſuſpected of maintaining Adultery or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency,
of ſuch as keep ſuch houſes, of lewd Women found
in ſuch houſes, of common Whoremongers and common Whores;

               <p>(12.) There are of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hold that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery
<hi>in conjugato cum ſoluta</hi> is <hi>minus peccatum quam in conjugata
cum ſoluto;</hi> the reaſon they give for it is, for that it is far more
repugnant to the Law of Nature that one Woman ſhould be
joyned to two Men, than <hi>e contra,</hi> and ſuppoſe that Bigamy in
the Patriarchs of old is an impregnable Fortification of that
Reaſon; the Feminine Sex will give them but little thanks for this
Opinion: But leaving them to enjoy the one and the other, we
hold that This, as to the Inquiry and Puniſhment thereof, is
properly within the Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance, it being moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant
to Reaſon, that in what Jurisdiction Matrimonial Cauſes
are controvertible, in the ſame ſhould the Violation of Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
Rights be diſcuſſed; to which end, as well the Civil as
Canon Law (though that eſpecially) are furniſh'd with great
variety of Conſtitutions, to obviate all manner of circumſtances
relating to this Subject. Paſch. 8. car. B. R. Caſe <hi>Matingly</hi> verſ.

being <hi>quaſi Acceſſio ad alterius thorum,</hi> is the violation of anothers
Bed; whence it is required, that either both, or one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
be under the Matrimonial Vow; for that conjugal circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
either in the Male or Female, is as the <hi>cauſa ſine qua non,</hi>
that the luxurious Act falls under the notion of <hi>Adultery,</hi> in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
from acts of the ſame kind under other circumſtances: For
the Law holds, that it may be committed in a threefold manner,

(5.) The Law hath given ſeveral Appellations for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
of Baſtards according to the different conditions of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of whom they were begotten; As when they were begotten by
perſons of a ſingle and unmarried Eſtate, and of ſuch as were kept
as Concubines, the <hi>Civil</hi> Law called them <hi>Filii Naturales:</hi> if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
of ſingle Women, not deſign'd for Concubines, for ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of preſent Luſt, then they were called <hi>Spurii:</hi> if begotten
of ſuch as the Law ſtyles <hi>Scorta,</hi> or common Harlots by publick pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
than they were called <hi>Manzeres:</hi> if begotten of Married
Women, then they were called <hi>Nothi:</hi> if begotten between Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and Deſcendents, or between Collaterals contrary to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
prohibition, then they are called <hi>Inceſtuoſi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>(6.) <hi>Baſtardy</hi> ſo ſtains the Blood, that the Baſtard can challenge
neither Honour nor Arms; and ſo diſables him, that he cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to any ſucceſſion to inheritance. The Temporal and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Laws with us do not differ as to matter of <hi>Baſtardy,</hi> but
ſomething as to the proſecution thereof: The Eccleſiaſtical Law
brings it two ways to Judgment, <hi>Incidently</hi> and <hi>Principally;</hi> the
Common Law makes two ſorts thereof, <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Special. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently</hi>
at the Eccleſiaſtical Law, when it is pleaded in Bar to a claim
of ſomething in right of Nativity: <hi>Principally,</hi> when by reaſon of
ſome ſlanderous and reproachful ſpeeches, it is brought before the
Court as the principal matter in Judgment to be alledged and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that thereupon Sentence may be pronounced accordingly by
the Eccleſiaſtical Judge, <hi>Ad Curiam enim Regiam non pertinet ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcere

                  <note n="r" place="margin">Glanvil. lib. 3. cap. 13.</note>. <hi>General Baſtardy</hi> at Common Law, is
ſo called becauſe it is in groſs objected in Barr againſt a Man to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint
him in the Principal matter of his Suit. Which, becauſe
it is of Eccleſiaſtical Cognizance, is ſent by the Kings Writ to the
Ordinary, to enquire whether the Party charged with Baſtardy were
born in, or out of Lawful Matrimony; And as the Ordinary finds
the truth of the matter upon due examination, ſo he pronounceth
accordingly in his Conſiſtory, whereof he returns Certificate to the
Temporal Courts<note n="s" place="margin">Ridley. ubi ſupra.</note>. <hi>Special Baſtardy</hi> at the Common Law,
ſeems to be only that, where the Matrimony is confeſt, but the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority
or Poſteriority of the Nativity of him, whoſe Birth is in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
is controverted<note n="t" place="margin">ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>General Baſtardy ought to be Tryed by the Biſhop, and not by
the Country<note n="l" place="margin">18 E. 3. 40.</note>. But Baſtardy in this ſenſe cannot be tryed by the

                  </note>. When Iſſue is
joyn'd on Baſtardy, before it be awarded to the Ordinary to Try it,
Proclamation thereof is made in the ſame Court, and after Iſſue it
is certified into <hi>Chancery,</hi> where Proclamation is made once a

may appear and make their Allegations before the Ordinary
<note n="n" place="margin">10 H. 6. cap. 11.</note>; whoſe Certificate of <hi>Baſtardy</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe, unleſs
it come in by Proceſs at the Suit of the Parties<note n="o" place="margin">7 H. 6. 32. b.</note>. And this Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardy
ought to be certified under the Seal of the Ordinary, for it
is not ſufficient to certifie it under the Seal of the Commiſſary<note n="p" place="margin">20 H. 6. 1.</note>.
And although the Defendant be certified a Baſtard by the <hi>Ordinary,</hi>
yet the Certificate ſhall loſe its force, if the Plaintiff be afterwards

               <p>In the Caſe of <hi>Elborough</hi> againſt <hi>Allen,</hi> it was ſaid by <hi>Crook,</hi> that
for calling one <hi>Baſtard</hi> generally, there is not any ſufficient Ground
of Action at the Common Law, but if there be any ſpecial Loſs
thereby, it ſhall be a good ground of Action at the Comon Law,
as if a Man be upon Marriage, or in treaty for the ſale of Land,
whereby his Title is diſparaged. <hi>Doderidge</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That the
word <hi>Baſtard</hi> is generally of another Juriſdiction and belongs to
the Eccleſiaſtical Court to determine what ſhall be Baſtardy, and
their Judgement is given for the damage, which the party had in
his birth, and for that their Entry is <hi>quia laeſis eſt natalitiis.</hi> And
in this Caſe the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi> ſaid, that generally to ſay <hi>J. S.</hi> is a
<hi>Baſtard, J. S.</hi> hath not cauſe of Action given him thereby; but if
there be a Temporal cauſe averr'd, the Common Law may proceed
therein; for though Originally <hi>Baſtardy</hi> be of the Eccleſiaſtical Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
not Triable at the Common Law; and therefore as in
its general nature it is of the Spiritual Juriſdiction, ſo being by its
generality no ground of Action at the Common Law, yet if one be
to ſue for a <hi>Childs part,</hi> or ſue for the Adminiſtration of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Goods, and this be ſet forth in the Declaration, it will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
an Action at Common Law. <hi>Doderidge</hi> Juſtice ſaid, That to
ſay generally that one called him <hi>Baſtard,</hi> is not ground of Action,
if he doth not ſhew ſome ſpecial Loſs thereby, as when a Woman
brings her Action, and ſays that ſhe was in Treaty of Marriage, and
that the Defendant called her <hi>Whore,</hi> this will not maintain an
Action unleſs ſhe ſay withall, that by reaſon of theſe words ſhe
loſt her preferment; but <hi>Chamberlain</hi> Juſtice ſaid, to call a Woman
<hi>Whore</hi> is at this day a ſufficient cauſe of Action for her, for that it is
puniſhable by the Statute; he alſo further ſaid, that if a Man Libel
in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, that he hath Lands by deſcent, and that
<hi>J. S.</hi> call'd him <hi>Baſtard,</hi> they may not proceed there; or if they
do, a Prohibition lies, He further ſaid, that for calling a Man <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard</hi>
generally, without ſpecial Loſs alledged, Action ſhall be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
and Cited a Caſe in 6 <hi>Eliz. Dyer.</hi> Where a Man recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <p>(7.) By the Civil Law ſuch as were born in the beginning of

were to be accounted legitimate, but ſuch as were born in the

there relates a matter of Fact contrary to this Law, and gives us
an inſtance of a Widow in <hi>Paris,</hi> who was delivered of a Child the
fourteenth Month after her Husbands death, yet the good repute
of this Womans continency prevailed ſo much againſt the Letter of
the Law, that the Court Judg'd the cauſes of Child-birth to be
ſometimes extraordinary, the Woman to be chaſt, and the Child
Legitimate. <hi>Hoc tamen in exemplum trahi facile non oportet,</hi> as the
Gloſs there concludes.</p>
               <p>(8.) By the Common Law, if a Child be born but an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the ſolemnization of Marriage, it ſhall be the Husbands, though
it were begotten by another Man, who was not the Mothers Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and may be the Heir of him who Married the Mother but a
Day before the Birth of ſuch Child<note n="u" place="margin">Term of Law. Verb. Baſtardy.</note> for in that Caſe he is not
reputed a <hi>Baſtard,</hi> who cannot inherit Land as Heir to his Father,
nor can any perſon inherit Land as Heir to him, but one who is
Heir of his Body<note n="x" place="margin">Littl. Sect. 401. Fitz. B. 20.</note>. Otherwiſe it is in caſe the Child were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by him who after the Birth of the Child doth Marry his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
For in that Caſe notwithſtanding ſuch Marriage ſubſequent
to the Birth, the Child is reputed a Baſtard in the judgment of the
Common Law, as being born out of Wedlock, though according
to the Eccleſiaſtical Law the Child in that caſe is reputed as Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
<note n="y" place="margin">St. 20. H. 3. 9. and 1 H. 6. 3. Co. on Lit. 244.</note>. But if one Marry a Woman, and dye before Night,
without ever bedding her, and ſhe after happen to have a Child,
within poſſibility of conception in reſpect of time computable from
ſuch Marriage,<note place="margin">Quia ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monium tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir culpam praeceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note> it ſeems it ſhall be accounted his Child, and Legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<note n="z" place="margin">Vid. Engl. Lawyer. 117.</note>.</p>
               <p>(9.) If a Child be born within the tenth Month (computing
thirty days to the Month) next after a Mans death, it ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
his Child as a <hi>Mulier;</hi> but the moſt natural time is nine Months
and ten days (computing twenty eight days to the Month) which

<note n="a" place="margin">Co. ſup. Litt. 123. <hi>Arſop</hi>'s Caſe. M. 17. Jac. B. R.</note>. Alſo the Children begotten under a ſecond Marriage

exhibited in his Eccleſiaſtical Court touching that matter, of his own

years after the death of the ſaid <hi>G. B.</hi> took the depoſitions of many

points were reſolved (1.) That although all Matrimonial cauſes

(3.) As the Eccleſiaſtical Judge may not enquire of Baſtardy or Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimation

(4.) Laſtly, it was ſaid, that the very cauſe and reaſon
why the Eccleſiaſtical Judge may not enquire of Legitimation or
Baſtardy, before that he hath received direction, or a mandate out
of the Kings Temporal Court, doth conſiſt in this, that the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical

Temporal Inheritance, directly or indirectly; It being obſerved

               <p>(1.) A <hi>Divorce</hi> is a Sententence pronounced by an Eccleſiaſtical
Judge, whereby a Man and Woman formerly Married
to each other, are ſeparated and parted<note n="a" place="margin">Co. par. 7. Kerah's Caſe.</note>. The
word <hi>Divortium</hi> or <hi>Repudium</hi> is often taken promiſcuouſly, both
for a Total and Perpetual Divorce, <hi>&amp; à vinculo Matrimonii;</hi> as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
for a Partial and Temporal Divorce, or Separation <hi>à Cohabita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione,
vel à thoro &amp; menſa.</hi> The cauſes of this Divorce, whereof
ſome are precedent, others ſubſequent to the Marriage, are many in
the Law; <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> reckons up no leſs than a dozen of them,
and thinks he hath Poetically compriz'd them all in four Verſes,
<hi>viz.</hi>

practicable, may be reduced to theſe few. (1.) The <hi>Levitical
Degrees</hi> within which it is prohibited to Marry. (2.) <hi>Precontract;</hi>
And ſo if a Man Marry one precontracted, and have Iſſue by her,
it is the Fathers Child until there be a <hi>Divorce</hi> upon the precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and then it is <hi>Nullius Filius,</hi> a Baſtard<note n="c" place="margin">Co. par. 6. 66. and Dyer. 105.</note>. (3.) <hi>Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty</hi>
or <hi>Minority;</hi> And ſo if two be Married <hi>infra annos nubiles,</hi>
and after full age are Divorced for the ſame, the Woman may
bring an Aſſize againſt the Man for Land given her in Frank-marriage
<note n="d" place="margin">Lib. Aſſ. 19. An. pla. 2.</note> which proves that the <hi>Divorce</hi> is by that Law from
the very Bond of Matrimony (4.) <hi>Frigidity</hi> in the Man, or <hi>Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency</hi>
in the Woman, termed <hi>Arctitudo</hi> in the Law; but the word
[<hi>Impotency</hi>] is promiſcuouſly uſed in both Sexes, for it is ſaid,
that if after a Man be <hi>Divorced</hi> for <hi>Impotency,</hi> he take another Wife
and have Children by her, theſe ſhall not be <hi>Baſtards,</hi> becauſe a
Man may be <hi>habilis &amp; inhabilis diverſis temporibus</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Co. par. 5. 93. and Dyer. fo. 178.</note>. But in
this Caſe the <hi>Civil</hi> Law hath made other proviſion, for that Law
<hi>in cauſa Frigiditatis</hi> requires three years Cohibitation for Trial of
the <hi>Diſability</hi> before it doth upon other legal evidence and proof
conclude any Married perſons either <hi>Frigid</hi> or <hi>Impotent;</hi> Indeed
the <hi>Canon</hi> Law expects preſent proof, and in caſe of ſuch <hi>Impotency</hi>
or <hi>Frigidity,</hi> not <hi>Accidental</hi> but <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Incurable,</hi> concludes
that the <hi>Matrimony</hi> was never a <hi>Matrimony.</hi> The evidence of
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:95379:294"/>
which <hi>Diſability</hi> depends on the Oaths of able <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> as alſo
of aged and grave <hi>Matrons</hi> experienced in ſuch affairs; nor is it
to be alledged till after a <hi>Triennial</hi> experience of each other <hi>poſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonium
Conſummatum;</hi> and is a juſt cauſe of <hi>Divorce,</hi> for that it
fruſtrates one of the chief ends of Marriage, <hi>viz. Procreation</hi> of
<hi>Iſſue,</hi> if it be ſufficiently proved by <hi>Inſpection</hi> of the Body, <hi>Trien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi>

               <p>(2.) There are alſo other ſeeming cauſes of <hi>Divorce</hi> than what
are forementtoned; for the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> Law do allow of
<hi>Divorce</hi> after a <hi>long abſence,</hi> but are not agreed touching the <hi>Time</hi>
of that <hi>Abſence;</hi> for in one place it is after <hi>Two</hi> years <hi>Abſence,</hi> in
another after <hi>Three</hi> years; in another after <hi>Four. Cod. lib. 5. tit.</hi>
1. <hi>l. 2. poſt biennium. tit. 27. poſt tres an. l. 27. poſt Quatuor an.</hi>
others hold that the <hi>Civil</hi> Law requires <hi>Five</hi> years <hi>Abſence</hi> before
there may be a <hi>Divorce</hi> on that account. In the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi>
a Sentence was allowed by the whole <hi>Council,</hi> which was given by
a Biſhop, pronouncing a <hi>Divorce</hi> for a Woman, complaining that
her Husband had been abſent <hi>Ten</hi> years, giving alſo leave to the
Woman to <hi>Marry again. In Concil. later. par. 50. cap.</hi> 23. But the
truth is, no abſence, be it for any time whatever, doth properly
cauſe a <hi>Divorce</hi> in Law; Indeed <hi>Seven</hi> years <hi>Abſence</hi> without any
tidings or intelligence of or from the <hi>Abſent</hi> Party, will ſo far
operate in Law towards what is equivalent to a <hi>Divorce,</hi> as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnifie
the Woman from the penalty of <hi>Polygamy,</hi> if in that caſe
ſhe <hi>Marry again.</hi> Alſo the <hi>Canon</hi> Law hath decreed, that if the Wife
refuſe to dwell with her <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Husband, he may lawfully leave
her. <hi>Cauſa 28. q. 1. c.</hi> 4. And ſome of the <hi>Imperial</hi> Laws allow
Homicide, Sacriledge, Theft, Man-ſtealing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for cauſes of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce,
Cod. lib. 5. tit. 17. l.</hi> 8. But the <hi>Canon</hi> Law decrees other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
In the time of <hi>Ed. 1. William de Chadworth</hi> was <hi>Divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,</hi>

               <p>(3.) This matter of <hi>Divorce</hi> hath often miniſtred occaſion for high
debates and altercations touching <hi>ſecond</hi> Marriages, As whether a
<hi>Divorce</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Adultery</hi> in either of the Married Parties,
doth ſo diſſolve the Marriage <hi>à vinculo,</hi> as that it may be
lawful for the <hi>Innocent</hi> Party to <hi>Marry again</hi> during the others
life? By the 107<hi>th Canon,</hi> It is provided, that in all Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
for <hi>Divorce</hi> ſecurity be given and Bonds taken for not Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
during each others life<note n="a" place="margin">Canons Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. Edit. 1603.</note>. By enjoyning ſuch ſecurity to
be given, and ſuch Bonds to be taken, This ſeems to be a <hi>Penal</hi>
Canon, <hi>viz.</hi> pecuniarily Penal; whoever therefore breaks the Law
incurrs the <hi>penalty,</hi> and whoever ſuffers the <hi>penalty</hi> doth anſwer
and ſatisfie the <hi>Law</hi> which before he had <hi>infring'd;</hi> a <hi>penalty</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

<pb n="497" facs="tcp:95379:295"/>
Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Divorces;</hi> where he ſays
that <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 9. and <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 6. are two places of ſuch <hi>perſpicuity</hi>
(one <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Divorce</hi> allowed the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that great <hi>Breach</hi> of
the <hi>Conjugal Vow,</hi> and <hi>whoſoever Divorces and Marries again,</hi>
ſave in that <hi>one</hi> Caſe punctually named, <hi>committeth Adultery</hi>) that
as no <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> can make them more <hi>Intelligible:</hi> So there is but
one <hi>Queſtion</hi> that can reaſonably be ſtarted in them, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether
he that <hi>puts away his Wife</hi> on this one <hi>authentick cauſe,</hi> be ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
freed from the <hi>Conjugal Vow</hi> and <hi>Bands,</hi> that he may <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
Marry</hi> ſome other <hi>Woman,</hi> and ſome <hi>other Man Marry that
Divorced Adulterers Wife?</hi> In <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 9. The words are, That
<hi>whoſoever ſhall put away his Wife, ſave for fornication, and ſhall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
another, committeth Adultery; and he that ſhall Marry her that
is put away, committeth Adultery:</hi> Which words (ſays that
learned Author in <hi>Sect.</hi> 22.) are favourable to the affirmative, that
it is <hi>Lawful</hi> for him in that one excepted Caſe to <hi>Marry again.</hi>
The nature of a <hi>Divorce</hi> among the <hi>Jews</hi> was the <hi>reſcinding</hi> of
the <hi>Conjugal Bands,</hi> and by one ſuppoſition common to <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Romans,</hi> viz. That they who were <hi>duly Divorced</hi> might <hi>Marry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:</hi>
So of the <hi>Jewiſh Divorced Wife, Deut.</hi> 24. 2. 'tis expreſly
ſaid, ſhe <hi>may Marry another;</hi> and of the <hi>Man,</hi> this was his only
<hi>End</hi> of <hi>putting away his Wife</hi> in that place, that he <hi>might Marry
another:</hi> Accordingly the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Divorce</hi> in <hi>Misna,</hi> tit. <hi>Gittin,
Behold, thou art free,</hi> or <hi>at liberty for any Man, and this is the Bill
of Divorce between me and thee, ſo that it is free for thee to Marry
to any Man thou wilt. Idem. Sect.</hi> 27. yet on the other ſide (ſays
that learned Author) it may be argued, that although in the
<hi>Moſaical</hi> Law, <hi>Divorce</hi> was the <hi>reſcinding</hi> the <hi>Conjugal Bands,</hi> to
which it was conſequent, as long as the <hi>Jewiſh polity</hi> laſted, that
they who were <hi>duly Divorced</hi> (as in the one <hi>Caſe</hi> of <hi>Fornication</hi>)
might freely <hi>Marry</hi> again: yet in the acceptation of our <hi>Chriſtian
Courts, Divorce</hi> appears not to be any more than the ſolemn <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial
ſeparation</hi> from <hi>Conjugal Society,</hi> as that it ſeems to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>freeing</hi> the Husband and Wife from the <hi>Obligation</hi> to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
conjugal duties, than the utter <hi>reſcinding</hi> and <hi>diſſolving</hi> the
<hi>Bands.</hi> For if it were ſo, then that Husband and Wife could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
come together again without a <hi>new Wedlock,</hi> which was never
heard of in the Church; that <hi>Adultery,</hi> the efficient cauſe of <hi>Divorce</hi>
(though a breach of the <hi>Conjugal Vow</hi>) is yet no <hi>actual diſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lution</hi>
of the <hi>Conjugal Bands,</hi> among us <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> ſeems probable (ſays
Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi>) by theſe two evidences (1.) Becauſe <hi>Adultery</hi>
committed by the <hi>Husband,</hi> diſſolves not <hi>Marriage,</hi> which yet it
equally ſhould, if that <hi>fault</hi> committed, and not the <hi>Sentence</hi> of
<hi>Divorce</hi> reſcinded the <hi>Conjugal Band,</hi> &amp;c. In this a difference is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:95379:296"/>
between <hi>us</hi> and the <hi>Jews;</hi> for in caſe of <hi>Fornication,</hi>
the <hi>Jew</hi> expected no <hi>Sentence</hi> of the <hi>Conſiſtory,</hi> but the Man
might put her away, give her from <hi>himſelf</hi> a Bill of <hi>Divorce,</hi>
which was never allowed or practiſed among <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> 2. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
if this were ſo, if <hi>Adultery</hi> in the Wife <hi>diſſolved the bands,</hi>
then the <hi>Husband,</hi> that after the <hi>Wifes Adultery</hi> continued to live with
her <hi>Conjugally,</hi> muſt be concluded to commit <hi>Fornication</hi> with her,
the <hi>validity</hi> of the <hi>bands</hi> being it (and nothing elſe) which makes
Conjugal Society <hi>Lawful.</hi> Accordingly hath the Opinion of the
Church been anciently, as in <hi>Can. Apoſt. 48. If any Laick put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
his Wife and Marry another, or Marry a Woman which hath been
put away by another, let him be Excommunicate.</hi> So likewiſe at the
Council of <hi>Arles, An. 314. Can. 10. De his qui Conjuges ſuas in
adulterio deprehendunt, &amp; iidem ſunt Adoleſcentes Fideles, &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibentur

And what hath thus been defined by theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently

Conſtit. Eccl. An.</hi> 1597. upon theſe Arguments <hi>pro &amp; con,</hi> Doctor
<hi>Hammond</hi> in the forecited place doth conceive, that the Reſolution
may be made by theſe three propoſitions: (1.) That by the force

any kind of <hi>Divorce,</hi> but that one for <hi>Fornication,</hi> doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> of Divorces, <hi>fol.</hi> 452, 453. it may be probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that in that one caſe of <hi>Divorce</hi> for <hi>Fornication,</hi> the Marriage
of the <hi>Innocent</hi> party ſhall not be <hi>Adulterous.</hi> (3.) That although
this be granted, yet the words of St. <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> eſpecially
the words of St. <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 39. do give ſuch <hi>prejudices</hi> againſt
<hi>Marriages</hi> after <hi>Divorce</hi> indefinitely, that the <hi>ancient Canons</hi> of the

thought fit not to permit ſuch <hi>liberty</hi> in any kind, and therefore

the one of them not knowing the other to be Living within that

<hi>Alimony. Barkley</hi> and <hi>Henden</hi> moved for a prohibition. The Suit
is originally <hi>Cauſa ſaevitiae,</hi> and as a Caſe wherein they Aſſeſs <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
And now for a ground of a prohibition, it was ſaid that the
Husband chaſtiſed his Wife for a reaſonable cauſe, as by the Law of
the Land he might; which they denied, and ſaid, that they had
Juriſdiction in theſe matters <hi>de ſaevitia,</hi> &amp;c. And afterwards that the
Wife departed, and that they were reconciled again. And then
that reconciliation took away that <hi>Saeviti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> before, as reconciliation
after <hi>Elopement. Richardſon,</hi> it was ſaid here, that the Suit was
without Libel, but that is no ground of a prohibition, for ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
upon that matter reduced in Articles, and we cannot grant
a Prohibition if they proceed in their <hi>Form;</hi> For we are not Judges
of their <hi>Form.</hi> But if they will deny a <hi>Copy</hi> of the <hi>Libel,</hi> a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
lies by the Statute. You ſay, that an Husband may give rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
chaſtiſement to his Wife, and we have nothing to do with
it: But only that the Husband may be bound to his good behaviour

Juſtification, and ſet forth a Provocation to him by his Wife, to
give her reaſonable caſtigation, then there would be ſome colour of
a Prohibition. <hi>Henden,</hi> we have made ſuch an Allegation, and it
is abſolutely refuſed. <hi>Hutton,</hi> perhaps he is in <hi>Contempt,</hi> and
then they will not admit any Plea; as if one be Out-lawed at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

for that there is an obligation taken in this Caſe, I will grant a

               <p>(5.) A Suit was commenced in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, where
the Lilbel was, that he called the Plaintiff <hi>Quean,</hi> or words to

               <p>(6.) The Defendant ſaid to one <hi>Anthony Elcock</hi> (who was
a Suiter to the Plaintiff, and with whom there was near an
Agreement of Marriage) <hi>I know</hi> Davies <hi>Daughter, well,
ſhe did dwel in</hi> Cheapſide, <hi>and a Grocer did get her with child,</hi>
and the Plaintff declared, that by reaſon of theſe Words,
<hi>Elcock</hi> refuſed to take her to Wife. Adjudged, that the
Action would lie at the Common Law, and the Suit was not to
be in the <hi>Spiritual</hi> Court for <hi>Defamation;</hi> but at the Common
Law, for that ſhe is prejudiced in that which ſhould be her <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>
advancement; and the ground of the Action is <hi>Temporal.</hi> The
truth of the Caſe was this; an Action upon the Caſe for a <hi>Slander</hi>
was brought by <hi>Anne Davies</hi> againſt <hi>John Gardiner:</hi> That whereas
there was a Communication of a Marriage to be had between the
Plaintiff and one <hi>Anthony Elcock;</hi> the Defendant to the intent to
hinder the ſaid Marriage, ſaid and publiſhed, that there was a Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
in <hi>London</hi> that did get her with Child, and that ſhe had the
Child by the ſaid Grocer, whereby ſhe loſt her Marriage. To
which the Defendant pleaded <hi>Not guilty,</hi> and was found guilty at
the Aſſizes at <hi>Aylesbury</hi> to the dammages of Two hundred Marks,
and now it was alledged in Arreſt of Judgment, that this matter
appeareth to be meerly Spiritual, and therefore not determinable
at Common Law, but to be proſecuted in the Spiritual Court. But
<hi>per Curiam,</hi> the Action lies here, for a Woman not Married cannot
by intendment have ſo great advancement as by her Marriage,
whereby ſhe is ſure of maintenance for her life, or during her Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and Dower and other benefits which the Temporal Laws
give by reaſon of her Marriage; and therefore by this <hi>Slander</hi> ſhe
is greatly prejudiced in that which is to be her Temporal advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for which it is reaſon to give her remedy by way of Action
at Common Law: As if a Woman keep a Victualling houſe, to
which divers of great credit repair, whereby ſhe hath her lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and one will ſay to her Gueſts, that as they reſpect their
Credits, they take care how they uſe ſuch a Houſe, for there the
Woman is known to be a <hi>Bawd,</hi> whereby the Gueſts avoid the
Houſe, to the loſs of her Husband: ſhall not ſhe in this Caſe have

Court. Reſolved, the matter muſt be meer Spiritual and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable
only there; for if it concern any matter which is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
at the Common Law, the Eccleſiaſtical Judge hath not the
cognizance thereof<note n="i" place="margin">25. Eliz. <hi>Palmer</hi> and <hi>Thorp</hi>'s Caſe. Co. 4. par. 20.</note>.</p>
               <p>(8.) Action was for theſe words, <hi>Pierce hath taken a falſe Oath
in the Court of Conſiſtory of Exeter.</hi> It was objected, that for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the Spiritual Court, an Action will not lye: And the Stat.
of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> of <hi>Perjury,</hi> doth not extend to thoſe Courts, but it was
reſolved, that the Action did lye for theſe words, and that the
Statute doth extend to ſuch and the like Courts; as the Court of
<hi>Star-chamber,</hi> &amp;c. And the words, <hi>that he hath taken a falſe Oath,</hi>
ſhall be intended actively, and ſhall amount to theſe words, <hi>He is
forſworn.</hi> In this Caſe it was ſaid by <hi>Prideoux,</hi> that theſe words are
Actionable, although the <hi>Perjury</hi> be ſuppoſed to be committed in
the Spiritual Court; for he ſhall be Excommunicated if he will
not appear, and he ſhall do penance in a white ſheet, which is as
great a diſgrace as to be ſet upon the Pillory. And it was ruled in
an Action upon the Caſe betwixt <hi>Dorrington</hi> and <hi>Dorrington,</hi> upon
theſe words, <hi>Thou art a Baſtard,</hi> that an Action lieth, and yet <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtardy</hi>
is a Spiritual matter, and there determinable; ſo for theſe
words, Thou art a <hi>Pirate,</hi> an Action lieth, and yet <hi>Piracy</hi> is not
puniſhable by the Common Law, but in the Court of Admiralty.
And theſe words, <hi>He hath taken a falſe Oath,</hi> do amount to theſe
words, <hi>He is forſworn. Wray</hi> conceived, that the words are not
Actionable, for there is a Proviſo in the Statute of <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 9.
that the ſaid Act ſhall not extend to any Eccleſiaſtical Court, but
that every ſuch Offender ſhall be and may be puniſhed by ſuch uſual
and ordinary Laws as heretofore have been, and are yet uſed, and
frequent in the ſaid Eccleſiaſtical Court. <hi>Gaudy,</hi> upon theſe words,
an Action doth not lye, for they are not pregnant of any <hi>Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
in the Plaintiff, for he may be meer paſſive in it: for if one of
the Maſters of the <hi>Chancery</hi> Miniſter an Oath to any perſon, or any
Commiſſioners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Plaintiff ſweareth falſly, a Man may
ſay that the Maſter of the <hi>Chancery,</hi> or the Commiſſioners have taken
a falſe Oath: and yet he is not guilty of falſity. And afterwards
<hi>Mutata Opinione Wray,</hi> that the Proviſo in the ſaid Statute is to
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:95379:306"/>
this intent, ſuch an offence may be enquirable and examined in the
Eccleſiaſtical Court in ſuch manner as was before, but the ſame
doth not take away or reſtrain the Authority of the Common
Law, but that ſuch an Offence may be here examined, &amp;c. And
as to the latter exception upon theſe words (<hi>he hath taken a falſe
Oath</hi>) it ſhall be intended Actively, and not Paſſively; And if
ſo, the Defendant ought to have ſo pleaded it: And afterwards

in it ſelf; for they cannot be <hi>Baſtards,</hi> which were born in the time
of her former Husband: But all the Court held that the Action
well lies. For to ſay of a Widow who is in Comnunication of
Marriage with another, that ſhe plaid the Whore in her former
Husbands time, is a great Diſcredit: And to ſay that her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
are Baſtards (although in truth they cannot be Baſtards in
Law, yet in Reputation they may be ſo) is cauſe of loſs of her
Marriage, and that none will marry with her; wherefore it was

(<hi>abſente Richardſon</hi>) agreed. But for the other words, they held,
the Action lies by the Husband and Wife, for the ſlander to his

And for theſe <hi>Defamatory</hi> words he ſued there; and becauſe it was
alledged, that for theſe words, being but words of Spleen, <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions</hi>

and divers preſidents were ſhewd, that for calling one <hi>Cuckold</hi> or

all the Court agreed, that no <hi>Prohibition</hi> ſhould be granted,

For although they agreed, that there ought not to have been any
Suit for the firſt words, they being too general; yet being coupled
with a particular, ſhewing that the Wife committed ſuch an Offence
with ſuch a particular perſon, they be not now general words of

a Prohibition was granted: For theſe words do not concern any
Spiritual matter, but meerly Temporal, and they be but <hi>Convitium

ought not to be a Suit in the Spiritual Court; and ſo it was held in

becauſe the Spiritual Court as well as the Temporal may meddle

ſaid, that preſident is not like to this Caſe, for there was not any

there <hi>pro reformatione morum;</hi> for it is a diſgrace to the Husband as

For it was held clearly, that for the word [<hi>Welch Thief</hi>]
Action lies at the Common Law, and they ought not to ſue in the

for they be words only of Heat and no <hi>Slander.</hi> But it was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

were not in the firſt Libel, nor in the Appeal at the time of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal;
but were interlined by a falſe Hand without the privity of
the Plaintiff in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, and that upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in that Court, it was found to be falſly inſerted, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be expunged. And that the words <hi>Welch Jade</hi> were ſhewn

which being a Spiritual Cauſe and examinable there, it was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
prayed that no Prohibition ſhould be granted; and if it were

was all the Court, that the words [<hi>and a Welch Thief</hi>]
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:95379:308"/>
being unduly interlined, and by Authority of the Eccleſiaſtical

               <p>(18.) It was moved for a Prohibition by <hi>Harris</hi> Serjeant to the

his Appeal, and for that <hi>W.</hi> had coſts taxed him: And now <hi>L.</hi>
prayed a Prohibition, becauſe he deferr'd his Appeal becauſe of the
Pardon, which had taken away the Offence. And by the Court in that
Caſe, after the pardon the inferiour Court cannot tax Coſts; but it was
urged that the ſuperiour Courts might tax Coſts upon the deſertion
of the Appeal, which is an Offence after the Pardon. But it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered

were actionable at Common Law; yet it was agreed, that a Suit

Legacy, deviſed to her by the Teſtator, and the Defendant pleaded

well remembred when that Caſe was argued, and the <hi>parlance</hi> then
was about the <hi>Divorce. Wentworth,</hi> it ſeems that no Prohibition
ſhall be granted, <hi>Hill. 7. Jac.</hi> in this Court. A Suit was commenced

a Prohibition was here granted, and after a conſultation was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
for that they ſhall try that, having cognizance of the <hi>Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal,</hi>
and in this Caſe the Releaſe is after the appeal, and therefore it

gift by the Church-wardens without the Aſſent of the Sidemen or

meerly Spiritual <hi>viz. Defamation,</hi> and therefore we have nothing
to do therewith, and the Releaſe of the Husband ſhall not diſcharge
the Suit of the Wife, which is only to reſtore her to her Credit and

               <p>In a Caſe of Prohibition between <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical

for <hi>Defamation,</hi> Sentence there given, the Wife divorced <hi>à Menſa

to reſtore the Party to her good Name, in Caſe of <hi>Defamation:</hi>
The point here only is, the Husband and Wife are <hi>divorced, Cauſa
Adulterii,</hi> the Wife ſues in the Eccleſiaſtical Court for <hi>Defamation,</hi>
and there recovers, and Coſts are given, the which the Husband
did releaſe; whether this Releaſe thus made by the Husband, ſhall
barr the Wife of her Coſts. And if they will not allow of this
Releaſe there, whether a Prohibition ſhall be granted or not. The
Whole Court clear of opinion, that no Prohibition in this Caſe is
to be granted. And ſo by the whole Court, the Prohibition was
denied.</p>

               <p>(6.) Touching <hi>Sacriledge</hi> as diverſified in reſpect of <hi>Perſons,
Places,</hi> and other <hi>things</hi> Sacred, the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> enumerate ſuch
kinds thereof, as would ſeem very uncouth and ſtrange for us to
hear of in this Kingdom, as the Conſtitution of the Eccleſiaſtical State
thereof is now moſt Proteſtantly eſtabliſhed; they are therefore here
purpoſely omitted. The Penalties likewiſe inflicted on <hi>Sacrilegious</hi>
perſons vary according to Circumſtances, and as the kinds or degrets
of the <hi>Sacriledge</hi> are; and herein the <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Civil</hi> Law
have provided very different penalties; which at the <hi>Canon</hi> Law
are of one kind, and at the <hi>Civil</hi> Law of another: But accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the ancient Eccleſiaſtical Conſtitutions of this Realm, <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge</hi>
of what kind ſoever, regularly incurr's the penalty of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication,
which admitts alſo of diſtinctions: For as there
is the greater and the leſſer Excommunication; ſo there is Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<hi>ipſo facto,</hi> in Contradiſtinction to that which is only <hi>ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
jure;</hi> alſo the Law even in this point of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> doth diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
between Excommunication <hi>latam,</hi> and <hi>ferendam;</hi> for if it
be <hi>Sacriledge</hi> committed againſt an Eccleſiaſtical Perſon, then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Canon</hi> Law, and as heretofore practiſed in this Realm,
the penalty was <hi>Excommunicatio lata;</hi> but when it is in reſpect of ſome
things pertaining to the Church, in that caſe the Puniſhment was <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicatio
ferenda. Lindw. de immun. Eccl. c. 1. glo. in ver.

for Sacriledge. 17. <hi>q. 4. c. quiſquis. &amp;c. ſi quis contumax.</hi> The

whereby the puniſhment ſometimes is <hi>Damnatio ad beſtias,</hi>
ſometimes the <hi>Sacrilegious</hi> perſon is burnt alive, ſometimes hung on
Fonk, ſometimes condemned to the Mines, ſometimes baniſhed, and
ſometimes ſentenced to death in the ordinary way of Execution.
He that is guilty of <hi>Sacriledge</hi> againſt an Eccleſiaſtical perſon, is by
the <hi>Canon</hi> Law <hi>excommunicatus ipſo facto, 17. q. 4. c. ſi quis ſuadente.</hi>
                  <pb n="335" facs="tcp:95379:313"/>
But if it be <hi>in rebus Eccleſiae,</hi> he is by that Law <hi>Excommunicandus. de

that by firing or breaking it open, in that Caſe the <hi>Sacrilegious</hi>
perſon is <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicated. <hi>de ſent. Excom. c. conqueſti.</hi> If
it be without burning or breaking it open, as when a thing being left
in the Church, is taken away, in that Caſe he ought to be excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.
<hi>De furtib. c. fin.</hi> And this (ſays <hi>Lindwood</hi>) may ſtand
as a rule in Law, that wherever you find that regularly the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious
perſon is not <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicated <hi>majori Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catione,</hi>
it hath theſe ſeveral <hi>Fallentias,</hi> that is, it doth not hold
in caſe of Burning, violating, ſpoiling and waſting of the Church,
nor in burning or breaking open the Church door, nor in <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
againſt an Eccleſiaſtical perſon, nor in caſe of ſtriking or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently
apprehending any man in the Church, nor in any forcible
or violent taking away any thing out of the Church, nor in any that
were excommunicated before for the like Offence, nor in ſuch as

After which comes the general Pardon of the <hi>Queen,</hi> wherby the
puniſhment of <hi>Smith</hi> the Incumbent is pardoned, and of <hi>Smith</hi>
the Patron alſo. If the Incumbent may be removed was the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion:
<hi>Williams</hi> ſaid that the Doctors of the Civil Law informed
him, That the Law Spiritual was, that for <hi>Simony</hi> the Patron loſt
his Preſentation, and the Ordinary ſhall preſent, and if he preſent
not within ſix montehs, then the Metropolitan, and then the King.
<hi>Spurling</hi> Serjeant, This puniſhment cannot diſcharge the Forfeiture,
although it diſchargeth the puniſhment. <hi>Glanvil contra;</hi> and ſaid
that this point was in queſtion when the Lord Keeper was Atturney,
and then both of them conſulted thereupon, and they made this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
<hi>viz.</hi> Between a thing void and voidable, and for <hi>Simony</hi>
the Church is not void until Sentence Declaratory, and therefore
they held that by the Pardon before the Sentence all is pardoned, as
where a man committs Felony, and before Conviction the King
pardons him, by this Pardon the Lord ſhall loſe his Eſcheat, for
the Lord can have no Eſcheat before there be an Attainder, but
that is prevented before by the Pardon: And ſo here this Pardon
prevents the Sentence Declaratory, and ſo no title can accrue to
the Ordinary. <hi>Walmſley contra:</hi> if Patron be charged by the
Sentence, he may plead the Pardon. But if a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> be
brought by a third Perſon, the Pardon of the King ſhall be no Barr
to him, for the title appears not to him, but only the puniſhment. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſon,</hi>
they may proceed to Sentence Declaratory, notwithſtanding
the Pardon; for the Pardon is of the puniſhment, but the Sentence
extends not to that, but only to declare that the Church is void.

(14.) In <hi>Calverts</hi> Caſe againſt <hi>Kitchin</hi> and <hi>Parkinſon</hi> in the
Exchequer, where <hi>K.</hi> not knowing of any <hi>Simoniacal</hi> agreement
was Preſented, Inſtituted, and Inducted to the Church of <hi>D.</hi> and
this after the Statute of 31. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 6. And this Preſentation
belonging to the Queen by reaſon of this Preſentation for <hi>Simony</hi>
by force of the ſaid Statute, the Queen preſented one <hi>B.</hi> and before that
<hi>B.</hi> was Admitted and Inducted the Queen died; whereupon the King
preſented <hi>C.</hi> without any recital or mention of the Preſentation
made by the Queen, and without any revocation actually made of
the ſaid firſt Preſentation, and thereupon <hi>C.</hi> is Admitted and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted;
and for Tithes as Parſon he brought Treſpaſs. In this Caſe
one of the points in Queſtion was, if within the ſaid Statute here be
<hi>Simony</hi> in the Patron, and not in the Parſon, if this ought to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Parſon or not? In this point <hi>Hitchcock</hi> conceived, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Preſentee in this Caſe, was not party to this corrupt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
yet he ſhall be prejudiced by it, although not ſo preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
thereby, but that he may be capable to be preſented again to
the ſame Benefice, but <hi>hac vice</hi> the preſentation of him is void; for as
<hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, the Preſentee ought to accept the Parſonage ſubject
to ſuch charges as the Patron pleaſeth, who in the time of vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath power to charge it, and ſo by his Act had made it ſubject to
the Forfeiture, and therefore the perſon who cometh under him ſhall
be prejudiced, &amp;c. <hi>Damport</hi> to the contrary; The Patron and a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
corruptly agree to preſent <hi>K.</hi> whereupon he is preſented;
If this ſhall be void againſt <hi>K.</hi> is the queſtion. To this he ſaid
that at the Common Law, if one be <hi>Simoniacally</hi> preſented, yet
this is not void until the Preſentee be deprived; and if before
the ſaid Statute ſuch a corrupt Preſentation had been made, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
and Ordinary being free, then no Preſentation ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue;
and he <hi>vouched</hi> the ſaying of <hi>Lindwood</hi> to be accordingly;
but if money be given by the friends of the Preſentee, and after
the King had notice thereof, and Aſſent, then it is not puniſhable,
but pardonable at the diſcretion of the King; and now by him the
Statute provides no puniſhment for the Parſon, when the Patron
onely conſents to the <hi>Simony;</hi> for he obſerved that after the ſaid
<hi>ſtat.</hi> of 31. <hi>Eliz.</hi> had appointed a puniſhment for the Patron,
then in the laſt part of this Branch, the words are, <hi>The perſons ſo
corruptly taking,</hi> &amp;c. ſhall be incapable of the Benefice aforeſaid;
and ſo it ſeemeth, that the intent of the Statute is not to puniſh any
party, but he that is to the <hi>Simony,</hi> and this is alſo explained to be
ſo, by other clauſes in the Statute, for another clauſe inflicts pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
upon the Ordinary, if there be any corruption in him,
and another clauſe inflicts puniſhment upon him who is party to a
corrupt Reſignation, and ſo in all the clauſes, thoſe only who are
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:95379:319"/>
partakers of the crime ſhall be puniſhed, &amp;c. And in this Caſe was no
agreement aſſented unto by the Parſon; and this diverſity alſo ſeems
to be good, that if <hi>A.</hi> hath the Preſentation, and <hi>B.</hi> the Nomination to
a Benefice, and the Preſentor upon a corrupt agreement, makes a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
unknown to the Nominator, here the Nominator ſhall not
be prejudiced within this Statute, &amp;c. In this Caſe <hi>Bromley</hi> Baron de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
his opinion, that the intent of the Statute was to eradicate all
manner of <hi>Simonies;</hi> and therefore the words are not if any man give
money to be preſented, but they are <hi>If any preſent for money,</hi> and the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
here found 20 <hi>l.</hi> to be given, and nothing for what it was given, or
to whom it was given, for if money be the meed, a Preſentation is void,
and therefore if <hi>I. S.</hi> be patron of the Church of <hi>D.</hi> which is void, and
a ſtranger ſaith to me, procure the Preſentation for <hi>A.</hi> and you ſhall
have 100 <hi>l.</hi> and he procured <hi>A.</hi> to be Preſented; here if the Patron had
notice of the money given to me, this Preſentation is void, but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
not: And in this Caſe without notice of the Parſon, the Admiſſion
and all that enſued thereupon is void, by reaſon of the <hi>Simony</hi> in the
Patron; and it is void as to the Parſon alſo; and if in this Caſe we are
not within the words of the Statute, yet we are within the intent clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
&amp;c. And <hi>Panormitan</hi> ſaith, That <hi>Simonia eſt ſtudioſa voluntas emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di
vel vendendi aliquid ſpirituale, vel ſpirituali annexum cum opere ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequente.
Altham</hi> Baron was of the ſame opinion, and ſaid that the
words of the Statute are, That if a Preſentation be made for money, it
ſhall be void, and that the King may preſent that turn; and therefore
the want of privity in the Incumbent is nothing to the purpoſe, as to
the avoiding of the Benefice; but his want of privity availeth to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him of being <hi>Simoniacus,</hi> yet he is <hi>Simoniace Promotus,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Preſentation is void, and the King ſhall have it by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
words of the Statute; and therefore as it ſeems, if in this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
there had been an expreſs ſaving of the Intereſt of the Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent,
by reaſon of his innocency, yet ſuch a ſaving of Intereſt had been
void and repugnant, in reſpect that it was expreſly given to the King
before, as it is in <hi>Nichols</hi> Caſe in <hi>Plowden</hi> upon the <hi>Stat.</hi> of 1. <hi>H.</hi>
7. &amp;c. And to prove that by the <hi>Simony</hi> in the Patron
that the Parſon ſhall be prejudiced, he vouched 42. <hi>E. 3. fo.</hi>
2.—<hi>Snig</hi> Baron concurr'd in opinion with the former,
and ſaid that as to the point of <hi>Simony</hi> by the Civil Law, it was
puniſhable by Deprivation, and the guilt of the Patron ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
the Parſon, as to matter of commodity in the Parſonage;
and at the Common Law if the Parſon will plead ſuch Preſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he ſhould be prejudiced, and here by the Incumbency the
words of the Statute will not be ſatisfied, &amp;c. Alſo it ſeemeth that
if <hi>I. S.</hi> hath an Adowſon, and <hi>A.</hi> purchaſe the next avoidance to
the intent to preſent <hi>B.</hi> and the Church becomes void, and <hi>A.</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:95379:320"/>
                  <hi>B.</hi> this is <hi>Simony</hi> by averment, as by good pleading the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of <hi>B.</hi> ſhall be adjudged void, &amp;c. <hi>Tanfield</hi> accordingly,
as this Caſe is, here is <hi>Simony</hi> by the Civil Law, and the party had
his Benefice by <hi>Simony,</hi> although he be not cognuſant thereof. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
admit here was not <hi>Simony</hi> by the intendment of the Civil
Law, yet the Statute hath made an avoidance of the Benefice in this
Caſe, although it be not <hi>Simony,</hi> for the Statute ſpeakes not one
word of <hi>Simony</hi> throughout the Act, and yet by expreſs words it
doth avoid ſuch Preſentations as this is; and as to the Civil Law ſuch
Benefice is to be made void by Sentence Declaratory, but it is not
void <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> as it ſeems in the Caſe where a common perſon was
conſenting to the <hi>Simony,</hi> but the text of the Civil Law ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
that the Church ought not to be filled <hi>Corruptive,</hi> or by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and the Civil Law expreſſeth ſuch a perſon as in this Caſe
by <hi>Simoniace promotus,</hi> and calls him who is <hi>Particeps Criminis,
Simoniacus,</hi> and he who is <hi>Simoniacus,</hi> is by the Civil Law depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not only of the Benefice <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> but alſo is deprived to be a
Miniſter, and adjudged guilty, <hi>in culpa &amp; poena. Petrus Benefiel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi>
ſaith, that if a Friend give money to a Patron, to make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
to him &amp;c. and the Incumbent pays it, ſuch an Incumbent is
<hi>Simoniacus</hi> by the Civil Law; and ſo if the Incumbent pay the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
not knowing it till after the induction, yet he is <hi>Simoniacus;</hi>
and by him if a Friend give money, and the Parſon is thereupon
preſented, though the Parſon knew not of the money given,
yet he ſhall be deprived of the Benefice; and this difference was
certified by <hi>Anderſon</hi> and <hi>Gawdy</hi> to the Council-Table upon a Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
made to them by the King, touching the filling of Benefices
by corrupt means; And the Statute of purpoſe forbears to uſe the
word <hi>Simony,</hi> for avoiding of nice conſtruction in the Civil Law as
to that word, and therefore the makers of the Act ſet down plainly the
words of the Statute, that <hi>if any ſhall be promoted for money,</hi> &amp;c.
So that by theſe words it is not material from whom the money
comes; and then in ſuch Caſes for the avoiding of all ſuch grand Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
a liberal Conſtruction ought to be made, as hath been uſed
in ſuch caſes, &amp;c. for which and many other reaſons mentioned in

Church for ever, and cannot be preſented to this Church again; as it
was adjudged in the Lord <hi>Windſors</hi> Caſe. But it was ſaid by <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chardſon</hi>
if he had ſaid, <hi>abſque hoc,</hi> That he was in <hi>ex Preſentatione</hi>
of &amp;c. it had been good enough which was granted. <hi>Henden,</hi>
two exceptions had been taken. (1.) That the Incumbent doth
not ſhew what Eſtate or Intereſt the King had to preſent him;
which doth not need, if the King brought a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> then
it is a good anſwer to ſay, that he is in of his Preſenting. But if it
be brought by a ſtranger, then he ought to ſhew the title in his
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:95379:321"/>
Preſentment. And he alledged the Statute of 25. <hi>E.</hi> 3. which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables
the Incumbent to plead by Writ of the Law. 41. <hi>Eliz.</hi> There
was a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> brought for the Church of <hi>Danell;</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
by the King was pleaded, without making a title, and it
was admitted good. And in many Caſes it is more ſafe not to make
a title. (2.) Becauſe that he pleaded a Preſentation by the King
he is diſabled. As to that he ſaid, that before he be convicted of
<hi>Simony,</hi> he may be preſented. But by <hi>Crook</hi> in <hi>Sathers</hi> Caſe, that
if he be preſented before conviction, yet it is a void Preſentation.
And it was ſo agreed by the Court, and they reſolved the plea was
nought, becauſe he anſwers nothing to the <hi>Simony;</hi> for the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation
is not any anſwer: wherefore Judgment was given for the

was a Decree in the Court of Wards accordingly. And then the

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:95379:321"/>
that is <hi>Simony; Firſt,</hi> becauſe there was a corrupt Contract for the
Advowſon: Note, that in the Stat. of 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> there is not word
of <hi>Simony;</hi> for by that means then the Common Law would have
been Judge, what ſhould have been <hi>Simony</hi> and what not. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>

purchas'd the <hi>prochein Avoidance,</hi> and preſents his Son after
the death of the Incumbent, that is not <hi>Simony,</hi> and that it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
judged in 42 and 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> It was <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Shelborns</hi>
Caſe. But by <hi>Hubbard,</hi> that if in the grant of the <hi>Prochein Avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi>
it appears that it was to the intent to preſent his Son or his
Kinſman, and it was done accordingly, that is <hi>Simony.</hi> In the 7th

he will preſent <hi>C.</hi> to the Church <hi>quando,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>C.</hi> not knowing any
thing of the Contract, is preſented accordingly. This is <hi>Simony.
Fortiori</hi> in this Caſe where <hi>S.</hi> himſelf who was to be preſented,
was party to the firſt motion of the Contract for preſentation.
(2.) It was reſolved, that the death of the <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Incumbent
doth not hinder but that the King may well preſent, for the Church
was never full as to the King, and that Turn is preſerved to the
King by force of the Statute, yet it ſeems the Church is ſo full
that a Stranger may not preſent for uſurpation; for it is not like
7 <hi>Rep.</hi> 28. where the King is to preſent by lapſe. And there are
many Caſes wherein the Church may be full or void in effect, when
there is a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Incumbent. <hi>Hubbard</hi> ſaid that if <hi>A.</hi> be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to preſent <hi>B,</hi> &amp;c. and he preſents by <hi>Simony,</hi> yet the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

is in by <hi>Simony.</hi> And by the Court, to ſay the Church was full

               <p>(33.) The Lord <hi>Winſor</hi> ſeized of an Advowſon, granted the next

                  <hi>R. F.</hi> the Father ſued <hi>J. S.</hi> before the High Commiſſioners

               <p>(34.) For a Prohibition upon a Suit for Tithes, ſuppoſing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

                     <hi>Risby</hi> and <hi>Wentworth</hi>'s Caſe.—Cro. par. 1.</note> and thereby the Church void, and the
Tithes not belonging to him: it was <hi>reſolved</hi> by the Court, a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
did not lie, for that <hi>Simony</hi> might more aptly be tried in the
Eccleſiaſtical Court.</p>
               <p>(35.) The Incumbent of a Church being ſick, the Father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
with the Patron in the preſence of his Son,<note place="margin">Trin 41. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz. B. R. <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Shelbourne.</hi> Cro. par. 1. vid. <hi>More.</hi> Caſe. 1229.</note> for the next avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance

The Grant is made, the Incumbent died; the Son is Preſented; Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted,
and Inducted; being ſued for <hi>Simony</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical
Court, he prays a Prohibition, and alledges the General Pardon
39 <hi>Eliz.</hi> which is after the Inſtitution and Induction, wherein <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
is not excepted: In this Caſe it was <hi>reſolved.</hi> (1.) That
although the Pardon diſcharges the puniſhment of <hi>Simony,</hi> yet he
may be examined of it by the Ordinary, and deprived for it: But
it was (2) Reſolved in this Caſe, there was no <hi>Simony,</hi> for the
Father might buy the next avoidance and preſent his Son, and it is
not <hi>Simony</hi> in any to buy an Advowſon; therefore the Prohibition
was granted.</p>
               <p>(36.) In Debt upon an Obligation to perform Covenants. That
<hi>T.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mich. 11. Car. B. R. <hi>Bryte</hi> and <hi>Mannings</hi> Caſe. Cro. par. 3.</note>

conſideration of which marriage, the Defendant amongſt other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants,
Covenanted, that he would procure the ſaid <hi>T. B.</hi> to be
Preſented, Inſtituted, and Inducted into ſuch a Benefice, upon the
next avoidance of the Church, and the breach was aſſigned, for
non performance of the ſaid Covenant, in procuring him to be
Admitted, Inſtituted, and Inducted: It was demurred to by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
becauſe the Covenant is againſt Law, being a <hi>Simoniacal</hi>
Agreement, and a Bond for performance thereof is not good. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved,</hi>
it it had appeared to have been, that in conſideration of the
Marriage, of his Son, he would procure him to be Admitted and
Inſtituted into ſuch a Benefice, that had been a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Contract,
and had avoided the Obligation; but here this Covenant is not in
conſideration of the former Covenant, nor depending thereon, but
it is a meer diſtinct Covenant of it ſelf, and independent upon
the former; and without a ſpecial averring or ſhewing that it was
a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> Contract, it ſhall not be intende, but it may be a
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:95379:324"/>
Covenant upon a good conſideration. And it was adjudged for the
Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>(37.) In the forſaid Caſe of the King againſt <hi>Zakar alias Secker</hi>
and others, it was ſaid by <hi>Coke</hi> Chief Juſtice, that it is put for a
Rule in <hi>Green</hi>'s Caſe,<note place="margin">Bulſtr. ubi ſupra.</note> that if one preſents <hi>Simaniace</hi> to a Church
of the Kings, and the King afterwards preſents, <hi>jure Simaniace,</hi> this
is a void Preſentment, becauſe he hath miſtaken his Title, but he
ought to preſent <hi>jure Patronatus,</hi> not <hi>ratione Simoniace Preſentatus.</hi>
And as to the diſability of a <hi>Simoniacal</hi> perſon by the State of 31
<hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 6. Four things are to be obſerved upon this Statute. (1.)
The Preſentation to be void. (2.) The King to have this Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
(3.) A Fine to be impoſed by way of Forfeiture. (4) The
party preſented to be utterly diſabled. For where there is matter
of <hi>Simony,</hi> if there be Fraud in the Incumbent, or if Money be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for the Preſentation, though it be unknown to the Incumbent,
to this let the Patron look; the Incumbent ſhall be removed. In
this Caſe the whole Court agreed clearly in this, that the perſon party
preſented by <hi>Simony,</hi> the preſentation is meerly void, and that the
ſo preſented is utterly diſabled for ever by the Statute of 31 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 6.
to take the ſame Benefice, to which he is preſented by <hi>Simony,</hi> and that
he is incapable to have another preſentation to the ſame Benefice.</p>
               <p>(38.) The words [<hi>Preſent</hi> or <hi>Collate</hi>] in the Stat. of 31 <hi>Eliz.
c.</hi> 6. are not intended (ſays the Lord <hi>Coke</hi>) onely where the perſon
preſenting or collating,<note place="margin">Co. Inſt. pa. 3. cap. 71.</note> hath right to preſent or collate, but alſo
where any perſon or perſons, Bodies politick or corporate, do u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp
and have no Title to preſent or collate; and that ſo it was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
in caſe where the uſurpation was to a Church of the King.
<hi>Sed quando Praeſentatio &amp; Jus Poetronatus ſunt Temporalia Quaeritur
quomodo ſit Simonia per donum pecuniae pro illis: Reſpondendum eſt,
Quod Jus Patronatus &amp; Praeſentatio dicuntur Spiritualia, veſpectu rei,
ad quam praeſentatur, quae Spiritualis eſt. Vide</hi> Lindwood. <hi>cap. de
Jurejurando. fo.</hi> 80. He ſays further, that there is a diverſity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a preſentation or collation made by a rightful Patron and an
uſurpur. For in Caſe of a rightful Patron, which doth corruptly
preſent or collate, by the expreſs Letter of the Statute the King ſhall
preſent: But where one doth uſurp, and corruptly preſent or collate,
there the King ſhall not preſent, but the rightful Patron: For the Branch
that gives the King power to preſent, is onely intended, where the
rightful Patron is in fault; But where the rightful Patron is
in no fault, there the corrupt act and wrong of the uſurper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
the Benefice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> void, but taketh not away the Lawful
Title to preſent from the rightful Patron And ſo it was adjudged <hi>Mich.</hi>

(39.) The <hi>Canon</hi> Law looks upon Simony as a kind of <hi>Hereſie,

And are <hi>ipſo jure</hi> deprived of that Benefice wherein the <hi>Simony</hi> was
Committed:—<hi>extr. ibid.</hi> And this holds true as well where
the <hi>Simony</hi> is only <hi>Coventional</hi> or by Compact, as where it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

of <hi>Conſtans</hi> (touching this Matter) there is nothing ſaid <hi>de da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione</hi>
as to Deprivation, but only to as Excommunication; whether
therefore it be a <hi>Conventional</hi> or a <hi>Real Simony,</hi> a Preſentation or
Collation in conſequence of either, is <hi>ipſo jure</hi> void and null accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that Law. <hi>Rebuff. ubi ſup. nu.</hi> 10. It is worth an <hi>Aſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risk</hi>
to obſerve, what an excellent expoſition <hi>Rebuffus</hi> the Canoniſt
to this purpoſe makes on <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. 12. (poſſibly more like a
Lawyer than a Divine) he ſays, that by the <hi>ſellers</hi> of <hi>Doves,</hi> is
there meant, ſuch as endeavour to make ſale of the Sacred Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hands: And by the <hi>Money-Changer</hi> are intended ſuch as
ſell Eccleſiaſtical Benefices: And pleaſing himſelf in this conceit,
breaks out into a Peice of Eloquence, <hi>viz. Nuſquam reperitur (quod

peccatores corripuiſſe, non ſolum eloquio increpans, verum etiam fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto

thence moſt infallibly inferrs, that our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jeſus

negotiated in <hi>Preſentations (Roman</hi> Elections and Poſtulations)
Collations, Reſignations, and Permutations of Eccleſiaſtical Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.
It is ſuppoſed that it hath it's denomination from <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi>
for theſe three Reaſons, (1.) Becauſe he was the firſt, that
in the New Teſtament we meet with, that was ever infected with
that Crime. (2.) Becauſe he was the ſuperlative Offender in this
kind above all others that were anciently guilty thereof, for (as
<hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) he would buy the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> on purpoſe to
ſell the <hi>Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. tract 40. in Johan. Num. 22.</note> But thoſe that went before him ſold only

he obtained from a Divine Power for <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King 5.</note> (3.)
Becauſe <hi>Simon</hi> ſeemed obſtinately to perſiſt in ſuppoſing this thing
to be Lawful, and ſo therein he thence became an Heretick, and
as ſuch is generally condemned by the Fathers. The Definition
which <hi>Panormitan</hi> makes of <hi>Simony</hi> ſeems defective according to
<hi>Leſſius</hi> and other modern Authors; <hi>Panormita</hi> defines it as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid)
to be <hi>ſtudioſam voluntatatem emendi vel vendendi aliquid
Spirituale, vel Spirituali annexum, opere ſubſecuto.</hi> But to make
the definition adequate to the thing, there ſhould be added to it
(<hi>pretio temporali;</hi>) for it is ſuppoſed, that if one Spiritual thing
be given for another, in that Caſe it is not properly <hi>Simony,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Turpitude of this Evil conſiſts in this, that Spiritual
things, which in their own Nature are ineſtimable, are here eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
at a Carnal, Humane, or Temporal price, which value
or price the Law makes threefold, <hi>viz. Pretium muneris,</hi> as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
or ought elſe that may be ſold for Money: <hi>Pretium lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guae,</hi>
as undue and undeſerved Praiſe, or immoderate Flattery:
<hi>Pretium obſequii,</hi> as ſome ſervice done, or to be done for the
Patron in matters Temporal; or as when a Chaplain ſerves a
Biſhop domeſtically without any Stipend or Salary, or remitts
it on purpoſe that a Benefice may be beſtowed on him; which
by the expreſs Letter of the Canon Law is no other than <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.

Opinion among the DD. that to reſign a Benefice into the

ſufficient of it ſelf to repeal the Act 25. <hi>H. cap.</hi> 14. without more:
Then the 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. repeals the 1 and 2 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> except
ſome Branches; and in the ſame Act it is enacted, that all other
Statutes repealed by the ſaid Act of Repeal 1 and 2 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi>
and not in this Act ſpecially revived, ſhall remain repealed. But
the 25. <hi>H. 8. cap.</hi> 14. was not particularly revived, and therefore
remains repealed. And after the ſaid Statute 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> repeals the
Act 1 and 2 <hi>P.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> of reviving of three Acts for puniſhment
of Hereſies; ſo that now at Common Law (according to the Lord

Royal, or the known Laws of the Land, ſhould remain in force

Members of the Lower Houſe of Parliament, for Reviewing of ſuch
Canons and Conſtitutions, as remained in force by virtue of the Statute
made in the</hi> 25th <hi>year of King</hi> H. 8. <hi>and fitting them for the uſe of

to the chief Commiſſioners, by whom it was to be preſented to the

Three things eſpecially are reported to be condemned by this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
Council. 1. The <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie, Blaſphemouſly denying to
Son to be Co-eternal and Co-eſſential with the Father. 2. The
diſſent of the Eaſtern from the Weſtern Chriſtians about the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration
of the Paſſover, in a manner different from the <hi>Jewiſh</hi>
Cuſtome; and it was concluded in this Council, That the Feaſt of

the Emperour burnt all the Accuſations which the Biſhops brought

Heretical Opinions, or raiſe up Schiſms and Troubles to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſing

the name or notion of one of the Rejected Councils. To this
Aſſembly reſorted 90 Biſhops, under pretence of Dedicating the

deſign was to eject <hi>Athanaſius</hi> out of his Chair, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
that Syſteme of Faith, which was ſet down in the <hi>Nicene</hi>

others which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> reckons; <hi>Longus</hi> alſo doth name this, and
mentions other Councils of <hi>Antioch.</hi> But this Council is referr'd
to the time of <hi>Conſtantinus,</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> the Firſt. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> being
reſtored from Baniſhment by <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Son of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>

referr'd to Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> he Summons the Synod to appear at
<hi>Rome.</hi> But the <hi>Euſebians,</hi> chief of the Hereticks, that they might
avoid this, did without much difficulty ſeduce <hi>Conſtantius</hi> to be
at the Conſecration of the Magnificent Temple built by <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi>

And although the Firſt Excommunication is in effect ſufficient for

continues too long ſecure under ſuch Sentence of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
without repentance, whereby the Law concludes him ſo
manacled by his obſtinacy, as no Spiritual Phyſick can have any

thoſe Offences are, on the Guilty whereof the Law doth

But there are very many other Caſes in the Canon Law that fall

of the Publick Worſhip of God, eſtabliſh'd in the

in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> (5) Impugners of the Rites and
Ceremonies, eſtabliſhed in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> (6) Impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of the Government of the Church by Archbiſhops, Biſhops,

Archbiſhops, Biſhops, &amp;c. in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> (8) Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of Schiſms in the Church. (9) Maintainers of Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
Conventicles, and Conſtitutions made in Conventicles.
Likewiſe by the ſaid Canons, the Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication
is incurr'd by all ſuch Miniſters, as Revolt from
the Articles unto which they ſubſcribed at their being made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
and do not reform after a months ſuſpenſion: Alſo by all
ſuch perſons as refuſe the Sacraments at the hands of Unpreaching
Miniſters, after a months obſtinacy, being firſt ſuſpended: Alſo
by all ſuch Miniſters as without their Ordinaries Licenſe under

or in private Houſes, having been formerly ſuſpended for
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:95379:362"/>
the ſame fault; and finally by all Miniſters who hold any private
Conventicles, to Conſult on any thing tending to the impeaching
or depraving of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or of
the Book of Common Prayer, or of any part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

of a contrary Opinion, and that in this caſe he is Bailable.
<hi>Flemming</hi> Chief Juſtice, This is a Caſe which doth deſerve very
good conſideration, and that therefore he would conſider well of
it, and alſo of the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> before he would deliver his
Opinion. <hi>Williams</hi> Juſtice, clearly he is not Bailable in this Caſe.
Afterwards at another time, it was moved again unto the Court
to have him Bailed. <hi>Yelverton</hi> Juſtice, That he is Bailable,

Juſtice of Peace in the Countrey can Bail ſuch a one, but this
Court here may well Bail, as in the Caſe before, <hi>de die in diem.</hi>
It was further alledged here in this, That in the Eccleſiaſtical
Court they would not there diſcharge ſuch a one, being taken and
Impriſoned by force of ſuch a Writ, <hi>De Excommunicato Capiendo,</hi>
without a great Sum of Money there given, and a Bond entered

Three Writs, <hi>viz.</hi> One of the Right, as the
Writ of Right of Advowſon; and the other two, of
the Poſſeſſion, <hi>viz. A Quare Impedit,</hi> and <hi>Darrein Preſentment.</hi>
This Aſſize of <hi>Darrein Preſentment</hi> or <hi>Aſſiſa ultimae Praeſentationis,</hi>
is a Writ, which lieth where a man or his Anceſtor hath preſented a
Clerk to a Church, and after (the Church becoming void by
his death or otherwiſe) a ſtranger preſents his Clerk to the ſame
Church, in diſturbance of him who had laſt preſented. This Writ
is otherwiſe alſo uſed<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. Bract. l. 4. tract. 2. Reg. Orig. f. 30. &amp; F. N. B. f. 193.</note>; and differs from that of a <hi>Quare Impedit;</hi>
for the <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> lies upon the diſturbance of one who hath the
Advowſon in his Preſentation, when the Church is void: The
other lies, where a man or his Anceſtors had preſented before, and
now (the Church becoming void again) a ſtranger preſents in diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
of him who had laſt preſented. Where ever a man may have
Aſſize of <hi>Darrein Preſentment,</hi> he may have a <hi>Quare Impedit,</hi> but
not <hi>e contra</hi>
                  <note n="b" place="margin">Terms of Law verb. Quare Imp.</note>. He that hath right to preſent after the death of
the Parſon, and bringeth no <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> nor <hi>Darrein Preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
but ſuffereth a ſtranger to uſurp upon him, yet he ſhall have
a Writ of Right of Advowſon; but this Writ lieth not, unleſs he
claim to have the Advowſon to him and his heirs in Fee Simple
<note n="c" place="margin">ibid.</note>. Where the Ordinary, Metropolitan, or King preſents for
Lapſe, any of theſe Collatives will ſerve the Patron for a poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

for the ſame avoidance; and therefore in the Caſe, where William

the Archbiſhop of <hi>York, Mary</hi> Counteſs of <hi>Shrewsbury,</hi>
and one <hi>Hacker;</hi> aud the Biſhop making default, the Counteſs
and <hi>Hacker</hi> pleaded in Abatement, that the Plaintiff before the
Writ purchaſed, brought a <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> againſt the ſame Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants,
and ſhews all certain, which remains undetermined, and
averrs that they are both of the ſame avoidance: And upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer
the Writ was abated by Judgment<note n="e" place="margin">Mich. 15. Jac. rot. 32. C. B. <hi>William</hi> St. <hi>Andrewes</hi> verſ. Arch<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>York</hi> &amp; alios. Hob. Rep.</note>.</p>
               <p>(2.) Aſſize <hi>de utrum</hi> or <hi>Aſſiſa utrum,</hi> is a writ which lieth for
a Parſon againſt a Layman, or for a Layman againſt a Parſon, for
Land and Tenements doubtful, whether it be Lay-Fee or Free
Almes<note n="f" place="margin">Vid. Bract. l 4. Tract. 5. r. 1. &amp; ſeq. Britton. c. 95.</note>. Theſe Writs are called Aſſizes, probably either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they ſettle the poſſeſſion; and ſo an outward Right in him that
obtains by them; or becauſe they were originally executed at a
certain time and place formerly appointed; or becauſe they are
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:95379:369"/>
tryed moſt commonly by eſpecial Courts ſet and appointed for
that purpoſe. The Incumbent, as touching his Right for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory;
hath the onely Writ of <hi>Juris utrum,</hi> and for his poſſeſſion
any other poſſeſſory Action.</p>
               <p>(3.) <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> is a Writ which lieth for him, who hath
purchaſed an Advowſon in Groſs, or a Mannor with an Advow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thereunto appendant, and againſt him, who (when a Parſon
Incumbent dieth, or a Church otherwiſe becomes void) diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the other in the Right of his Advowſon, by preſenting a Clerk
thereunto being void. Vhis Writ is diſtinguiſh'd from the former
of <hi>Darrein Preſentment</hi> or <hi>Aſſiſa ultimae Praeſentationis,</hi> becauſe
this latter lieth (as aforeſaid) onely where a man or his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
formerly preſented, but the <hi>Quare Impedit</hi> lies properly for
him, who himſelf was the Purchaſer of the Advowſon; though
he that may have Aſſize of <hi>Darrein Preſentment,</hi> may have the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
if he pleaſe, but not ſo <hi>Vice verſa,</hi> as was alſo before obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.

                  </note>. It is ſome queſtion, whether the Ordinary may ſuffer
the lapſe to incurr, after it is found on the ſaid Writ for one of the
Patrons? It is ſuppoſed that he may not: For 35 <hi>H. 6. 19. per Priſot.</hi>
he ſhall not have any lapſe after it is found for one of them, for he
is to admit his Clerk<note n="f" place="margin">21 H. 6. 44. 45. Roll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Ordinary is not obliged to admit his Clerk without a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt

               <p>(24.) The <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Spoliation</hi> lies properly by one <hi>Incumbent</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

hath a diſpenſation to hold his Rectory, and after the Patron pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
another Incumbent, who is inſtituted and inducted, the Biſhop
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:95379:372"/>
ſhall have againſt that Incumbent a <hi>Spoliation;</hi> which proves the
Biſhop to continue <hi>Incumbent</hi> after his Conſecration, and to hold his
Rectory by his former Preſentation; and in ancient times it was held,
that where the Pope doth Licence one, who is created a Biſhop, to
retain his former Benefice, and the Patron preſents another, if in
that Caſe the <hi>Elder Incumbent</hi> ſues a <hi>Spoliation</hi> in the Spiritual Court,
it well lies, for both claim by the ſame Patron<note n="i" place="margin">38 H. 6. f. 19. Br. Spoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation pl. 4.</note>. So that if one
happen (during the Incumbents preſentation) to be preſented by

ſo that the Patronage comes not into Debate, a <hi>Spoliation</hi> lies.</p>
               <p>(25.) If any man ſhall hold or keep the poſſeſſion of a Church
by force, ſo that the Biſhop or the Parſon cannot do their office
there, it ſhall be removed by the Kings Writ, called <hi>Vi Laica re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movenda,</hi>
as aforeſaid:<note place="margin">O. N. B. 33. b.</note> which Writ lies eſpecially where the debate
is between two Parſons touching the ſame Church, or Prebendaries,
on the Title, and where the one keeps the other out by Force and
Arms; but by this the Force only ſhall be removed, and not the
Incumbent, who is in poſſeſſion of the Church, whether he be in
poſſeſſion by right or wrong.<note place="margin">F. N. B. 54.</note> And this Writ ſhall be granted on
the bare Surmiſe of the Incumbent, or party greived, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Certificate made by the Biſhop into Chancery, as upon ſuch
Certificate, &amp; alſo by reaſon thereof; and there are two ſeveral forms
of the Writ in theſe two Caſes; which Writ is returnable or not,

                  <hi>S.</hi> was deprived by the high Commiſſioners for not conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Canons of the Church; it was general, <hi>quia Refracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius;</hi>
but no particular Canon mentioned: The King by reaſon of
the ſaid Deprivation, preſented <hi>B.</hi> who was inducted, but <hi>S.</hi>
would not yield up the poſſeſſion of the Parſonage-houſe: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Writ of <hi>Vi Laica</hi> iſſued out of Chancery; the Sheriff came to
the houſe, but could not apprehend the parties; <hi>B.</hi> finding the houſe
empty, entered peaceably; <hi>S.</hi> made an <hi>Affidavit</hi> in <hi>B. R.</hi> that he
was ouſted by the Sheriff by force, and <hi>B.</hi> put in poſſeſſion; the
Court of <hi>B. R.</hi> thereupon granted a Writ of Reſtitution, he having
an Appeal depending of the Deprivation: In this Caſe theſe points
were reſolved; (1) That the Writ <hi>De vi Laica removenda</hi> is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnable
unleſs the Sheriff find the Force. (2) That the Kings
Bench cannot award Reſtitution upon an <hi>Affidavit,</hi> but there ought
to be a Return of the Writ of <hi>Vi Laica &amp;c.</hi> in the Chancery, and
upon Affidavit made there, that the Sheriff by virtue of the Writ
hath removed one and put another in poſſeſſion, Reſtitution is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardable.
(3) Reſolved, that upon a Deprivation by the High
<pb n="652" facs="tcp:95379:373"/>
Commiſſioners no Appeal lieth, becauſe the Commiſſion is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Prerogative of the King, in the Eccleſiaſtical Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and therefore the Commiſſioners being immediate from the
King and poſſeſſing his perſon no Appeal lieth. (4) Reſolved,

               <p>A Leaſe was made of a Rectory, a Parſon was preſented to it,

(as he urged it) he was unlawfully removed: The reaſon being,
that in a <hi>Vi Laica removenda,</hi> whereby he was removed (which

the Sheriff in a <hi>Vi Laica removenda,</hi> had removed one, and put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother

the Court the firſt man removed ſhould be reſtored again or not;
and there reſolved by the whole Court, the ſecond man to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed
again, and the firſt to be reſtored; and <hi>Coke</hi> ſaid, if a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
of Peace remove a Force, he cannot put another into poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:</p>
               <p>(26.) There is a Writ in the <hi>Regiſter, Quod Clerici non Eligan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur

               <p>In the Ninth year of the Reign of King <hi>James,</hi> a queſtion was
