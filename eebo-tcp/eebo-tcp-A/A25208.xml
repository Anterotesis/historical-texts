            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>that he took on him the Person of Sinners:</hi> you must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
that he now refers to a certain Paper drawn up
by some private Ministers, whereof you will hear more
in due time; Now their Words run thus: <hi>We conceive
that the Doctrine of Iustification, and of Christ's Satisfaction,
on which it depends, cannot be duly explained, and defended
consistently with the denial of any Commutation of Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and Believers:</hi> So then according to this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
there must be some Commutation of Persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and Believers. But 1. He has foisted in
those Words <hi>taking on him the Person of Sinners:</hi> 2. That
the Commutation those Brethren speak of, is between
<hi>Christ and Believers;</hi> and therefore I am convinced that
this Reporter will never be trusted in his Arguings, or
repeating of other Mens Words.</p>
            <p>§ 3. And to what end does he thus needlesly multiply
Terms of Art without any apparent necessity, that the
Controversy has of 'em? All that the Case of Sinners
required for Satisfaction to Divine Justice, was <hi>a Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stute,
or Sacrifice to be offered for our Sins;</hi> for the Substi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
to take on him the Punishment due to them; but
to <hi>take upon him the Person of Sinners;</hi> as the Phrase is
new and uncouth, so it's to me unintelligible, till they
who have invented it shall interpret it, and if ever they
should be so ill advised as to give it a fixed Sense, they
must either make it signify no more than that <hi>Christ di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our stead;</hi> or else enlarge it to such a Breadth as
will admit all the Extravagancies of <hi>Antinomianism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. For I will make a fair Motion, or propound a
modest Question: This Phrase of Christ's <hi>taking upon
him the Person of Sinners;</hi> Does it signify <hi>more or less,</hi> than
Christ's taking on him our Sins, and suffering for them
in our Place and Stead; or does it signify <hi>neither more nor
less,</hi> but is just <hi>adaequate</hi> and <hi>commensurate</hi> to, and with it?
If it signifies less, then it limits and narrows the End of
Christ's Sufferings, and will be a Sense only serving the
turn of a <hi>Socinian;</hi> If it signifies more than that, then it
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31985:5"/>
               <hi>comes of evil</hi> and <hi>leads to evil,</hi> even to the Dreggs of <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianism;</hi>
but if it signifies <hi>neither more nor less</hi> than
Christ's standing and suffering in our Place and Stead,
when he offer'd himself to God; then I embrace it, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe
it with my whole Soul. But then what need is
there to pester and vex the Christian Faith with a Word
which signifies <hi>neither more nor less</hi> than that old Term
which has obtain'd so long in the World, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be deceived in it: whereas this new Phrase, Christ
<hi>suffered in, or took upon him the Person of Sinners,</hi> is a Phrase
to puzzle and confound Mens Understandings.</p>
            <p>§ 5. I think therefore we ought in the first place to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what they mean by <hi>the Person of Sinners?</hi> and then
to inquire about <hi>Christ's taking it up.</hi> Does it import that
all Sinners are united, and are to be supposed, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
considered as one Person? and so Christ died, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
satisfied for that one Person? very good! then I
perceive we are tackt about to the Tents of the <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi>
and do suppose that Christ died for all equally:
for if all Sinners be one, or to be reputed as one Person,
and Christ took upon him that one Person, it will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
for all their divi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing and prescinding Skill to make
it out how he died for one, and not for another, seeing
all these Sinners, as in Christ's Eye, are but one single
Person. Now I do not once conceive that this is their
Sense, for they are too far gone the other way: but by
this way of expressing my self, I would provoke and
tempt 'em to fix a tolerable meaning upon the Phrase;
though it were more reasonable that they should choose a
sound Phrase for a sound Meaning, than torture an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible
Phrase into an honest Meaning against its
Will.</p>
            <p>The Purer Primitive Times were wisely concerned
for the preserving the Truth, that they decreed in the

            <p>§ 6. I will shut up this Head of Discourse with this
modest Proposal: Let this Matter be thus worded: <hi>That
Christ in his suffering and dying was considered by God, and
placed himself in the place and stead of all the Elect; so that
he made Satisfaction to the Divine Iustice for all their Sins;
the Benefits and Advantages whereof, every individual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
shall partake of, in that Order and Method, and upon
those Terms, which the Wise and Holy God has prescribed in
the Gospel:</hi> Which Proposition you, and I, and all sober
Persons in the City and Country would readily sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe,
and leave these Gentlemen, who it seems are at
leisure to invent new Controversies, to their own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious
Humours.</p>
            <p>II. The Reporter has miserably imposed upon you <hi>in
Matter of Fact,</hi> nor has he shewn that due Regard to
Truth, which he and all of us owe to so great a Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign:
A few Instances I will give you, that you may
be convinced how little Reason you have to take him or
his Narrative upon their bare Words.</p>
            <p>(1.) One <hi>Specimen</hi> of his Honesty, you shall meet
with at the Entrance of his Paper; and its ominous to
stumble at the Threshold, lest he should break the Neck
of his whole Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And thus in a pompous Stile he breaks into the Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness:</hi>
After sundry Attempts made by the <hi>industrious Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficators,</hi>
an Instrument was pitcht upon, which gave Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to the most Learned of both Parties: This Paper was
sent by Six or Seven of the biggest Name among them, who
do, or at least have gone under the Denomination of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians,
unto some Congregational Brethren, and gladly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:31985:6"/>
Now, Sir, do you not judge that this Instrument
which gave such Satisfaction to, and was so gladly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced
by the Congregational Men, had redintegrated
the violated Union, had reclaimed them who had deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
their former Station; that all Distances were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
removed, and Jealousies and Suspicions of <hi>Socinianism</hi>
on the one side, and <hi>Antinomianism</hi> on the other were
cured, and that a Coalition between the Two Parties
had hereupon ensued; that they were all now got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
again at <hi>Little St. Hellens?</hi> I assure you, Sir, not
one Word of this was true; and that you shall truly
learn from these Particulars:</p>
            <p>1. Whereas he affirms <hi>This gave Satisfaction to the most
Learned of each Party:</hi> what does he then think of Mr.
<hi>Tho. Cole,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Nath. Mather?</hi> are not these to be
reckon'd in the Number of the <hi>most Learned of that Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi>
These great Persons will hardly return him Thanks
for expunging them the Catalogue, unless they judge him
no competent Judge of their Learning.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas he tells us that it gave Satisfaction to the
most Learned of each Party: it appears it gave no Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
at all: For they of the Congregational Interest
never intended to receive such Satisfaction, as to return
to a Re-union; and this was openly avowed by one of
that Number, who was not of the least Name, nor made
the smallest Figure amongst them, That <hi>they never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
to enter into an Union</hi> with the Presbyterians: and
of this I can produce incontestible Proof; this Rational
Jealousy was the Reason why Mr. G. <hi>Hammond</hi> refused
his Hand to that Paper, <hi>yet declaring,</hi> (if the Reporter says
true) <hi>he would gladly have done it, if it might be a mean to
restore Union;</hi> which he had just Grounds to believe it
never would, and therefore refused.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, it was known from first to last through
the whole Transaction of that Affair, that this Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
would never Retrieve the Union; only if they could
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31985:7"/>
get any Advantage by it, to put a Slur upon Mr. <hi>D. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi>
this they would gladly embrace, and then let the
Union shift for it self.</p>
            <p>3. But will you see with your own Eyes how these
Gentlemen <hi>were satisfied, and how gladly they embraced
the first Paper?</hi> Thus it was; After all the Pains taken;
after much Attendance, great Courting of, and Waiting
upon them, they obtained this Little, this No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hing, or
Nothing to the Purpose of Re-union: <hi>They are glad to
find so good an Agreement amongst us, as this Paper doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press:</hi>
No doubt, a little is better than nothing, and so
much Agreement as this comes to, is better than going
to Logerheads: But are there any Expressions that inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
they are satisfied upon the Terms of this Paper to
unite? do they express any embracing of Communion
with one another?</p>
            <p>(2.) I come now to a Second Instance of the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
regard to Truth, where you will easily observe how
by a wretched <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> he has given you <hi>a part for the
whole of a just Narrative.</hi> This is called <hi>the Politicks of
the Pismire,</hi> which nibbles off the Grain at both Ends,
that it may never grow, but come to nothing: Or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
this Report is framed according to the Law of a
<hi>Good Heroick Poem,</hi> which, our Criticks tell us, must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
commence at the middle of the Story; This is the
Method of our Reporter, who enters upon his Report
about the Middle of his Matter, and therefore expect a
pure <hi>Poetical Fiction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He begins with the Mention of <hi>Pacification:</hi> I think
he should have informed his <hi>Country Friend;</hi> That there
was once an Union; that this Union was broken; and
then who they were that made the Breach, and upon
what Grounds; and how the Breach was pieced up
again; and then how it was without any visible Reason
broken again; and then he might seasonably have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
upon the Story of his so celebrated Attempts for
Pacification: Now, Sir, to supply the Deficiency of his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31985:7"/>
Story, I'll give you a full and faithful Account of the
whole, wherein I shall inform you of nothing but what
you know already.</p>
            <p>§ 1. In the Year 1691. After many Meetings of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
of both Persuasions, after frequent Applications
to the Throne of Grace; certain Heads of Agrement
were drawn up, and assented to by about Eighty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> and by some
others in a little time. This Agreement was solemnly
transacted, and seriously concluded with this Protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<hi>As we Assent to the forementioned Heads of Agreement,
so we Unanimously Resolve, as the Lord shall enable us, to
Practise according to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Amongst those Heads assented to, the Eighth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
the <hi>Test and Standard of Orthodoxy,</hi> and speaks thus:
<hi>As to what appertains to Soundness of Iudgment in Matters
of Faith, we esteem it sufficient that a Church acknowledge</hi>
the Scriptures to be the Word of God, the Perfect and
only Rule of Faith and Practice; <hi>and own either the
Doctrinal Part of those commonly called the Articles of the
Church of</hi> England; or the <hi>Confession, or Catechisms short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
or larger, compiled by the Assembly at</hi> Westminster; or
the <hi>Confession agreed on at the</hi> Savoy, <hi>to be agreeable to the
said Rule.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Agreement was the Honour and Strength of the
Dissenters, and in the Practice of which they made the
greatest Figure in the Eyes of all wise Men: They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the Rejoycing of their Friends, the Envy of
their Enemies, to whom they had formerly been a
Scorn.</p>
            <p>In the Practice of this Union they walked together
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaceably, holding Communion in Prayer, Preaching
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Word, and Sacraments; mutually strengthning the
Hands of each other, consulting, counselling and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng,
and assisting one another; and one of the great
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lessings of this Union was, that they contributed to the
Relief of their poorer Brethren in the Country, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31985:8"/>
and encouraging them in the Work of the
Lord.</p>
            <p>§ 2. But a little before this, 1690 a new Impression,
of Dr. <hi>Crisp</hi>'s Works, with an Addition of some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
came into the World, which was judged by some
to contain divers strange Doctrines, ether evidently Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous,
or of dubious Construction, creating a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
in some tender Minds, lest some Doctrines were
openly vouched, or secretly couched in them which
might disturb the Harmony of the Confession they had
signed, and without great Care and Caution, might
weaken, if not dissolve the Union.</p>
            <p>§ 3. This awaken'd some of the more Zealous among
the United Brethren to consider of some proper Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient
to obviate the growth of those Errors: Amongst
and before the rest, Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> a Brother of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
composed a Book stiled, <hi>Gospel Truth Stated and Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated,
wherein some of Dr.</hi> Crisp'<hi>s Errors are considered,</hi>
&amp;c. A Book, to say no more, ingeniously Penned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
exactly Methodized, the Truths and Errors fairly Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and for ought I can see, piously designed. To this
Book upon its first Edition, several Ministers gave their
Judgment thus far; <hi>That he had (in all that was material)
fully and rightly stated the Truths and Errors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
second Edition many more gave their Iudgment of it in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
same Words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 4. But now, Sir, as if <hi>Aeolus</hi> had opened all the
Treasures of his blustring Winds; or a Flood-Gate had
been drawn up to let in the Sea upon us; such a Storm
of Passion, such Indignation against the Author and his
Book, broke out, as had almost overset the United Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
with their Union, if Providence had not timously
interposed by a powerful Word; <hi>Peace, be Still!</hi>

            <p>In this Juncture, there were some Brethren piously
disposed, and with sincere Intentions no doubt, who
would be doing something, though they little knew
what that something should be, or what would be the
Success of it; and that would make another Attempt

calls, and may they deserve to be so called, <hi>the industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

            </p>
            <p>Now these acting upon their personal Account, and
without Instructions or Directions from the Body of
the United Ministers, held many Meetings, had many
Debates, the Product whereof was a Paper signed by
Nine of those Brethren who had put their Names to

premised a few Things.</p>
            <p>(1.) The Body of the United Ministers did not, could
not look on themselves as concluded or bound up by
the former Paper, because it was managed without their
Privity, and however without their Order.</p>
            <p>(2.) Therefore they proceeded upon the whole matter
as intire and clear in it self, not prepossessed by, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced
against it, but as free, and in their own Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to resolve as God and their own Consciences should
direct them.</p>
            <p>(3.) And yet they carried it with a decent respect to
those of their Brethren who had engaged in the drawing
up the former Paper, and accordingly retained as much
of that Paper as they safely could, and drew-up this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Conformity to the former, saving in some Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions

Sense, or dangerous Consequence.</p>
            <p>(4.) They well knew that those Brethren who had a
and in penning the first Paper, laboured under some
conveniencies in that whole Transaction, from which

how would they have reviled him had he spoken <hi>hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly,</hi>

               </gap>
new Phrases, the Socinians are as pregnant in Equivoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and Interpretations to elude and evade the new
Terms; and you must be put to the needless trouble to
make new Intrenchments as they distinguish you out o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of that too? and so you must make and coin new
Terms and Phrases <hi>in infinitum.</hi>

            <p>§ 3. I will therefore in Charity (if you are pleased to

you suspect that any under a sound Expression conceals
an unsound Meaning, ask him, if he understands it
<hi>properly in a legal Sense,</hi> or no? ask him, if he means that
<hi>Christ suffered in our stead as a Sacrifice to satisfy God's Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice?</hi>
and there you have driven him to the end of his
Equivocations, for which Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> has given you
the only proper Draught in the place I have already ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified.
And beyond this you cannot go, unless you
will have recourse to the <hi>Rack</hi> or <hi>Spanish Inquisition,</hi> which
is a Remedy worse than the Disease.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:31985:18"/>
§ 4. I add one thing more: If both these Phrases,
<hi>Christ's suffering and dying in our place and stead;</hi> and that
other, <hi>A Change of Persons between Christ and us,</hi> be liable
to be thus practised upon by Men of great Wit and little
Conscience; and that no Terms can be found out so
plain, but crafty Heads will suborn them into an evil
Meaning, I would then a Thousand times sooner chuse,
to adhere to this Phrase, <hi>Christ suffered and died in our
stead and place,</hi> [loco nostro, vice nostra] than to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
In the Sufferings of Christ, there was <hi>a Change of
Persons between Christ and us:</hi> For the former has had its
Signification strongly fixed and setled, by long usage and
prescription; whereas this latter is but of Yesterday,
and scarce Two Persons, no not the Inventers, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
amongst themselves, what Sense to stamp upon it.
Again, the plainest Christians have a tolerable Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of the former; whereas the other does but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse
and confound them: Nor is it so dangerous to the
Main of the Cause, to mistake in the one as in the
other; for he that by Christ's <hi>suffering in our stead</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
he <hi>suffered for our good,</hi> speaks the Truth; but he
that mistakes in the Sense of <hi>Commutation of Persons,</hi> may
err the whole Heavens, and mis-lead himself and others
into the Dreggs of Antinomianism.</p>
            <p>In a Word therefore; The Socinians are Subtle, and
have put a false Gloss upon <hi>Christ's dying in our stead;</hi>
shall we therefore discharge that Phrase? so have
they put a false one upon <hi>Commutation of Persons;</hi> shall
we therefore by the same Reason discharge that also?
Why, they have put as absurd a Sense upon the Term
<hi>Satisfaction;</hi> which with them signifies no more than Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
made <hi>to the Will or Wisdom of God:</hi> must we
therefore relinquish that too? Then we give them up
the whole Cause: How much more advisable would it
be, to keep to the old Land Marks, and adhere to what
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> with all that are sound in the Faith, have
asserted; <hi>That Christ suffered and died in our place and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31985:19"/>
stead, as a Sacrifice to satisfy Divine Justice;</hi> and then let
the <hi>Socinians,</hi> and whoever have a wicked Mind, try
their Skill in evading and eluding it.</p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>A Second heavy Charge against Mr.</hi> Williams <hi>is,
That he absolutely</hi> denies a Change of Persons between
Christ and the Elect: <hi>to which the united Brethren in
their Third Paper (as he calls it) give a clear Answer;</hi>
That it could not be intended as a denial of a Change of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
between Christ and us in a general Sense, but only in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
to the Opinion of his Adversary, he wrote against,
for in that very Place he expresly affirms, That Christ suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and died in our stead: <hi>That is, Mr.</hi> Williams <hi>did not
deny</hi> a Change of Person, simpliciter, sed secundum quid;
<hi>not</hi> universally, <hi>but</hi> restrictively; <hi>for the most</hi> universal
<hi>Terms are not always</hi> universally <hi>to be understood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Manuscript will not acquiesce in this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.</p>
            <p>§ 1. <hi>He therefore says;</hi> That his denial of a Change of
Persons between Christ and the Elect, or between Christ and
Believers, is so express and full, that he leaves no room for
a distinction, limitation or restriction, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To which I return this; Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> has left room
enough for all the Distinctions that are proper to the
Matter in hand; for thus he expresses himself: <hi>Gosp.
Truth. p. 33. 2 Edit. The difference lies in these Points:</hi> 1.
<hi>Whether there be a Change of Person between Christ and the
Elect? yea, or between Christ and Believers? This the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
affirms, and I deny:</hi> Whence I argue; Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>
denies nothing, was concerned to deny nothing, but
what the Doctor had affirmed; but the Doctor had af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
a wild, monstrous Sense of Change of Person
between Christ and the Elect, or Believers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> did not, could not deny any thing
else, according to all the Rules and Laws of pertinent
Discourse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:31985:19"/>
               <hi>Now then the Determination of what Mr.</hi> Williams
denies, <hi>must depend on the knowing what it was the
Doctor</hi> affirm'd: <hi>and for this see</hi> pag. 31. <hi>where he cites
Dr.</hi> Crisp, <hi>speaking thus;</hi> Marke it well! Christ himself
is not so compleatly Righteous, but we are as Righteous as he;
nor we so compleatly sinful, but Christ became, being made
Sin, as compleatly sinful as we; Nay more, we are the same
Righteousness; for we are made the Righteousness of God;
That very sinfulness which we were, Christ is made the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
sinfulness: So that here is a direct Change; Christ takes
our Person and Condition, and stands in our stead; we take
Christ's Person and Condition, and stand in his stead: So
that if you reckon well, you must always reckon your selves in
anothers Person, and that other in your Person. <hi>And now
you have it, what is that Change of Persons, which the</hi>
Doctor affirms, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Williams denies; <hi>which had he
not, he had denied his Redeemer and betrayed the
Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 2. But the <hi>Manuscript</hi> comes upon Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> with
his Logical Talent, <hi>p. 8. The Negation of a Change is so
general,</hi> that unless <hi>no Change signify a Change; and a</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
<hi>is of the same import with an</hi> Affirmative, <hi>you will
never be able to find him allowing of a Change of Person be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Christ and us,</hi> &amp;c. This case is very hard, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess;
for of all Morsels, I never loved to swallow a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction:
But the Question is, where the Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
lies? They that would find it between Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>
and the United Brethren, must seek elsewhere: They
affirm the same things. If they will find it between Mr.
<hi>Williams</hi> and Dr. <hi>Crisp,</hi> they need not look far, <hi>the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
affirms, Mr.</hi> Williams <hi>denies:</hi> but now to find Mr.
<hi>Williams</hi> contradicting himself, that would be sweet!
Why does not he <hi>own a Change,</hi> and yet <hi>deny a Change?</hi>
he does so! yet without any Contradiction to himself or
the Truth.</p>
            <p>There is nothing more nauseous to an understanding
Reader than to see a Man Paratragaediate in Trifles, and
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:31985:20"/>
to raise a mighty Storm in a sorry Bucket of Water. A
Change and no Change! Yea, and Nay! Did this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
in good earnest never hear or read, that single
Terms or Propositions, which are really contradictory,
must be spoken or intended, <hi>Ad idem, eodem modo, eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem
respectu, eodem Tempore:</hi> Suppose I should tell him,
<hi>Lazarus was dead,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus was not dead;</hi> he'll cry
out perhaps, O horrid Contradiction! O barbarous
Nonsense. But be not so fierce, both are true: he <hi>was
dead</hi> before Christ raised him, and <hi>not dead</hi> when Christ
said <hi>loose him and let him go:</hi> To what purpose then do
they fill our Ears with the Din of an imaginary Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
which has no Ground but in the Fansy and
Wind of their own Heads.</p>

Contradiction:</hi> Ay, but our Manuscript thinks he has

Adversary affirmed a Change.</hi> But to what purpose should
he tell you it, when you stop your Ears; or to what
end shew you it, when you are blinded with Prejudice,
or Wink very hard and will not see? He has told it to
all the World besides; every one else can hear it, see it,
or read it: only he has not told it you, because you do,

To which I reply. 1. <hi>As we may call it,</hi> is not opposed
<hi>to Reality,</hi> and the Criticks do commonly observe that
there is a <hi>sicut veritatis,</hi> as well as <hi>similitudinis;</hi> and we
must expect when the Humour takes him to cavil at the
Apostle, who <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 9. uses a like Phrase; <hi>And as I
may so say,</hi> Levi <hi>also, who received Tythes, paid Tythes to</hi>
Abraham: The Phrase there does not deny the Truth
of the thing; but is a Form of Speech wherewith we
usually mollify an Expression, which to tender Ears
may seem a little harsh and strange: such as these Terms,
<hi>Legal and Iudicial,</hi> might do to vulgar Understandings.

But still the Manuscript proceeds in his objecting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty;
<hi>A Commutation in a Legal Sense, is the same with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>
proper Surrogation;</hi> and what is <hi>a proper Surrogation,</hi> but a
placing one Person in the room and place of another
And thus God placed his Son, and the Son so placed him
self in our room and stead, and he was a Sacrifice to
satisfy Divine Justice: Are they not all agreed? One
would think so! Ay, but there is more at the Bottom
what is that? why, <hi>where the surety puts on the Person and
stands in the Quality, State and Condition of the Debtor, and
lies under the same Obligation to answer for him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wish I were worthy to advise this confident Man
not to insist so strictly upon that Notion, of <hi>Debt and
Debtor:</hi> For if he supposes Sin to be only <hi>a Pecuniary Debt</hi>
and that the Sinner stands only obliged as <hi>such a Debtor</hi>
he has betrayed the Cause he seems so zealous to defend
and yielded it up irrecoverably to the <hi>Socinians!</hi>
And this is that which the Learned Author of <hi>the
Reasons of Christ's Sufferings,</hi> p. 269. has warned him
of long since: <hi>The true state of the Controversy</hi> (says he)
<hi>has been rendred more obscure by the Mistakes of some, who
have managed it with greater Zeal than Iudgment,</hi> (he had
never seen the <hi>Report</hi> nor <hi>Manuscript) and by this means
have shot over their Adversaries Heads, and laid their own
more open to Assaults. It's easy to observe that most of the
Socinians Arguments are levelled against an Opinion, which
few who have considered these things do maintain, and none
need think themselves obliged to do it. That Christ paid a
rigid and proper Satisfaction for the Sins of Men, under the
Notion of a Debt,</hi> &amp;c. The Sinner therefore is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered
as a <hi>Malefactor,</hi> who has forfeited his Life to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
and here the <hi>Surrogation</hi> and <hi>Substitution</hi> of Christ
intervenes, who has by Agreement between his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and him, offered himself as a Sacrifice to Satisfy
Divine Justice.</p>

            <p>Sir, It's time, high time that I ease you and my self
of this trouble, and I will effectually discharge you,
when I have left with you a few Queries, which you
may consider at your Leasure.</p>
            <p>§ 1. Do you understand the true Reason why these
Gentlemen in the City will not be persuaded to settle
the true Notion of <hi>Christ's taking on him the Person of
Sinners? dying in the Person of Sinners?</hi> For I find that
the true Reason why some do not subscribe it, is because
they do not understand it: and yet on the other side,
there are some who say, they understand it too well to
subscribe it; there are yet some who affirm, that the
Words have only this honest plain Meaning, that Christ
suffered and died in the place and stead of Sinners, to
make Satisfaction to Divine Justice, for them, and for
their Obligations to his violated Law: but then, should
they declare as much, all the Design would be defeated
and utterly blown up, for then Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
subscribe it.</p>
            <p>§ 2. Pray, Sir, inform me <hi>Quo Warranto?</hi> By what
Right do these Gentlemen impose such hard Terms of
Union and Communion? Why must all the World be
Hereticated that dare not subscribe to these <hi>Apocryphal
Phrases,</hi> which neither Scripture nor Ancient Fathers,
nor General, nor Particular Councils, nor Synods, nor
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:31985:25"/>
Assemblies, nor Nation reformed, nor single Churches
ever brought into their Creeds, Confessions, or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of Faith, to be the Standard, or Test of Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy,
or the Terms of Communion? And I am the
more earnest in this Query, because the Dissenters for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
have complained heavily, That <hi>some things were
imposed on them as necessary to Communion, which were n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
ways necessary to Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>§ 3. And I would be satisfied how it comes to pass
that if these Terms insisted on, be necessary to support
the Doctrines of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> and <hi>Iustification;</hi> they
themselves never once mentioned or moved, or insisted
on them, that they might be inserted into the <hi>Heads of
Agreement,</hi> upon which they united in 1691. nor into
those Articles debated, agitated at <hi>Great Pinners-Hall,</hi> and
afterwards agreed to, at <hi>Little St. Hellens,</hi> where yet the
highest, hottest, and greatest Names of the Contender<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
did subscribe to the Articles <hi>of the Person of the Mediator
and of Iustification,</hi> when yet not a Word or Syllable o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

Person of Sinners,</hi> &amp;c. was once spoke of, and therefore
conclude were never then thought of; 1692.</p>
            <p>§ 4. I wish you could inform me, whether they have
received any new Revelations, or made any new Disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries

like it? what do you think of it? again we are told,
p. 7. of <hi>Christ's sustaining the Person of Sinners:</hi> Now,
good Sir, what is <hi>sustinere Personam alterius?</hi> What then

Spirit that runs through the whole of the <hi>Report,</hi> and
<hi>Manuscript?</hi> They would both make us believe how
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:31985:27"/>
grieved, how afflicted they are that this Third Paper
was sent, and the former rejected, by the Body of the
United Brethren, <hi>p. 5. this is one thing that grieves the
Offended Brethren:</hi> and <hi>another Passage increaseth their Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi>
&amp;c. And p. 7. <hi>we cannot but be grieved to observe,</hi>
&amp;c. and p. 11. <hi>they have added to the Grief of the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Brethren:</hi> Now do not you in the Country fancy
from these Expressions, that they have been melted and
drowned in Floods of Grief and Sorrow? And why
then did they not grieve to make the Breach in the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
to break it again, when it seemed to be closed up;
in all which they were certainly the Aggressors: And
why did not they advance one single Step towards the
Re-union, upon the signing of the First Paper? They
had time enough between that and the sending of the
other: which may remember you of what you read in
some Naturalists, that the <hi>Crocodile</hi> weeps over his Prey
and then devoures it.</p>
            <p>Of the same Temper you will interpret the Repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
strange Transport of Passion, with which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes:
<hi>To the All Wise God, be render'd Honour, and
Glory, that the indefatigable pains of the Pacificators have
issued out in so happy an Agreement of the most Godly, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

POSTSCRIPT.</head>

               <salute>READER!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THOU mayest possibly wonder that the <hi>Report</hi> and
<hi>Manuscript</hi> should bear so hard upon the <hi>Third Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi>
and yet so graciously smile upon the <hi>First:</hi> and
what <hi>sufficient Causes</hi> there can be conceived, to justify
their height of Passion against the One, and yet the
most endeared Affection towards the Other. But the
Secret will manifest it self, when thou shalt consider,
that all this is nothing but a Trial of Skill between the
<hi>Apocryphal Story of Tobias,</hi> and the <hi>Canonical History of
Daniel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that I may deliver thee from this uneasy posture
of Soul, I will set before thee the Mystery in a clear
Light, that so thou mayest be capable of using thy Eyes;
and therefore know:</p>
            <p>I. <hi>That the true Reason of their severe Displeasure
conceived against the</hi> Third Paper <hi>is, that it has so
clearly and fully born its Testimony against the</hi> Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians
<hi>in the Fundamental Article of</hi> Iustification: <hi>And
thus it speaks:</hi> We further declare, as to to the special mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in difference concerning <hi>Justification:</hi> That although
the express Word of God doth assert, the necessity of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to our entring into the Kingdom of God: and requires
Repentance that our Sins may be blotted out; and Faith in
Christ, that we may be justified; and Holiness of Heart and
Life, without which we cannot see God: <hi>Yet that</hi> none of
these, or any Work done by Man, or wrought by the Spirit
of God in them, is under any Denomination whatsoever, any
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31985:28"/>
part of that Righteousness, for the sake, or on the account of
which, God doth pardon, justify or accept Sinners; or inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
them to Eternal Life: That being only the Righteousness
of Christ without them, imputed to them, and received by
Faith alone.</p>
            <p>From hence it is most evident, that the Brethren have
secured the Doctrine of <hi>Iustification</hi> against the <hi>Socinian,
Papal,</hi> and <hi>Arminian</hi> Errors; and themselves too, from
all, even the least Suspicion of any Inclination that
way, with all impartial, reasonable and indifferent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
by the <hi>latter Clause:</hi> Yet the <hi>former,</hi> by which
they were willing to give a fair Opportunity to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
Party, to vindicate themselves from all Jealousy
of leaning towards <hi>Antinomianism,</hi> is the <hi>unpardonable
Sin</hi> against Dr. <hi>Crisp;</hi> which shall <hi>never be forgiven</hi> by
the <hi>Reporter,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Manuscript;</hi> if they may
carry the Keys of <hi>Admission</hi> and <hi>Exclusion, Absolution</hi> and
<hi>Condemnation</hi> at their Girdles.</p>
            <p>II. As I have now given the secret Reason of their
immortal Pike against the Third Paper, so will I grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy
the Reader with the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or secret Reason of
their over-passionate Fondness to the <hi>former,</hi> and that
must be wholly ascribed to its Severity upon Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams.</hi>
And let it be observed that a few hard Words
and Censures upon him, shall at any time, even in their
most morose Hours, purchase their Good Will and
Friendship: And <hi>this Paper</hi> having honoured them
herein to the utmost, could not fail of insinuating it
self into their Favours. Mark therefore the Conditions
of his Peace, and the Terms of being restored to some
small degree of Acceptance: <hi>If therefore, Mr.</hi> Williams
<hi>shall concur with us in what we have declared, touching the
Doctrine of Iustification; and in the sense we have given of</hi>
a Change of Persons between Christ and Believers; <hi>and
of</hi> Christ's undertaking the Displeasure of his Father for
our Sins; <hi>and shall give Satisfaction about any thing else,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:31985:29"/>
that any Brother excepts against in the rest of his Writings,
agreeably to the abovesaid Articles and Confessions, we shall
so far acquiesee therein, as not to make them the Matter of
further publick Contest or Altercation amongst our selves.</hi>
Was ever a poor Creature thus tyed to a Stake to be
baited by the English <hi>Molossi,</hi> and every whaffing Whelp
that could bark, though not bite? Must a Man stand
in the Pillory all his Days, there to be palted with rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
Eggs, till they can find no more to throw at him?
how much more merciful were the Terms put upon the
Men of <hi>Iabesh-Gilead</hi> by <hi>Nahash, 1 Sam.</hi> 11. 2. he
would only <hi>thrust out their right Eyes;</hi> but these would
cut off his <hi>right Hand too:</hi> And now because the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in their <hi>Third Paper,</hi> exprest more Humanity, durst
not be so unreasonably cruel, but proposed more mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Terms, the Former Paper must be cried up above
the Skies, and the Latter thrown down to Hell.</p>
            <p>Reader, thou shalt pardon me if I exercise thy Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in making some Remarks upon the <hi>Conditions</hi> of
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his <hi>Absolution;</hi> the rather, because they are
wiser than to allow <hi>any for their own:</hi> And first I will
observe the <hi>Conditions required,</hi> and then the <hi>Grace promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi>
upon fulfilling the Conditions.</p>
            <p>§ 1. And for the <hi>Conditions required.</hi> The <hi>Three for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Conditions,</hi> I will not mention to save time and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
but the last Condition, which is a Complex of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I will a little, though gently examine: <hi>If he shall give
Satisfaction about any thing else, that any Brother excepts
against, in the rest of his Writings.</hi> Now here we have
what he must give, and then <hi>to whom</hi> he must give, it,
and then, <hi>how far</hi> he must give Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>What is it</hi> they expect Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> should give?
<hi>Satisfaction.</hi> But what will satisfy? he has given already
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ust and reasonable Satisfaction; he has subscribed the
<hi>Assemblies Confession of Faith;</hi> he has subscribed the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of Iustification</hi> drawn up by themselves, 1692. he
has subscribed <hi>the Article of Iustification</hi> in the Third
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:31985:29"/>
Paper, which satisfies all but <hi>Socinians, Arminians, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi>
and <hi>Antinomians:</hi> And must he satisfy them that
are resolved nothing shall satisfy? These Terms savour
too much of Empire over Souls, and Dominion over
the Consciences and Faith of Men: Let them tell him
explicitly and plainly what will content them, and not
vex Men with indefinite, unlimited Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>(2.) But <hi>to whom</hi> must he give this <hi>Satisfaction?</hi> why
truly to <hi>any Brother?</hi> I wish they had confined their
Number to—About Twenty Thousand; That had
given some Possibility, at least some little Hope that he
might at last have given Satisfaction. But to <hi>any</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is really hard: For in what Sense must he interpret
<hi>Brother?</hi> In a <hi>general</hi> Sense, it may reach all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind;
in a much <hi>narrower</hi> it may include all Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants,
Reformed at least: But suppose it extends to
none but <hi>Independents,</hi> where there are no <hi>Clergy-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi>
nor <hi>Lay-Brothers,</hi> it would find him picking Work
for one Ten Years at least: But what if these <hi>any
Brothers,</hi> should prove weak and injudicious? What if
cavilling and captious? What if proud and imperious,
Their Character as well as Number, would render it
next to impossible to satisfy them: and what if one
will be satisfied and another dissatisfied? this will sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
the Performance of the Promise for his Life;
and I know no way for him to satisfy all, but by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the World; to which I will never advise him,
least some other should be set up in his Place and
Stead, with whom to quarrel, and of whom to
demand Satisfaction; and I am not sure but I may be
the Man.</p>
            <p>(3.) <hi>How far</hi> must this <hi>Satisfaction</hi> extend? <hi>To any
thing else, excepted against in the rest of his Writings?</hi> I
am glad however this allows no Exceptions against his
Thoughts; though the Manuscript has adventured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that too: Here's a wide Field for Exceptions; for
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> has written a pretty many things, and it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:31985:30"/>
were hard, if <hi>Ten Thousand Men,</hi> having <hi>Ten Thousand
Sentences</hi> to except against, could not make Earnings of
it for three Lives, and the longest Liver of them, and
so they have entailed the fibble frabble to succeeding
Generations. You have heard the hard Terms required,
will you</p>
            <p>§ 2. Now hear the <hi>Favours promised</hi> upon his fulfilling
the Conditions: <hi>We shall so far acquiesce therein as not to
make them the Matter of farther publick Contest or Altercation
amongst our selves. O quantum oh quantillum!</hi> What a
World of Work must he do for such sorry Wages!
what severe Penance for this hungry Absolution! Will
they acquiesce? O no! <hi>but so far only!</hi> How far?
pray, that he may know the worst on't! they will
make <hi>no further Contest:</hi> Well, but if they make <hi>no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
they may keep the old or the present Contests a
foot still; but will they promise to make <hi>no further Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test;</hi>
not to raise new Objections, pick new Quarrels;
but be content with the old ones? I mistake; They
will make no further <hi>Publick</hi> Contests; but Private
Whisperings and evil Surmises, and insinuated Slanders,
and clan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>estine Reproaches may be multiplied,
whilst Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> lives, and 'tis to be feared,
will feed upon his Carcase, and survive his Dust and
Ashes.</p>
            <p>To shut up this ungrateful Subject; those very Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
who from amongst the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> had some,
concern in this <hi>First Paper,</hi> after having heard the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and Reasonings of the United Brethren, being
satisfied that they had gone beyond the Bounds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
did ingenuously (to say no more) joyn with
their brethren of a more benign Temper, in the <hi>Third
Paper,</hi> which is that Crime, amongst some others, which
these Bigotts will never forgive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:31985:30"/>
III. Give me leave, Reader, to bestow one thought
more, upon the <hi>Manuscriptors</hi> tragical Harangue, upon
Mr. <hi>Williams</hi>'s pretended <hi>Contradiction: A Change</hi> and <hi>no
Change!</hi> what, <hi>a Negative of the same import with an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative!
Yea and Nay, Words of the same Signification!
Crimen inauditum Cai Caesar!</hi> But did he never hear or
read of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>a Gift and no Gift?</hi> I make no
question but he had heard of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
and no Marriage:</hi> and though there might be some
Solaecism in't <hi>Theotogically,</hi> yet it was no <hi>Grammatical</hi> or
<hi>Logical Contradiction:</hi> and if the one of these does not
offend his tender Ears, nor the other grate upon his
tender Conscience, he might have spared his pompous
Rhetorick upon <hi>a Change and no Change!</hi> Nor indeed in
this Case; does a Change <hi>signify</hi> no Change: Nor is a
<hi>Negative</hi> of <hi>the same import</hi> with <hi>an Affirmative:</hi> Nor
yet are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> Words of the <hi>same Signification</hi>
(as he childishly Fancies) but that there may be <hi>a
Change</hi> (in a certain Sense) which is well consistent with
<hi>no Change</hi> in another Sense, without the mortal Hazard
of a Contradiction; even as he that may be said to be
<hi>Married</hi> and yet <hi>not Married,</hi> may be said also with
equal Truth, to have <hi>Changed,</hi> and yet <hi>not Changed
his Condition:</hi> Of which some may have heard on
both sides of their Ears.</p>
            <p>IV. Reader, Thou hast heard much noise about that
Book, <hi>Gospel Truth stated and vindicated,</hi> &amp;c. and of
the <hi>Subscription</hi> to it by some Ministers; I could wish
thou wouldest be so true to thy self, and just to the
Subscribers, as to view with thine own Eyes how far the
Subscription extended; for this is the pretended and
assigned Reason of their Fire and Faggot, with which
they have presented it and them: It was no more than
this: <hi>They judged that he had in all that was material, fully
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:31985:31"/>
and rightly stated the Truths and Errors therein mentioned.</hi>
Now if the things be not <hi>rightly and fully stated, in
all that is material,</hi> why have not these Gentlemen,
with all their Acuteness and Exactness, stated them
better?</p>
            <p>The same Quarrel they had formerly raised against
the <hi>Book and the Subscriptions,</hi> or rather against the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and Subscribers,</hi> which most Men thought had been
composed, and full Satisfaction given, and in which the
opposite Party did acquiesce; as appears from the
printed Transactions of <hi>Dec.</hi> 16. 1692. But it seems they
reserved some Seeds of further and future Quarrels in
their own Breasts, and had smothered some secret
sparks of Contention under the Ashes of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance,
which now after some Years they have blown
up into a greater Flame: But if they were then satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
why are they now dissatisfied? And whence is it,
that in the <hi>First Paper,</hi> they have changed the former
Declaration into this other: <hi>That the Generality had given
their Names only to a short Abstract of Truths, and Errors
which they had seen</hi> (and since is much enlarged) <hi>and not
to the Book it self, which they had not seem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Reader! Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and the <hi>Generality of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribers</hi>
do hereby demand Justice of the Authors of this
Assertion; and they doubt not thou wilt do 'em Right,
upon this Evidence:</p>
            <p>1. The Author doth protest there was never yet <hi>any
Abstract, short or long, of the Truths and Errors,</hi> since they
were first <hi>stated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the State of the Truths and Errors <hi>was seen
by all that Subscribed,</hi> and Printed before any one Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas there were Sixteen who Suscribed the
<hi>First Impression,</hi> and Three and Thirty who gave their
Names <hi>to the Second;</hi> there were three or Four of the
First Sixteen who had read, not only the State of the
Truths and Errors, but the Book it self: And therefore

            <p>I will conclude with this; If these Contenders will
