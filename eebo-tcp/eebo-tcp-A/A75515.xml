            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Apothecaries Reply to the City's Printed Reaſons againſt Their Bill.</head>
            <head type="sub">Humbly Submitted to the Conſideration of the Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Aſſembled.</head>
            <p>FIRST, It is alledg'd againſt the Bill, That the <hi>Ground</hi> thereof is <hi>Falſe;</hi> viz. <hi>That the Apothecaries ſerving Pariſh, Ward, and Leet-Offices, takes up ſo much of their Time, that they cannot perform their Truſt in their Trade, or attend their Patients according to their Duty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This Suggeſtion had been indeed <hi>Falſe,</hi> could thoſe ſeveral Offices have been executed <hi>without</hi> employing any time therein.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſuggeſted, That the <hi>Duty</hi> of (and the only <hi>Truſt</hi> repoſed in) the <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> is to make and compound their Medicines, and <hi>then</hi> to carry or <hi>ſend</hi> them by their reſpective Servants (as other Tradeſmen do.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> It were for the <hi>Eaſe</hi> and <hi>Intereſt</hi> of the Apothecaries to wiſh, that their Attendance were never required, and that the Neceſſity of the Cafe did never <hi>diſpenſe</hi> with their adminiſtring Phyſick without a Phyſician's Preſcription: But it is ſo <hi>Notorious</hi> in <hi>Fact</hi> as it needs no Proof, That did not the Apothecaries in Charity <hi>Give</hi> to many both their <hi>Attendance</hi> and <hi>Phyſick,</hi> ſome Thouſands <hi>would periſh,</hi> ſeeing their unhappy <hi>Incapacity</hi> can pay for neither.</p>
            <p>This is not alledg'd to plead for a <hi>Liberty</hi> of Practice, but only to <hi>expoſe</hi> the <hi>evident Falſity</hi> of the Suggeſtion: And it's preſumed, <hi>ſcarce</hi> any that <hi>oppoſe</hi> this Bill would <hi>employ that Apothecary</hi> who ſhould <hi>only ſend his Servants refuſing in Perſon to viſit,</hi> whilſt he was under a Phyſical Preſcription.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas it is ſuggeſted, That <hi>moſt</hi> of the Offices in the Bill mentioned may be <hi>executed</hi> by Deputy:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is <hi>equally, Chargeable</hi> with Fining: <hi>And if the Perſonal Attendance of this Profeſſion in thoſe Offices is not conſiſtent with the Common Intereſt, It's humbly ſubmitted to the Great Wiſdom of this Right Honourable Houſe, Whether it's rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that the Profeſſors ſhould be thus charged; for that is in effect,</hi> with humble Submiſſion, <hi>obliging this Profeſſion to <hi>buy</hi> an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption for a General Good.</hi> Which (with all due Submiſſion) it may be hop'd this Honourable Parliament will now <hi>Grant without Price.</hi> For <note place="margin">☞</note> in none of thoſe Laws, Statutes, or Cuſtoms, that have (for a General Good) exempted Lawyers both Common and Civil, Attorneys, Proctors,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Surgeons, was it thought equitable to oblige any of thoſe Profeſſions, by <hi>Fines</hi> or other Impoſitions, to <hi>buy</hi> ſuch Exemptions.</hi> Neither was it in any of the above Inſtances thought proper (upon <hi>giving</hi> ſuch Exemptions to any of the before-mention'd Profeſſions) to <hi>diſable</hi> any of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors from ſuch <hi>Common Rights</hi> (as Voting) in any Election whatſoever; that being <hi>depriving</hi> men of a <hi>Right</hi> which all degrees of men in <hi>ſome reſpect</hi> enjoy. <note place="margin">☞</note> Neither (with all due Submiſſion) would thoſe Laws have ſeem'd <hi>conſiſtent</hi> with themſelves, that ſhould in <hi>one</hi> part have <hi>given</hi> an Immunity or Privilege to a <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> whoſe <hi>very Profeſſors</hi> by the <hi>ſame</hi> Statute ſhould be <hi>puniſh'd</hi> by being <hi>depriv'd</hi> of a Common Right. And <hi>this <hi>without</hi>
               </hi> any <hi>Offence</hi> by them committed; <hi>unleſs it can be ſaid to be a <hi>Crime</hi> for men to <hi>receive</hi> ſuch Benefits as the Legiſlators</hi> (for the Good of <hi>Mankind)</hi> think fit to <hi>give.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſuggeſted, That the Apothecaries are <hi>Ambitious</hi> of ſeveral Offices of <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> in which as much of their Time is ſpent, as in thoſe they would now be exempted from.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There are not above <hi>Eight</hi> Apothecaries Common Council-men; <hi>but One</hi> (at preſent) an Alderman's Deputy; <hi>but One</hi> in the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy; <hi>not exceeding Two Captains</hi> in Commiſſion, in the City of <hi>London;</hi> none of which was by them ſought.</p>
            <p>As for their ſpending ſome Time in Electing Lord-Mayor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thoſe Elections are <hi>very ſeldom,</hi> and ſo but a <hi>ſmall</hi> part of their Time therein ſpent: And being in them a <hi>voluntary</hi> Act, its <hi>never done to the Neglect of their Patients.</hi> But it is quite otherwiſe in thoſe Offices which <hi>poſitively require their Perſonal Service.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> 'tis Objected, That the Apothecaries have <hi>not</hi> the <hi>ſame Reaſons for</hi> Exemptions as the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> whoſe <hi>Perſonal Attendance</hi> is required, and they cannot act by <hi>Proxy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> 'Tis confeſs'd that Phyſicians <hi>muſt</hi> Act in Perſon: And it is as <hi>manifeſt</hi> Truth that the Apothecaries <hi>doe,</hi> even to the ſpending much more time therein than the Phyſician doth; and (as before-obſerved) in a <hi>thouſand</hi> Inſtances <hi>muſt,</hi> (where the Phyſicians can't be paid, and for that reaſon generally are not ſent for) or the Patients <hi>
                  <hi>muſt</hi> periſh. And which of theſe two ſpend <hi>moſt</hi> time on their Patients</hi> (with humble Submiſſion) <hi>
                  <hi>moſt</hi> deſerve an Exemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Some of the Learned'ſt and Eminent'ſt Phyſicians <hi>knowing</hi> the grounds of this Bill to be <hi>true,</hi> have induſtriouſly promoted the Paſſing thereof; for which the Apothecaries think themſelves in gratitude bound to make their publick acknowledgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> 'Tis aſſerted that the <hi>Fines</hi> for Offices by Act of Common Council are <hi>forbid</hi> to be applied to <hi>Fraſting,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This very <hi>Prohibition</hi> proves the <hi>before</hi>-common Abuſes of thoſe Fines; and it can plainly be proved, that notwithſtanding that Act (in the greateſt part of them) they are ſtill miſpent in luxurious Treats.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly, As for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Exemption of all Apothecaries throughout the Kingdom by thoſe Reaſons complained of:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> In this the City ſeem officiouſly to Oppoſe what all other parts of <hi>England</hi> (by their ſilence) may be preſumed to deſire as a common good; for upon <hi>firſt</hi> reading this Bill, the <hi>gromnds thereof, and the benefits thereby, were thought ſo reaſonable and advantgeous, that a worthy Member of the Houſe of Commons Mov'd the Exemption might extend to <hi>all</hi> Parts of</hi> England. This motion was ſo <hi>well</hi> approv'd of, that the Bill was immediately alter'd to its now latitude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> 'Tis Objected, That the <hi>preſent</hi> Exemptions from Offices are already <hi>too many,</hi> and that <hi>ſuch Immunities</hi> tend to the <hi>great Oppreſſion of the Subject, eſpecially the <hi>poorer</hi> ſort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> There are <hi>not</hi> above <hi>
                  <hi>Three hundred thirty ſeven</hi> Apothecaries</hi> within the Bills of <hi>Mortality;</hi> and <hi>modeſt'y</hi> ſpeaking, there are about <hi>One hundred and thirty thouſand</hi> houſes, as is preſumed upon a Critical calculation (notwithſtanding what the City Reaſons hath ſaid to the contrary): So <hi>that there is <hi>but one</hi>
               </hi> Apothecary to near <hi>Four hundred</hi> Families, and <hi>above <hi>Two thouſand</hi>
               </hi> perſons to an <hi>Apothecary</hi> within thoſe Limits.</p>
            <p>Now admitting that the Apothecaries <hi>Abuſed Fines</hi> for Offices, <hi>Communibus Annis,</hi> come to <hi>One hundred Pounds <hi>per Ann.</hi>
               </hi> (which is the moſt they would amount to) the Forgiving thoſe <hi>Miſ-ſpent <hi>Fines</hi>
               </hi> would not be <hi>One Farthing Yearly charge</hi> to <hi>each</hi> of the above-Number of Houſes: For 130 <hi>thouſand</hi> Farthings comes to 135 <abbr>
                  <hi>l</hi>
               </abbr> 8 <abbr>
                  <hi>s</hi>
               </abbr> and 4<abbr>
                  <hi>d</hi>
               </abbr> 
               <hi>And how very Oppreſſive <hi>this</hi> deſired Exemption would <hi>thus</hi> prove, deſerved the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Objectors, before they made this Groundleſs Suggeſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But admitting that there were <hi>not</hi> above the <hi>One half</hi> of the before-Number of Houſes within the Bills of Mortality, then the Charge would not amount to <hi>
                  <hi>a Farthing half Farthing</hi> per Annum,</hi> to each Houſe: And what Maſter of a Family doth ſo <hi>little</hi> regard his <hi>Health,</hi> as not rather to pay that <hi>Inconſiderable</hi> Charge, than that his Apothecary (by any of thoſe Common Offices) ſhould be engaged, when nothing leſs than the ſaving his own (or ſome of his Families) Life, <hi>neceſſarily</hi> requires his Attendance.</p>
            <p>It is pretended that no Reaſon can be aſſign'd for Exempting Apothecaries from Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but may with as much colour be given for any other Occupation concerned about the neceſſaries of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> As for Bakers, Brewers, Butchers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Maſters in thoſe Trades work very little, their men doing all under them, and ſo they in their Perſons are much at leiſure, and conſequently may well (without any publick prejudice) ſerve in Offices; but otherwiſe in the caſe of Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, where the Maſter's Attendance is deſired by all Patients, and their own Eyes neceſſarily required to ſee moſt of their Medicines faithfully prepared. —Beſides if any other Traders neglect their Trade, the prejudice tends only to their private Property, whereas by the neglect of the Apothecary the Patients would many times Periſh.</p>
            <p>And whereas theſe Gentlemen alledge that the <hi>Poorer</hi> ſort will be <hi>moſt</hi> grieved by Paſſing this Bill: It's humbly conceived, <hi>That thoſe will receive the <hi>greateſt</hi> Benefits by the Paſſing thereof.</hi> For the Apothecaries <hi>not</hi> being <hi>deprived</hi> of any part of their <hi>Time</hi> or <hi>Money</hi> [by <hi>Services</hi> or <hi>Fines</hi>] upon the account of <hi>any</hi> of thoſe <hi>Troubleſome</hi> or <hi>Fineable</hi> Offices, They will be <hi>
                  <hi>then</hi> more</hi> at <hi>leiſure</hi> and the <hi>better able</hi> to beſtow both their <hi>Viſits</hi> and <hi>Medicines</hi> on the <hi>Poorer Sort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now whether the Apothecaries <hi>Only</hi> ſhould be charged with this</hi> 100 <abbr>l</abbr> per Ann. <hi>in their Fines for their Exemption, or the <hi>One hundred and thirty thouſand</hi> Families (that within the Bills of Moatality receive the Advantages of their due undiſturb'd Attendance on their Profeſſion), <hi>inſenſibly</hi> bear this Charge, is at preſent under the mature Conſideration of this Auguſt and Right Honourable Aſſembly: To whoſe great Wiſdom the Premiſes are moſt humbly ſubmitted.</hi>
