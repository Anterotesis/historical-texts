         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

A man retired and drawne much up into himselfe, neither thinking great thoughts of himselfe, nor seeking great things for himselfe;

but seeking him, and conversing much with him that is invisible; hee attained a great measure of divine wisedome, and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindednesse: So that wee that knew him looked on him, and judged much of him to bee in heaven already: Of whom it may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as once of a worthy Divine of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that hee did even eate, and drinke, and sleepe eternall life: Whom if thou didst not know in his life

to see Iesus who he was, which is amplified by his endeavour to obtaine it: in which is noted what hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him, the preasse, and his low stature; and the helpe which he used. First, he ranne before. Secondly, he climed up into a Sycomore Tree to see him, being to passe that way. The cause of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Christ, who called him outwardly, and inwardly, to receive him into his house, and heart; set forth by his looking up to him, calling him (by name) to come in hast downe to him, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine him, declaring his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to abide that day at his house. Which calling is further declared by the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie of it in his heart, and the events following.


<pb n="3" facs="tcp:753:25"/>
The efficacie; First, in his comming downe, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him, amplified; 1. by his readinesse, hee made haste. 2. his joy, and chere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, he received him joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Secondly, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to Christ of two acts, of two excellent vertues; First, of liberality, giving to the poore, inlarged by the quantitie, the halfe of his goods; Secondly, of justice in possessing men againe by restitution of that which hee had taken from them by false accusation, enlarged al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by the measure fourefold. Both graced with a signe of confidence and constancie, his standing forth, the events following; First, in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude they all murmured at Christ for going in to a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

            <p>

               </hi> 49. 6. In which service, hee employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and tooke the forme <note place="margin">Phil. 2. 7, 9.</note> of a servant, assumed our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to unitie of person for the worke of the mediator<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and became obedient to the death, even the death of the crosse. According to the will of his Father, fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ceremoniall Law in


<pb n="12" facs="tcp:753:30"/>
his sacrifice, and the morall in fulfilling all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; by the which will of God wee are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Iesus Christ once for all, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, hee died of his owne love to man, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8, 31. Whose delights were with the sonnes of men; hee gave his life for his friends in the greatnesse of his love, <hi>Iohn,</hi> 15, 13. So his love is set before the gift of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 20. To wash us from our sinnes in his blood, to make us kings and Priests to our God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 5. As his Father lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, and appointed him to be the mediator, in whom whosoever were received into favour, should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,


<pb n="13" facs="tcp:753:30"/>
and no otherwise: so hee loved us and gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a ransome for us, that the Father might love us with the love wherewith he loved him, and that love also bee in us. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 17, 23, 24, 26.</p>
            <p>It was expedient that his death should bee voluntary, First, for mans justification, that as by one mans disobe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one, many might bee righteous: as wee were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in <hi>Adam</hi> by imputation of his disobedience before wee had inherent sinne, so in Christ by faith wee might bee righteous, by imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his obedience, before wee have inherent righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse: as sinne reigned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:753:31"/>
death even over the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that sinned not after the simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Adams</hi> transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so grace may reigne through righteousnesse, by Iesus Christ, unto eternall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5, 14, 19, 21. Thus was <hi>Adam</hi> the figure of Christ. Thus was Christ Gods righteous servant in his obedience, righteous in himselfe, and the righte ousnesse of them that effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually know him, <hi>Esay</hi> 53, 11.</p>
            <p>Secondly, it was expedi ent for his sacrifice that his death should bee in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not onely for innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie not to need to offer for himselfe as the priests of the Law did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, 26, 27. But because obedience with God is more than all burnt


<pb n="15" facs="tcp:753:31"/>
offering and sacrifice; this being the obedience of such a person, being the Sonne, hee learned obedience in the things which hee suffered. The Lord of the Law wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submitting himselfe to the Law, it did greatly please God: <hi>His sacrifice was a sweete smelling savour, Ephes.</hi> 5, 2. His father loved him because he laid downe <note place="margin">Iohn 10. 17.</note> his life for his sheepe, such as were given him of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it was meete al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so for his victory that his death should bee in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and voluntary, that as death and the Divell who had the power of it, reigned by disobedience, so hee by obedience might overcome and tryumph, in his Crosse


<pb n="16" facs="tcp:753:32"/>
(where hee shewed obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) hee spoiled principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities <note place="margin">Coloss. 2.</note> and powers, disarmed them, and made a shew of them openly, and tryumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over them; so they have no more power to accuse them that are in Christ, or to require them of Gods justice to punishment for their disobedience. Sinne is put out of authoritie, in the flesh of Christ, and the whole right of the Law full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in them that walke not after the flesh, but after the spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 3, 4. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Christs obedience or righteousnesse which is reall and inherent in him, is so imputed to them as if they had done it themselves.</p>
            <p>Which well knowne and <note place="margin">Vse.</note> digested, may be a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement


<pb n="17" facs="tcp:753:32"/>
to come to Christ for salvation, seeing hee gave himselfe so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and with such great desire to death in obedience to his Fathers will, to save the world by him; and salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton being now preached in his name, how can wee say any thing to excuse our not receiving him and life with him, hee being straitned and pained with strong desire to shed his blood for reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation betweene God and man, and he is now set forth unto us for propitiation through faith in his blood: let us abhorre flownesse of heart to beleeve in him, and with all boldnesse imbrace the benefit of Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10, 22. Let him see in us the travell of his soule to his


<pb n="18" facs="tcp:753:33"/>
satisfaction, <hi>Esay,</hi> 53. 11. The affluence of burdened sinners to him to finde rest for their soules, is the fruite of his passion; the satisfying of his desire in it, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spering of the good pleasure of God in his hand. Say with the Church, I am my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loveds, seeing his desire is towards mee, because hee hath so freely loved mee when I was wholly turned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from him, and was his enemie; as in desire to save me to give himselfe for me, I resolve to yeeld up my selfe to him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 7, 10. This is the pleasure of Christ and his Church, that their bed is greene, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1, 16. that there is still an increase of faithfull ones. And this faith by which wee looke up


<pb n="19" facs="tcp:753:33"/>
to Christ for salvation, is the eye which so much doth affect him, as hee is no more his owne but theirs that so beleeve in him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 9. If we could weigh this well that Christ is so delighted with our faith, by which as by our eye wee behold him as sent of God to save us, how should it make us to burne in desire to have this faith more and more, which is but one though it have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse degrees? Our faith in him is the end of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pell, as the end of his passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the end of it the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our soules, 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 1, 9.</p>
            <p>Let this love of his, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">2 Vse.</note> hee willingly met his death for our salvation, move us to labour to know


<pb n="20" facs="tcp:753:34"/>
this love which passeth knowledge, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3. 19. which as his banner is lifted up to gather his to him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured by his love, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2. 4. and admiring it, to bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to burne in our love to him, as the Church is said to be sicke of love, &amp; the coales thereof to be coales of fire which hath a most vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment flame, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8, 6. So possessed of the love of Christ that wee bee wholly to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5, 14.</p>
            <p>And so know this love not onely as our motive to love him, but our patterne to love such as hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to our love: so is his commandement that wee love one another as he hath loved us, <hi>Iohn</hi> 13: His love to us is as his fathers to him,

purely gracious, as his father received not of him, but gave to him, so hee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not first of us to love us for our love, but when there was nothing to incline him towards us to bee conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in us, he loved us &amp; gave us even himselfe. Thus let our love bee to others, not first because wee receive of them, but freely of goodnes put into us by the Spirit of Christ, inclined to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

            <p>Let it direct our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">3.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:753:35"/>
to his Father. As <hi>Peter</hi> stretching forth his hands to bee bound and led to death by others, in respect of his naturall will, is said to bee led whither hee would not, <hi>Iohn</hi> 21. 18. yet of obedience and feare of God, choosing death for the safetie of Christs cause, to glorifie God by his confession of the truth: thus is the obedience more glorious, being perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by grace against relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of nature: Yet where <note place="margin">Caut.</note> there is reluctation of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt nature, the excellency of obedience is lesse, though grace get the victory; for to the performance of the Law it is required that a man shall not lust, have no motion bee it never so small contrary to Gods Law. The


<pb n="23" facs="tcp:753:35"/>
perfection of that which is good, is when there is not so much as concupiscence of sinne in a man: if there bee never so little a motion step ping aside from the love of God, and from his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in love, it is evidently a breach of the Law; our Saviour had no manner of corruption in him to wrestle or strive against the will of God.

            <p>Fourthly, riches (though they bee no causes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is neither the lawfull

Faith is in him which wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to beleeve, whose good will it prevents, not in time, but in cause and nature.

Which is not meant of any thought whatsoever, but of a thought of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or right living which affects the will. It signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not simply to apprehend something in our mind. But with deliberate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of reason and affection of the will about the thing apprehended, as <hi>Philip.</hi> 4. 8.

But it is such a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him as hee gives in the face of Iesus Christ, unto some measure of faith, drawing us to him to seeke reconciliation &amp; remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sins, and is an effect of his knowledge of us.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:753:98"/>
nor will, nor can forsake and forget her. Which he illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates by comparing and preferring his compassion towards them, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion of a mother to the Sonne of her wombe. It is given to the mother com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to love more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than the father, therefore he compares his love with the mothers love, and not simply her love to the sonne of her wombe, but that suckes her breasts, towards whom, a mothers affection is not overcome with labour or any kind of molestation, but with unremitted care she indures to give it sucke, to nourish it and foster it. And scarse is it to be expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed how she is affected with the smiles, or afflicted with


<pb n="149" facs="tcp:753:98"/>
the cries of it, specially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pressed with any danger: Whereby <hi>Solomon</hi> found out in his wisedome, the true mother of the child, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by two women, when the true mother heard of the dividing of it betweene them, her bowels yerned, &amp; were hot upon her sonne: and would in no wise have it slaine, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 25. 26.</p>
            <p>Againe, if the soule in temptation, except against this comfort and say: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience shewes that some mothers doe loose naturall affection and regard not the children of their wombe, no not then when they are not long from their birth: God answers to that, though created nature may defect, and turne monstrous, yet the


<pb n="150" facs="tcp:753:99"/>
supreame and uncreated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is so perfect that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not change. And that is the first thing, which may specially comfort Godly, tender mothers in such temptation about Gods leaving his care of them. If their affection bee such to their children, can Gods be lesse to them? They cannot forget nor forsake theirs, &amp; will they thinke that their affection is not equalled by God, yea overmatched and exceeded, being infinite?</p>
            <p>Secondly, a second thing is, that God will not forget his for this reason; hee will have them ever in his sight, as graven upon the palmes of his hands, as things in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, and precious are minded. As the gold finer


<pb n="151" facs="tcp:753:99"/>
sits by the fire into which he hath put his gold to melt, to take it out in due time, and <note place="margin">Iob 23. 10.</note> his eye is still upon it, hee neglects it not, <hi>Malach.</hi> 3, 3. God withdrawes not his <note place="margin">Iob 36. 7.</note> eyes from the righteous.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a third thing for their answere is, that the time of their reliefe being come, their comfort shall be hasted in the departing of the instruments of affliction, in the coming of such as shall build them up, with new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse of members of the Church, multiplication of Gods people, that the joy shall exceed your sorrowes.</p>
            <p>It may silence such god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> persons as would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the faith of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises in the hearts of his people, by his deferring so

long the fulfilling of them. First, they misaccount time, <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3. 8.</note> it is not long that God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferres, compared with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie following: one day and a thousand yeares are alike, and differ not concerning that which belongs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of infinite time; both in comparison of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, is but as a point of time in comparison of time. The eternitie of God coexisteth indivisibily with any durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and with the least part thereof, even a moment. The parts of our duration which are passed, or which shall passe away, either have beene or shall bee, but are not: Gods eternitie is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable, whole, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect possession of his life to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. All things that have


<pb n="153" facs="tcp:753:100"/>
being may be said to coexist with God in eternity or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by objective, though not any reall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, as the objects of the knowledg, &amp; power of God. Knowne unto God are all his workes from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, <hi>Act.</hi> 15, 18. By his eternall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell he disposed all things in the best sort, and from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie there is with him the best reason of his counsels and doings. He needes not time to discusse causes, to inquire after iniquities, and search out sinnes; for his dayes are not as the dayes of man, or his yeares as mans dayes, distributed into spaces of dayes and yeares, his life is not as mans.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they falsly accuse


<pb n="154" facs="tcp:753:101"/>
God of slacknesse, as it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men counted a fault, which is a deferring of any thing beyond the due time appointed. God hath times and seasons in his owne power, so as opportunitie shall not slide away from him, his promise which is for an appointed time, shall surely come and not tary, at the end shall speake and not lye: <hi>Hab.</hi> 2, 3.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let it provoke us to bee followers of God in this: as he slackes not to doe good to his people in fit time, so let us observe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities and seasons of doing good, and not let them slip, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 11, 6, but sow our seed in the morning, and not let our hand rest in the evening; and worke the


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:753:101"/>
workes of him that sent us, while it is day, <hi>Iohn</hi> 9, 4. Waiting for occasions, as <hi>Abraham</hi> in his tent doore, being given to hospitalitie, who spying three men as he thought comming in the way, ranne to meete them and to invite them: a proofe of sound love to shew kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to unknowne men, of whom he neither had nor hoped for exchange of good turnes. Integritie being more then, hospitality might be used with lesse daunger than now in so great persidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse of men.</p>
            <p>Grace makes a man pompt, and readie to gracious acts. The liberall man deviseth liberall things (contrary to the churle) and by liberall things shall be established,

            <p>Increase of grace is given to them that rightly use the first grace by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, <hi>Psal.</hi> 84, 11. To them that walke uprightly God giveth grace.

               </gap>inke, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. The whole effect is ascribed to the Spirit of Christ, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the covenant, I will make you a new heart, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh, and I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walke in my statutes, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 36, 26, 27.</p>
            <p>If it depended on the will of man to make the grace effectuall or ineffectuall, it would follow; that I owe to God no more in my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and obedience to his


<pb n="180" facs="tcp:753:114"/>
word than the prayse of a power to convert, but to my selfe the prayse that I actually doe convert and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. So when the Apostle saith, It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God which sheweth mercie; with the like supplement the speach might be converted, it is not of God shewing mercie, that is, altogether, but of mans internall act of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and externall of run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, conversing with studie and diligence. Which must needs offend godly eares.</p>
            <p>So when hee saith, who made thee to differ from an other man? It might bee answered, mine owne will; another man had as much given him of God as I, equall


<pb n="181" facs="tcp:753:114"/>
helpe of grace; but hee would not bring his abilitie into act, which I did. But this excludes all boasting, that the will and the deed is onely and wholy of God, who hath wrought all our workes in us.</p>
            <p>Grace is opposed to the fault in us, which is both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and habituall deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie in the will; therefore is grace both habite and act in the will: it ministreth spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall vertue, it giveth an effectiue principle of super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall operation.</p>
            <p>In summe, if efficacie of grace depend on mans will, then there is no other effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of the grace of God in the faithfull to well doing, than there is of a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divell in sinners to


<pb n="182" facs="tcp:753:115"/>
evill doing, if as the efficacie of the temptation depends rather of the will of the sinner than of the Divell temping, so efficacie of grace rather on the will of the well doer than of God exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to good. Which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the glory of his grace, which is to bee maintained in all the good hee workes in us or by us. That which I am, saith the Apostle, I am by the grace of God; I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was in me, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. Hee meanes not to give only part or the principall part to the grace of God, and to take the rest to himselfe onely helped by grace: but by correction gives the whole

What good soever wee doe, it is by the direction and impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the holy Ghost: wee speake, but when it is god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is the Spirit of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">Mat. 10. 20.</note> which speaketh in us.

            <p>First, the incomparable


<pb n="222" facs="tcp:753:136"/>
excellencie in himselfe is cause of great joy to them that receive him, hee is from heaven and above all, such a bridegroome is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily the joy of the bride, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, 29, 31. As his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie above all other makes him desired being knowne, it drawes hearts to him, when the Church de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed him, and concludes her description thus: Hee is altogether lovely, adorning her description with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled exclamation to the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> This is my beloved, and this is my freind.

<pb n="223" facs="tcp:753:136"/>
so holds it them to him with delight, who have him, counting him their full fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitie. Wee will rejoyce and bee glad in thee, wee will remember thy love more than wine. Nothing is there in the world that seemes not vile to them in comparison of him, <hi>Canticles</hi> 1, 4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The benefits which they receive with Christ are all matters of great joy. They have him as the first effect of their election, the gift of the love of God wherewith hee loved them from the beginning: of this they have abundantly to rejoyce that their names are written in heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10, 20.</p>
            <p>Secondly, the reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and peace which they

to conceive some singular sweetnesse of Gods favour, affected therewith unto rejoycing, wee may study to walke worthy of God.</p>
            <p>They have the nature of God, borne nor of blood nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1, 13.</p>
            <p>They have accesse to God, a singular priviledge, adduction into his presence by one Spirit; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2, 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who makes requests for them according to the will of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 27.</p>

will for good; quickening, and comforting them, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving and increasing the life of God in them, causing strength to grow in their soules to victory over the world, their standing in grace after all assaults; and so is the Spirit of glory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting upon them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4: The earnest of salvation with eternall glory.</p>
            <p>They have interest in God for his speciall providence, as <hi>David</hi> claimes, I am thine save mee, <hi>Psalme</hi> 119, 94. The Church, <hi>Esay 63, 16. Doubtlesse thou art our Father, thou O Lord art our Father. 19. Wee are thine. So his eye is over them, Psal. 33, 18. Hee withdraw es not his eyes from them, Iob 36, 7. Hee that toucheth them toucheth the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple


<pb n="228" facs="tcp:753:139"/>
of his eye; he loveth them with the same love wherewith hee loveth his owne Sonne Iesus Christ, Iohn</hi> 17, 26.</p>
            <p>They have their right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to and dominion over all things restored; all is theirs with Christ, whom God hath appointed heire of all things, and they coheires, to inherit all things with him, <hi>Rom. 8, 17. 1 Cor. 3, 22. Revel.</hi> 21, 7. This is no small part of the joy of their faith, that whether they bee things present or things to come, all are theirs.</p>
            <p>Seeing Christ received by faith brings such matter <note place="margin">Vse.</note> of joy, it is to their reproofe who have him and his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing constantly offered, yet receive him not. 1, It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignitie offered to Christ,


<pb n="229" facs="tcp:753:139"/>
whom they refuse. 2. It is the wronging of their owne soules, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8, 36. Hee that sinneth against me, wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his owne soule; all they that hate mee, love death.</p>
            <p>Infidelitie is two wayes considered, First of mere negation, as in them who never heard of Christ, called infidels, of not having the faith, which is a punishment rather than a sinne. Such are damned for their sinnes, because no sinne can be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned but by faith in Christ; but not for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving in him of whom they have not heard, <hi>Iohn 15, 22. Rom.</hi> 10, 14.</p>
            <p>Of contrarietie of faith, when men reject Christ, will not receive him, the


<pb n="230" facs="tcp:753:140"/>
will standing in opposition to the hindering of the mindes assent to the truth, resisting both interior in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and exterior prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, whereby Christ with his saving power is offered: This hath the reason of sinne and condemnes men, makes them guiltie of the body and <note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> blood of Christ, in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy rejecting of him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1, 11.

they that were called to the marriage Supper of the kings sonne, set light by it, for their worldly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, <hi>Luke</hi> 14, 18: with one consent making excuse: and when they feare that his presence will bee any losse in their temporall state, they wilfully reject him, as the <hi>Gadarens</hi> for the losse of their hoggs, and shew a notable unthankefullnesse, offering vile indignitie to Christ, in preferring and redeeming base things with a wilfull losse of him and his salvation.</p>
            <p>So they wrong their own soules, as the rich man that had his whole and full por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in good things in his life time, and cast away his soule, <hi>Luke</hi> 16, 25. Some

But that the light being come into the world, they love darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse rather than light, and


<pb n="233" facs="tcp:753:141"/>
the cause is that their deeds bee evill. They have an evill conscience and will not bee cured, they worthily perish without pitty: the love of their vices keepes them from imbracing the fountaine of vertue. They are withheld by a most wicked cause from yeilding themselves to so gracious a remedie: As they justly are damned, that had the truth which saveth, but lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it not, having pleasure in unrighteousnesse, 2 <hi>Thess</hi> 2, 10, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To derogate faith from the Gospell in which Gods truth and faithfullnesse is chiefly set forth, when men spoyle him of the honour of his truth, what leave they remaining to him?

            <p>In doing our dutie wee <note place="margin">Vse.</note> must be content with Gods approbation, it is enough that we are allowed of God though wee desire also to manifest our selves in the consciences of men: our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution must bee to shew our selves the servants of Christ in good and in evill report; when men speake well of us, and when they dispraise us, wee have one

mind well affected towards him, shewing it in benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and beneficence, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his power, and that for Christs sake, which ariseth of the light of faith. In whose mind the true light (Christ apprehended by faith) doth shine: the Law concerning brotherly love is written in his heart by the Spirit, which is a testimonie not onely of his being but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding in the light, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in it. And this light and knowledge of Gods Commandements so guides him, that hee goeth on his journey to heaven which he hath undertaken with expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, without offence or hinderance: and love in his heart carries him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the whole law, that


<pb n="278" facs="tcp:753:167"/>
the Apostle saith, hee that loveth another hath fulfilled the Law, whatsoever Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t there is, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in this saying, namely: <hi>Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> Love worketh no ill to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13, 8, 9, 10.

            <p>And it is to bee observed that hee doth not say, there is no scandall to him, but there is no scandall in him. Though many scandalls are offered of the world to him that loves his brother: none peirceth into his mind, or is so in his mind whereby hee is hindred from leading his life freindly and peaceably

with his neighbour.</p>
            <p>Hee so farre offends not, and is not offended as hee hath light abiding in him and walkes in it: but because hee is but in part taken out of the darkenesse, and his love is not perfect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in respect of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of ignorance and selfelove unsanctified, hee offends and takes offence, stumbles in many things: but as his knowledge increaseth and his holy love, so hee is more pure and without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: for which the Apostle praied for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that their love might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound still more and more in knowledge and in all judgement, that they might bee sincere and without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence till the day of Christ;


<pb n="280" facs="tcp:753:168"/>
that they might hold on a constant course in their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie without stumbling: this is one great part of their felicitie that love Gods Law; nothing shall offend them, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119, 165. Most great tranquilitie, and true securitie.</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is that which offends them, his fellowship with a sinner. It is to bee inquired 1. who is a sinner or in their account such. 2. whether it bee a sinne to have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with them?</p>
            <p>A sinner in their account was one of prostituted wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse, living, and taken in notorious and manifest sinnes, for which they were excommunicate out of the


<pb n="281" facs="tcp:753:168"/>
Synagogue; and the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith some thing to this purpose: in degrees of sinnes it seemes more to bee a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than to bee ungodly, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1, 9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4, 18. Where shall the ungodly and the sinner appeare? <hi>Psal.</hi> 1, 1. Blessed is the man that hath not walked in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners; of the <hi>Sodomits</hi> it is said they were sinners before the Lord ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13, 13. They feared not in the sight of the Lord and before his face to designe any wickednesse though never so vile; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they that sinne with impudencie are said to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their sinnes like <hi>Sodome Esay</hi> 3, 9.</p>
            <p>So they began to bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

sinners which fell, not of ignorance or weakenesse, but did evill of destinate malice, without all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of God. 2. Who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended not in some lesser er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror or fault, but lived in hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous wickednesses. 3.

When they committed their sinnes not in secret, but so manifestly and notoriously as men of ordinarie honestie abhorred them.</p>
            <p>Hence by little and little followed that Pharisaicall persuasion, that they which were not desiled with such notorious sinnes, were just even in the sight of God;

of which men Christ saith, he came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Math.</hi> 9, 13. Such as in a loftie and proud mind with trust of carnall workes, thought themselves righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and despised others, <hi>Luke</hi> 18, 9.</p>

            <p>But a sinner taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally is every one that is not in Christ. So as hee is still guiltie in his conscience, his sinnes are imputed and are upon his owne score, as his debts not discharged,</p>
            <p>

There is sinne remaining and sinne removed or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sient. <note place="margin">Iohn 9. 41.</note> It is remaining when men do not come to Christ.

Sinne transient not onely in respect of act, but concerning guilt and punishment is, when men know their sinne, and betake themselves to Christ that they may be justified in him, they have forgivenesse of all trespasses, so as they are not the faults and sinnes of that man, God hath received in

that the communication of his faith, may become effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: though faith have her seate in the heart, yet by fruits through love it is communicated to others.

            <p>Generally, that which is required of a man is his goodnesse, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19. 22. His beneficence specially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes him, to bind many to him with benefits. It should bee his studie as to live religiously towards God, so in doing good unto men, and then may he seeme to have attained the end of his condition, when hee is as a God to man, when hee profits him. It is one proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a good man, that hee is mercifull and his light shines in darkenesse, <hi>Psal.</hi> 112, 4.

            <p>It not onely releiveth the poores necessitie, but also abundantly causeth many to give thankes to God: a grace administred to the glorie of the Lord, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 10.

whereby hee is carried both in softnesse to his brethren, not hard and rough to them; and to releeve those that stand in need of his helpe, the ground is Gods promise to the mercifull.

            <p>Other rules there bee to bee observed in giving, as <note place="margin">Est modus in dando, quid, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Let thy fountaines flow forth, and the rives of

waters in the streets. Not onely take part of thy goods thy selfe, but distribute them liberally to those that want. The Apostle requires of him that stole to steale no more: but to labour with his hands the things that are good, that of his honest labour he may have to give him that wants, <hi>Ephes. 4, 28. Hee that hath this worlds goods</hi> (saith the Apostle <hi>Iohn) and sees his brother have need, and shutts up his compassion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi> So the goods must lawfully bee possessed, and it must be an act of love to God and to our brethren, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, 17. The goods that are unlawfully with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from the owner, must bee restored, as followes


<pb n="333" facs="tcp:753:195"/>
in the text.</p>
            <p>There be three sorts of ill gotten goods. 1. When the injustice is onely his that hath gotten them, as in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing, usurie, theft, rapine, defrauding, over-reaching, &amp;c. when the right and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is not transferred from the owner; of such, men may not give almes, but restore them as an act of justice in putting a man in possession of his owne. When by diligent inquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it appeares that neither the parties wronged, nor any of their kindred is alive; it must bee given to the maintenance of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterie and Gods worship, or to the use of the poore, such as are in Gods steed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5, 8.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:753:196"/>
2. Sometimes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice is in both, that he that hath acquired the goods cannot retaine them, they are gotten against justice, nor hee of whom they have beene gotten can require them, hee gave them against justice, as in bribes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert judgement or such cases as this, almes is to bee given.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Something is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully gotten where the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition it selfe is not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply unlawfull, but that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull by which it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, as when a woman hires out her selfe to bee a whore and takes the wages of a harlot, she comes by Gods mercie to repentance, and would shew mercie as she hath received mercie,


<pb n="335" facs="tcp:753:196"/>
she gives of that which was her reward unto the poore, it is not unlawfull. The Law forbad to bring for offerings in any vow the price of an whore, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23, 18. Hee would have the sanctitie of his house and altar held in high reverence, and not pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted wish any impure ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Hee forbad also to bring the price of a dogge, in any vow, as an impure creature and abject and vile; but the service of the tabernacle is ceased, the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall worship is at an end. This is mercie to the poore, to whom if for Gods sake a man give the price of his dogge hee of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends not, it is of his owne he gives.</p>

               <p>A second thing that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends almes is the grace of the person; it is joyned with the almes of <hi>Cornelius</hi> in his commendation, that hee was a devout man, one that feared God with all his household, that prayed God continually, and fasted: in summe that hee excelled in vertues. The <hi>Macedonians</hi> are commended as for their liberalitie and that rich out of extreame povertie, so for the abounding of their joy in much afflictions, and for giving themselves to God

Not the punishment onely as a sacrifice for sinne, to give satisfaction, but became a sinner, not by nature or any act of his, who knew no sinne but by imputation, translating the sinnes of the Elect from them to him, according to his Fathers counsell, and his owne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: he having no sinne of his owne hee could not as man be bound to these kinds of Lawes prescribed to

Gods people by occasion of sinne, in conforming where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they professed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves sinners; which Christ conforming himselfe unto, did professe himselfe also to bee, and the chiefe, though not by inherence (hee was without sinne) yet by Gods laying the sinnes of the Elect upon him, and his taking them upon himselfe, so as the guilt of them was upon him, and did bind to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, as a suretie that takes the debt upon him, that was not his before, is bound, as <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>He gave himselfe a ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,

a full price, answerable to all that punishment which our sinnes came unto. Both in soule and body, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2, 6. Hee himselfe, gave himselfe whole, a full and equall price for us. Hee is called a suretie of a better Testament, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, 22. Sureties are to deliver them for whom they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come sureties, by payment of the whole debt, as it is required. If it bee goods, take his bed from under him, <hi>Prov. 22. 27. Philem. v.</hi> 18, 19. If it be libertie, the suretie becomes bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man for him whom hee freeth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 44, 33. Life for life, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20, 39, 40, 42. So Christ becoming our suretie must give body for body, and soule for


<pb n="493" facs="tcp:753:276"/>
soule, in stead of our bodies and soules: hee suffered for sinnes, the just for the unjust, that which the unjust should have suffered.</p>
               <p>Hee redeemed us, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming a curse for us.</p>

He is able to save perfectly, or unto the end, such as come unto God by him, seeing hee liveth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to make intercession for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7, 25. The life and kingdome, and glory of Christ are destinated to this end as their scope, the salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beleevers; not onely by his kingly power but by execution of his preistly office in glory, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king requests for us: thus the


<pb n="494" facs="tcp:753:277"/>
Apostle comforts the Elect of God, beleeving in Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 33. 34. Against feare of condemnation, yea of accusation, to secure them of salvation. And to lay the comfort downe in the best force of it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the direct opposition is of accusation, and Christs patronage or intercession; of condemnation and Gods justification: but hee makes a traiection, willing to fence Gods Children from the toppe to the bottome, and to arme them with such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence as may chase away to the furthest, anxieties &amp; feares. Hee gathers more emphatically (that they are not obnoxious to any accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation of guiltinesse that may hurt them before God)


<pb n="495" facs="tcp:753:277"/>
by Gods justifying of them: then by Christs intercession, for the way to judgement is shut up aforehand, when the judge hath pronounced them just and guiltlesse, clearing them from all faults that any would lay to their charge. And so in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond opposition. It is not to bee feared that they should bee condemned for whom Christ by his death hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed divine justice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated their sinnes, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent that judgement of God, and by his intercession not onely abolished death, but brings their sinnes to bee forgotten, so as never to come into account.</p>
               <p>How doth Christ make intercession now for us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heavenly glory? in his

               <p>Being our high Priest, it is his office still to pray for us, as it were by name, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the high Priest under the Law was a type, who going in to the most holy place, had by appointment, the names of the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> in the names of the tribes (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heads were all contained:) So answering to the type, Christ is entred into the true holy place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very heavens, within the veile, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6, 20, and 9, 24. Not in his owne name onely, but in the name of every particular belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. <hi>Exod.</hi> 28, 12, Hee


<pb n="497" facs="tcp:753:278"/>

               <p>I doe not say I will pray <note place="margin">Object.</note> for you.</p>

               <p n="4">4. And as the incense and sweete perfume ascended and gave a sweete smell, so the workes and specially the prayers and prayses of the faithfull, through the odour of his sacrifice and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Christ, are sweete to God.

for us all to death. Secondly, particularly unto union with us, that is, in our calling: by the first our redemption was wrought, by the second wee enjoy him and all things with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 32.</p>
               <p>And this gift of Christ is the cause why God first (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee seeke it) giveth us faith. By his merit, and on his behalfe, it is given us to beleeve in him, as also to suffer for his name, <hi>Philip.</hi> 1. And because we cannot beleeve unlesse wee be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to it, faith is of Gods Elect; the Election being in Christ. For execution of the decree, saith is given to them that are given him, as the hand to take hold of him, as the mouth to take him in to dwell in us for life and


<pb n="504" facs="tcp:753:282"/>
nourishment: faith is not of all; onely his sheepe beleeve in him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. And in Gods gracious acceptance of our faith, not for the grace it selfe, it is in this life imperfect; but as it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, so faith is imputed for righteousnesse, and righteousnesse is imputed without workes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4, 5, 9, 11. Imputation, is three fold. 1. Acceptation of a thing as sufficient, though insufficient in it selfe: so some falsely define our justifyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be nothing else, but Gods gracious acceptation of our faith in Christ, though in it selfe unperfect, for our perfect righteousnesse. It is certaine God receives no righteousnesse from us, unto our justification in


<pb n="505" facs="tcp:753:282"/>
whole or in part, but giveth righteousnesse unto us, and imputes it for our owne, as if wee had wrought it our selves.</p>

               <p>It is questioned betweene us and the Papists, not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by faith: but by what faith wee are saved. By faith ye are saved, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse word of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.</p>

               <p>The things spoken of Christ in the Scriptures: all that <hi>Iohn</hi> spake of this man was true, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.

The faith of Gods Elect peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar to the sheepe of Christ, it is called receiving of Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1, 12. We teach that the proper object of justifying faith is Christ: with promise of mercie in him, as forgivenesse of sinnes, reconciliation, &amp;c. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2, 16. Even wee I say have beleeved in Christ that wee might bee justified by the faith of Christ: that, say the Papists, is as by a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to justification, but that is false; for that putts a space betweene justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and faith, but they are together in time, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porarie; every one assoone as hee beleeves is just.</p>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> opposing in the point of justification, beleeving and doing, faith and worke, therefore it doth justifie not as it is a worke, but as an instrument to receive Christ, and in him righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse unto justification of life, imputation of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse without workes. The <hi>Israelites</hi> stung of fierie Serpents were cured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing but looking upon the brasen Serpent; and so with faith of the promise of God were healed: so we fixing our eye of faith upon Christ, and the promise of speciall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in him are justified, and saved, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3, 16.</p>

The Papists though they grant Christ to bee in himselfe most just, and that hee fulfilled the Law, and satisfied God most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: yet they deny this obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to bee our justice. They teach besides Christs satisfaction, other satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, either in their owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons by penall workes, or by indulgence, a remitting thereof for the satisfaction


<pb n="552" facs="tcp:753:306"/>
of others, made theirs by bargaine and sale. The foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of which indulgence they make the treasure of the Church, of the superfluous workes and satisfactions of the Saints. They for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider in the workes of the just a double valour, one of merit which they say cannot bee applyed to another, a second, of satisfaction which is in some more than they need for themselves, either having no actuall sinne, as they say of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and as some of them count piously beleeved that she had not originall sinne, yet suffered much for God. <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. A sword also shall pierce thine heart. <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Spirit from the womb and lived innocently,


<pb n="553" facs="tcp:753:306"/>
yet put himselfe to great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie of life, under hard pennance. They suppose that such need not for their owne satisfaction, therefore as superfluous to him, it is laid up in the treasurie of the Church for such as want where with to satisfie God for their veniall sinnes, and the temporall punishment of mortall sinnes. Thus they adde to Christ, helps to save from sinne and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on false ground. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Be confident my sonne, thy sinnes bee forgiven thee.
