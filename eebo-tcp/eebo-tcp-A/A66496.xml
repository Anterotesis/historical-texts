            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>To the Most Reverend Father in Christ, His Grace, <hi>Gilbert,</hi> by Divine Providence, Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> Primate and Metropolitan of all <hi>England,</hi> and One of His Sacred Majesties most Honourable Privy Council.</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT is so Ordained by the Laws, most Noble Prelate, that whatsoever shall happen to be built upon any ones ground, it shall be his own, by right of accession. Since therefore, to that work which I lately attempted, concerning the gifts and Nature of the Sensitive Soul, as also the Affections of the Brain, and nervous stock, and the various Diseases which belong to them, I had placed the Anatomy of the humane Head for a foundation; it was altogether necessary (this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise being Dedicated to your Grace) that whatsoever build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be raised on that Foundation, should truly, and rightly be said to be yours: And so indeed, we continue the fault, we had sometimes Committed, and it becomes not only a step, but what is more, an obligation to the following Crime; that at length, we seem rather to perform a Duty, the name of a fault being lost, than to become Criminal.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time, this matter in which I busie my self, may not be said to be unfit for your Knowledge, or to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeing to the business of the Church, over which you most happily preside; For both those Epilepticks which are to be met with here precipitating themselves into the water or the fire, and those whose members variously Contracted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storted with Spasms or Convulsions, and those whose whole Bodies so bent, that they could not stand upright, by and by, as if by Inspiration of the Devill, they are agitated with Stupendious leapings, and other wonderfull gesticulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. These I say, and many other Sick men whom I here e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where describe, seem not much to differ from those whom we read of in the Evangelists, to be cured by our Lord Jesus Christ; and although such be to be cured however Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumatious and rebellious they are, the Physitian, however Skillfull he be, ought allways to Implore the help of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power, to be assisting to him, being above all the
<pb facs="tcp:106699:3"/>
Strength of Medicines. Therefore and by right the Disease by the Ancients called Holy of the word <hi>Theoria,</hi> and the rest of our Pathology, as if it contained in it a certain Divinity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates the Disease to be cured no lesse with prayers and fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings than with Medicines, and therefore should desire greatly to call upon the Authority of Holy men, and to be helped by the Power of your Sanctity.</p>
            <p>Besides it is no new thing that there should be an Entrance into the Church thorow the Spittle, for that it appears, our Saviour to have used almost this method, who would for the most part, that the health of the Soul, should take its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the restored health of the Body. And truly, as the Stupid <hi>Deliriums</hi> of Melanchollicks, the Caninish madness, and others sprung from an infirm Brain, have driven some, both from the Communion of Saints, and from the Society of men, if these had been profligated by the help of our Art, it would not be dispair'd of, but that the men should not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, growing well, have left both at once their Diseases and Errors, but also should have become Wise.</p>
            <p>It remains, that I Supplicate the Great God, that he will render to his Church, the peace he has happily given to the Common-wealth, that he may take away the darkness from the eyes of the miserable people, that he may withdraw the fury from their mindes, and for a pledge and advantage of so great a benefit, that he may long keep safe and in health, your Grace, the mighty Pillar, and Glory of the Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which is Cordially desired by</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I. <hi>Of Spasms or Convulsive Motions in Generall.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN handling the Convulsive Distempers, many Physitians distinguish between the <hi>Spasme</hi> or <hi>Convulsion,</hi> and <hi>Convulsive Motion;</hi> by the first they understand a constant Contraction, whereby the member becomes stiff and inflexible; by the Second, swift motions, and Concussions, which, coming between, cease, and return alternatly: But neither those who have observed these notes of difference, nor other Authors, have taken notice that they are continual: for that by the words <hi>Spasme,</hi> and <hi>Convulsion,</hi> they often designe a certain Spasmodick or Convulsive Affection; wherefore to distinguish it better, we will call the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer distemper with <hi>Cardan,</hi> tetanon, a continual Convulsive Cramp, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Spasm,</hi> or, a <hi>Convulsive motion in generall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that the irregular Nature, and Causes of Convulsive motion, might more rightly have been made known, it should first have been declared, after what manner the regular motive function, is effected in an animated Body: but the more full Consideration of this, because it belongs to the Physiologie, or Reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nature, of the Brain, and Nervous stock, it is deferred to another Discourse: For the present, we will signifie in a word, as much as shall serve for the elucidation of the matter proposed. That the animal Spirits are the next In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument <note place="margin">How the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Motion is Effected.</note> of regular motion, and that their Action, or moving force, consists only, in that they being more thickly heaped up together, in the motive part, and there spreading themselves in a more large space, they blow it up, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumefie it, which for that reason, being contracted, as to its length, draws to it self the part hanging to it. In our description of the Nerves already published, <note place="margin">Its beginning twofold.</note> we have shown this kind of motion to be twofold, to wit, Spontaneous, and meerly natural, the Instinct of this is derived from the Cerebel, but of that from the brain, but both through the pipes of the Nerves, as it were the channels, both to the muscles, and also to the fibres, interwoven with the membrains, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motive parts of the <hi>Parenchyma,</hi> or Inwards; Lastly, in all these, the various actions are so expeditiously effected, which either natural necessity, or the rule of the will requires, by that only means, that there is an intimate Conjunction, and communication of Duty, and most swift Commerce, between the animal Spirits, which Constitute the <hi>Hypostasis</hi> of the sensitive Soul, within the foresaid parts, disposed, or fitted by a continued <hi>Series.</hi> But there is this notable difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <note place="margin">The Subject also twofold</note> the motion of a muscle, and that performed by other parts; for in these, the action is most often circumserib'd within the bounds of the motive body, so as its membranes only, or one part of the inward moves another, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently this is moved of its neighbour: But in the musculous stock, usually the moving part is placed in one member, and to be moved of another next it (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though within some musculous part, as the Heart and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> they proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the most part move themselves only) hence the Membranes and Inwards, are said to have as it were an intestine, and vermicular Motion; such as where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is begun, the Spirits there more thickly gather together, and Spreading themselves forth, they first intumifie this part, then going forward another, and so farther, till at last they draw the hindermost parts, and by this means transfer an intumifaction, and therefore a motion, from one place to another; almost after the same manner as worms, and other Creeping creatures make their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression. But to this motive function of the Membranes and Inwards, if it be frequent or undiscontinued, plenty of spirits are required, which notwithstanding execute their task calmly enough, without tumult or great force: And indeed it is to be observed, that the Animal Spirits, flow not more sparingly into the Membraneous Inwards, than into the Muscles; as it appears from the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:106699:4"/>
more exquisite sense of those parts, and by the manifold insertion of Nerves within them, and the diversity of divarication, through the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and <hi>fibres,</hi> although in the mean time, the muscles are watered, with a more plentifull influx of Blood: But as to the motion, performed in the musculous stock, the heaping together, and rarefaction of the Spirits, through the whole joynting of the motive part, suddenly, and at once unfolded, are performed with such force, and strength, as the attraction of the muscle, in its motive endeavour, may exceed the force of a pully or windlace; and when this force, only depends on the expansion or rarefaction of the Spirits, seated in the motive part, we can conceive it to be no otherwise, but that the Spirits so expansed or stretched forth, as it were fired, after the manner of gunpowder, to <note place="margin">The Motion of a Muscle is a certain exple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</note> be exploded or thrown out. But we may suppose, that to the Spirituous Saline particles, of the spirits inhabiting the interwoven <hi>fibres</hi> in the muscle, other ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous-sulphureous particles, of a diverse kind, do come, and grow intimately with them, srom the arterous blood, flowing every where within the same <hi>fibres.</hi> Then as often as the particles of either kinde, as <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Sulphur</hi> combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, by reason of the instinct of motion brought through the nerves, are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as an inkindling of fire, forthwith on the other side bursting forth, or being exploded, they suddenly blow up the Muscle, and from thence cause a most strong drawing together: for indeed it seems to be ordained for this end, that the Muscles are imbrewed much more plentifully with the arterous blood, than the membraneous inwards: to wit, that the Elastick coupling of the spirits, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consumed, and perpetually falling off, through the very osten, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times continual motion, might be by that means supplyed, from the fresh san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineous juice: in the mean time, that the spirits themselves, being supplyed in a smaller quantity, through the small nerves, might even like old Soldiers continue longer in the same station, and follow their manifold coupling or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. How else are labouring beasts supplyed with a sufficient stock of spirits, for so much labour, whilst they exercise allmost all their muscles, by a swift course for many howers, yea sometimes a whole day: or who can believe that a little handfull of spirits brought through the small branches of the wandring and Intercostal pairs of the Nerves to the heart, can be able by their own strength to effect that its so strong and indiscontinued motion? Indeed it seems, that of necessity there must come to them from the blood perpetually, auxilarie aid, and those afterwards to be allways exploded. For this reason certainly, the motive virtue, both of the Heart, and the rest of the Muscles, becomes more strong and Elastick, above any mechanick Organ: to wit, for as much, as the animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, acting every where in the musculous stock, get to themselves an explosive <hi>Copula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any one shall be displeased at the word <hi>Explosion,</hi> not yet used in Philosophy or Medicine, so that this Spasmodick Pathologie, standing on this <hi>basis,</hi> may seem only <hi>ignoti per ignotius explicatio,</hi> an explication of unknown things by more unknown things; it will be easy to shew the effect of this kinde of notion, and very many examples, and instances both concerning natural and artificiall things; from the Analogie of whose motions, in an animated body, both regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly and irregularly performed, most apt reasons are to be taken. For besides the mixtures of <hi>Nitre</hi> with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> with <hi>Tartar,</hi> and with <hi>Antimony,</hi> all which are fired with a thundring noise; also <hi>Aurum fulminans</hi> or <hi>fulminant Gold,</hi> and a Composition of salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> with <hi>Nitre</hi> and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> without any actual fire, being only thoroughly heated, are exploded with a vehement Crash; also to this may be referred, many Liquors, which being mixed together, or poured upon some certain bodies, cause or stir up violent motions, and plainly Explosive: The spirit of <hi>Nitre,</hi> and the liquor of congeled <hi>Antimony,</hi> being powred on one another, or either of them thrown upon the filings of Iron, cause a great <hi>Ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> with heat and black smoke. It is commonly known, what heat or efferves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and force plainly explosive, arise from fixed Salts melted together, and from acetous or sharp salt of every kind, mixed with one another: Nor is the effect of Explosion less seen, when a Liquor imbrued with a volatil Salt, as the spirit of Harts-horn, or of blood, is put to a saline, either fixed or acetous <hi>Stagma,</hi> or sulphurious <hi>Nitre,</hi> to wit, the particles being vehemently stricke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Concerning this thing, we have more fully discoursed already in our <hi>Neurologie,</hi> or Tract of the Nerves, and perchance we may yet publish the explication of this more fully and more accuratly some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</p>
               <p>In the mean time that this opinion may not be thought altogether new, and that I have exposed it as a childe of my own brain, that had no other Patron, I will here shew you the assertion of the Famous <hi>Gassendus,</hi> which as it openly favours this our Hypothesis, and in some sort gave an occasion of it, so perhaps it will give to it some Authority. <q>Therefore this Rational man, weighing in his minde, how much that force or strength might be, with which, not only the Arm, or Thigh, but the whole animal Machine, is moved, govern'd, lifted up, and carryed up and down: He adds, Who can easily comprehend that small thing, whatsoever it is, within the body of an Elephant, whether we conceive it to be a soul, or spirit, or any other beginning of motion, that it should be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to agitate such a bulk, and to cause it to perform a swift, and regular dance? and so much the more, for that, when as that small thing within that body, no longer flourishes, there is need of so much outward strength, to remove it never so little from its place: but indeed, the same fiery nature of the sou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But indeed he says as to the spirits, which (like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosed Gun-powder) cause the agitation, it is doubtfull, whether it be they, which come from the brain, or those in the little tendons as it were of kin to them or springing from them, that are thought to do it: But although either of them concur, yet they seem to be more presently destinated to this office, which are those ofthe same kin or off-spring in the Tendons.</q> There needs no more, it is declared, that the motive function depends on the <hi>Elastick Copulae,</hi> of the animal spirits, and its decision or abating. But from this being supposed, (which indeed we may suppose with very great probability) it easily follows, that the Convulsive motions proceed from the like cause: For whosoever shall consider the sudden puffings up, the violent and strong Contractions, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Further from hence it may be Argued, by a recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Argument, that because the Spasmodick motions are explosive, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the regular are also produced by the explosion of Spirits: But after what manner, and by what means, and from what causes, the animal spirits being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, or thrust forth; produce Spasmodick affections, shall be our present business, a little more largely, and plainly to demonstrate, however difficult, and abstruse the matter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

irritation of the Nervous parts, to be the cause of Convulsion; taking their Conjecture from thence as I suppose, for that by ocular inspection it appears from the Vellication it self, and by the only touch of the Nerves, that spasms are induced: And indeed we have clearly observ'd, in the dissection of a living whelp, that the knife being put upon the naked ends of the spinal Nerves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently both themselves, and the Bodies of the Muscles, in which they were inser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were hauled: neither is it unusual, that spasms are excited almost in every man, by the punctures of the Nerves and Tendons. I remember by reason of an Ulcer, in the Arms of a certain man, that the Tendons of the Muscles were laid open, which when touch'd by the Surgions Instrument, caused in the Patient a certain rigor, through his whole body, and forthwith a Concussion arising, made him to quake for a good space. But in truth, albeit we grant the irritations of the Nervous parts, not seldom to serve the turn of the evident Cause, and further that sometimes this solitary Cause, produces more light and transient spaims; nevertheless, that the more grievious paroxisms of this Disease, and their frequent repetitions by turns, may be duly unfolded, it behoves us to inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigate, or search out other, and deeper Causes, to wit, the Conjunct and proca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick Cause.</p>
               <p>Forasmuch, as spasms never happen but in a living Body, where the Nervous parts are blown up, and grow turgid with the animal Spirit, we may readily Conjecture that those animal Spirits themselves, are, as in regular motion, so also in the Convulsive, the next Instrument of Action: to wit, so long as they are imbued, with a fit and moderate explosive <hi>Copula,</hi> and are moved to that striking forth, only by the Command of the Appetite, or instinct of Nature, they bring forth motions altogether regular; but if the same Spirits get to themselves an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> and too much Elastick, or if they are snatched into their Actions, more impetuously and vehemently than they should be; they even like unbridled Horses, pricked forward with Spurs, leap forth inordinately or throw off, or explode violently their <hi>Copula,</hi> although genuine and natural: and so they carry away the containing parts, as it were a Chariot tied to them, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with themselves, with a fierce and perverse motion.</p>
               <p>When therefore as aforesaid, the Convulsive motions are chiefly stired up for <note place="margin">There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

For first, it happens that a Convulsion is induced without a procatartick Cause, or heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> first acquired only from a solitary evident Cause: For so a vehement pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, impressed on the brain, a dissolution of the parts, hapning somewhere in the Nervous stock, a spasmodick passion is suddenly brought upon some, whose brain and Nerves are of a more weak Constitution: for that the animal spirits do trouble the containing parts, the improportionate Object flying from them, and by striking vehemently their <hi>Copula,</hi> though very agreeing it blows them up, and so they pull others annexed to them: Spasms being after this manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, because the natural <hi>Copula</hi> of the spirits in them, is stricken more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently, they are after a manner explosive, which notwithstanding, quickly leave off, and very often pass away with moving of the viscera, or Members; only with a trembling, and some horror, into a fainting of the spirits. But Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Convulsions, whose paroxisms are more grevious and stay longer, or are oftener repeated, seem altogether to depend on a procatartick Cause, or a previous disposition, and to arise from some other Conjunct Cause, befides Irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And therefore in this Case we suppose, that the heterogeneous, and greatly explosive particles, do increase with the spirits, acting in this or that <note place="margin">
                     <hi>A preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural explosive</hi> Copula.</note> region of the Body: then from this wicked Combination, and restless Collision of this kinde of matter, and the Spirits, frequent and vehement explosions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought forth, the spasmodick Paroxisms are induced.</p>
               <p>But besides the Elastick <hi>Copula,</hi> which every where happens to the Spirits, from the arterous Blood, and from whose orderly explosion, the motive force is performed, according to the Beck of the Appetite, or instinct of Nature, in all the Nervous parts; (as we have elsewhere declared) also sometimes other kinde of little bodys, of a fierce nature, or rather like <hi>Gun-powder</hi> or <hi>Nitre,</hi> come to the Spirits, and intimately adhere to them, when frequent and suddain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorces of this matter, from the Embraces of the Spirits, happen from the mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al striking together of the particles, the conteining Bodys are variously blown

                  </gap>asion; the procatartick Cause of such a disease, consists in the evill dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of such a sort of animal Spirits: For neither is the Serous filth, or other less sharp humours, although deposited in the very ventricles of the Brain, or about the origine of the nerves, sufficient to stir up such a sickness: For that I have seen in the heads of dead people, oftentimes the middle part of the brain, and the very beginings of the Nerves, wholly covered with a limpid water, who, whilst they were alive, had neither the Epilepsie, nor Convulsive Motions: But to the producing or these motions, very active Bodys are required, such as are Saline, and Sulphereous, which being combined with the Spirits, and then on a sudden breaking from them, they imitate the combinations, and violent explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, of particular mineralls. For indeed, if in regular and ordinary motion (as we have intimated) the Muscles cannot get a motive force, and elastick strength, unless a certain explosion of the animal Spirits be supposed, certainly much more lawfully may we assert, that, epileptick fits, and other admirable Convulsions, which still happen to be excited, complications of the same Spirits, with other very firce particles, and vehement elisions, or strikings of these, one against another, are required. But, as to this kind of Sposmodic <hi>Copula,</hi> because it differs from the natural and ordinary, which we have elsewhere shewn to be in regular motion, and to be supplyed srom the blood; it behooves us to inquire, from whence it comes, and by what means, and in what places, it is wont to get to the Spirits.</p>
               <p>As to the first, it is to be observed, that Spasmodick explosions do every way happen, not only in the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Indeed nothing appears more evident, than that the Spasmodick Disease, doth most often arise, by reason of the evill first fixed in the Brain, and from thence is transmitted, into various parts of the Nervous System: for it happens from hence, that a vehement Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as of fear, or Anger, or of Sadness of spirit, affecting the inhabitants of the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> the passion called Hysteric, and Hypochondriac, doth so often arise: Further, that in the evill Crises of Feavours, when the adust recrements of the blood, are transfer'd into the head, Convulsions do generally succeed. Moreover, and this is the reason, why the Vertigo, the inflation of the head, torpor of the minde, and other accidents of the Supreme Region, are wont to be the <hi>proaemium,</hi> of Spasmes presently following, in the Inwards, and not seldom, in the whole Body. Wherefore it is not to be doubted, but that the heterogeneous, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosive particles, are instilled from the Blood, together with the nervous juice, into the Brain; which afterwards being thrust forth, into the nervous stock, do there grow to the Spirits, and with them bring on a Convulsive disposition. In truth, the Spasmodick distempers, which are either universal, or at least occupie many parts of the body at once, arise for the most part, by this only means. But in the mean time, we will not deny, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>t that particular Spasms, which contain themselves within Certain places, the Head being no ways affected, are induced sometimes by other means. For if the nerves imbibe their humour from either end, to wit, the root, and the extream fragments, (which both the learned <hi>Gliss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

plain enough, that from the spleen being evilly affected, Spasms arising about <note place="margin">Sometimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the ends of the Nerves.</note> its region, do not seldom asfect the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> and <hi>Praecordia.</hi> I have known som<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>These things being thus premised, concerning the inward and next Cause of the Spasmodic Distemper, which we affirm to arise chiefly, and most often, from the head it self, and in some respect also from the extremities of the Nerves, it now remains, that we more particularly declare, the Various remoter Causes in either Kinde, and the manifold provision of this disease. The Convulsive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease <note place="margin">The more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Causes of Spasms.</note> therefore, for the most part, takes its original from the head: to wit; as often as the heterogeneous and explosive particles, being diffused from the blood into the Brain, or its medullarie Appendix, are afterwards derived <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Therefore, that the Heterogeneous and Spasmodick particles are admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">1 The morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick matter is heaped up within the Head, by the default both of the blood send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When the Blood powrs upon the Head the morbifick matter, either all its whole mass is depraved, as it frequently happens in malignant feavours, also in the Scorbutick, cacochymick, and chiefly in an originally corrupt Distemper; or the Blood of it self innocent and incorrupt, receives elsewhere malignant little bodys, and afterwards fixes them on the brain, so in great impurities of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and chiefly when any parts are affected with an Inflamation, or virulent ulcer, or hurtfull ferment, for from such mines the taint of the disease, the nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious particles bubble up into the blood, and afterwards, in its passage, are laid up in the Brain: So, by reason that the spleen, womb, and other Inwards, being evilly affected, Convulsive Diseases are excited, which notwithstanding, depend more immediatly upon the Brain receiving the corruption of those parts, through the commerce of the Blood.</p>

But as to the Constitution or irregularities of the animal Spirits, by reason of which, the heterogeneous and Spasmodick par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, enter the brain without any repulse, and more easily cleave to it; it is to be observed, that the animal Spirits are in some more tender, and easily dissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, from their very birth; so that indeed, they are not able to sufser any thing very strong or vehement, to be brought to the sense or Imagination, but strait they fly into confusions: For this Reason, women more than men, and some of them more then others, are obnoxious to the passions called Histerick. Further, sometimes a violent Passion, impresses on the spirits, though moderatly firm, this kind of dissipation and inordination, so that afterwards they are able to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer nothing strongly, or to resist any injurie: So it often happens, that morbid impressions are affixed on the animal <hi>regimen,</hi> by sudden fear, or great sadness, which can hardly ever after be blotted out: for from hence women often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract first the Diseases named the <hi>Mother,</hi> or from the <hi>Womb,</hi> and men the <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriack,</hi> and are for the most part still subject to them.</p>

It sometimes happens, that the heterogeneous and explosive Particles, are <note place="margin">Sometimes it is carried back again from the brain.</note> admitted into the Brain, which notwithstanding are again exterminated, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any great hurt, and before they enter into the nervous stock: for that the veins and Lympheducts, or water-carrying Vessells, often sup up what is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, and an enemy to the animall dominion, and convey it forth of doors, or dispose of it into Emunctuaries, or Sinks. Whilst such a matter is for a little while agitated in the brain, its particles being affixed to some of its Spirits, and at length striking against them, cause the <hi>Virtego,</hi> and the swimming in the head; but because they enter not into the passages of the nerves, Spasmodick Distempers do not follow.</p>
               <p n="2">2.

I have known some, who have had all the muscles and tendons through their whole body, asflicted with Contractions and leapings without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termission: I have known others whose thighs, arms, and other members, were perpetually forced into various bendings, and distor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If the explosive and hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Particles, be combined with the Spirits in a lesser plenty, they stick to them without tumult or perturbation, untill after some time, both Particles leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again one from another, and from their striking one another, raise up Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive paroxysms; which sort of Paroxysms are periodical, and are repeated exactly at certain hours; which happens by reason of the morbifick matters, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dayly poured upon the nervous stock, with an equal dimension, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>We meet with a double order or <hi>Classes</hi> of Evident causes; for either they are <note place="margin">

Or 2dly, the evident cause is said to be, whatever stirs and irritates suddenly the spirits, that they presently fall into explosions, and whatever it be, that causes them to strike off their <hi>Copula,</hi> and of this sort there are very many accidents, that provoke the spirits, planted now within the Head, and now within the nervous System, to convulsive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">The irritate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Cause, stirs up Spasins, direct, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected.</note> by a divers instinct (as is wont in the regular motions) which motions are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther direct, or reflected.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the former kinde chiefly are violent perturbations of the minde, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the spirits of the brain being agitated and confused, they excite others ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the nervous stock, and often praedisposed, to irregular explosions, so a vehement fear, anger, or sadness, do not only introduce epileptical and hysteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal fits, to those that are disturbed in their health, but sometimes cause to divers others, palpitation, and trembling of the heart, and also horrid convulsions of the members and Limbs. 2. As to the other kinde of evident cause, to wit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Spasms are excited by a reflected Act, this indeed comes to pass not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, as often as any heavy trouble, with an irritation of the <hi>fibres</hi> and spirits, happens any where to the nervous stock: for that this trouble being by and by communicated, to the chief fountains of the Spirits, to wit, the brain or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, from thence inordinate and violent motions, against the will of the minde, that is convulsive, being begun, they are returned back, for so either worms, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, or sharp humours, cruelly hauling the coats of the Intestines, cause spasms in those parts, and not seldom in the outward members.</p>
               <p>So much for the several kindes of causes, the conjunct, procatartick, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, whereby convulsive Diseases, becoming habitual, and are wont to be repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more grievous Paroxisms, do arise: But as we have assigned another spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of this Disease, where the Paroxysms depend on an evident solitary cause, or at most only from irritation, the Spirits being not yet praeoccupied with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosive <hi>Copula:</hi> it is now next to be inquired into, by what, and how many ways, this may come to pass. Concerning this in general, it is affirmed, that the Spas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic fits produced by mere irritation are either lighter and quickly passing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, or more grievious and not seldom deadly, as when poyson is taken, or when they come upon an overpurging medicine. Moreover it is noted, when the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick, or irritative matter falls upon the tales themselves, or the foldings of the nerves, that it also not rarely becomes explosive, and so Spasms produced also <note place="margin">The irritateing Cause distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, as to the places af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, as to the subjects.</note> from mere irritation (as we have already noted) are certain explosions; these be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus premised, we will dispatch the business in hand.</p>
               <p>The irritation of the Nervous parts, which is wont to cause convulsive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, happens in various places, and from various matters, which are incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and inimical to the spirits, and <hi>fibres.</hi> As to the things, enemies to the Nature of the spirits, you may observe, besides poysons, and the excess of cangible qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, <note place="margin">The places af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, are the beginnings the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the middle procefses, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>lphureous humours, yea worms, the stone, with many other things, to be infestous to the nervous stock, and ordinarily to stir up Spasmodick irritations. As to the places affected, or the seat of the irritative matter, although this brings hurt in any part of the nervous System, yet for the most part, it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106699:8"/>
wont to become most infestous, when it is fixed near the beginnings, or the ends of the nervous System, or about the middle processes of the Nerves, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in their foldings: Besides, such a matter, which irritating the Spirits, is wont to have the place of an Evident Cause, doth not seldome become, as we hinted but now, the means of a more remote cause, forasmuch as the heterogeneous particles, being sent from it, enter into the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> and being combined with the Spirits, renders them more apt and ready to be exploded.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore, it sometimes happens, that malignant humours, and infestous <note place="margin">How the irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Cause affects the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of the Nerves.</note> to the nervous stock, being poured out from the blood, on the region of the brain, and from thence dilated to the hinder region of the Head, do fall upon the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine</hi> of the nerves; where, if the little skin, which cloathes the oblong pith, be broken, they fall into the naked trunks of the nerves, and enter deeply into their <hi>fibres;</hi> wherefore indeed, <hi>Convulsive motions</hi> arise, not only in the neighbouring parts of the head, but sometimes in very remote, and not rarely in the whole nervous System: This is generally observ'd, in evill <hi>Crises</hi> of feavours, the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick matter being translated to the head; also in cephallic Distempers, being brought to the worst and deadly state. Truly, when I have opened the heads of those, who have dyed by this means, I found in all of them, the hinder Region of the oblong pith, immers'd with a sharp, and salt <hi>Serum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As the interiour extremity, or original of the System, so not rarely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior, <note place="margin">How the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the Nerves.</note> or the end, from a vellication or hawling there made, begets Spasms, or Convulsive motions, and transfers them on every side: that this is done ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the outward members, the prickings of the tendons, and Nerves, do testifie. No less are Spasms wont to be excited every way about, from a vellication or pulling, made in the <hi>Viscera,</hi> when at any time Medicines, or sharp humours, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so worms lying in the Ventricle or Intestines, pull the membraneous part, and so impress a troublesome sense on the chief sensories; presently from thence, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the firing of the spirits, <hi>Convulsive motions</hi> torment now the affected parts, and now indifferently any other parts: for oftentimes Spasms, from the more grievous hurt of some Inwards, do not only imploy the affected parts, and their neighbours, but also the Muscles of the face and mouth, and are likewise transfer'd to the exterior members. The stone impacted in the Uriters, causes not only cruel Contractions in that passage, but in all its neighbourhood. Moreover, some hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steric and other hypochondriac Symtoms, are sometimes induced by this means, forasmuch, as by a vellication made in the membranes of some <hi>Viscera,</hi> thence the Spasm is returned back.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The irritative matter, which is wont to be the Evident Cause of Spasms, <note place="margin">How the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle processes and foldings.</note> sometimes occupies the middle processes of the nerves; and therefore the parts, sometimes above, sometimes beneath its seat, are incited to convulsive motions: This appears plain enough in the foldings of the Nerves; for when the sharp recrements of the nervous juice, are laid up in them, they do not rarely create Spasms, through the whole neighbourhood: by this means, the Collick or Histe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick Distemper, is often seen to be begot or excited, there being no fault in those Inwards, only from the humours, deposited in the foldings of the mesenterie, as we will shew hereafter, when we come to treat of those particular Distempers. In like manner, by reason that the ganglioform foldings, being stopped up with a sharp and irritative humour, perfocation or choaking in the Throat, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Contractions of the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are caused. Besides, Spafmodick Distempers do not seldom depend, upon a sharp humour within the whole trunks of the nerves, and filling the passages of the nervous Bodys. We have seen some troubled with admirable, and perpetual Convulsions, so that they have been forced (as we have already mentioned) to run about, to leap, to fling about, and distort their members, to strike the ground with their feet and hands, and to exercise other strange gestures, even as if they had been bewitch'd; the genuine Cause of which kinde of passion, seems to consist in this, that the Juice watering the nervous stock, being most sharp like stygian water, and being become degenerate from its due <hi>Crasis,</hi> doth irritate continually, and as it were possess with a certain madness, the Spirits therein flowing, and implanted.</p>
               <p>From these things, which we have discoursed, about the various causes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, <note place="margin">The difference of Spasms in respect of their origine.</note> their manyfold <hi>Species</hi> and differences are made manifest: For first, we have made known, that Spasmodick Passions are most often derived, in respect of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106699:8"/>
their <hi>origine,</hi> for the head, being affected; or the morbific matter, slowing into the beginnings of the Nerves: yet sometimes, though more rarely, they depend upon such a matter, Creeping into the extremities of the nerves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As to the production of the Disease and symptoms, we observe the same sometimes to be produced, from a solitary evident Cause, as a sudden and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Of their Causes</note> Passion: but indeed more often, to require a more remote, or procatartic cause, or praevious disposition: moreover, the causes sometimes so to interfeer, that the procatartick, also may supply the place of the evident cause; and also, on the contrary, that this may serve in the place of the other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to the extention of the Disease, the Convulsive Distemper may be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into <hi>Universal,</hi> because the Spirits actuating the whole nervous System al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, and the <hi>Encephalon</hi> it self, are successively exploded; and <hi>Particular,</hi> in which the Spirits, within some private Region of the Animal Kingome, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The former is meant, when the animal Spirits are irritated, within their first fountains, to wit, the pith of the brain, and cerebell, from whence their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent <note place="margin">Of the extent of the disease.</note> explosions happen; wherefore every internal function of the soul, to wit, the sense and Imagination is obscured, and its exterior locomotive faculty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: This kind of universal Spasmodick Distemper, in which, besides the spasms of the Limbsand <hi>Viscera,</hi> the interior powers of the Soul suffer an Ecclipse, is again twofold: to wit, either primarie, which begins at the Head, and arises, forasmuch as the Spirits inhabiting that place, being imbued with nitro-sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous particles, are first exploded, and their inkindling snatches or takes hold of the rest, flowing in both the medulary and nervous <hi>Appendix,</hi> and there stirs up Convulsive explosions, as may be discerned in the Epilepsie.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Or this universal passion, causing Insensibility is Secondary, to wit, which being begun somewhere in the nervous stock, from thence, plenty of spirits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing successively affected, becoming like the undulation or moving of waters, is at length carried to the head it self: this often happens in paroxisms called hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterical, in which, by reason of the Spasm begun at first in the bottom of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or some intumescency or rising up in the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> then, the same spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing higher, with the same effect, through the pipes of the Nerves, the Ventricle, and by and by the <hi>Praecordia</hi> are drawn together, and at length, the Spasm force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably rushing to the Head, the patients fall down, and all Knowledg is taken from them, and lastly, the Disease being reflected into other nerves, Convulsive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the exterior members succeed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But as to the particular Spasm, in whose fit the sick continue well in minde, this Indeed is distinguished into various differences. As to the seat of the matter, which happens about the beginnings, extremities, or middle processes of the Nerves (as we have shswn) there arises a difference: For even as this morbifick matter, beseiging the beginnings of the nerves, is fixed about the head, middle, or end of the oblong pith, it therefore happeneth, that sometimes only the parts of the face or mouth, sometimes the <hi>Viscera</hi> of the lower, or middle Belly, and again sometimes chiefly the outward limbs, are hauled together.</p>
               <p>Further, a Convulsion, as to the duration of the fit, and its magnitude, uses to be distinguished, into a continual, and Intermitting: The former, as we have <note place="margin">Of the durati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Fit.</note> already hinted, is called <hi>Tenasmus,</hi> or a permanent Contraction, as when one part, or more, being Contracted or distorted with a constant stretching, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for some time in the same praeternatural posture; so, when the muscles, or a member, suppose the eye, Lipps, Cheeks, are distorted from their right po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, nor cannot easily be presently reduced: the cause of which is sometimes a resolution, or Palsie, in some other muscles, which when they are loosened, the opposite do too strongly Act, and draw forceably the whole part, towards themselves, which ought to stand, as it were betwixt them, in an equall ballance: but sometimes, such a permanent contraction, is excited, by reason of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons being stopped with an impacted serous humour, which become for that cause stiff: This Kinde of Distemper becoms very familiar in the Scurvy, that the sick sometimes are not able to extend any member or Joynt, but they are contracted round like a globe. Sometimes the Tendons in the back by reason of such a course of humour, draw the bones out of their due scituation, and cause a gibbousness, or bending out of the Body. The <hi>Tenasme</hi> is wont to be distinguished into uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106699:9"/>
of which there are three Kinds, to wit, <hi>Tension</hi> forward, <hi>Tension</hi> back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and <hi>Tenasmus</hi> properly so called; and Peculiar or particular, which chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly respects some certain member or joynt: we will speak of these distinctly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The intermitting Convulfion, is either short and momentary, which is act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by frequent turns, and as it were by little leaps, as is to be observed in the quaking and shakings of the Tendons in horror, which are to be distinguished be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween, with a frequent alternation of motion and rest: or the leapings of the Spasms, and their intervals, are drawn out longer: So it is usual, for Convulsive paroxysms, when they are repeated, to endure for some time, and to leave off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but such periods are now certain, or come to certain set hours, now rare, and incertain, and happ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>THus far we have treated, of the Nature, Causes, and differences of Spasms, or Convulsions in general according to a clean, new, and unusual <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> but (as I think) agreable enough with Reason: our next business is, to explain particularly the chief kindes of that Distemper; amongst which the <hi>Epilepsie</hi> easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deserves the preheminence, and the Consideration of it ought to proceed, by a certain right of method and order; for that this Disease, having as it were got a large Empire, in the humane body, exercises its Tyrranie, not only in the whole <hi>Encephalon,</hi> but for the most part, in all the parts of the nervous Sistem at once: wherefore by the Ancients, it was called <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>bus Herculeus,</hi> or the <hi>Hercnlean Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease,</hi> from the Cruelty of the distemper, and from the manner of the violent fits, as if sent, as it were by some Divinity, being so amazing, <hi>morbus Sacer,</hi> or, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Disease, to which may be added, the Conjecture of a certain Divine of our own Country, of no small note, to wit, that many, who were taken to be <hi>Daemonaicks,</hi> or possessed with the devill in the New Testament, were only Epilepticks, and that they called the cure of this Disease by our Saviour Jesus Christ, an ejection or exorcism of the evill Spirit: In truth, in this Distemper, no marks at all, of the morbifick matter appears, or are so very obscure, that we may have deservedly suspected it, to be an inspiration of an evill Spirit, at least it is probably, that as often as the Devill is permitted to afflict miserable Mortals, with his delusions, he is not able to draw more Cruel Arrows, from any other quiver, or to shew miracles by any better witch, than by the assaulrs of this monstrous Disease.</p>
               <p>As the Symptoms of the Epilepsie are very Stupendious, so their Causes, and the formal Reason of the Disease it self, are most difficult to be unfolded. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the businesse is variously controverted among authors, both concerning the part Affected, and also the manner of its being affected: many place its seat in the Brain, or its Ventricles, others in the meninges, or thin skins enwrapping the Brain, and some again in the middle, or lowest belly, but by what right shall be inquired into anon: In the mean time, laying aside the opinions of others, that the true speculation of this Disease may be found out, by the clew afright rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, we will first of all endeavour to give you its description, together with the whole sense of its <hi>Phaenomenas.</hi> Secondly, these things being rightly weighed, to finde out the subject of the diiease, and its chiefly affected parts. Thirdly and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to add the means and manner. whereby this disease is begotten, with the true Causes of its Symtoms.</p>
               <p>In the first place, As to the Idea of the Disease, the Epileptick Fit or assault, <note place="margin">The descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsie, or the history of the Disease.</note> seems to be only an universal, and more cruel Convulsion, to wit, in which the Spirits inhabiting the Brain, being first irregularly moved, and as it were confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, all the rest, dwelling in both the medulary, and nervous appendix of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eephalon,</hi>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:106699:9"/>
begin at once Convulsive motions, or inordinate contractions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue them for some space, with frequent leapings or palpitations: The accession of the disease come upon them at unawares, and oppresses the sick, not the least thinking of it, and in the twink of an Eye, casts them on the ground, deprived of sense and understanding; for that they do not only fall, but are flung down with a certain force, so that oft times the part first striken against the Earth, or other adjacent Bodies, is hurt with a bruise or wound; being last done, there comes upon them a gnashing of Teeth, with a foam at the mouth also, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the shaking of the head, and a frequent knocking it against the ground, the armes and thighs, yea, the hinder part of the neck, and back, either become presently slit, or else they are distorted hither and thither, with various ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings; some Cruelly beat their breasts, others strongly thrust out their armes and thighs, and fling them, and sometimes the whole Body, impetuously here and there; many have their <hi>praecordia,</hi> and <hi>hypochondria,</hi> and also all their lower belly swelled, and blown up very much: after some time, sometimes shorter, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times longer, these Symptoms, the Tragedy being as it were acted, cease, on a sudden, and then the sick come to themselves, and recover their senses: but after the fit there remains an akeing in the head, with a dulness, and hebitude of the senses, and not seldom a turning, or giddiness.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Epileptick Paroxysms</hi> are wont to return sometimes at set times of the day, moneth, or year; and most Commonly at the greater returns of the year or Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, or at the opposite aspects, or conjunctions of the Sun, or moon, they are wont more certainly to return, and to afflict more grievously: sometimes their comings or accessions, are uncertain, and wandring according to the occasion, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Evident Causes: there are also Fits or Poroxysms, now more light, which quickly passe away, so that the sick are scarce thrown to the ground, nor are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into disorder or insensibility; now more grievous, whereby they when taken, lye senselesse the space of an hour or more, and are tormented with horrid Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, as if possessed with the Devil: Sometimes tho more rarely, some forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing signes of the fit, warn them of their falling into it; as an heavinesse of the head, a brightness of the eyes, a tingling of the eares: sometimes a spasm or cramp pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, in some exterior part, as in the arm, or thigh, or else in the back, or <hi>Hypochondria,</hi> which ascending from thence, like a Cold air, and creeping to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the head, seems to bring on their falling down. Boys, and young Men are found to be more obnoxious to this disease, than old men, or men of mature age: who ever are once struct down by its fit, unless they be cured by the help of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, they will hardly be altogether free, from the infection of it, all their Life after; the more often the Fits are, the more grievous they become, which as they frequently return become more cruel, and enervate the use of the memory, Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, and Reason, and then the strength, and force of the whole animal fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, until its Occonomy being greatly perverted, the vital function at length de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cays, and by degrees is abolished. The weapons, and wicked preparation of this Disease, being after this manner layd open, we will next make an inquiry, in what part it fixes its seat; or what is its next subject.</p>
               <p>The accession of the Epilepsie, and the manner of invasion, seem plainly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <note place="margin">The subject or the seat of the Disease is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into.</note> that its primary seat, ot part chiefly affected, is contained somewhere within the Head; but that a Paroxysm sometimes begins in the remote parts, and from thence ascends towards the head, which indeed seems only to be so, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens by accident, when in the mean time, the morficick Cause subsists about the <hi>Encephalon</hi> it self, (as shall be anon declared): but that from the first assault of the Disease, presently a strange In sensibility, and disorder, with contractions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of all the Members and <hi>Viscera</hi> succeeds, it is a manifest signe, that the whole joynting of the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> and the original of all the nerves, are possessed with the morbifick Cause: But truly, although it seem most difficult, to unfold where this cause, or morbifiek matter subsists chiefly; sor, neither is it probabIe, that the same is diffused thorow all the parts of the Brain; yet it neither appears in <note place="margin">Some affirm i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>vill.</p>
               <p>Among the various opinions os Authors, about this matter, there are two that seem more probable than the rest, and challenge an assent with an equall likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to Truth. One of which asserts the very middle of the brain, and the other
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:106699:10"/>
the meninges, or the thin skins encompassing or cloathing it, to be the primary seat of the Epilepsie: The Reason of the former is founded in this, that where the fountain of the animal Spirits, and the original of the sensitive soul it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fists, there ought to be placed the cause of this Disease, certainly when the chief faculties are first hurt, all the rest easily participate of the same evil: But in truth, though I may grant in the Apoplexy, and the <hi>deliquium</hi> or fainting of the spirits, that it is so, yet it follows not in a Convulsion (of which kinde of distemper the <hi>Epilepsie</hi> is) that all the <hi>fibres</hi> and nerves should be pulled together, because the middle part of the brain is first pulled: for that this, as it is a moist and fluid sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and wanting of sense and motion, seems not capable of contraction, or the Spasmodick Distemper: wherefore others thinking the brain, and every part of it, free from the blame of this Disease, cast it altogether on the meninges: affirming, that the membranes, cloathing the brain, and chiefly their processes, spread upon the clefts of the brain, and <hi>Ceribel,</hi> as they are hauled by the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick matter, do conceive or beget Spasms, or horrid Convulsions, and then that from the Meninges themselves, so Contracted and brought together, the included Brain is greatly compressed, and bound together, so that its pores and passages be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound up, the great amazing disorder and insensibility is induced, and also the trunks of the nerves, to which either meninge or skin is fastened, being brought into a consent with them, enter also into Convulsive motions: And indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, the formal Reason of the Epilepsie, may perhaps seem to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded; but truly when I consider further of the matter, I think we may difser from this opinion, because it does not appear by what Course, or for what cause, the falling down being at hand, these meninges should beget such horrid Spasins. Nay, it neither appears, how from them, however Convulsive thev be, the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leptick Paroxism should be induced.</p>
               <p>As to the sormer, it seems an impossible thing, sor the meninges to be so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, <note place="margin">It is affirned, that the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninges are not first of all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected.</note> as to their whole Concavities, that being bound more strictly together, like a purse, they should on every side pull together their contents, and draw them into a narrower space: for that the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> sticks most firmly to very many places of the skull, yea, and the <hi>Pia mater</hi> is tyed to it, near the processes of the hollow turnings, by a mutual knitting of the membranes, and every where besides with a Continuity of Vessells: Hence it easily appears, either that mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane, as to the greatest part of it, is immovable, so that they cannot fall into so univer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>al Spasms: but in respect of lesser Spasms, as when a certain portion of this or that meninge, or both together, is pulled, indeed we grant such may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen: for I have often heard those troubled with great headach, to complain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly of a great constriction of the parts, lying under the side of the skull, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on the right, sometimes on the left, and yet from thence no assault of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down, has followed: Further as those membranes being notably hurt, do cause great vellications or haulings, yet upon it there is not wont to be an Epileptick sit to follow: for I have known, from an Imposthume in the <hi>Dura mater,</hi> when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing broken, and that the stinking matter had knawn the more tender meninges, and shell of the Brain, that the sick have fallen first into an amazednesse, and at length into a deadly Apoplexie, who notwithstanding, in the whole course of the Disease, was free from any Epileptical Symtom. Also I remember, I have seen one, who had the <hi>Dura mater</hi> very much torn, by the instrument of an unskilfull Surgion, and another, that by a wound, had that with part of his skull taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, so that a portion of the Brain swelled forth, and yet to neither of them any Epilectical passion hapned: wherefore neither is it likely, that the blood, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> humors, or (if any shall so argue) the vapours, compacted within those meninges, can bring in any greater evill, than either a stroke, or wound, inflicted on them, or filthy matter there poured out: Befides, those who are more lightly troubled with the <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> so that they scarce fall down, and have their minds free through the whole assault of the disease, would perceive the membrans to be so contracted, and the globe of the brain to be more straitly thrust together, if there had bin any such kinde of affection; but they on the contrary, seem to have the Brain as it <note place="margin">The spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the middle of the brain are the primary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease.</note> were inflamed, and to be sensible, that the spirits leap forth, and are as it were explosed, with a certain fierceness.</p>
               <p>And indeed, I think it is very likely so, that the Epileptick Paroxism is stired up, from a certain suddain rarefication, and explosion of the animal spirits, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:106699:10"/>
the Brain, which are in truth the first, and immediate subject of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease; to wit, whereby the Brain it self is inflated, and rendered so insensible, and the Nerves hanging thereto, also put into convulsions: For hence it comes to pass, that the accession of this Disease begins so on a sudden, and determines per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly without any great provision or remains, of the morbifick matter; because the Infection is not brought so much to the solid parts, as to the Spirits them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.</p>
               <p>We have already shown by what means, the heterogeneous and explosive <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula,</hi> consisting as it seems of <hi>nitro-Sulphurous</hi> particles, cleaving to the spirituous particles of the animal Spirits, and lastly, being smitten and explosed by them, by reason of plenitude or irritation, produces Convulsive Symptoms: But although this kinde of Spasmodick <hi>Copula,</hi> is first distilled from the blood into the brain, yet, for the most part, it does not take hold of the spirits there, or at least, it stays not long with them, in that place: but rather, being thrust from thence, towards the nervous <hi>Appendix,</hi> causes particular and respective Spasms, near the places affected: But sometimes, if the Spasmodic matter be more plentifull and strong, and the constitution of the brain weak, the heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> being fixed to the Spirits, not only in the nervous stock, but also to those planted within the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalon</hi> it self, causes the Epilectick disposition; and the explosive particles of the Spirits, and this <hi>Copula</hi> knocking one against another, stir up the falling fit. For indeed, since the assault of the <hi>Epilepsie</hi> urging, the Insensibility, and great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is for the most part the first Symptom, and all the pathognomick, it may be concluded, that the animal Spirits, lying within the middle of the brain it self, are affected before others; and that therefore, that part, is the principal seat of the Disease: Then, forasmuch as the falling of the sick, or casting to the ground, and spasms of rhe members and <hi>Viscera,</hi> most often follow that Insensibility great disorder, or leaping forth, of the spirits, it follows that the animal Spirits also inhabiting the nervous System, are imbrued with the same explosive <hi>Copula,</hi> and are drawn into consent with those inhabiting the brain it self, and are excited by them, to explosions purely inordinate; although sometimes (by the whole <hi>series</hi> of Spirits, planted both in the brain and nervous stock, being like a long train of gunpowder, praedisposed to explosions) an exterior Spasm, beginning a great way off, perhaps in some member or Inward, may afterwards be carried to the Brain, as shall be more fully shown hereafter. In the mean time, it is concluded, that the region of the Brain it self, is always the primary seat of this Disease; and that we ought to suppose, the conjunct cause of the Distemper, not to be water heaped up within the ventricles of the brain, nor a thick or clammy humour, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted in the passages of its pores: for such Causes are begotten by degrees, and therefore would shew some certain signes before-hand, of the first coming upon one: further, the assault of the fit being over, such a matter could not be wholly discussed in so short a time, but that from its reliques, some impediments of the animal function would remain, which indeed rarely happens in the Epilepsie, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse inveterate: but, for the exciting of the falling down, no lesse can be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then that the animal Spirits, which flowing within the marrowie substance of the brain, perform the acts of the interior sense, of the Imagination, and appetite, having gotten an heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> should be inordinately exploded, and so they being disturbed beyond their orders and stations, the Superior faculties of the animal regimen, must suffer an eclipse; then, from this greater explosion of spirits, as it were from a fiery enkindling, other Spirits, inhabiting the marrowy and nervous appendix, being also praedisposed to explosions, conceive the like disorder, and in like manner, cause the explosive Convulsive motions, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Bodys.</p>
               <p>For although we conclude, that the middle of the brain, is always the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry seat of the Epilepsie, and that from the beginning, the morbific matter is layd <note place="margin">The disease af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily very many parts, of the Nervous Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem.</note> up wholly in that Region; yet the distemper growing grievous, this being more plentifully spread thorow the head, enlarges its bounds, so that it being strowed here and there, and far and neer stretched out, Spasmodic particles, are cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rest of the Brain, and also into the nervous <hi>appendix,</hi> like gunpowder or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosive seed, whereby it comes to passe, that at the first approach of that disorder of Spirits, Convulsions follow, sometimes in these, sometimes in those parts, and not rarely thorow the whole Body.</p>

               <p>The most notable difference of the Epilepsie, is wont to be taken from the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to wit, that the brain, or part of it, labouring with this disease, is eithe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t is to be observ'd, that this kinde of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper (as <hi>Galen</hi> hath noted) proceeds either from the external, or internal <note place="margin">The Reason of the Epilepsic which is said to be excited by consent.</note> parts: we meet with many examples of Epilepticks, in whom the fit being just coming upon them, a spasm is felt, with a numness in the hand or toe, or other particular member, which presently from thence, as it were with a pricking or tingling, creeps towards the head, which when it hath attained, immediately the fick party falls flat on the Earth, and is hurried into insensibility and disorder of spirits, and other proper demonstrations of the Symptom of the falling sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness: neither is it a less usuall <hi>proaemium</hi> of this disease, that there first arises as it were a conflict, in the stomach, splcen, womb, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But in very deed, as to this, we must say, that in every Epilepsie, not only the <note place="margin">The Conjunct Cause of the Epilepsic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

As to those praeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Symptoms in some Epileptical people, they sometimes have the place of an Evident Cause, and sometimes only of a signe: For when the evill disposition of any inward, as the stomach, spleen, or womb, happens with the disposition of the Epilepsie, as often as any perturbation is begun in that distempered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, it easily happens, by reason of a transmission of the ferment from thence, or a continuation of the spasm to the head, an Epileptical fit is excited in the Brain prae-disposed to act.</p>
               <p>But these kind of symtoms of the sallingevil, which being suscitated from without, seem to propagate the distemper to the Brain, do often arise from the consent of the Brain it self, and are only signs of the approach of the Epileptical Fit, or of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits beginning to be exploded, in the brain: For when the animal spirits planted in the middle parts of the Brain, and Cerebel, and also those in the oblong pith or marrow, neer the beginnings of the Nerves, are so filled with an heterogeneous Copula, that, for the Casting of it off, they are ready to bring on the assault of the Disease, before they are all exploded heap by heap, some spirits lying more outward, in some private Nerves, because they are destitute of the wonted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of their superiors, fall into certain inordinations, and so begin spasms, which fpasms (as it is often the manner in this kinde of distemper) begin at the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities or ends of the Nerves, inserted to this or that member, or Inward, from whence by degrees, they creep forward to their beginnings; whether being come forth with the spirits, thorow the whole <hi>Encephalon,</hi> before disposed to explo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:106699:11"/>
being moved by that spasms, and so being snatch'd away with a fiery enkindling, are suddenly exploded or thurst out; so they seem to stir up the Epileptick Fit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at first from themselves, as it were secondarily, and by instinct, brought from fome other place. After this manner, sometimes the Histerical passions, when beginning in the bottom of the belly, they are Communicated to the Brain, are thought to arise from those Viscera, and to be stirred up by their fault; when in the mean time, the morbific cause subsists chiefly, about the beginnings of the Nerves, as we have elsewhere signified, and shall again show hereafter, when we come to treat particularly of the Spasmodick distempers.</p>
               <p>There yet remain other differences of the Falling sickness, to wit, that it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haereditary, or acquired; again, either kind is variously distinguish'd, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">Other differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepsie.</note> of the Age, or time, in which it first comes upon one, to wit, when the first coming of it happens before, or about the puberty, or being of ripe age, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it; further as to the Efficacy of the disease, into strong, and weak, for as much as the Paroxysms or fits, are with, or without the disorder of spirits, and falling, as to its inordinate manner, whose assalts are wandring, and uncertain, moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, it is wont to be distinguished, according to the peculiar symptoms, in these, or those sick people, by reason of some disposition, or manifold Idiosyncrasy, or propriety, of the Temperament.</p>
               <p>But from what has been said before, of very many of the Symptoms, which are to be met with in this Disease, the causes do easily appear, so that there will be no need here, to consider all of them: but of some of them, which seem more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, it will not be from the matter, to discourse in this place.</p>
               <p>We will therefore first of all inquire, why those sick of this Disease, do not fall <note place="margin">Why Epilep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks fall down with violence.</note> as those that are apoplectick, or have swounding fits, but are rather stricken down with violence, against the Earth, or any other bodys, that are by chance opposite to them, as if they were smitten down by some wicked Spirit, so that very often, some part of the head, or face, is hurt, with the violent fall: And those so distempered, even like the Daemonaicks in the Gospel, are frequently flung into the fire, or the water: but it may be here declared, that the Epilepticks become obnoxious to these kinde of evills, for that the fit coming upon them, all knowledge or providence is taken from them; and further the nerves neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to the head, being strongly contracted, the whole bulk of the Body is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away headlong: but in the Syncope, and Apoplexie, the fall of the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perd Body, seems as the ruines of a building, which happens, by reason that its props are taken away: but indeed in the falling Sicknesse, it is no otherwise than if a house were overthrown, bv the blowing up of Gunpowder, which is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved much from the place where it stood.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:106699:12"/>
and so at last drives it out of doors: wherefore, a foam or spumous spittle does often succeed in other distempers, where the pneumonic or breathing nerves are either contracted, or are hindred from performing their Function.</p>

But it is to be observ'd, that the Epilepsie sometimes terminates of it self, and is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times overcome by the help of medicines: which happens about the age of puber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and then only, so that, who are not cured, that time being elapsed, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the twenty fifth year of age, they scarce ever after recover their health, for about the time of ripe age, there is a twofold alteration of the humane Body, and therefore, there often happens a Solution or loosing o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

About the time of ripe age, as the Blood pours forth something before destinated for the brain, through the Spermatic Arteries, to the genitals, so also it receives as a recompense, a certain ferment from those parts, through the veins: to wit, certain particles imbued with a seminal tincture, are caryed back into the bloody mass, which makes it vigorous, and inspire into it a new and lively virtue, wherefore at that time, the gifts both of the Body and minde, chiefly shew themselves; Hairs break out, the voyce becomes greater, the courses of women flow, and other accidents hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, whereby it is plain, that both the blood and nervous Juce, are impregnated with a certain fresh ferment: wherefore, the morbific ferments or seeds, unlesse they be overcome by this new natural firment, they afterwards continue untame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able even to Death.</p>
               <p>But that the Epilepsie is sometimes cured by the help of medicines, Experience doth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>As to the former, whenas the fits are often repeated, and every time grow more cruell, the animal function is quickly debilitated; and from thence, by the taint, by degrees brought on the Spirits, and the Nerves serving the Praecordia, the vital function is by little and little enervated, till at length, the whole body languishing, and the pulse being loosned, and at length ceasing, at last the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal flame is extinguished.</p>
               <p>But that this Disease often ends in the Palsie, melancholly, or madnesse, the reason is, because the tone, and confirmation of the brain is depraved, by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

Forasmuch as these are taken without any sensible evacuation, or also perturbation, following in the viscera or humours, it is a wonder, by what formal reason, or virtue of acting, they are wont at any time to help in this disease.</p>
               <p>Concerning this matter, intricate and obscure enough, if there may be place for Conjecture, when as we have already asserted, the procatartick Cause of the <note place="margin">In what the Virtue of the specificks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in the Epilepsie.</note> Epilepsie, to consist in the heterogeneous Copula, joyning or cleaving to the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, inhabiting the Brain, and inciting them to praeternatural explosions; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that those things which take away, or resist such a cause, must be of that nature, that by strengthening the brain, and binding up its pores, may exclude that Copula, and so fix, and as it were binde the spirits, flowing within the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or marrow of the Brain, from leaving their Copula, that they shall not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more apt or prone, to irregular explosions; Perhaps after the same manner, as when gunpowder or aurum fulminans being pounded with sulphure, or sprinkled with spirit of Vitriol loses its thundering virtue. And indeed, these kind of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, to wit, one or both of them, may be suspected, yea, in a manner detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in most anti-epileptick Remedies: For truly, Paeony, Missletow, Rue, the Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the vally, with many others, abound in a certain manifest astriction, that 'tis likely, their Particles being taken inwardly, and so dilated to the brain, by the Vehicle of the blood, and nervous Juice, do so binde, and shut up its too loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>It will not be needfull here, for the curing of the Epilepsie, to propose a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat method of healing, with exact forms of prescriptions, because there are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant every where among Authors, general precepts, and most choyce Remedies, and the Prudent Physitian will easily accomodate, both the Indications, and that plentifull provision of medicinal stuff, to the particular Cases of the sick.

The Domesticks observ'd, that she allways fell on the same side, so that siting nee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> the fire, if she sate in the right Corner she would be flung in the midst of the fire, but if in the left Corner, she fell against the wall of the Chimny: once when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing left alone in the house, she fell upon the burning Coals, and so miserably burnt her face, and forepart of her head, that the skull being made bare of the skin and flesh, a deep and large escar was burnt into it: and afterwards the outer shell of it fell off a hands bredth. In the mean time the sick maid, so long as the ulcers contracted by the burning, ran with filthy matter, she was free from the fits, but afterwards, they being healed up, the falling evill returned: This Disease began first to shew it self about the time of puberty, for this maid, presently after the begining of it, had her Courses, and afterwards they constantly observed their set times, though her distemper grew dayly worse: Various kinds of medicines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing administred to this sick Creature, availed nothing, because it was the custome and practise, of her, and her friends, quickly to change both the Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and method of Physick, if an happy event did not presently follow, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themselves very much to every Empirick, and outlandish Mountebanks.</p>
               <p>That in this Case, the Vertigenous Distemper, with a short delirium, was the forerunner of the Epilepsie, it plainly argues, the original of this Disease be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted in the middle of the brain, to depend upon a certain inordination of the Spirits, to wit, those dwelling there, at the begining, begun to admit an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terogeneous Copula; which being more plentifully heaped up, being moved ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of its own accord, or occasionally, while it was shaken off, induced, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the spirits being disturbed, and not yet very explosive those former distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers; Afterwards, from the same cause, by degrees growing worse, the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations of the Spirits did raise up their manifest explosions, and chang'd the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigo, and <hi>Delirium,</hi> into the Epilepsie.</p>
               <p>But that this maid began to be sick, about the time of ripe age, it hence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follows, as the natural ferment, so sometimes the praeternatural, expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates it self, first at that time; wherefore, as it happens, that the menstruous purgations doe then first break forth, so the seeds of the falling sicknesse, whether innate or acquired then budded forth a little, and by degrees were ripened into fruit: when the praeternatural Ferment first appears, ofttimes the natural fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, blots it out, hence the Epilepsie of young ones, often ends about the time of puberty or ripe age, but if that Firment, or taint of the disease, comes after the menstruous flux, or together with it, and ceases not presently, it remains for the most part afterwards, during Life, of it self untameable, and not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by any Remedies.</p>
               <p>From this observation, that a Cautery accidentally, and by chance being made on this sick party, freed her from the fits of the Disease, it may be inferr'd that fontanells or Issues, may be profitably administerd, in the Cure of the Epilepsie: for wheresoever an emissary is opened, for the constant carying away of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous water, both from the blood, and nervous juce, there very many heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous and morbifick particles, flow out with it, that therefore the brain might remain free.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV. <hi>Of other kinds of Convulsions, and first of the Convulsive Motions of Children.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AFter the Epilepsie, as it were the principal Spasm, in the chief place excited, to wit, within the middle part of the brain, the other Kindes of Convulsions come to be treated of in order. The differences of those, are best taken from a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold kinde of cause, and the various manners, and accidents of either. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready shown, that all Spasmodic distempers, do flow, either from the meer irritation of the spirits or from their explosion, by reason of the cleaving of an Elastick <hi>Copula</hi> to them, or jointly from both, together: wherefore, the manifold Ideas of Spasms, may be distinguished, and distributed into certain Classes, as it happens for this, or that cause, or either together, to remain in the various places of the <hi>Encepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> or the nervous Appendix. For indeed, the Spasmodic matter, or the explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Copula of the Spirits, finding a passage chiefly, and most often thorow the Brain, and sometimes in some measure thorow the extremities of the nerves, sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists either about the origine of the nerves, or their middle processes, or their outmost ends, or abounds in their whole passages, as shall be by and by more particularly declared: Further, an irritation stiring up Convulsions by it self, or with a previous remote cause, although it be made every where in the nervous stock, yet it chiefly, and more frequently produces such an effect, about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginings, middle processes, and foldings, or ends of the Nerves. But the same Kinde of Cause and effects, are after one manner in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nfants and children, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in youths, and those of riper age. Since theresore we have determined, particularly to consider, all the kindes of Convulsions, we will first discourse of the Convulsive motions of Infants, and Children.</p>
               <p>Infants, and children, happen so ordinarily, and frequently to be tormented with Spasmodick Distempers, that this is reconed the chief, and almost the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kinde of Convulsions; for the Symptoms of this kinde, in other more ripe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are wont to be called by other known Names, and referred to the Epilepsie, hysterick, hypochondriac, Collic passions, or also to the Scurvie: but in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, they are called, as it were by way of Excellency, Convulsions.</p>
               <p>As to this we must observe, that children are found to be greatly obnoxious to Convulsions, chiefly about two seasons, to wit, within the first month after they are born, or about their breeding of Teeth: Although it often happens, that the assaults of this Disease, may come also at other times, and from certain other Causes.</p>
               <p>In the first place therefore, it very often happens, that children newly born, or at leaster'e they are two months old, are afflicted at every turn with Spasms, excited in divers parts; for that inversions of the eyes, distortions of the cheeks, and Lipps, or tremblings, yea Contractions of the Tendons, and frequent jerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or leapings forth of the members, and sudden shakings of the whole Body, infest them; and that the same effect likewise sometimes afflicts the praecordia, appears plain enough, because whilst the Spasms busie the Limbs, and outward members, also the face becomes now pale, now of a livid, or dead Colour, from the blood stagnating in the heart, and the Lungs being at that time contracted. As therefore, Spasms are wont to infest three Regions of the Body in children, to wit, the parts of the head and face, the outward members and Limbs, and the Praecordia and viscera, we observe now these regions, now those, now, two or all together to be possessed, by the morbific Cause, to wit, as it is fixed, either about the beginings, or ends of the nerves; and when the former of these hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:106699:16"/>
as the superior part of the oblong pith, the middle, or the lowest part of the spinal marrow, is touch'd, one, or more parts together, are assaulted by the Morbifick Cause.</p>
               <p>As to the other Causes of this Distemper, to wit, the procataric and evident, those of the former Kinde, do chiefly consist in two things, sirst that all the parts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nfants are very weak, and abound with a viscous humidity; to wit, the Brain less firm, and the to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e of the nerves very loose, so that they are not able to bear the more light force of every matter, but the Spirits inhabiting them, are easily incit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, because it appears by observation, that children, not only, nor all, who are of a more tender Constitution, are found to be prone to this Disease, therefore, this ought to be rather accounted for a reason, of the more remote morbid Cause, that the Blood, and nervous Juce, are originally vicious, in some Infants, by reason of evills coutracted from the womb: For that the sanguineous mass, wanting eventilation for many months past, becomes impure in children newly born; wherefore, broad and Red puttings forth, like the small pocks, shew th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Hence we may deservedly suspect, such impurities of the blood, sometimes to be poured forth into the brain, and nervous stock, considering their debility, and for that reason Spasmodic Distempers to arise; to wit, whilst the blood being vitious from the womb, endeavours to purifie it self, it transfers its faeculencies into the head, which were wont to be exterminated by the putting sorth the Red-gum, or r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Sometime past, in this City, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny chilbren of a certain woman dyed of this Disease, at length, the fourth, as the others, dyed within the month; we dissected the Head, and here no serous Collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies or water did overflow the ventricles, but only the substance of the Brain, and its appendix, was moister then ordinary, and looser; what was most worthy of observation was, that in the Cavity, which lyes under the Cerebel, upon the trunk of the oblong pith, we found a remarkable heap of clotter'd, and as it were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted blood: but in truth it is uncertain, whether this matter, deposited there from the begining, had primarily caused the convulsions; or rather, whether this blood being extravasated, and expressed, by the contraction of the parts, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted round about, was not the effect, and product of the Convulsions, and not the cause of them; for also in Apoplectical people this kinde of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>2ly.</hi> Thus much concerning the Convulsive motions of Children, which are wont to infest them, by reason of an Infection contracted from the womb. If that at this bout they should escape the Disease it self, or at least its deadly strokes, nevertheless, about rhe time of breeding teeth, they would be found at last to be obnoxious, to the same danger: for when the Teeth, especially the greater, are about to cut, oftentimes a feavour is excited, to which not seldom Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Joyned: and though at this Time, children are grown stronger, and may better bear the sits of the disease, then when new born, yet the convulsive Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, now stirred up by no other grievous occasion, becomes very dangerous, and sometimes deadly.</p>
               <p>But forasmuch as childern, who fall into feavours, about the time of breeding of Teeth, are not all tormented with Convulsions, it therefore follows, that some disposition to this disease, either innate, or acquired, doth precede; and that the pain caused from the breeding the Teeth, is to be esteemed only the means of a more strong evident Cause, to wit, Children, who being indued either with a Cacochymia, or juce causing ill digestion, or with a more weak constitution of the brain, and nervous stock, have their animal Spirits too much adulterated, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipable, are sometimes disposed for the coming of Convulsive distempers: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when so acute pain, together with a feavor, afflicts, that latent dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is brought into Act.</p>
               <p>If it be here ask'd, for what reason a feavour, and then Convulsive motions following thereupon, come to those <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>raedisposed, in teething, it may be answer'd, that either effect may be attributed to the pain, as the immediate Cause: We ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally know by our selves, what the torment is, that follows an irritation about the roots of the Teeth; in truth so great, and so cruell, that a more cruell can scarce be; for that one or two notable shoots, of the 5th pare of nerves, reaches to the roots of each Tooth, which when it ss hauled by the sharp particles of the Blood, or other humours, there layd up, causes a most sharp sense of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, or pain, by its Corrugation: But this kinde of Vellication or hauling of this Nerve, happens thus to children breeding teeth, because that the membranes and fibres, are every way distended, by the Teeth, now increasing into a greater bulk, and as yet included within the scarce hollow gums: hence the blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hindred in its Circulation, causes a tumour, and so presses the nerves, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so pours on them the more sharp particles of the Serum, by which, being nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pulled or hauled, they are tormented with Corrugations, and painfull Spasms.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:106699:17"/>
Therefore, when so cruel pains happen to children, from their breeding Teeth, it is no wonder if a feavour, and also Convulsive motions sometimes follow: the former of these happens, both for as much as the blood being hindred about the pained part, is not circulated with its wonted and equall course, wherefore it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inordinatly moved, in the whole Body; and besides, because Spasms being stirred up somewhere in the nervous stock, the corrugated and contracted nerves, presse together, and pull the Arteries, and by that reason, stir up irregular and feavourish sluctuations in the Blood. But sometimes Couvulsions happen in breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teeth, both because the blood growing hot, sends forth heterogeneous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, to the animal government, and so stirs up the spirits into explosions; and besides also, when this acute pain, and as it were a Lancing, follows upon the teeth being about to cut, it communicates a very troublesome and irritative sense, from the affected parts, to the first sensorie, presently from thence, the motion of the rage is retorted, by the same or other neighbour nerves, which by reason of a praevious disposition, doth not rarely become convulsive.</p>
               <p>Besides these two occasions of Convulsions (which are wont to be chiefly, and more often in children) to wit, the times of Infancy, and breeding Teeth, this Distemper also is excited at other Times very often, and for other Causes: For in whom the Seeds of the Spasmodick Disposition is sown, they sometimes unfold themselves presently after the birth, and are ripened into morbid fruit; or else lying hid for a while, they now come before the breeding of Teeth, and follow a long time aster it; and by reason of other evident causes, to wit, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, or Internal; of which sort are a sickly, or breeding nurse, milk Coagula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the stomack, or degenerating into an acid or bitter putrifection, a feavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish distemperature of the head, Ulcers or wealks of other parts suddenly vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Changes of the aire, the Conjunctions, oppositions, and aspects of the Sun, and moon, and such like; they at length break forth into Act, from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain event. Concerning these, there is no need, that we should particularly discourse.</p>
               <p>When all the Children, of a man dwelling in the neighbourhood, dyed of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, within the space of three months, at length, to prevent that fatal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, they sought for remedies, for a child newly born: I being sent for, a few days aster the being brought to bed, sirst advised the making an Issue in the nape of the neck, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

After half a year, the Convulsive motions wholly ceased, but a painfull Tumour arose, about the lower part of the <hi>Spinae dorsi</hi> or back-bone, from which proceeded a certain distortion of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> or joynts of the back bone, and a weakness of the legs, and at length a Palsie. It seems in this case, that the Spas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modic or Convulsive matter, being wont to come upon the brain first, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the nerves, entring at last the Spinal marrow, and being thrust out at its further end, it wholly stopt up the heads of the appending nerves, and shut out the passage of the Spirits: to wit, because other narcotick, and more thick, had joyned themselves, to the explosive particles.</p>

And this for the most part is the cause, that sick people, after long and ill handled Feavours, also after the more grievous <hi>Cepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic</hi> Diseases, at length dye of Convulsions; as I have found, by the frequent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomie of the Carcases, of those who dyed by that means. Also it appears by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical Observation, that the brain may be overflowed by a certain serous water, without the distemper of the Convulsive disposition; and further that in some,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:106699:19"/>
who dyed of the Epilepsie, and other Convulsive diseases, there was no deluge of the <hi>serum,</hi> within the ventricles of the brain: By which it is given us to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that the Convulsive distempers, do not flow only from the waterie matter in the Head; but that they arise not at all from such a cause, unless the <hi>serous</hi> water, overflowing the <hi>ventricles</hi> of the Brain, and chiefly that underlaying of the <hi>Cerebel,</hi> be imbued with heterogeneous and explosive particles.

After he was dead, his carcase being dissected, his Lungs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared all over tumified, and in some places Ulcerated: then his Skull being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there flowed within all the <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the brain, a great quantity of yellow and salt <hi>Serum:</hi> which water certainly whilst it did slide forward upon the fourth <hi>Ventricle,</hi> about the Trunk of the oblong marrow, his head leaning back, rushing upon the heads of the wandring, and intercostal pair of nerves, did stir up the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Convulsions about the <hi>Praecordia:</hi> but so long as his head was inclined for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the heap of <hi>serum</hi> flowed back into the anterior <hi>Ventricles</hi> of the Brain, the origine of the nerves remained free from that Convulsive matter.</p>
               <p>Having hitherto shown, how many ways, and by what passages, the morbific matter, being dilated towards the origine of the Nerves, feems to bring on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions, it were easie, according to these reasons, to unfold many Convulsive Symptoms: for besides the Convulsive motions of Infants, and children, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times excited from the same kinde of Causes, hither may be referr'd the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, and sudden leapings forth of the nervous parts, which follow upon fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. As also those passions commonly called <hi>Hysterical,</hi> also <hi>hypocondriacal,</hi> and certain others, proceed not seldom from the <hi>morbific</hi> Cause, rushing upon the beginings of the Nerves. We will therefore endeavour to establish the truth of this <hi>Hypothesis</hi> by some other Histories, and examples, of Sick people; but in the first place, we will propose observations of that Kinde, in whom the morbific matter, setling upon the beginings of the nerves, and not being as yet slid deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into their processes, induced frequent <hi>vertigos,</hi> and only more light Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of the <hi>Viscera</hi> and <hi>Praecordia.</hi>

But after the winter Solstice, having taken cold, she was troubled with an huge pain of the head, a tingling of the ears, a giddiness, with a great defluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the eyes, that it easily appeared, that the heap of <hi>Serum,</hi> which before this time was wont to distill into the Breast, was now wholly layd up, within the head and Brain: besides, an effect of which was, that as often as she began to sleep, she was greatly infested with passions, as it were <hi>histerical,</hi> to which she had never been before obnoxious: For when ever being sleepy she closed her eyes, presently a bulk ascending in her bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>, a choaking in her throat, tremblings, and leapings about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> were stirred up; which Affections notwithstanding quite ceased, when she was thorowly awakened, so that the Sick party was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitated, to abstain almost altogether for many days and nights from sleep.</p>
               <p>Being sent for to this Lady, after she had bin sick and weak for many days, I was compelled at length to use gentle medicines: Therefore I took care, that blood should forthwith be drawn from the foot, to four ounces, and every day a Clyster of milk and sugar to be administred, by which she was wont to have three or four stools: besides I gave her every eighth hour a dose of the Spirits of <hi>Harts horn</hi> in a Spoonfull of the following Julap.

with the <hi>Roots of Bryony, bay salt,</hi> and <hi>black soap,</hi> to be layd to the soals of her feet. Sometimes I gave her in the evening, in a little draught of the prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed Julap, half an ounce of <hi>Diacodium,</hi> to which succeeded a moderate sleep, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the wonted Convulsions following: which kinde of effects, from opiats exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in the like case, I have often experimented: for the quenching her thirst, I gave her a <hi>Ptisan,</hi> with diuretick Ingredients boyled in it: by the use of these, she was very much eased, in a short time. But what proved a great benefit to her was, that an Imposthnme in her ear, breaking of its own accord, powred forth, at first a yellow matter, and afterwards for many days, a great plenty of thin <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor</hi> or <hi>Excrement,</hi> by which Evacuation, the Convulsions of the <hi>Visecra</hi> and <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia</hi> wholly ceasing, the disease was perfectly Cured.</p>
               <p>As to the Reason of the aforesaid sicknesse, without doubt it seems, that those Distempers were excited, by the serous colluvies, layd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

But, when by sleep sometimes Creeping upon her,, the excursion of the unquiet Spirits were restrained towards the Brain, (which indeed necessarily happens, when we sleep, the nervous Liquor within the pores of the brain, at that time being more plentifully admitted) they tumultuarily rushing upon the heads of the wandring pair, and intercostall Nerves, troubled the whole <hi>scries</hi> of Spirits, flowing within the passages of those Nerves, and so caused the aforesaid Convulsions, about the <hi>Praecordia, Viscera,</hi> and muscles of the Throat. I have known many both Men and women sick after this manner, who, when they have been troubled with an headach, an heaviness of the hinder part of the head, or a <hi>Vertigo,</hi> have while they slept, felt forthwith in their <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia,</hi> or <hi>Viscera,</hi> or in both together, perturbations as it were Convulsive; which indeed happens from the bending downward of the tumultuating Spirits, being reflected from the brain, upon the beginings of the Nerves: But that the use of opiats, brought a pleasing sleep to this sick person, without the wonted Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons following, the reason was, because the animal spirits, as unquiet and furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as they were, yet by the Intanglement of the narcotick Particles, they were bound as it were in chains, that afterwards, without any resistance they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by sleep.

After that this Sick maid had liv'd subject to these kinde of fits, being very often repeated, for about 14. months, she at last became Epileptical, that as often as the assault of the evill returned, being flung prostrat on the Earth, she was taken with the insensibility or ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zedness of Spirits, with the foaming at mouth, and other peculiar symptoms of the falling-sickness.

               <p>Who shall rightly weigh these Symptoms, need not suppose them vapours, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing from the womb, or spleen, and in those seek for the morbific cause in vain: which truly may more certainly be placed in the head it self: for it seems, that by reason of a great sadness (which happens often to women) at the beginning, a great debility, together with a vitious taint, was impressed on her brain; so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the animal spirits derived to the brain and Cerebell, brought with them, heterogeneous particles, of a mixt kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> Partly narcotick or stupifying, and partly explosive or rushing forth: which kinde of Copula, when they had more plentifully conceived, through sleep, they were stirred up to the shaking of it of, by mere fullness: as soon therefore, as the woman was awakened, the same spirits, being moved, either a ben<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In truth, this distemper was somewhat akin to the Epilepsie, but that the morbific matter was not as yet stayed within the regal palace of the brain, or its middle part, so that there it might infect the spirits, within their Fountains; but yet, the same heterogeneous Copula, did cleave more strictly to them, dissociated or disjoyned below, and dividing themselves into various and lesser rivolets, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beginnings of the Nerves. In the mean time, the spirits, whereby they might shake off that matter, being often explosed, caused the stupor, and Insensibility, but bending to some other place, they rushed upon the beginnings of the Nerves, for that reason caus'd those Spasms or Convulsions of the <hi>viscera:</hi> But that the fits come only in the morning, after a plentiful sleep, the reason was because the heterogeneous Copula of the spirits, coming to them with the Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous juce, was at that time gathered together to a fit fulness for explosions, which being then wholly shaken off, the sick person remained therefore all the rest of the day, free from the distemper, till the next day, when the nights sleep had brought to the head, a new supplement of morbific matter, the like fit returned in the morning; which perhaps, as the sleep had been shorter or longer, was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved now within the brain, now near the nervous origine.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106699:22"/>
coming to himself, he would talk soberly, and walk about in his Chamber; he knew what he had suffer'd, and ask'd pardon of the standers by, presently after he began to draw his eyes inward, and swiftly to role them about: then presently the convulsive distemper returning, acted the like Tragedy as before: and after this manner, he would have five or six of these kinde of convulsive fits, within three hours space. In the midst of one of these fits, a vein in his Arm being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, and a large orifice made, the blood flowed out slowly, and was seen pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently to be congealed: and so indeed, that being received into the dish, it did not flow about, after the manner of Liquors, with a plain and equal <hi>superficies,</hi> but like melted sewet, drop'd into a cold vessell, one drop being heaped upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it grew to a heap.</p>
               <p>If this strange distemper had hapned to a woman, it would presently have been said, that it was the mother, or histerical, and the Cause of it would have been <note place="margin">The reason of the aforesaid Case,</note> laid on the fault of the womb; especially, for that the ascent of something, like a bulk, began the fit, from the bottom of the belly: But when this common soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which most often is the mere subterfuge of Ignorance, cannot be admitted in this case, it seems most congruous to reason, to referr all these Symptoms, to the evill affections of the brain, and nervous stock. For truly it may be plainly gathered, that the cause of the disease, did lye hid in the head it self, by the Symptoms preceding the fit, which did denote a very great agitation of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, within the head; that inflation of the brain, and heavy swimmings, which constantly came just as the fit was coming upon him, the turnings of the eyes, manifestly argue, that heterogeneous and explosive particles, did adhere to the spirits, dwelling within the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> near to the beginnings of the Nerves. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>o that this case, comes near to the nature of the Epilepsie, excepting, that the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits within the middle of the brain, did not admit an heterogeneous Copula, nor being explosed in another place, did they tumultuously break forth there; for du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the fit, the sick person was still in his senses, or had the use of his memory: But the morbific matter, being more plentifully laid up in the head, when from thence it was slid, more deeply into the pipes, both of the Interior und Exterior Nerves, it had placed mines of explosive seeds, very diffusive, in the <hi>viscera,</hi> both of the lower and middle belly, and also in the exterior members; so that, when the animal spirits began to be exploded, near the beginnings of the nerves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently from thence, others inhabiting the mesenteric enfoldings, and then others in the other nervous enfoldings, interjected from the outmost bound, even to the head, being explosed in order, did even continue the Convulsions, from one part to another, untill they came to the head it self: but presently the explosion being translated from thence, to the spirits dwelling in the spinal marrow, and Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Nerves, the most strong Convulsions of the muscles, and members of the whole body follow'd: But that, that ascent, as it were of a bulk, or substance which very often was perceived in the lower belly, about the beginning of the Convulsions, proceeding from the spirits, within the mesenterick enfoldings, being brought into explosions, shall be more largely declared anon, when we come to treat of hysterick passions.</p>
               <p>In the mean time if it be ask'd, for what reason, that, the convulsive paroxysm, beginning in the part of the head, near the beginnings of the Nerves, presently the spirits dwelling in the outmost parts (as many as are pre-disposed for that Symptom) enter into explosions, and so transfer the convulsive Distemper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there fully raised, upwards, (for it is for the most part so, whether the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the disease begins in the bottom of the belly, or about the middle of the abdomen, the <hi>Hypochondria</hi> or <hi>praecordia,</hi> for that the Convulsion is wont to creep by degrees, from those places towards the head.) I say, for the solution of this, these two considerations are offer'd, to wit, in the first place we consider, that <note place="margin">Wherefore the Convulsions begin from the extremities of the Nerves.</note> when some whole <hi>series</hi> of spirits is disturbed, those who reside in the extreamest bounds are first destituted of their originall Influence; wherefore, they, before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, grow tumultuous, and begin to grow irregular; hence it is, when the Nerve of the arm or thigh, is strained hard, by leaning on it, that the wonted Influence is hindred, that a numness, with a sense of pricking or tingling, is first felt in the fingers or toes; from whence by degrees, it creeps upwards towards the places affected. Secondly, the other is, and rather the reason of this distemper, to wit, that the spirits being ready for explosions, when they are contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

the nervous pipes, one or more, as so many distinct little Tubes, they require a sufficient ample space, in which they may be able very much, and ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> while the Spirits, about the nervous origine, being first struck off, leap back towards the <hi>Encephaleon,</hi> for that cause they stir up the Vertigo: the more open explosion of the spirits, for the most part, begins about the inferior passages of the nerves, or at their extremities, where the Trunk of the nerve is either dilated, into more ample foldings, or terminated in more <hi>fibres</hi> largely dispersed abroad; then those Spirits being explosed, there is room made presently for others succeeding in order, whereby in like manner they may be exploded: Hence we may observe, whilst the exterior Spirits are exploded, if a Ligature or hard Compression being made, the succession of others into the same space, or their progress toward the exterior parts be intercepted, the Convulsion is wont to be hindred, that it cannot ascend upwards: wherefore when a numbness (as medical Histories testifie) being arisen from the farthest end of the finger, or toe, creeps to the superior parts, with a tingling, or like a cold air, and at length reaching the brain, causes most horrid Convulsions; if by and by after the motion is begun, the Arm or thigh be strongly tyed, the Spasm or Convulsion not being able to get over the bound place, is hindred from coming to the head; yea, it is usuall for histerical women, as soon as the swelling of the belly, or the ascent of the bulk in the <hi>abdomen</hi> is first perceived, to gird strongly their waists, with Swathing-bands, and so oftentimes they prevent, the <hi>Praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> and the region of the brain, from being disturbed, by that same Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Fit.</p>
               <p>But that the Blood, being let out in the midest of the fit, was so soon congeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, indeed it very ordinarily happens to be so, in Convulsive and Apoplectical <note place="margin">Wherefore the blood is soon congealed in convulsive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers.</note> Distempers, as the most learned <hi>Heighmore</hi> hath first noted, out of <hi>Hendochius:</hi> But that some from hence contend, that Convulsions rely altogether upon the thickness of the Blood, and stagnation, its motion being hindred, cannot be granted: Because, the blood taken from those who are subject to convulsions, a little before the fit, is dilated with <hi>serum,</hi> and fluid enough: wherefore, we may lawfully think, that, that Congelation is caused by the <hi>paroxysm</hi> it self, because in Convulsive motions, and immoderate Contractions of the Nerves, and <hi>Viscera,</hi> the interflowing Blood, by the exhalations of its spirit, and <hi>serum,</hi> is somewhat loosened in its mixtion, and therefore in some sort coagulated; like as when milk, by reason of too much agitation, and separation of the parts one from another, grows into butter; wherefore this kinde of Coagulation of the Blood, seems ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be the effect, than the Cause of the Convulsions.</p>

               <p>SOmetimes Convulsive distempers do arise, without any fault in the Head, by the irritation and explosion of the spirits, remaining about the extremities of the nerves, which plainly appears, because, when medicines haul sharply the Ventricl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

in those parts, but besides, convulsive motions do sometimes torment (or are retorted on) the members, and outward Limbs: for indeed, as we have shown elsewhere, when the sense of a very grievous Trouble torments any part, and from that is communicated to the chief Sensorie, presently from thence, an involuntary, and irregular motion, is wont to be reflected on the spirits in that place irritated; and that not only by the same nerves, to which the sense of the pain was carried, but sometimes also the Convulsion is reciprocated, by others, either neighbouring, or altogether extraneous: So the Stone being fixed in the Ureters, and irritating very much its nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> excites Convulsive motions, not only in the distemperd Vessell, but almost in all the <hi>Viscera</hi> of the Abdomen; So that, the urine being suppressed, Torments diffused here and there, and very often horrid Vomitings follow. Wherefore, 'tis not at all to be doubted, but that both diseases, and some Convulsive Symptoms, are very often induced, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of an outward hurt, brought to the Tops of the Nerves, terminating with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the membranes, muscles, or <hi>Viscera:</hi> yea, in the hysterical, <hi>hypochondriacal,</hi> and certain other passions, if at any time Convulsive motions are excited, in the hurt head, by the fault of the womb, spleen, or other Inward; verily they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise by this only means, to wit, by the Trouble of the rest of the parts, being translated this way through the Nerves, (but in no wise, by the Vapours) to the brain, and are propagated, all about, into various Regions of the Body.</p>
               <p>But it should here be noted, that although the evident Solitary cause, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <note place="margin">Convulsions begin from the ends of the Nerves, both by r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Three years after, she having taken cold, and having observed but a bad course of dyet, all things began to be exasperated, the hurt part swelling into a bigger bulk, troubled her with an accute, and almost continual pain, that the sick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, for the cruel torment, could take no rest, for many days and nights, neither could she suffer the <hi>glandula's</hi> of her Breast, being then made more tumid, to be either touch'd or handled, yea nor any noyse, or shaking to be made in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>

When to this Tumour, about to degenerate into a Cancer, they had applyed fomentations, and Cataplasms of <hi>hemlock,</hi> and <hi>mandraks,</hi> and other stupifying and repercussing things, this gentlewoman began to susfer certain Convulsive affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, infesting her very often: At first, as often as the pain in her breast did most cruelly torment her, she felt in that place, prickings, also convulsions, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, running about here and there: then presently her <hi>Ventricle,</hi> and <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondria,</hi> and often the whole <hi>Abdomen,</hi> were wont to be inflated, and very much distended, with an endeavour of belching, and Vomiting; by and by, the same distemper, being leasurely translated to the superior parts, excited Insensibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; to which shortly after, Convulsive motions succeeded,, in the whole Body, so strongly, that the Sick party could scarce be held, by three or four strong men.</p>
               <p>These kinde of sits, at sirst were wandring, and only occasionally excited: to wit, they would come, as often as the pain of her brest was strained, by some e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident cause: Afterwards, these Convulsions did more often infest her, and at last, they became habitual, and periodical, twice in a day, to wit, they were wont to come again constantly, at so many set hours after eating: And when after this manner, the sick Gentlewoman, had been miserably afflicted, for six months, at length, she began to be molested with a vertiginous Distemper of her head, exercising her almost continually: for which evill, when a fomentation of aromatick and cephalick herbs, had been a good while administred to her head, she became better, as to the giddiness; but then she was perpetually infested, with a quite new, and admirable Symptom, <hi>viz.</hi> an empty cough, without spitting, night and day, unless when she was overwhelmed with sleep: After this worthy Virgin, had tryed without much benifit, diverse medicines and remedies, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by several Physitians, she was at last helped, by making use of the most temperate Bath, at the <hi>Bath;</hi> then being presently married, after she had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and was brought to bed, she by degrees grew well.</p>
               <p>If the reasons of the whole disease and its Accidents, be inquired into, without doubt, the convulsive distemper, was sirst of all excited from the tumour, or pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">The reason of this.</note> place of the breast; the cause of which was, partly the most sharp sense of pain, being impressed from its <hi>fibres</hi> and nervous parts, but partly by the hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneous Copula, being affixed on the spirits inhabiting those <hi>fibres</hi> and nerves; for truly, it may be suspected, that the most sharp humour impacted in the Tumor, which perhaps had in some sort flowed thither, by the passages of the Nerves, being repercussed, by the use of Topicks, had entred the <hi>fibres</hi> and nervous fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or little strings disposed thorow the whole border or neighbourhood, and so the heterogeneous, and explosive Copula, had clove to the spirits; for the shaking off of which, as often as by pain they were excited, they entred into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive explosions, and together with them, other spirits flowing within the neighbouring Nerves, by consent of the forms (as it often happens) were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded after the same manner: Then the convulsive distemper, when it first had begun in the extremities of the Nerves, being continued thorow their passages, even to the head, was wont to cause the insensibleness, and from thence, leaping back upon the whole <hi>nervous system,</hi> the convulsive motions, of the Limbs and all the members: The sits, about the beginning of the sicknesse, being excited after this manner, by reason of pain, from the distemper'd part, were carried secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darily to the brain, and its appendix: But afterwards, when the spirits inhabiting those places, being often explosed, by sympathy, had so loosned, and weakned the pores of the containing parts, that there lay open a passage, within the same, for all heterogenious particles to enter, with the nervous juce, the convulsive <hi>procatarxis</hi> or more remote cause, also increased in the head; and the spirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habiting the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> being infected with an heterogenious Copula, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves begun the convulsive fit, or at least afforded the sirst instinct to its assalt, which did return, for the most part, at such set hours after eating, because the morbific matter, was carried in, together with the nervous juce, almost in an equal dimension: In truth, in such cases, where the convulsion being generall, doth possess almost all the parts of the whole <hi>nervous system</hi> successively, we may suspect, that the animal spirits, had contracted an heterogenious and explosive Copula, in the whole nervous stock, which, when it is arisen, at the set time, to a fullness, incites the spirits themselves, at the appointed time, in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

               <p>

We have largely enough, in another place, discoursed of the nervous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and in their description, and use, we have shown, that 'tis very likely, the more grievous fits of convulsive motions, beginning oftentimes within these parts, are from thence propagated on every side, into the neighbouring parts, and not seldom to a great distance: at least, that it seems much more probable, that the heterogenious and explosive particles, after they have overcome the tract of the head, and its medullary <hi>appendix,</hi> and being more deeply slidden into the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells of the Nerves, and their passages, together with the juce watering them, do spread their stores within the nervous foldings, as it were in Cross-streets, and by paths, and there sometimes make their stations, untill at length, being more plentifully heaped up, they as it were with Collected forces, produce the more cruel convulsive distempers: This I say, appears to be much more probable, then <note place="margin">That the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous foldings is the seat of Convulsive matter.</note> (what is commonly said) to suppose them vapours, arising from the womb, spleen, ventricle, or any other inward, in which all the fault is easily thrown: For within these foldings, there are spaces large enough, for morbific mines, that the matter may be there at leasure laid up, and remain, till it be gathered to a fullness: But then, because we believe, that great plenty of spirits lodge there, more than in any other little cells, the heterogenious <hi>Copula</hi> growing to them, lays as it were tinder for more grievous explosions, so that, the spirits being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosed within these bodies, do not only inflate, and dilate them, but elevate and lift them up, from their Place (even as a house blown up with gun-powder;) wherefore the parts lying over them, are suddenly lifted up into a tumour, and loose are drawn violently hither and thither. That after this manner, the more cruell sits of Convulsions, about the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and <hi>Viscera,</hi> are very often stirred up, I have found to be true, besides the Arguments taken from reason, not long since by my own sight: For when I opened the dead body of a Gentlewoman who had been exceedingly troubled with (as they say) the Mother fits, or hysterical Distempers, I found the womb wholly faultless, but the Nerves near the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Indeed there are more considerations of solid reasons, whereby we are induced to believe, that the passions called hysterical, do most often arise, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive <note place="margin">3. <hi>Observation.</hi>
                  </note> matter, heaped up within the <hi>Mesenterick</hi> enfoldings, and by turns explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: which shall be more clearly manifested, where we treat especially of those diseases: But, neither is it less probable, that the Collick-pains, do very often proceed, from a more sharp and irritative matter, contained in the same enfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Besides, as often as the convulsive fits seem to begin from the spleen, or ventricle, by reason the beginnings of which are inflations, and very great distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances of those parts, it is likely, that the nest of the convulsive matter, was hid within the nervous enfoldings, belonging to the spleen or ventricle: Also, this kinde of matter, seems to excite within the Cardiac foldings, most heavy trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blings, and passions of the heart; and within the pneumonic, or cervical, (or those belonging to the Lungs and throat) enfoldings, most terrible fits of the Asthma. In our Treatise of the Nerves, we have related a notable case, of a worthy Gentlewoman, to whom a serous matter, wonted to distill from the forepart of her head, through her left nostrill, fell down behind her ear: where, when the most cruel pain did infest her, Convulsions also, and admirable contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions followed: whereby the joynting or compaction, now of the brain, and the whole head, seem'd to be pulled downward, now the throat, <hi>praecordia,</hi> and <hi>Vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera</hi> upwards: which kinde of Convulsions, vexing the parts so opposite, and at such distance, by turns, when they did proceed from one and the same seat, of the disease, planted in the midst, it will be obvious to conceive, that the grieved place, as the origine of either convulsive affection, was the ganglioform enfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, planted near the <hi>Parotidae,</hi> or the two chief <hi>Arteries</hi> of the throat: into which, the Nerves both of the wandring pair descending from the h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

choaking in the Throat, so often excited in the convulsive fits, did proceed. But there will be a more fit place, to speak of this, when we shall particularly handle, the convulsive diseases, and symptoms. We shall now endeavour, to search into what remains, of the last kind of Convulsions, of which we made mention above, to wit, which relies on the nervous Liquor being infected, thorow its whole mass, with heterogenious and explosive particles, and for that reason, irritate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole processes of the Nerves, and the nervous bodies, into universal Spasms, or Convulsions; and those either continual, or intermitting.</p>

But truly, what these Authors say concerning the cure of this Distemper, and is practis'd commonly thorow the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is worthy of great admiration: for those stung with a <hi>Tarantula,</hi> as very sick as they are, as soon as they hear musical Instruments, presently they are ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of their pains, and leaping into the middle of the room, they begin to dance, and jump about, and so continue it, a long while, as if they were well, and ailed nothing: but if it happen, that the Fidlers leave off never so little a while, they straitways fall to the ground, and return to their former pains, unless by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant musick they dance, and leap, till the poyson be wholly shaken off: For this end therefore, Musitioners are hired, and are changed by turns, that without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of the noise, those who are bitten, may dance so long, till they are quite cured. Thus saith <hi>Mathiolus:</hi> to which <hi>Ferdinand</hi> adds, that poor people do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend almost all their substance, in these fidlers, and musitians, who wander up and down all that Province; and by playing to these <hi>Tarantulasized</hi> people, make much benifit: they dance or leap about, in the villages, and Pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But why the painfull Convulsions, which are raised by the bite of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">In what the reason of the Musicks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying the symptoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists.</note> being presently allayed by musick, are wont to turn into dancing, does not so plainly appear. That some affirm, this little animal (for that by the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Aristotle</hi> it should be most wise) to be delighted with musick, and for that reason, its venom being impress'd on man, by fermenting the humours, to induce the like love of musick: I say, this conjecture will not satisfie a minde desirous of Truth, because, that supposes a musick-loving nature in the spider, and the same to be communicated to man, by a <hi>matastasis,</hi> or as it were a certain <hi>metempsychosis,</hi> or transmigration of soul, both which are taken upon trust, and little satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but it may be rather said, that the venome inflicted on the nervous liquor, by the bite of the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> is too gentle, to be able to extinguish wholly the Animal spirits, or to dissipate them very much asunder, and to compell them into more cruell explosions, but only to put them to flight, and to incite those flying here and there, into lighter, and somewhat painfull Convulsions; and that the Musick, with its flattering sweetnesse, doth congregate together, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally associate, with ease, the spirits so dissipated: wherefore, whenas the same spirits, by reason of the Infection sticking to them, are apt to involuntary and Convulsive motions, the melody disposes them, delighted together, and directs them to such Convulsions, that entring the bodies of the nerves, by a certain Course, and Order, they are carried as it were in certain prescribed limits and compasses, until at length the particlcs of the venome, being quite evaporated,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:106699:27"/>
and the fury and rage of the spirits being worn out, they wholly shake off that madnesse. For truly, musick doth easily carry men sound and sober, whether they will or no, or thinking of another thing, into actions answerable to the sound of the harmony; that presently the standers by, at the first st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>iking up of the Fiddle, begin to move their hands and feet, and can scarce, nay are not able, to contain themselves from dancing: Let none therefore wonder that in men bitten by the <hi>Tarantula,</hi> when the animal spirits being moved, as it were with goads, they are compelled to leap forth, and wander about hither and thither willingly, if they are excited to dancing, and composed measures, at the stroke of an harp; so that as in these distempers, the spirit of the musick, as it were inchanting the outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous spirits, and in some measure governing, and changing their convulsive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, serves instead of an Antidote: for that the animal spirits, being very much, and for a long while exercised, after this manner, wholly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Indeed it is a usuall thing (as I have observed) both for men, and women, to be <note place="margin">The reason of it.</note> sometimes tormented with this inquietude of their members, and as it were with a fury or madness, that they have been forc'd to walk, till they were tyred, as also to dance, leap, and run about, here and there, that by this means they might shun the grievous trouble, and sometimes faintings away, which were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to invade them: The reason of which seems to be, that the animal spirits, forasmuch as they being incited, by an heterogenious <hi>Copula,</hi> in the whole ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous kinde, become fierce, and altogether unbridled, which so to exercise, and tire out, there is need, both that they themselves may be tamed, and that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosive <hi>Copula,</hi> may be shaken off.</p>
               <p>That Convulsive distempers are sometimes excited by witch-craft, is both commonly believed, and usually affirmed, by many Authors worthy of credit: <note place="margin">Universall Convulsions from Witch-cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </p>
               <p>But indeed, it is sometimes observ'd, that, besides these kinde of Convulsive distempers, coming upon Feavours, and secondarily excited; in a malignant constitution of the air, also from the breath of a Pestilent Contagion, the nervous Liquor hath been infected before the blood, or else apart from it, and therefore a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or Convulsions, have gone before a feavourish Distemper. Further, I have often observed, that some irregular Feavours have arose, in which the blood has been hardly seen to boyl up, or grow hot above measure, but the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of this slow and very dangerous feavour, were layd chiefly in the nervous humour; which being by degrees brought to maturity, did induce Convulsive Distempers, with a <hi>Delirium,</hi> or madness, and other wastings or exorbitances of the Animal Spirits. For the sick never complained of heat, or thirst, being
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:106699:28"/>
soon made feeble, and as it were strengthless, they were presently obnoxious to frequent giddiness, also to rremblings of the Limbs, and as it were leapings forth, besides, to twitches or jumpings of the muscles, and tendons, and to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, and pains wandring about, here and there. This kinde of sickness, by some Physitians, because it seem'd to consist in the solid parts, rather than in the blood, is called a <hi>malignant hectick feavour;</hi> when indeed, the same being fixed chiefly in the nervous humour, may be better called, the <hi>Convulsive nervous Pestilence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is mention made, by <hi>Gregory Horstius,</hi> of a <hi>Convulsive,</hi> and <hi>malignant Disease,</hi> which was sometime past <hi>Epidemical,</hi> in <hi>Hassia, Westphalia,</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <note place="margin">

                  </note> Countrys: they being taken therewith, without a feavourish heat, immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate effervescency of blood, whilst they were imployed about their familiar oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, hardly perceiving themselves to be sick, were wont to have about their hands, or feet, and sometimes in both, a sense of tingling, with a numbness, running up and down: then by and by, their fingers, together with their Arms, and thighs, were now strictly drawn together, now most strongly stretched forth, as if they were frozen. Those kinde of Contractions, and extentions, rendred themselves by turns, and then changed places, that now the distemper resided in one part, then presently in another: But (as it often hapned) if the Disease, at once invaded the whole Brain, Universal Convulsions, and oftentimes epilepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Fits, infested the sick: besides, those labouring with it, were obnoxious at some turns, to a <hi>Delirium, madness,</hi> and sometimes a <hi>Lethargie:</hi> This sickness, continued a long time, without any <hi>Crisis,</hi> or sound solution, and could scarcely be so perfectly Cured, but that the Disposition of the Brain, and nervous parts, remained evill all their Life after.</p>
               <p>As to the Reasons of this Disease, and Symptoms, it is obvious enough, that <note place="margin">The reason of the symptoms.</note> the same depends altogether upon the vice, and notable depravation, of the nervous juce. That pricking, or tingling, for the most part, at the first coming of the disease, was procured for this Reason, because that Liquor, beginning to be poysoned, and loosned in its mixtion, by the malignant Infection, presently it oppressed the animal Spirits, abounding therein, and inhibited them from their wonted, and free expansion; wherefore, they being half overwhelmed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to creep, as it were among bryers, or things that catch'd hold of them, or held them back, they excited the sense, as it were of tinglings running about: but then, because this disease growing worse, the nervous Liquor was yet more perverted in its <hi>Crisis,</hi> or disposition; the heterogeneous particles, which were brought together in it, cleaving to the Spirits, caused them to be moved hither and thither, and to be unduly exploded; for which Reason, the Contractions and horrid distentions in the members, and the tumults, and great inordinations in the head, were raised up. But that in this feavour of the nerves a solution or difficult <hi>Crisis,</hi> or none at all hapned, the reason was, because the nervous juice being slow, and as it were mucilaginous, and therefore heavy in its motion, was not defaecated, or cleared, as the blood, by a critical effervescency, nor easily conceived, that kinde of fermentation, by which the pure, might be separated from the impure.</p>
               <p>Indeed I have known a sickness, much like to this example, to be often excited in our Country, and to invade whole families, especially children, and the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger people. Some years since, a populary or childish feavour, very much infesting the Brain, and nervous stock, exceedingly spread in this country, yea almost thorow all <hi>England:</hi> The History of which Disease, being described in that time, in which it raged, <hi>viz.</hi> in the year 1661.

Which kinde of Symptoms, were very often esteemed, as it were the peculiar signe, of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of this Disease, if in some, those had been wanting, or hapned to be more remiss, instead of the head being affected after that manner, the disease took more deep root in the Brest, with an excited cough, as shall be told by and by.

                     </gap>nsensibility did molest them. For I often observed, in many children, and not seldom in women, after seven or eight days from their falling sick, that their knowledge and Speech failed them, and so the sick have lain, for a long while, yea, sometimes for the space of a whole month, without any taking notice of the by-standers, and with an involuntary flux of their excrements; but if they continued in some sort the use of Judgment, and Reason, they laboured with a frequent <hi>delirium,</hi> and constantly with absurd, and incongruous <hi>Chymera's,</hi> in their sleep. But in Men, and others of a hotter temperament, from the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific

matter, instead of a <hi>Crisis</hi> being translated to the brain, a Fury, or dangerous; and oftentimes deadly phrensie did succeed. But if neither Stupidity, nor great Distraction did fall upon them, swimmings in the head, Convulsive motions, with Convulsions of the members, leapings up of the <hi>tendons,</hi> did grievously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest them. In almost all the sick, the belly was for the most part loose, casting forth plentifully now yellow, now thin, and serous excrement, with a great stink: it was rarely that vomiting fell upon any one: The urine in the whole process of the Disease, (unless when the morbifick matter, being caried more plentifully into the Brain, did threaten a phrensie) was highly red, so that some, by reason of the deep colour of the water, judg'd this feavour to have been plainly Scorbutick: which notwithstanding appeared to be otherwise, because <hi>antiscorbutic</hi> Remedies, (of which indeed many, and almost of every kinde were tryed) were little or nothing beneficial. It was most of all to be admired, how soon after the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Disease, the flesh of the sick consumed, and they reduced to the lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of a <hi>Sceleton,</hi> when in the mean time, there was no great heat, that might by degrees consume the solid parts, nor any violent evacuation, which might greatly take them down.</p>
                  <p>Besides these evills molesting the region of the head, a distemper no less dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, oftentimes fell upon the breast. For in some, tho not in all, a cough very troublesome, with abundance of spitle, and thick, was excited: this hapned in some, about the declination of the disease, to wit, whilst the confines of the brain were serene, as it were the clowds sent from thence to the thorax, a great <hi>Catarrb</hi> suddenly rained down upon the Lungs. But in others, who especially had little infection of the disease in the head, presently after the beginning of the feavour, a cruell cough, and a stinking spitting, with a consumptive disposition, grew upon them, and suddenly, and unthought of, precipitated the sick into a <hi>Pthisis:</hi> from which nevertheless, they recovered, by the timely use of Remedies, often beyond hope. It was observ'd in some, that after a long ecclips of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive facultie, and oppression of the brain, from the morbific matter, at length tumors did follow, in the glandula's, neer the hinder part of the neck, out of which, being hardly ripened and broke, a thin and stinking ichor or matter, ran for a long time, and brought help. I have also seen watery pustles, excited in other parts of the body, which pass'd into hollow ulcers, and hardly curable: sometimes little spots, and <hi>petechiales,</hi> appeared here and there: yet I never heard, that any more broad, or blew, of these kinde, were seen in the sick. Not withstanding, tho this feavour was not remarkable for very many malignant spots, yet it was not free from Contagion. For that in the same Family, it invaded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all the Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <p>Altho the course of this disease, (unless when it intimately settled in the brain) did appear so gentle, and continued without any horrid Symptome; yet its cure being always difficult, succeeded not under a long time: For the sick rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grew well, within three or four weeks, yea for the most part, scarce in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months. If this disease fell upon men of a broken Age, or strength, especially those who were before obnoxious to <hi>cephalic</hi> distempers, as the <hi>Lethargie, Appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexie,</hi> or Convulsion, it oftentimes kill'd them in a short space: but if there was any hope of recovering, it could be but slowly procured, (all Remedies what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever scarce bringing any sensible help) so that the sick, did no sooner come out of the sphear of this disease, than they fell into the confines of a Consumption.</p>
                  <p>If the formal reason, and courses of this aforesaid sickness be demanded, it here <note place="margin">The reason of them.</note> easily appears, the watering Liquor of the brain, and nervous stock, for the most part both together, with the blood, to be in fault, and the immediate cause, especially of the troublesome Symptoms: to wit, forasmuch as this water, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the first assault of the disease, was grown more poor then usuall, and as it were lifeless; therefore a Languishing, and enervation, with a <hi>spontaneous</hi> weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and impotency to motion, hapned in the whole body, and with a sudden wasting of the body, in the sick. Further, forasmuch as the same Liquor, was stuffed with heterogeneous particles; <hi>viz.</hi> partly narcotick, partly explosive,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:106699:29"/>
therefore, a numbness, a sense of pricking, leapings up of the tendons and muscles, and contractures, also the <hi>Virtego,</hi> giddinesse, and other more grievous Cephal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ck distempers did arise: Moreover, forasmuch as by reason of the evil of the nervous juice, being not quickly or hardly to be mended, the cure or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the disease, became so hard, and lingring. But for that the fault of this <hi>Latex,</hi> necessarily depended on the discrasie or evill disposition of the blood, also of the depraved constitution of the brain, what their morbid dispositions were, and by what means they brought forth the beginning, or tinder of the Symptom of the feavour but now described, let us now see.</p>
                  <p>As to the former, it seems, that at this season, by reason of the hot and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi'd constitution of the year, and no blast from the north (the little bodies of which imbue the blood, and juices of our body, as it were with a nitrous sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning, and by agitating them, defend them against putrefaction) the blood in most men, and chiefly in children, youths, and women, became like standing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, that so contracts a setling, very impure, stuff't with heterogeneous parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and turning to a clammyness, and watrishness; in which, the more pure spirit and sulphur, being somewhat depress'd, the watery particles, being carried forth with the impure salt and sulphur, were too much exalted. Wherefore the blood, both by reason of its <hi>Crisis</hi> or constitution, being vitiated, also by reason of heterogeneous particles, being heaped up more plentifully in its bosome, was made more fit, either of its own accord, or occasionally, or because of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to receive a feavourish Effervescency, so that from thence, very many fell at this time into feavours. But the blood growing hot, from the feavourish taint being received, did not presently burn with an open flame, but like green wood laid on the fire, with a flame as it were suppressed, and much incumbred with smoke. Wherefore, the morbific matter, being heaped within its mass, was not wont, (as in a regular feavour) to be consumed by the burning, and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, at the set time, to be exterminated by the <hi>Crisis:</hi> but yet, a little after the beginning of the feavour, a great portion of this matter being powred into the head, or <hi>Thorax,</hi> or into both at once, and afterwards being continually supplied in those parts, it induced either the aforesaid distempers of the brain, and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous stock, or a cough, with a consumptive disposition, or both together, and for this reason, about the beginning of this disease, when a pulse quicker than it ought to be, and a high colour'd urine, and full of contents, did show the blood to grow hot with a feavourish distemper, the sick did not complain of heat, or thirst; because the blood growing hot, did lay up its impurities, and recrements, forthwith into the provision of the nervous Liquor, or into the Lungs; wherefore, within these receptacles, the Symptoms presently became worse; but afterwards the disease growing on, a somewhat sharp heat, with scurfness of the tongue, was wont to be troublesome to some: yea, in all, a flow, and as it were hectick feavour, continued throughout; which neither by sweat, nor by insensible tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration, could be so wholly removed, but that it was daily renued, chiefly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eating, tho never so small: which thing truly seem'd to happen, because the nervous juice being full of the feculencies, brought from the blood, did not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards receive them in so great plenty, but that these recrements, together with the nutritious humour, (and for that this was not consumed by nourishing the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid particles) remaining within the bloody mass, caused it then to grow fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourishly hot.</p>
                  <p>2ly, Besides this morbid disposition of the blood, contracted from the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the year, it seems, that the brain also, from the same occasion, was made prone to the aforesaid passions. For when, for a long tract of time, the southern winds did continually blow, with a moist constitution of the Air; from thence, the passages, and pores of the brain, being very much loos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ed, and opened, and its connexion toomuch dissolved, they gave an easie passage, to serous humours, and for all sorts of heterogeneous particles: wherefore the blood being very fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent, and watery, as soon as it began to grow hot from the feavour, carried its serous recrements and filths, presently thorow the too open doors into the head: for whosoever he was, who did not complain of his head, being too much stuffed with a moist air, and numbness of spirits; on the contrary, his pores being bound together, by an intense cold, or dryer air, all his senses, and faculties, remained more quick and lively.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:106699:30"/>
These things being thus premised, concerning the morbid provision of the brain, and humours, to wit, of the blood, and nervous humour, by reason of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of the year, whereby indeed, very many at that time, sell into a slow, unequal, and long continuing feavour, surrounded with <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>phalick</hi> and <hi>Convulsive</hi> symptoms, and hardly curable: hence also it will be easie, to unfold the reasons, of the rest of the symptoms and accidents, chiefly to be noted in this disease.</p>
                  <p>For first of all, that this irregular Feavour, raged chiefly among Children, young men, women, and phlegmatick men, the reason was, because in those <note place="margin">Why this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease chiefly invaded chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, women, and phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick men.</note> kinde of bodies, the blood was apt to be more waterish, and less perspicable, and from theace to gather a serous <hi>Colluvies,</hi> or watry humour, and heterogeneous feculencies; and also, the brain being more humid and weak, easily received any recrements of the bloud. Wherefore it may be observed, that those sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, were found more prone to Convulsions, arising by reason of any other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the noted <hi>Atrophie</hi> or leanness, came so suddenly upon this feavour, because, by reason of the / depravation of the nervous juice, the officies of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment, <note place="margin">The reason of the Atrophie coming upon this feavour.</note> depending upon it (which, as we have elsewhere shown, are highly active) presently failed. For although we do not grant, the nervous humour to be only nutritious, but to dispense thorow the Arteries, a matter destinated to the nourishable parts, prepared in the bloody mass; yet it may be lawfull to think, that the Liquor watering the brain and nervous stock, by means of an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause, doth conduce very much to alimentation; for this growing turgid with animal spirit, actuates and invigorates the nutritious juice, brought to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part by the blood, and admitting it into the passages, and most intimate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacles of the body to be nourished, and as it were leading it in, assimilates or resembles it, Wherefore, when this houshold Liquor is so depraved, that it doth not rightly supply the animal spirits, requisite about the work of nutrition, all the members and parts of the stomach vitiated in its tone, either spues back whatsoever nourishment is brought, or cannot receive it to its proper use: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore truly in this disease, the bulk or habit of the body, however fuller or fatter, was more sooner pull'd down, then in a continuall Feavour, where it might much more evaporate, by the intense heat, or copious sweats. The reason of which is, because in a burning feavour, altho the blood growing very hot, exhales more plentifully; yet in the mean time, it continually affords something of nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the severall parts, help'd by the benefit of the nervous juice, easily received, and assimilated; but in this nervous pestilence, altho the nutritive mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was sufficiently provided, yet by the defect of the Nourishment of the spirits, the nourishment was altogether inhibited.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the aforesaid reasons also, this feavour, being a long while protracted, <note place="margin">Why this fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was hardly curea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</note> was wont scarce ever to be critically helped, and difficultly cured, by the help of allmost any medicines: For the feavourish matter, creeping presently, from the beginning of the disease, into the nervous Liquor, could hardly afterwards, and not but of a long time, be exterminated from its bosome: for that this water, with a slow motion, and flowing leasurely in the streight vessells, does not as the blood, conceive of its own accord a purifying effervescency, or fermentation; neither can the forces of medicines, reach to it so easily, and unmixed: but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are first hindred by other parts, or because they are heterogeneous, they are wholly excluded from the brain, casting back whatever is incongruous. In truth for this reason, all distempers of the brain and nerves, as it were making a mock at Medicines, are most difficulty cured. Therefore in this feavour, if the evill impressed on the brain and nervous stock was taken away, either a cruell cough with plentifull spitting, ot tumours, or an Impostum in the neck did fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: to wit, the morbifick matter being supped back, by the blood, and again deposited, setled either in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> or in the Glandula's, and emunctories, nigh the hinder part of the neck. But this disease, was the more contumacious, because the discrasie or evill constitution of the blood, was not easily mended: for altho from the beginning, its <hi>Latex,</hi> the recrements being poured forth, even into the nervous Liquor, grew but little and sluggishly hot; yet afterwards, these receptacles being filled, and the morbisic feculencies, and besides the nutritious matter, not imployed in nourishing the parts, being resident even in the blood, did aggravate it, and for the exclusion of this trouble, not to be mixed with it,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106699:30"/>
did induce an Effervescency, such as is wont to be in an hectick feavour, either almost continuall, or presently apt to come again. For I have often observed in this feavour, from grewell, barly-broth, and other slender diet; no less ebuliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the blood to be stirred up, than from broth made of flesh: whether indeed the nourishing juice, supplying the blood from the chyle, because it was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the work of nutrition, carried something heterogeneous, and not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miscible, as a trouble to the blood; and by reason of the particles of this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous juice, being copiously sent away with the <hi>serum,</hi> the urine became very thick, red, and very full of contents: Also, for the same reason, the belly was for the most part loose, forasmuch as the blood, filled full of the nutritious juice, did suck forth a lesser portion of the chile from the bowells, and did pour back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain part of that which had been brought to it, on the intestines; the feavourish distemper did likewise stick so long in the blood, because, till the animal regiment being restored, nutrition was rightly performed, that superfluous matter was carried into the mass of blood.</p>
                  <p>We deliver the example, and the <hi>AEtiology</hi> or rational account of this aforesaid feavour, more largely for this reason, because the same disease, did fall upon our Countrey men, here and there also at other times: for that of late, in this City, all the younger people of a certain family, were sick of it: yea, I remember, that some time past, very many laboured with such a feavour; Out of the many histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and examples of sick people, which it rendred when it was epidemical, I will here propose one or two.</p>
                  <p>A strong and lively young man, about the beginning of the spring, 1661, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling sick, without any evident cause, without any great heat or thirst, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <note place="margin">1. <hi>Observation.</hi>
                     </note> suddenly weak, and as if enervated, with a dejected appetite, and languor of spirits. <hi>Cathartick Remedies, Antipyretics</hi> or allaying of heat, digestives, and also antiscorbuticks, and others of various kindes, administred by the prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the most famous Physitians, availed nothing: But notwithstanding the sick man, hitherto languishing with a slow and wandring feavour, with a quick and feeble pulse, a deep-colour'd urine, had kept his bed a fortnight; besides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reduced to the greatest leanness, he complained of a giddiness, and as it were the fluctuation of a sound in his head, and a tingling noyse in his ears. Altho he was troubled with a great stupor, yet his sleeps were mightily troubled, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with delirious fables. After four days, when the feavour was not yet decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, it was thought good to take away four or five ounces of blood, by Leeches, from the sedal veins; from hence the feavour began to be much exasperated, for a great intense heat, with thirst, watchings, and almost continual tossing of the body, also the tongue d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>y, and scurfy, appeared; then quickly a troublesome cough, with abundance of discoloured spittle followed, to him were administred, <hi>almond,</hi> and <hi>barly-drinks,</hi> with temperate bechicks (or things to stop coughing) boyled in them; water of milk distill'd with <hi>snails,</hi> and pectoral herbs, the shelly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powders, prepared nitre, and often Cordial opiats; which notwithstanding scarce giving any help, the sick man still became more weak: when in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being sick above two months space, the feavourish distemperature, and cough also, dayly growing worse, he seemed near death, at length a voluntary sweating arising, so that every night, or every other night, he sweat abundantly, and from thence finding himself better, using then the aforesaid Remedies, he grew well within six weeks.</p>
                  <p>Till I had seen many sick people after the same manner, I suspected this disease to be alltogether an hectick feavour, with a consumptive disposition of the Lungs; but when I saw many others at that time fall sick ordinarily, after the like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I easily instituted the <hi>AEtiologie</hi> or national account of this feavour, such as I have already described: to wit, that the blood, because of the intemperature of the year, and perhaps from errors in dyet, had contracted a vitious <hi>procatarxis</hi> or <note place="margin">The reason of it.</note> remote cause: Then it growing feavourishly hot, and presently carrying its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities to the brain, and so depraving the juice, watering it, and the nervous stock, induced the vertiginous distempers, with a <hi>stupor,</hi> a languishing of spirits, and an <hi>atrophy</hi> of the whole body: but so long as the blood did transfer its recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, from its own bosom, into the brain and nervous <hi>appendix,</hi> the feavourish heat continued more gentle and milde: But afterwards, when the tending down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the morbific matter, by the opening of the hemorhoid veins, was drawn
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106699:31"/>
away from the brain, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>ame being first retained within the bloody mass, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased the feavour; then being poured on the Lungs, excited the cruel cough, with plentifull spittle: but forasmuch as the flesh of the Lungs remained free ftom putrefaction, as soon as the serous water was sent away by a more plentifull sweating, the sick man became free, both from the feavour, and <hi>phthisis</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, that seemed so deplorable.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, whilst he lay sick, I visited another, about 12. years of age, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </note> after the like manner affected. But this when I was first sent for, having been sick above a month, was reduced to the leanness of a Skelliton: besides, he was troubled with a <hi>vertigo,</hi> with a noise in his ears, and deafness, and also with a violent cough, with yellow, and as it were consumptive spittle: his pulse was quick and feeble, his urine red and thick, his appetite much dejected, his spirits so languid, and his strength so cast down, that he could not keep out of his bed: I gave this youth to drink often in a day, water distill'd from milk, with snails and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate herbs: besides I ordered him an open decoction, such as is in use for the Rickets, to be daily taken instead of his ordinary drink: by the help of which Remedies, he was restored to his health, in a months space.

                  <p>For that reason, this feavour became very deadly, in the family of a certain <note place="margin">3 <hi>Observation.</hi>
                     </note> Noble man, among his children, originally obnoxious to Cephalic distempers. About the vernal AEquinox, a Boy of about eleven years of Age, began to be sick: At first without any vehement heat, or thirst, a dejection of appetite, and want of strength came upon him: Besides, an almost continual giddiness did trouble him, with a frequent danger of fainting, that he often thought he was just dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. By the advice of a certain woman attending him, they dayly gave him Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters: then, when from the foulness of the mouth, and Tongue, manifest signes of a Feavour appeared, this Emperick on the fifth day, gave him a vomit of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of <hi>Crocus metallorum,</hi> and on the seaventh day a Cordial powder being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred, she incited the sick youth covered with blankets to sweat: his skin hardly began to be moist: but presently he began to talk idly, complained that his Cap was fallen into the water, by and by becoming speechless, within four hours, whilst I was sent for, he expir'd before I came.</p>
                  <p>A little while after, the same disease fell upon his yonger Sister: whose sickness however, because it was accompanied with a frequent and humid Cough, was <note place="margin">4. <hi>Observation.</hi>

Certainly this shew'd, that the feavourish matter, or the serous impurities of the boyling blood, being soon impacted in the Lungs, did so stuff up their pores and passages, that the blood it self, being in its wonted and free Circulation, there stagnating, and being extravasated, did excite a certain Inflammation.</p>
                  <p>We found a no less clear track, of this so deadly disease in the head: for the shell of the skull being removed, presently the vessells, creeping thorow the <hi>meningae,</hi> were seen to swell very much with blood, as if almost the whole mass of blood, were gathered together in the head: for the veins being cut or broken, about the Inwards of the lower and middle belly, little blood flowed forth: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, those membranes where they cloath the <hi>Cerebel,</hi> and being higher spread divide it from the brain, being sprinkled in very many places with extravasated blood, were noted to be of a black-purple colour; that it was not to be doubted, but the <hi>Phlegosis</hi> or Inflamation round about excited, was the cause of the so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly infesting Convulsions.

heaped together, in its mass to a fullness; that from thence a flowring or putting forth arising, at the set intervalls of times, it might thrust the same subtilities out of doors: yea rather this growing hot glows not with a great, and open bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: but like a fire covered over with chips, sends forth a moist smoke or breath, rather then a flame: But so, that from thence, by reason of the nervous juice being depraved soon in its disposition, and not rarely, because of the lungs being stuffed with the consumptive matter, the convulsive, or phthifical or consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive symptoms, did molest chiefly, in the whole course of the disease.</p>

About the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this feavour, the taking away of blood, seem'd convenient allmost to all: This kinde of remedy, I often experienced with success, in little Children: For that by the means, as it were another breathing place is opened, to the mass of blood, silently and covertly growing hot, and obtruding its soot or smoak, on the more noble parts; and for that reason, its impure efflorescencies or puttings forth, are drawn away from the brain, and lungs. Therefore, although this fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of an ill Condition, may be accounted as it were malignant, yet forasinuch as the blood is not presently apt to be coagulated, but to be too much poured forth, and to bestow its serosities on the nobler parts, to wit, the brain and lungs, therefore <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> so it be administred in the beginning of the disease, is convenient allmost to all.</p>
                  <p>For the same reason, <hi>Cathartick</hi> Medicines, and chiefly vomitory, are admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred at the very beginning of the disease; for these do not only evacuate the <hi>visce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> of concoction, and so draw away the chief fomenting of the disease, and as it were its originall, but besides, they draw forth the serosities from the blood, and so effect its cleansing, rather in the stomach and Intestines, then in the head and lungs. Further by Emeticks, for that the receiving <hi>Glandulaes</hi> of the <hi>Lymphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts,</hi> are pulled with a great shaking, the superfluities of the nervous juice, least they should evilly affect the brain, and its dependencies, are expressed forth into the lower bowells: also for this end, the belly is to be kept continually loose, by the use of Clysters. But in the mean time, whilst the blood being infected with the taint of this disease, threatens the brain or <hi>praecordia,</hi> with the evill, it will not be safe to attempt any thing with <hi>Diaphoreticks,</hi> or sweating medicines, or <hi>Diureticks</hi> or such as evacuate by urine, or also with <hi>Catharticks,</hi> vomiting and purging medicines: For these kinde of medicines, forasmuch as they greatly pour out the blood, and compell its serosities into more open issuings forth, all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, being apt to fall away from the mass of the blood, are easily obtruded on the brain, or Lungs, when they are of a more feeble constitution: So in the youth above-mentioned, a loss of speech, came upon the raising of an untimely sweat: Also I have known, that <hi>Sudorificks,</hi> no other then chaly beats, in the morbid disposition of the lungs, have brought on a waisting or Consumption.</p>

                     <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> therefore, and if need be vomiting, or purging, either one or other, or both, being to be made use of at the very beginning of the disease, the other <note place="margin">Vomits and Purge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

To this end, <hi>Vesicatories</hi> or blistering plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, ought to be applyed, to the nape of the neck, or <hi>Parotida</hi> or <hi>jugular Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi>

                  <p>If that notwithstanding, any preventive physick, the morbific matter, should lodge in the brain, or Lungs, or both together, so that a dissolution, or inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the animal function, or also a violent cough, should assalt them, it must be consider'd, what is to be done in either state of the disease, carried forth after this manner, into an evill condition; but then the curative Indications ought to respect the stupor, or madness, or cough: and lastly, if in the declina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the disease, these symptoms do remit, proper Remedies are to be adhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, against the <hi>Atrophie,</hi> as it were the last fortress of this Feavour.</p>
                  <p>1st.

                  <p>2dly, But if either with, or without this sort of displeasure, brought to the <note place="margin">In the Cough.</note> head, the Lungs also have taken the evill of this disease, so that the sick, not yet free from the feavour, seem to fall into a waisting, or Consumption, with a troublesome cough, with abundance of thick, and often discoloured spittle; Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines commonly prescribed for such kinde of Distempers, are convenient e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; wherefore, pectoral Decoctions, Electuaries, syrrops, distill'd waters of milk and snails, and other remedies of the like nature, ought diligently to be made use of; the forms of which may be found, in the before-described Cases.</p>
                  <p>Thus far we have described the continual feavour, for the most part convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive, and arising no less from the fault of the nervous juice, then of the blood: I will here further propose an example of a disease, having the likeness of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting feavour, but radicated chiefly in the nervous juice; the nature of which kinde of distemper, for that it is very rare, and truly pertinent to our convulsive <hi>Pathologie,</hi> will appear from the following history.</p>
                  <p>A noted Woman very young, and indued with a more weak constitution of brain, and nervous stock, and for that cause very obnoxious to convulsive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers, <note place="margin">A very rare Observation.</note> after she had conceived with child, about the fourth month of her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing big, from cold being taken, she was grievously afflicted with Astmatical fits, and besides, with a frequent sinking down of her spirits: but by the use of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, indued with a volatile salt, she grew well, within a fortnights space, but after that, about 14. days, an unwonted and truly admirable distemper, fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Gentlewoman.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:106699:33"/>
One morning, awaking after an unquiet sleep that night, she felta light shive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in all her body, as if she had had the sit of an Ague: frequent yaunings, and reatchings, with an endeavour to vomit followed thereupon: then her urine, which was but now of a citron colour, and of a laudable substance, became pale, and waterish, and was rendred at every turn, to wit, almost every minute of an hour: moreover, about her loins, and <hi>hypochondria,</hi> and in other places, pains with light Convulsions, running about here and there, were excited: which kinde of symptoms plainly convulsive, with her frequent making of a lympid urine, continued in the Morning allmost to Evening, in which space of time, a great quantity of water, at least three times more then the liquor she had taken, was rendred; in the mean time, neither was the heat great, nor did thirst trouble her, nor was her pulse encreased: In the evening the aforesaid distempers ceased, and her urine became citron colour, and moderate; and besides, all night she enjoy'd a moderate sleep, then the morning following, about the same hour, the fit retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, accompanied altogether with the like symtoms, and so dayly acted the same Tragedy.</p>
                  <p>Visiting this Gentlewoman, after she had been sick in this manner for 12. days, I framed the AEtiologie of the aforesaid case, to wit, that this disease, chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>fly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical <note place="margin">The reason of it.</note> in the nervous stock, did depend upon the effervescency, and flux of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, watering the nervous parts: For it might be suspected, that this water being disfused from the blood, made degenerate by reason of the suppression of her Terms, upon the brain, and nervous stock, became more sharp, and serous than it ought to be, and for that cause incongruous to the containing parts: wherefore, being gathered together to a plenitude, by the nights sleep, it did stir them up, or provoke them, for the expulsion of it, every where into wrinklings, and contractions: hence shiverings, yaunings, streachings, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring pains, were excited in the whole body: Furthermore, from the sollid parts, after this manner contracted, and shaken, not only the nervous Liquor, but also the nutricious, every where laid up in the sollid parts, but not truly assimilated, were shaken off: and then, either <hi>Latex,</hi> being exterminated from its recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and received by the veins, or Lymphaducts, or water-carrying vessells, was render'd to the Mass of blood: from whose bosome, before it had acquired a lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viall tincture from it, being at last cast forth by the reins, constituted a clear, and Copious urine: But that this distemper observed such exact periods, the reason is, because the nervous water, being supplyed with an equall dimension, did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise to a fulness of running over, dayly at the set time: Therefore also, the urine appeared concocted, and yellow, before and after the fit, because then its mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter consisted only from the <hi>serum</hi> of the blood: Afterwards, during the convulsive fit, the limpid humour being shaken off, from the solid and nervous parts, and passing quickly thorow the blood, adulterated the colour and the quantity of the urine. I prescribed to this big-bellied woman, Phlebotomie, and besides, a powder composed out of <hi>Corall, pearls, ivory,</hi> and other <hi>Cardiacks,</hi> to be taken thrice in a day, in a proper Liquor; morning and evening she took of the <hi>tincture of Antimony,</hi> 12. drops (whose singular effect in the too great flux of urine, I have many times experienced): By the use of these, all the symptoms ceased, in a short time.</p>

Or Secondly, the Convulsive Distempers, which are excited in the whole nervous kinde together, are continued or connex, which succeed one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with a certain perpetual vicissitude continued between themselves: Foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as inordinate motions, almost of all the members, mutually relieving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, being risen in one part, presently passe over to others. For so <hi>Horstius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of a maid, obnoxious to Convulsive motions, whose members and Limbs not only were forced into divers manner of flections and distortions, but besides, as if agitated by an evill Spirit, not being able to stand in a place, she was necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to run up and down here and there, and to dance, and Ieap in the Hot-house; nor could be hindred from it by any force or chiding, but that she would run here and there; now she would cast her selfon her feet, now impetuously fling her self after another manner, for if she did endeavour never so little to be quiet, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly her <hi>Praecordia</hi> was most grievously asflicted. Wherefore, the Business of our present task is, to enquire a little more exactly, into the nature and Causes of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Convulsive Affection, to wit, both of that, which is affected through the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much leaping of the tendons and muscles together, and of this, which is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed through the madness and inquietudes of the members or of the whole body: that from thence it may appear, what method of healing ought to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred in either Case.</p>
               <p>As to the former kinde, it easily appears, that these kinde of distempers, are <note place="margin">The nature of the broken Convulsive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper.</note> not simple, but complicated, to wit, of a Convulsion, and Palsie. For the mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and tendons, are perpetually urged with Convulsive motions, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the sick being made weak, they are not able strongly to move any of their members, or their whole body: yea, to these Distempers, pains equally diffused thorow all the Limbs, are adjoyned. Hence we may infer, that the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are imbued, with a manifold <hi>Copula, viz.</hi> both with explosive, and also nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cotick ot stupifying, and in some sort irritative or provoking particles: so that, although being alway burthened, they enter into explosions, yet, not many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, nor indeed any hastily or strongly are exploded, by reason of the other interjected Particles of another kinde; wherefore the motive force does not long continue, but is short, and as it were interrupted: just as if gunpowder being kneeded with some muddy substance, should be fired: for then the whole mass is not let off at once, with a noise, nor does one heap presently fire another, but a few grains only, and those successively, to wit, one a little while after another, with small crackling noises, are let off or exploded: In like manner, the nervous Liquor is stuffed thorowout, with Convulsive particles, which even cleave to the Spirits: but forasmuch, as some narcotick, and other painfull ones, are mingled with them, the elastick force of the former, however lasting, and greatly diffused, is yet much broken and every where cut off.</p>
               <p>For the illustrating this kinde of broken convulsive Distemper, I will here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe <note place="margin">An observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> a very notable case of a certain Gentleman lately living in this neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: which being truly admirable, not any writings or observations of Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, have scarce shewed the like. An honourable Gentleman whom I knew, sprung from Parents, and grandfathers obnoxious to a someways morbid disposition ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Brain, or nerves, about the hight or beyond the strength of his Age, the fruit of this diseased Race began to punish him: for first of all, he was wont to be tormented with a debility, and numbness of his Limbs, and with light Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions; with which kinde of Distempers, when he had a while laboured at length,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:106699:34"/>
for cure sake going to the Bath, having used too much the hot bathes, instead of a remedy, he brought back only an exasperation of the Disease, that from that time, the aforesaid Symptoms did not any more tormeut him by fits, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most continually, to wit, the Convulsive motions, and painfull extensions, did incessantly exercise every Limb, yea, every part of his Body, so that all the muscles were perpetually drawn together, with repeated leapings all at once, and that not without great torment: The only means he had for quieting them, was to exercise his whole body, sometimes some of his members, perpetually with a local motion: for so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ong as he was awake, he was necessitated to be rock'd in his bed, or on his couch, or to be carried in a Coach, or to have his members press't or rubb'd; for which end they had made for him a Bed, and a Chair set upon bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fashon'd feet, such as are on Childrens Cradles, in which, when he lay down or sat upright, he was moved up and down continually, with a tottering or rock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing motion; which unless he did, he was infested with most cruel pain, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid extensions of his muscles: This kinde of dayly trouble, of the Convulsive Distemper, in the night-time, and presently after sleep, entertain'd much more grievous Symptoms: for being newly awaked, his whole body presently was wont to quake, his muscles to be exercised with painfull stretchings, every Limb to be wetted with a squalid or ill-favour'd sweat, as if in the agony os Death, which was so very Corrosive, that, like <hi>aqua fortis,</hi> unless they presently wiped it off, it quickly eat and rotted the Linnen. The sick man, during this Conflict, was tormented for many hours, between the sweats and shiverings, untill being quite tired out, sleep creeping upon him, brought him some ease; but if at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the fit, he was presently taken out of his Bed, he was better, and so prevented the wonted cruelty of the Distemper: Therefore, as soon as he was awaked from sleep, though it hapned within half an hour, immediatly to avoyd the torture, his servants being called, they took him out of his Bed: As to his Appetite he was well enough, he eat without loathing, nor was his stomack dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb'd with what he eat: Bur he did often complain of the pain of the heart, and sometimes a troublesome Spitting, with a stink in his mouth, as if he had taken <hi>Mercury,</hi> molested him for many days. All hot things, whether food or Physick, did nor agree with his constitution; he did not dare to taste, either wine, or strong beer: In the first years of his sickness, he abhor'd the very sight of the fire, afterwards becoming weaker; though the winter was sharp he would not sit neer the Chimny; his Urine was always of a Citron colour, which ifit were evaporated in an earthen vessell, over hot coals, saltish faeculencies remained in the bottom, to above half the Liquor; his belly was continually bound, and never put forth its load, unless provoked by a purge or Clyster: Yea, besides the Convulsive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a Spurious Palsie possessed every member of his whole Body, for he could not lift up his hand, nor step a foot forward; his tongue shaking, brought forth his words but imperfect, but sometimes, when his minde was carried forth, by some sudden occasion of Joy, he would be able, his Spirits being raised with a wonderfull strength, suddenly to rise out of his chair, and without the help of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to stand upright, and to jump, which interval however lasted scarce a minute of an hour, but that his members flagg'd, and were affected with their wonted languor and trembling. When this worthy Gentleman, had been sick af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner above 12. years, and had consulted the most famous Physitians in all <hi>England,</hi> and had tryed very many Remedies, and almost of every kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> Antiparalytick, antiscorbutick, drying Diets, Sweating medicines, purges, Causticks, baths, Liniments, yea, and had twice tryed salivation, could finde no cure by any method of healing; wherefore, all hope of cure being wholly layd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side, for the latter seven years of his life, he made use of only Remedies, chiesly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specting some Symptoms, <hi>viz.</hi> he took thrice in a week a solutive medicine, of <hi>Senna</hi> and <hi>Rubarb</hi> with Correctives, now in form of a Syrrop, or of an extract a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time; every night he was wont to take a dose of an opiate, out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves, and temperate <hi>Species:</hi> Besides, as occasions serv'd, he had ready a Julap, to be taken when his Spirits sainted: moreover, he continually drunk Beer, made of oaten mault, altered with temperate and diuretical herbs. By the use of these, he pass'd over at least seven years, without any great alteration for the worse; at length, old Age coming on him, together with the disease, more cruel fits of Convulsions, not as at first after sleep, but assoon as he was warm in his bed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:106699:34"/>
him, that he was forced to abstain altogether from his Bed, and rarely put off his cloaths, unless to shift his Linnen: from hence transpiration being hindred, the serous Recrements, and others, wont to be evaporated, were fixed on the Lungs, which at first, brought in a frequenr or short breathing, afterwards an Asthmatical Distemper, and lastly a deadly Consumption or wasting.</p>
               <p>If the Reasons of the aforesaid Symptoms be sought after, it will be easie, to <note place="margin">The reasons of the symptoms chiefly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting.</note> deduce all these evills from a depraved Constitution of the Brain, and nervous stock, and more immediatly from the dyscrasie, and fault, of the juice watering those parts. For when that Liquor, in which the animal <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>pirits, do abound, was, as to its temper, highly sharp and Corrosive, like <hi>Stygian</hi> water, and as to its mixion, was stuffed full of both narcotick and explosive particles, it is no wonder, because the Spirits being very much burthened, and for that cause restrained from their due expansion, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>hould be forced every where into small explosions, as it were Cracklings; and that the containing bodies, being loosed from their due extension and strength, should be also continually irritated into painfull Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rugations or shrinkings up.</p>
               <p>Those Convulsive Distempers, did more sharply infest after sleep, because the <note place="margin">The growing worse p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>esent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after sleep whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.</note> heat of the Bed, did exuscitate or stir up the heterogeneous particles of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous juce, and rarifying them, as it were compell'd them into explosions; then also, because the nervous parts did imbibe its juce in sleep, and a more plentifull provision of the morbifick matter, brought together withit; which being silled to a plentitude, at the first instant of waking, they immediatly endeavour to shake off what is troublesome. For this Reason, it is observed, that the pains of Scorbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical people, and the fits of Asthmatical, are made worse by the h at of the bed, and by sleep; therefore as in these, presently to leave the bed, was wont to give ease, so likewise it did in our sick man: But that the trouble, excited by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual <note place="margin">Why allayed by Motion.</note> leapings, and painfull extentions of the muscles, was somewhat allayed by the local motion, or moving from one place to another, of the body, or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the reason is, because the Animal Spirits, whilst they are compelled to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers actions from without; they remit whatsoever inordinations are excited from within: for as in pain, and itching, which are lighter Convulsions, it helps to press, rub, or scratch the affected part, so the Convulsive motions of the muscles, and tendons, are somewhat pleased, by the inordinate agitation of the whole body, or the members.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Ptyalismus,</hi> or copious spitting, with the stinking breath, which <note place="margin">The spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>As to the lucid Intervalls, whereby the sick man us'd to obtain some truces, <note place="margin">Why this sick man obtained some truce from pains.</note> though short, the cruelties as it were of the disease being mitigated, as when but now his sickness had bound him to his chair, he was able on a sudden to leap up, and walk about; but yet, this unlook'd-for strength being vanish'd, by and by falling again into his wonted languishment: I say these kinde of motions of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nature, prostrate under a great burthen, are its utmost endeavours, and some more strong inforcements, to wit, whereby for a moment of time she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects her self, and attempts as it were to shake off the yoak of the Disease; but because she is not able to sustain long this strife, she quickly relapses, and lies down under her former burthen. Truly it is a wonder, how much above the strength of Nature, Anger, and fear, and some other passions of the minde, do stretch the nervous kinde, and compell them to shew a force plainly stupendious: But these prodigies of her attempts, are only of a small duration. <note place="margin">The secret lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cause of the aforesaid distemper.</note>

yet for us to inquire into the secret leading cause, to wit, by what occasions, the nervous juice being become so degenerate, at first brings in the Palsie, and then leapings, or intestine Convulsions of all the muscles: further, we ought to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain wherefore the fruits of this Disease, increasing by little and little, came suddenly to maturity, by the use of the Baths; also wherefore this sickness yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to no Remedies became uncurable.</p>
               <p>As to the first, it may be said, that the sick person, being sprung from parents who were obnoxious greatly to Cephallic Diseases, had contracted originally an evill Constitution of the brain, and nervous stock, so that within the 6th lustre <hi>(i. e.</hi> about the 36th year) of his Age, he began to be sick of a spurious Palsie, then, when the evident causes daily fixing the infection more on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> bloud and humours, did happen upon this remote hereditary cause (for there were many chances, and unfortunate accidents, which continually brought sadness, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly upon this Gentleman) indeed therefore, the nervous Liquor being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued above measure, with a fixed and Scorbutic salt, became highly sharp and irritative, like <hi>aquafortis,</hi> or the Stagma's of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> and so continually incited the Spirits, and the bodys containing them, into Corrugations and contractions, just as the aforesaid Liquors when poured upon worms do the same thing.</p>
               <p>But that this disease, leasurly at first increasing, was quickly brought into a much <note place="margin">Why this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the mean time, the <hi>Ventricle, Intestines, Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Mesemery,</hi> were well enough, to wit, the membranes were firm, well coulour'd, and free from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ulcer, or hard swelling: There grew to the greater Intestines certain excref<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies like to the ears of a mouse; for that there were very many of these kinde of things out of either side of the <hi>Colon,</hi> and right intestine, they shewed like twins at certain distances, like the branches of Trees: The like I formerly found in a Consumptive person: The Reason of this seems to be, that the nourishment in Consumptive people, (though it be deficient about the more solid, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts, yet sometimes) within neer the fountains of the nourishing juice, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms more than it ought, and for that cause, superfluous and unnaturall additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons grow forth.</p>
               <p>The milt or Spleen, which always is thought ill of, and of most Physitians condemned, for being the Principal cause of the Scurvy, and of all other distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, appear altogether blameless, and free from any fault: For, as in most
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106699:35"/>
people, we observed, it was of a darkish Colour, soft and of an equal <hi>superficies,</hi> free from any obstruction, or swelling, indued withvessells, and <hi>fibrcs,</hi> distinct, and firm enough: out of its substance, flowed black blood when it was cut.</p>
               <p>The Liver (which indeed might be wondred at) was indifferently well, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was it, from so long and grievous a sickness, become harder then usuall, or scirrhous, or planted with littIe whelks, but it was somewhat big, and of a darkish colour.</p>
               <p>The Kidnys, though free from any ulcer, or gravell, were not however free from fault: for in the middle of the right Kidney, was seen a great cavity, dist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inct from the Tunell, and much greater then it, full of clear water: the like I have very often found, in hydropical people: But indeed, this perhaps arose, from the <hi>serum</hi> deposited in that kidny, that could not easily be strained thorow its passages, and pores; for that the <hi>serum</hi> subsisting therein, had in the beginning made for it self a little den, which afterwards by degres was inlarged, and when for this Reason, the secretion of the <hi>serum,</hi> and its passing forth by the <hi>ureter,</hi> were something hindred, its <hi>Latex</hi> restagnating into the blood, brought in the grievous trouble to the head; which indeed was the rather to be suspected, because alfo the left Kidny, being mightily extenuated, and consumed, contained many Cisterns, and Cavities full of clear water.</p>
               <p>The Lungs, growing on every side to the <hi>Sternum,</hi> (or part of the breast where the ribs meet) sides, and <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> seem'd without any distinction of <hi>Lobes,</hi> of one substance only of putrid spongy flesh, stuffed throughout with a frothy or ichorous matter: without doubt, the sick man had not contracted this evill so long before, to wit, when he was not able to perform any exercise of the Body, nor stay in bed that it might breathe out any thing more freely, the faecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies and recrements of the blood, which were wont to evaporate thorow the skin, being layd up in the Lungs, were the cause, that they grew together among themselves, and with other parts, and did vitiate their tone and conformation wholly, so that, a Consumption being at last arisen, was the effect and product, and not the cause of the rest of the distempers, wherewith he had bin a long while miserably afflicted.</p>
               <p>In either ventricle of the heart, blood was concreted into a solid whitish sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and bak'd like flesh, which being formed neer the Cavities, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of the vessells of the Heart, resembled the figure of a Serpent, with a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold divided tail: than which indeed nothing is more usual, in many dead Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after long sickness: The reason of which is, that the Blood being without life, from long sickness, and from thence circulated slowly abont the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> begins to stand or stagnate in the heart, and depending vessells, and by that means, is congealed leasurely, into this kinde of fleshy Concrete.</p>
               <p>When the Skull was opened, we sought among its contents, the chief Cause of the Disease: The first thing that occurr'd was, the bulk of the brain was less than it should be, and folded into fewer folds, from whence we suspected, that the Animal Spirits, were not plentifully enough brought forth: Further, the whole substance of the head, was more moist than it ought to be, and wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mersed in a wet watery humour, that its Covering, <hi>viz.</hi> the whole meninges, were pulled asunder, and the compassing or crevices, and all the ventricles, run over with clear water. 'Tis probable, that this deluge of the Brain, had lately hapned, to wit, forasmuch, as by reason perspiration being hindred, and the Secretion of urine being but little, the serosities gathered together in the bloody mass, were carried to the head, and therefore, the substance of the Brain, and especially the chancelled or chequer'd bodies, were so wholly wetted, and soked, that being cut, their substance could scarce remain compacted, but that it would flow away, somewhat after the manner of thick Liquids: within the bosoms o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlying, and inserted to the brain, and its <hi>Appendix,</hi> and the vessells coming from them, the blood had concreted into little, round, hard, and as it were fleshy balls, just like those within the ventricles of the heart, and the vessells hanging to them, which also lately, when the Bloud circulated slowly, we thought might happen, for the same reason, for which the blood was coagulated within the <hi>Praecordia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The trunk of the Spinal marrow, being drowned in clear water, was very much extenuated, that it could scarce fill half of the bony cavity or hollowness:

In these Cases, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Spirits, not only those implanted in private corners, and mines, get to themselves an explosive <hi>Copula,</hi> and being some how satisfied, or irritated, strike it off by certain turns; but when the whole mass of the nervous Liquor, abundantly abounds with elastick particles, they then every where cleaving to both the Spirits implanted, and flowing in, for that reason stir them up into Continuall Convulsions: But forasmuch, as not all the Spirits at once, are not able, however predisposed, to be exploded, (because within the nervous pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, there is not room large enough for their so great agitations) therefore the explosive force, arising in these, or those parts, is by and by transfer'd, from thence, unto others, and so to others, and so like fire-draks, or wild-fire, it runs wandringly here and there, most swiftly creeping from these Limbs, to those, and then presently from all into the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> or <hi>Viscera,</hi> and back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

                     </gap> Observation.</note> obnoxious to most grievous Distempers of the nervous kinde, about the 20th year of her Age, was afflicted for many days with an head-ach, very Cruell and periodical; at length, at the time of the winter folstice, 1656. the pain of her head ceased, but instead of it, a mighty Catarrh followed, with a thin and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious spitting, also an ulcerous distemper of the nose and throat; when she had for some time endured this trouble, at length, by the prescript of a certain Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, receiving the fume of <hi>Amber</hi> by a tunnell into her mouth, she was sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cured, to wit, the Catarrh, or violent Rhume ceas'd suddenly, but from thence she complained of a notable <hi>Vertigo,</hi> with a pain in the head, and of the tingling noise of the ears: on the Third day, the tendons of the hinder part of her neck, were pulled together, that her head was bended now forward, now back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and now of one side, sometime it continued stiff and unmoveable; a little after this, the same kinde of Convulsive Distemper invaded the outward mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and Limbs of the whole body, her arms and hands were wonderfully turned about, that no jugler or tumbler could imitate their bendings, and rollings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout; she was necessitated to spread abroad her leggs, and feet, here and there, to strike them against one another, and to transpose or cross them by turns: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner either sitting in a Chair or lying in a Bed she was perpetually af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted with these Convulsive motions, unless when overwhelmed with sleep; and when she did a little restrain her members from the great labour of the Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, presently she was taken with a difficult and short-breathing with a sense of Choaking; but in the mean time, her eyes, jaws, mouth, and lower bowells, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained free from any Convulsion; neither was she troubled with vomiting, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, nor any inflation of the belly, and <hi>hypochondria:</hi> Besides she was still her self, and had truly the use of her memory, understanding, and phantasie, she did, nor said any thing madly, or foolishly: but in these wonderfull evills, she shew'd an admirable example of Christian fortitude, and patienee, even with godly and discreet speeches; her appetite was soon lost, so that she took any meat or aliment very unwillingly; thirst continually troubled her, and her strength was grown so feeble, that she could not stand or walk, her urine was of a Citron colour, very full of saltness, on whose <hi>superficies</hi> grew little tararous skins.</p>
               <p>When I was sent for to this Gentlewoman, on the Sixth day of her sickness, I framed the AEtiology of this kinde of admirable distemper: For the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her father, who at that time was sick in the same house, with most grievous Convulsive passions, kept me, that I did not with many others, refer all things to the delusions of witches: wherefore, that I might seek out the natural Causes of these Symptoms, it was in the first place plainly to be suspected, that this
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106699:36"/>
Gentlewoman had contracted hereditarily the seeds of Convulsive Distempers, which at length, about the flower of her age, broke forth into this kinde of fruit: for when her blood was very much imbued with heterogeneous and explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive particles, they at length (as is wont in such a disposition) began to be poured into the head, and there to be fixed: being therefore first deposited in the <hi>Meningae,</hi> they induced the huge periodicall head-ach; then afterwards, the same matter having accidentally shifted its place, falling down into the sinks of the throat and mouth, changed the <hi>Cephalage</hi> or head-ach, into a <hi>Catarrh</hi> or <hi>Rbume:</hi> and when lastly by an untimely use of the administred Remedy, the defluxion stop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>As to the formal Reason, or the means of generation, whereby the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive matter, falling down into the nervous stock, did produce these admirable <note place="margin">The reason of the aforesaid case.</note> Symptomes, we may lawfully suppose, that the same being thrust forth from the Confines of the head, being yet more firm, into the spinal marrow, and its <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix;</hi> and being like a malignant firment, it first infected, with heterogeneous and highly explosive particles, these parts of the juce watering the whole mass; which cleaving to the spirits, every where disposed thorow their whole <hi>series,</hi> and agitating them, as it were with a certain fury, did stir them up into continuall explosions: When in truth, the nervous juice, as is said, was so fermented by the inflowing of the Convulsive matter, that which did other ways water the contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts, with a gentle falling on them, and through the same; did pass over the animal spirits, with an equal Expansion; now the same did torment the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>fibres,</hi> with various contractions, and Corrugations or shrinkings up, and did hinder both the spirits flowing in, being too much burthened with an hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> from their d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But, altho the heterogeneous particles, being poured forth with the blood, into the brain, and thence thrust forth into the nervous stock, did not enter rightly the beginnings of all the nerves, but chiefly and almost only the spinal marrow, and its nervous shoots; so that the internal <hi>Viscera,</hi> also the parts of the eyes, mouth, and face, remained free from any Convulsion: yet, that same explosive force, being hindred by some violence, whereby it entred less in the outward members, presently like wild-fire, a way being found, it was wont to run into the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and bowells of the lower belly: <hi>viz.</hi> because the inflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spirits, being struck with a certain fury, and requiring a larger space, in which they might exercise their madness, being excluded from one place, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently enter another somewhere open: wherefore, if that fury had been repulsed, both from the members, and the <hi>viscera,</hi> no doubt but it would have flown back on the brain, and brought thither, madness, or as it were an Epileptical Insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness: which Symptoms indeed hapned to be wanting, for that the brain of this most ingenious Gentlewoman, being indued with a more firm Constitution, did take from the nervous Liquor freshly instilled, whatsoever was congruous and spiritous, for its properfood, and enjoy'd it: In the mean time, it did depress all the morbific particles, into the spinal marrow, by which the involuntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the members were excited, after that manner as we said but now.</p>
               <p>Being requested to undertake the Cure of this worthy Virgin, first, a light preparation of her body being made, I gave her a solutive potion of the Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">The Curatory Method Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in this case.</note> of <hi>Senna</hi> and <hi>Rhubarb,</hi> with <hi>yellow Sanders</hi> and <hi>salt of Wormwood</hi> added to it, by which she was purged 12 times with great ease, the next day I took viii. ounces of blood from her left Arm, every evening I gave her an opiate of the water, and Syrrop of the <hi>flowers of Lungwort,</hi> with the <hi>powder of pearls:</hi> besides, once within vi. hours, I prescrib'd her to take a dose of the <hi>spirits of Harts-horn,</hi> in a draught of the following Julap.

were made use of frequently: besides antispasmodic oyntments, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the hinder part of her neck, and the back-bone, we order'd often rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of the distemper'd members, with warm woollen Cloaths wetted in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per oyl.</p>
               <p>By the use of these, the sick person within 6 days, seem'd to be very much hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; for the Convulsive motions allmost wholly ceased, and she could contain her members quietly in their due position, only her head sometimes by a lighter Contractiou was compelled to bend gently this way and that way; further she was able to stand a little, and rise out of her chair, but when she went to step for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, she went not rightly, but obliquely on one side: At this time going away, I left her much better, and in a manifest state of growing well: But after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther week, when the North-winde being high, and arisen in Night time, the window not being fast shut, blew very much upon the sick person being in Bed, she presently taking cold, relapsed into that kinde of Condition, that she became obnoxious not only to Convulsive passions, but to an universal periodical palsie: for after that she was forced to move about, turn, and winde variously, all her limbs successively, with her head, and members by turns, bent, and thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout here and there (as before) from morning to night; till at night these kinde of motions wholly ceasing, a resolution of her members, or palsie succeeded, so that she was not able to stir either hand or foot, or any other part of her body besides, or to exereise any motive bending of the body, lying in her bed allmost immovable like a stone; but being a little refresh'd with sleep, about morning, as she recovered some little strength or virtue of the regular motive faculty, by bending, tho but weakly here and there, her arms, and legs, so also the involun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, and Convulsive motions, did constantly return, enduring from that time, all the day, which again at the Evening, were changed into these resolutions of the Limbs.</p>
               <p>By these it appears clearly, that the sick Gentlewoman laboured with a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold disease, <hi>viz.</hi> a Palsie, and Convulsion, and that the materiall Cause of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was somewhat distinct: For it seems, that the animal spirits, every where abounding, being burdened with narcotick particles, were almost continually bound: besides that, in the time of sleeping, together with the nervous juiee, the Convulsive particles, plentifully flowing in, clove also to the spirits: for the explosions of which, the spirits being incited, produced the involuntary moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but also at that time, the narcotic <hi>Copula</hi> being somewhat shaken off, they were then able in some sort to perform the voluntary or regular also: Besides the Remedies but now recited, they did carefully administer very many others, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most of every kinde, <hi>viz.</hi> Antiscorbuticks, antiparaleticks, Decoctions, sudo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificks, or sweating medicines, distilled waters, spirits, Elixirs, Tincture, Baths, Liniments, with many others; by the use of which, the Symptoms were something remitted, but yet the disease was not wholly cured, the universal pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie soon ceased, that she was able at any time to move her Limbs, and to bend them here and there; and also the involuntary motions did trouble her but rarely, yet she continued Languishing, and weak; and when she being of a more fine temper, and prone to a Consumption, by reason transpiration was hindred, the recrements of the bloods being laid up in the Lungs, brought in a Cough, which every day growing worse, she at length dyed of a <hi>Phthisis</hi> or wasting.</p>
               <p>Some years since, I was sent for to a Noble Virgin, sick almost after the same manner, and something worse: For this suffer'd almost perpetually, coming by turns, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Observation.</hi>
                  </note> involuntary motions, to wit, shakings of the head, and members, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, or movings about here and there: besides, she was afflicted with an exceeding troublesome, and plainly wonderfull Convulsion, of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and muscles serving for breathing: for every minute of an hour and oftener, her back-bone was suddenly bent in, about its middle, and together her breast shooting out forward, and her <hi>hypochondria</hi> being drawn inwards, she made a noysie sobbing, now double, now threefold, but still with a less and less noise: this kinde of motion, and ebbing of a crashing noise, was wont to come for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hours, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rval of this hapned, she was compelled presently to shake, or writhe together extreamly her arms, and hands, and sometimes her legs and feet, and also to fling about most furiously her head, and by and by to hold her
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106699:37"/>
neck, as it were stiff and immovable: and then in speaking, her tongue would be taken after that manner, that she would repeat the same word very often, yea sometimes twenty times at least: when the Convulsive motions tormented her strongly in her outward members, she was free for a little while from that throt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and noisie distemper, and this space of intermission she call'd her time of ease; tho in the mean time, her head, and members were carried violently here and there, with Convulsive Motions: if at any time she lay on her left side, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently a contraction of her right <hi>hypochondrium</hi> inwards, with a sobbing or throt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, vex'd her. Within a few days, her strength being very much lost, by the assiduity of the passions, she contracted so great an imbecillity in her Loyns, and joynts of her legs, that she could not stand, nor lean on her feet: Her Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, distemperd either with weakness, or the Convulsion, return'd back what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was put into it, by vomit.</p>
               <p>In this Case, as in the former, it appears, clearly, that the Animal spirits, <note place="margin">The nature and cause of the discribed case.</note> not only those implanted in this or that part or region, had contracted an hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogeneous <hi>Copula</hi> to be shaken off by some turns, but also the spirits influencing some nerves, being imbued with explosive particles, had brought in the perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, and wandring Convulsive Motions. And when at first it hapned, that the spirits so afflicted, did assolt, not all the nerves together, nor any indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, but for the most part, only those belonging to the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and the <hi>Appendixes</hi> of the spinal marrow, so that within those spaces, the fury of the spirits, perpetually explosing, was limited, for this reason it hapned, that the convulsive affections being restrained, in any one of those parts, did break forth more furiously strait in another; and when by their proper instinct, their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive force was imployed in one Region, the same was in the mean time, wont to be remitted in another. Moreover in this sick person, the morbific matter, consisting both of narcotick and convulsive particles, caused together the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytick, and convulsive distemper.</p>
               <p>Coming to her on the 4th day, I gave her an Emetick potion, by which she vomited 7 times, abundance of ropy phlegm, with yellow choller, yet without any ease: on the next day, I took six ounces of blood, from her left Arm, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently from thence, the blood being more impetuously carried, towards the head, she complained mightily of an head-ach, and giddiness; But within 3 days she being let blood in the foot, found her self better: she afterwards took Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the distempers of the nerves, to wit, <hi>Spirits of Harts-horn,</hi> and of <hi>blood, Bezoartick</hi> and <hi>shelly powders, Julaps,</hi> and <hi>Electuaries,</hi> antispasmodical: by the use of these, the Symptoms seem'd to be something remitted, but yet they remained somewhat after the manner but now described: After a fortnight, by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of a certain Country-Woman, she took in a draught of beer, 6 spoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulls of <hi>blood,</hi> taken from the ear of an Asse, by which she seem'd on a sudden to be cured: for forthwith all the Convulsive motions did leave, and she remained free from them 24 hours; but yet the disease returning the next day, with its wonted fierceness, would not give place, neither to that Remedy, nor indeed easily to any others: she therefore for the future, took medicines methodically prescribed: Once within 6 days, she was gently purged, besides she took the powder composed of <hi>Bezoar, pearls,</hi> and <hi>Corrall,</hi> with the roots and seeds of <hi>Pae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony,</hi> also an Electuary, prescribed by <hi>Horstius</hi> for these kinde of admirable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions; also <hi>Julap,</hi> and <hi>decoctions,</hi> proper in convulsive Distempters: <hi>Clysters</hi> were often used, frictions, oyntments, and vesicatories were administred with success: within another week, the sobbing affection wholly ceased, and likewise the other convulsive motions, being grown more gentle by degrees, very much remitted: Growing well of these distempers, a <hi>Catharr</hi> falling down in her throat, she was so much troubled, that she almost continually spit forth a sharp, and as it were Corrosive spittle, as if she had had a salivation by taking <hi>Mercury:</hi> which kinde of Remedy indeed, hath been found to have been the last event in this case: but I wholly abstained from administring it, because both the sick, and her friends, would not give me leave.</p>
               <p>After this plentifull, and troublesome spitting had continued for many days, the disease seem'd almost to be wholly Cured: so that this noble Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, being free of her Convulsive motions, went abroad, and was well, both in strength and stomach. Only she complained, that oftentimes in a day, she
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106699:38"/>
was suddenly afflicted, for about a minute of an hour, with a shivering of her whole body; which kinde of Distemper coming upon her sometimes in the night, broke her sleep: within the space of a month, this Symptom also, and likewise her Catarrh wholly ceased: But from thence, she was sometimes afflicted with an extream Soureness, in her ventricle, and the passage of the <hi>Oesophagus,</hi> and sometimes also in her mouth, and pallate, that it was feared lest the inward skin being sretted, those parts should Contract an ulcerous disposition; besides she was wont to be tormented often in her sleep, sometimes also being awake, with the night-mare or <hi>Incubus.</hi> For this prescribed, <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>fall,</hi> a gentle purge to be administred, with the use of antiscorbutick Remedies, and sometimes <hi>Chalibiates,</hi> or medicines of <hi>prepared steel,</hi> which kinde of method she observed so much to her benefit, that she was well in health for many years, and is as yet well.</p>
               <p>Among the many Remedies, which were taken against that Sourness, and as it were ulcerous disposition of the pallat, and <hi>Oesophagus,</hi> I prescribed, that she should drink every morning, her own urine fresh made; this, whilst it was very Saltish, was wont to give her great ease; but at sometimes, her urine flow'd from her thin and plentifully, which being nothing salt, but like to sour vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, from the drinking of that she received little or no benefit.</p>
               <p>The Reason of the Case but now described, seems not much unlike the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, unless that in this sick Gentlewoman, the explosive particles had enter'd into more passages of the nerves, to wit, besides the <hi>appendixes</hi> of the spinall marrow, into those dedicated for the office of breathing, and also by fits, into those designed for the motion of the Tongue, and almost perpetually tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Spirits abounding in them, with Rage or fury.</p>
               <p>But that the Cure of this Disease hapen'd, by the falling down of the sharp humour, into the emunctories of the mouth, and throat, we may from thence gather, that the material Cause of this, was the heterogeneous particles, and as it were nitrous, begotten in the blood; which, when from thence, being pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed thorow from the brain, they were carried into the nervous stock, caused the aforesaid Distempers: But assoon as by the help of Remedies, the more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful provision of that matter was hinderd, and the morbifick particles allready produced, both from the blood, and the Brain, and nervous stock, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived into those emunctories of the head, the Convulsive Distemper presently ceased, and within a short time, such a Crisis or secretion still remaining, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> the Disease followed.</p>
               <p>Forasmuch as the urine, being of it self very salt, and as it were lixivial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came at some times sourish, which did not give any help, as the former, to the sourne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s of the throat: it may hence be gathered, that the salt particles of the blood, and humours, coming away by the urine, had a twofold state or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to wit, offixedness, and fluedness; wherefore the serum, imbued by them, became now of this, now of that nature: for it seems, that the Saline particles, being degenerate within the mass of the blood, remained fixed, and rendred the urine for the most part Lixiviall: but those which flowed without the blood, in the nervous juce, or were laid up about the solid parts, did degenerate into a flux or acetousness: and therefore from these, being derived into the emunctuaries of the mouth, that noted sourness of the mouth, and <hi>Oesophagus</hi> proceeded: moreover, when these kinde of particles, being gathered to a fullness in the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous juce, and solid parts, did swell up, and arising to a fluxion, boyled up into the blood: presently these being sent away from thence, in heaps, thorow the Reines, rendred the urine, increased in quantity, sourish. But forasmuch, as the Saline particles, being of a divers Condition, and that those of the same kinde could not be mingled together, they mutually moved against one another, and break their forces, therefore the salt urine, and not the sour healed the sourness of the throat. It appears by a vulgar experiment, that the most sharp <hi>Spirit of Vitriol,</hi> by the mixture of the <hi>Salt of Tartar,</hi> or any other lixivial, grows very milde: yea, and yet from thence appears, that the acid humour, sweating out into the parts of the mouth and throat of this Gentlewoman, came near the nature of sharp <hi>Vitriol;</hi> because the fume of Tobacco, being taken at the mouth of the sick person, was wonderfully sweet, as it happens to such, who have beforehand tasted <hi>Vitriol.</hi>

                  </note> with an evill Spirit: This Virgin about 16. years of age, fair, and well-made, yet begotten of a paralytick Father, without any evident Cause, about the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-solstice began to fall ill. At first she was troubled, though not in any grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous manner, with an head-ach, and giddiness for many days; then she felt, now in one of her arms, and then in another, a trembling and sudden Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction; which kinde of Convulsions, returning often that day, endured scarce a moment; the next day sitting nigh her Sister in a Chair, suddenly leaping out, she fetch'd one or two jumps, and many others successively, with wonderfull agility, at the distance of many feet; then, when she was come to the farther part of the Chamber, she stood leaping a great while in the same place, and every time to a great height; when her legs were quite tired with leaping, she fell on the floor, and presently she flung her head here and there with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull violence, as if she would shake it from her neck: As soon as she ceased from this motion for weariness, presently the same fury invaded her hands and feet, so that she was forced strongly to exercise these members, by striking the walls or posts, or by beating the pavement: when by reason of shame or mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, due to her friends, and by-standers, she did hinder her self with great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, from these motions (for all the while she was her self, and spake soberly) the distemper being sent inwardly, she was very much infested, with a mighty oppr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

By the Use of these, she seem'd presently to be cured, and was well above a Month: And when afterwards, the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers being about to return, she felt at any time some forerunners, presently by the use of a vomit, and the expression of the <hi>Millepedes</hi> or <hi>Cheslogs,</hi> she averted the approach of the Disease: within three months, she fo far recovered her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer health, that she has now liv'd for many years, free from those kinde of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive distempers: But from the time the convulsive passions wholly ceased, she was sometimes troubled, about the parts of her mouth, and throat, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Cough, with a discolored spittle, threatning a Consumption, notwithstanding which, by remedies used in these kinde of Cases, she was easily cured.</p>
               <p>As to the AEtiologie, or Rational account of the aforesaid Case, there is no <note place="margin">The reasons of aforesaid case.</note> reason that we should fear to refer both the Causes, and Symptoms of this disease, to the explosive particles (the brain being pass'd thorow without hurt) sent as a supply, Continually from the blood, into the nervous stock; which, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they being poured forth in great plenty, were not restrained within privatemines, to be struck off only by turns, cleaving every where, both to the implanted, and inflowing Spirits, forced them, as it were inspired with a madness, to be perpetually exploded, and to grow raging here and there, by bands: so that indeed, they were not able at all to be ruled; within the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining parts, but there was need to overthrow, and to tame them, impetuously tumultuating, and apt to be carried here and there, like a whirlwinde, by some very violent and strong exercise. In truth in was in this sick person, as it is in musical Organs, which if filled above measure, by too great a blast of winde, unless presently the passages of more Pipes be opened, the whole frame of the Organ is quickly shaken, and in danger to be broken to pieces: In like manner in this Lady, when the animal Spirits, actuating the pipes, and the depending <hi>fibres,</hi> of some of the nerves, were moved beyond their due tenour, there was a necessity, that their force should be bestowed on many vehement local moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons together, whilst they inflated above measure the nervous bodies: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when their madness was hindred in on part, by and by like winde pent up, creeping somewhere else, it broke forth more violently, in some other part.</p>
               <p>In this sick person, the use of one or two Vomits, brought help once or twice, because that by it, what was lodged in the gallie-vessell, yea the <hi>glandula's</hi> and emunctuories, and also about the <hi>viscera</hi> of concoction, being by this means emptied, the purging of the blood, and nervous juce, were more Copiously drawn into the same place; therefore indeed, that the animal Spirits, flowing within the Pipes of the distemperd nerves, might be less infected by them: By this reason also, the juice of the Sows or hog-lice was beneficial, forasmuch as it derived the morbifick matter, from the nervous kinde, to the urinary passages: Besides these Remedies, the Root and in a great part the branches of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific matter being cut off, and when others, as it were antidotes, hindring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where its vegitation, were carefully administred, whatsoever was left of it, Nature at length becoming superior (as she is wont in these criticall Cases) sent away, to the sinks of the mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Whilst I was writing these things, I visited an illustrious Virgin, who was <note place="margin">4. Observation.</note> troubled with other kinde of Convulsive motions, and those universal, and no less to be admired: she was about 18. years of age, hansome, and well made, and before this time healthfull; when the Pestilence raging in this neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, she had come within the danger of its Contagion, she fell into a panick fear, with frequent swouning; the night fellowing, she suffer'd so great a <hi>deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> or sinking down of her Spirits, and insensibility, that she seem'd just a dying: hardly strugling with so great an evill, afterwards she had every day Convulsive fits, though at first at uncertain hours, and returning after a manifold Kinde: But within a short time, its comings being made regular, twice in a day, to wit, they constantIy returned at eleven of the clock, and before five in the afternoon, that no intermitting feavour, kept more exactly its periods; yea, also, the same accidents of the fit dayly chanced after the same manner.</p>
               <p>When she had thus been sick for three weeks, one day I was sent for, that I mighttake notice of all the Symptoms, and the whole figure of the disease: she being up about ten in the morning, was well, in her Countenance, going, and speech, she behaved her self exceeding well, so that none would ever suspect her to be sick: at eleven of the clock, she began to complain of a fullness of her head, and numbness of Spirits, with a light swimning; by and by she felt a great pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, and as it were the leaping of some live animal, in her left <hi>hypochondrium:</hi> putting my hand on her side I plainly perceived this motion; then a stretching and belching followed, which done, she was presently put to bed, and a maid siting upon a pillow held her down; who during the fit, most strictly graspt the sick person, holding her to her bosom, with her arms foulded about her wast: besides servants were ready, and her relations standing by, who now press'd down

her belly, and <hi>hypochondria</hi> rising up, and swelling to a great bulk, now held her hands and arms. The chief Symptoms of the Disease, which being excited by turns, almost divided the whole fit, were these two, <hi>viz.</hi> one while Cruel Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions of the Bowells did infest her, so that the <hi>abdomen,</hi> rising up into a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bulk, strove against the hands of the by-standers, held upon it, that it could not be pressed down; and at the same tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, her <hi>Praecordia,</hi> being contracted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the motions of her blood and heart, were almost stop't: in which space of time, this virgin, her head falling down, with a small pulse, and almost with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out voice, lay nigh sensless; after two or three minutes of an hour, these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsions ceased: and then the sick person, setting her self upright, look'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout cheerfully, and for a while, the force of the disease changed into talking and singing, both of which she without ceasing performed, most pleasantly and most elegantly, beyond her proper capacity: with these kinde of speeches, and pleasant jeasts, she fell upon all the standers by, that nothing in a Comedy could be more pleasant; then she utterd most sweet tunes of musick, and more pleasant, than any other could, or her self at another time: After she had past fix or seven minutes of an hour, thus jesting and singing, the Convulsions of her Bowells and <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and the want of speech, came upon her as before: and these soon remitting, the force of the Spirits leaping back, from the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior nerves on the brain, it was lastly imployed in the pleasantness of speech and Songs; as often, when she talkt to the by-standers, as any of them replyed any thing bitterly or reproachfully, she fell into those most grievous, and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er continuing, Convulsions of the <hi>Viscera:</hi> After this manner, she was wont to be molested, with an alternate distemper of the Bowells, and brain, about the space of an hour: Then towards the end of the <hi>Viscera,</hi> the fit declining, more light Convulsions being made, they repeated three or four times without any intermission, then these wholly ceasing, the force of the disease brake forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her outward members, from whence it quickly vanished: for her Arms and Legs, for a minute of an hour, suffer'd leapings forth, and Contractions; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after, the sick person being taken up, left ber bed, free from all Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, till a new fit returned; yea, indifferently well in strength, she walk'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the house, and during the interval of her distemper, she cheerfully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the accustomed Offices of Life, excepting that her stomack languish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings all day she loathed food, in the evening, after the second fit, she supp'd mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratly.</p>
               <p>This was the present state of the Disease, in whose fits, the more clear use of some faculties, seem'd in a manner to Compensate the irregularity of others: But about the beginning of her sickness, it was somewhat otherways: for the Convulsions of her bowells, were far more grievous, and an insensibility was joyned to them: besides, in their intervall, talking idly, an incongruons sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, yea both laughter and weeping, without any known reason, breaking forth, were wont to follow one another: but now, the animal Spirits being forced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to longer explosions, performed them so regularly, now this, now that, as a more Commodious way was made, that they seemed after a manner, to be done by the Command of the will, and of Reason.</p>
               <p>That we may therefore, according to our <hi>hypothesis,</hi> frame an <hi>AEtiology</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional account of this Distemper; In the first place, it seems, that a vehement <note place="margin">The reasons o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> the aforesaid Distemper.</note> fear, did drive the Spirits inhabiting the brain and <hi>Praecordia,</hi> into great disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: so that, they being disturbed out of their ranks, both the kinde of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or foolishness, and the frequent swooning succeeded: Further, it may be suspected, that from the same impression, the hurt was carried to the brain it self, so that its conformation being somewhat vitiated, the heterogeneous and morbific particles, were admitted together with the nervous juice: Then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the spirits at the beginning, being confused and troubled, after their short inordinations, at last recovered themselves, and performed the wonted offices both of the animal and vital function; yet by reason of the taint, impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on the brain, the heterogeneous particles being constantly admitted, clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to those Spirits, induced explosive endeavors, as soon as the spirits were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>illed to a plentitude, with the extraneous <hi>Copula,</hi> they being irritated, entred into Convulsive explosions for the shaking or striking it off.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the Disease, when both the Disposition of the Brain,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106699:40"/>
and the Spirits inhabiting it, was more perverse, and vitious, from the fresh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hurt, a fullness of the heterogeneous <hi>Copula</hi> sooner happened, and so its explosion following more often, and more inordinately, was dispatched with greater tumult; But afterwards, when the hurt of the animal regiment abating, the supplements of that <hi>Copula,</hi> even as the nervous Liquor, were dayly brought in with an equall dimention, the explosions of the Spirits being made regular, and more milde, observed their just periods or set times.</p>
               <p>That she <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>elt, upon the approach of the fit, a fullness and as it were an inflati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in her head, with an heaviness, and dullness of the spirits, the Reason is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause at this time, the spirits inhabiting the brain, being now prepared for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosions, were wont first of all to be moved, and as it were to swell up; then that pulsation in her left <hi>hypochondria</hi> succeeded; for that the Spirits inhabiting the nervous foldings, and <hi>fibres,</hi> thickly planted about rhe Spleen, began to be exploded: afterwards, when the Spirits flowing both within the mesenteric, and Cardiac enfoldings, were exploded rogether, those elevations, and as it were leapings up of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> and <hi>Thorax,</hi> were induced: and when in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper, the motions of the blood and heart were almost wholly stopped, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a small and almost no pulse, and she became Speechlesse, and in a manner sensless.</p>
               <p>The Convulsion of the <hi>Viscera</hi> and <hi>Praecordia</hi> remitting, a pratling and singing succeeded, because a falling down or removal of the Spirits as yet exploded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made from the nervous stock, into the brain, it changed the Convulsions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an exaltation of the fancy, and more ready exercise of the phantasms, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the Imagination: So long as the Spirits, within the middle of the brain, are regularly and orderly exploded, they bring forth the Acts of the habits and faculties so much more noble, and as it were above the strength, and tenour of Nature, as in this sick Gentlewoman: but on the contrary, when the explosions of the Spirits in that Region, happen to be inordinate, they cause for the most part foolishness, or at least the exercise of their powers, are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous and absurd.</p>
               <p>The Convulsions of the Bowels, and the phantastic actions, releiv'd one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mutually, and by turns, because plenty of Spirits, being disposed to be struck off, made their tendency, as it were with a direct and reflected waving or undu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, now on this part, now on that by turns: then lastly, when they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all exploded, the more often Convulsions of the <hi>Viscera</hi> were stir'd up; and when a small handfull only remained to be exploded, that being at last exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, both from the head and bowells, it ran forth into the spinal marrow, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the last assolt of the disease, in the Convulsions af the Arms and Legs.</p>
               <p>There yet remains one great difficulty in this Case, why the fits of this disease, were always repeated exactly at set hours, and yet had so unequall periods, to wit, that the Coming of the first, was only but fix hours before the second, and then the return of the next, did not hapen but in 18 hours space. For the sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of this, it is to be supposed, that these fits did depend upon the nervous juice being stuffed to a plenitude, with heterogenious particles: which particles were altogether conveyed thither from the bloody mass, and the blood did drink up the same, from the nourishing juice, sent as a supply from the Bowells: These being thus supposed, we must consider, in what space of time, the bloody mass is filled with those morbific particles, and then, in what measure, it pours them forth into the nervous Liquor. As to these, that it may the better appear after what manner it was done, in the case of this sick person, you must know, that she took in 24. hours space, only at one time, a full meal: to wit, after the second fit was ended she supped moderately about 7 of the Clock; the rest of the day wanting an Appetite, she hardly took any food, therefore it is probable, that the morbific matter, was poured forth together with the nutritious provision, into the bloody mass, chiefly in the night time; and that more plentifully, than that all could presently be derived, into the nervous Liquor: The heterogeneous particles, which are first conveyed from the blood, newly satisfyed, into the nervous Liquor, being heaped up to the fulness, did excite the first fit, the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of which therefore was longer delayed, because both one space is required wherein the blood, and then another wherein the brain and nerves, are to be filled: after this fit was over, because the blood yet full, containing in it self more
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:106699:40"/>
particles, of the same kinde, pours them suddenly on the nervous juice, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ore the other fit isinduced, within thrice the space of the former: but this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, because both the bloody mass, and the nervous juice, are wholly freed from their burthen, the sick person finding her self better, than at any other time, took her food greedily enough; but after that, when to the next following fit, first the bloody mass, and then the nervous juice, ought to be filled with the morbific matter, therefore 10. hours are required for this double task: but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch, as there is only need, for the second fit, that the other particles should be derived srom the bloody mass, yet full, into the nervous juice, therefore for this effect, a much less space doth suffice, <hi>viz.</hi> of 6 hours.</p>

it will not be easie to assigne, either fit remedies for this herculean disease, or a certain method of Cure, approved by often experience: for besides, that these like cases are seldome met with, it is likewise observed, that the same Medicines which at this time were helpfull to this sick person, being given to another, or to the same, helpt nothing at another time: The reason of which seems to be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the cause of the Disease consists in the discrasie, or evill disposition of the nervous juice, which Liquor, is not always perverted, after one and the same manner: But by the manifold combination of the salts and Sulphures, it gets a morbid nature of a various manner and kinde, and oftentimes changes it: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the most grievious distempers of this kinde, not the vulgar medicines, taken from the shops or dispensatory, are to be prescribed, but magistralls, as cause arises, according to the appearances of the admirable Symptoms. A gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle vomit, Purge, blood-letting, ought in the first place to be ordained, and to be repeated, as often as shall seem flt. As to specisick medicines also, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate in these cases, when the chief Indication shall be, to mend the temper of the Nervous juice, you may try many, and by their effect judge of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues: Therefore it may be lawfull, to try, what the Remedies indued with a volatile or armoniac salt, may effect. For this end, the spirits and salts, of Harts-horn, Blood, soot, and the flowers and spirits of <hi>Sal-armoniac,</hi> are taken: These helping nothing, you must come to Chalybiats or Steel medicines; the tinctures and solutions of Corall and Antimony are given: which kinde of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are exhibited, in such a dose, and form, and so often, that some alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be made by them, on the whole blood or nervous juce: Further, If suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse shall fail in such like, you must then proceed to <hi>Alexipharmaca,</hi> which help against poysons, and the malignancy impressed on the humours: to wit, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute from these, decoctions, and distilled waters of vegitables, powders, Conserves, and other preparations; and to compound variously some with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to administer them diversly. It is likely, that those kinde of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, which are wont to be helpfull to such, as are bitten by a viper, or a mad Dog, or that have taken woulfs-bane, or poyson, may be usefull also in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Convulsions. It may be lawfull here, according to the example of <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory Horstius,</hi> in his tract of the malignant Convulsive disease, and also of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull Convulsions, to prescribe magisterial Remedies, in the form of a purging Electuary, and also of a powder, and Convulsive Antidote, and to compound them variously, partly of simple <hi>Alexipharmacks,</hi> or poyson resisters, and partly of <hi>Antiepilepticks,</hi> or things good against the falling Evil.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE hysterical passion is of so ill fame, among the Diseases belonging to wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that like one half damn'd, it bears the faults of many other Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers: For when at any time, a sicknbss happens in a womans body, of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usual manner, or more occult original, so that its Cause lyes hid, and the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory Indication is altogether uncertain, presently we accuse the evill influence of the womb, (which for the most part is innocent) and in every unusual Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, we declare it to be something hysterical, and so to this Scope, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is only the subterfuge of Ignorance, the medical Intentions, and use of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies are directed.</p>
               <p>The Passions, which are wont to be referred to this cense or order, are found <note place="margin">A descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical passion.</note> to be various and manifold; which rarely happen in diverse women, or which come wholly after the same manner: The most Common, and which common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are said to constitute the formal Reason of the hysterical distemper, are these, <hi>viz.</hi> A motion in the bottom of the belly, and an ascention of the same, as it were a certain round thing, then a belching, or a striving to vomit, a disten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and murmur of the <hi>hypoehondria,</hi> with a breaking forth of blasts of winde, an unequall breathing, and very much hindred, a choaking in the throat, a

                  </gap>e excited: But universal Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions rarely happen, and not unless this disease be in the very worst state: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, for the most part, the Tragedy of the Fit is acted without Contraction of the members, only in the inferior belly, <hi>Thorax,</hi> and head, to wit, in some of them, or successively in all: women of every age, and Condition, are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to these kinde of Distempers, to wit, Rich and poor, Virgins, wives, and widdows: I have observed those Symptoms in maids before ripe age, also in old women after their flowers have left them; yea, sometimes the same kinde of Passions infest men, as plainly appeared by the example already shewed.</p>
               <p>As to the causes of those symptoms, most ancient, and indeed Modern Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitians, <note place="margin">The causes of the Symptons inquired into.</note> reser them to the ascent of the womb, and vapours elevated from it: The former opinion, although it plead antiquity, seems the less probable, for that the body of the womb is of so small bulk, in virgins, and widdows, and is so strictly tyed by the neighbouring parts round about, that it cannot of it self be moved, or asccnd from its place, nor could its motion be felt, if there were any: as to that vulgar opinion, or Reason taken from the vapours, we have often rejected it as wholly vain, and light, for just reasons elsewhere: But we judge, the passions but now described, do neither always, nor at all proceed from the ascent, or the vapours of the womb: and that indeed, other very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Physitians, have already determined: For in times past. <hi>Charles Piso,</hi> and of late the most learned <hi>Highmore,</hi> have vindicated the womb from all fault; and the passions, which are commonly call'd hystericall, are thought by this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to arise from the blood, most impetuously rushing on the Lungs; and by the other, from a serous colluives heaped together neer the <hi>origin</hi> of the Nerves. How probable this latter opinion doth seem, shall appear from what follows: But as to the opinion deliver'd by Doctor <hi>Highmore,</hi> concerning this thing, tho it be far from our Custom to contradict any ones opinion, and that it is almost <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nlawfull for me, to diffent from this famous man; yet, because our Pathologie standing on a contrary <hi>basis,</hi> (viz. the cause of the hystericall distemper being imputed more immediately to the nervous stock, than to the blood) will seem to be only asserted, unless we shew the Reasons, which combat against that <hi>hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis,</hi> and forours, therefore taking leave, here we will try more exactly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opinion, put as it were in a ballance.</p>
               <p>In the fit therefore commonly called hysterical, this famous man supposes, the blood, for that it is thin, flatulent, and with a certain effervescency, to rush <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctor</hi> High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
                  </note> too much in heaps, into the pneumonick vessells, and the vessells of the heart, and in them to broyl up impetuously, and so to stuff up the lungs, and very much to aggravate them, that neither they can exercise their motion, nor that the blood can be drained from the bosom of the heart: Hence, from the blood stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in the <hi>Praeoordia,</hi> a great oppression, difficult breathing, and often none, with a melting of the vital Spirits were wont to be inferred: then the <hi>diaphrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> that it might give place to the Lungs more and more distended, and that breathing at least might be some way made, is carried downward, with a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and long continued <hi>Diastole,</hi> and so by pressing down the Intestines, it lifts up the <hi>ahdomen,</hi> and <hi>hypochondria,</hi> and feins a motion as it were the arising of a globe: But afterwards, the vital function labouring after this manner, the animal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty arises in its aide, wherefore, a necessity of motions, in various parts urging the animal Spirits, being driven impetuonsly into the beginnings of the nerves, produce divers manners of Convulsions, running here and there. The Author endeavours to confirm this Opinion, by the great help in this disease had, by the taking away the bloody excretion, both from things helpfull, and things hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, in this paffion:</p>
               <p>But though I cannot but praise this Doctrine of the suffocation of the womb, as very ingenious, and cunningly wrought, yet that I do not consent to it in all things, some reasons of great moment clearly hinder me. Truly I confess, that I do not understand, how in some hysterical persous, to wit, who are of a more frigid temperament, and are often troubled with the Pica, and longing disease; the blood should so immoderatly boyl up in the Lungs, without any conspicuous
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:106699:42"/>
notes of its growing hot, in some other place. I have known young maids, by reason of the green-sickness, as it were without blood, to wit, whose blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed being without life, did remain without any exercise in the heart, and was from thence diffic ltly enough drawn forth, into the Lungs, who yet were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vously obnoxious to the passions called hysterical: Certainly it is not probable, that the blood of these persons growing immoderatly hot, should rush impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onsly into the Pneumonick vessells, and should stuff up their pores and passages very thickly, when in the mean time, such become short-breath'd, by reason of the absence of the blood from the Lungs, or its difficult admission to them: Besides, by what means comes it to pass, that this violent course of the blood into the Lungs, which is supposed to be made in this Fit, brings forth no Inflammation in them? for that the blood, being too much heaped, or rapidly put into any part, is easily extravasated, and is wont to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite an Inflammation hardly to be shaken off. From whence it is therefore, in the hysterical distemper, the blood entring violently into the Lungs, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stending them, does not cause a peripneumonie or impostume of the Lungs? Or wherefore the distempers as it were hysterical, come not on an Inflammation of the Lungs, otherwise caused? wherefore it seems improbable, that the blood swelling up, with its proper anger or heat, should rush into the Lungs, and by stuffing them, renders them too immovable, and so secondarily and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induce Convulsions of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and other parts: but it may rather seem, that by reason of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> and other organs of breathing, being first affected with a Convulsion, the blood should be forced to stagnate in the <hi>praecordia:</hi> Besides, it may be observ'd, that the lung<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> are not always afflicted before other parts; for oftentimes the convulsive Symptoms begin elsewhere, and not rarely bear the region of the breast wholly untouch'd: Because in some, the <hi>vertigo,</hi> and Corruscations or sparklings of the eyes, begin the fit, to which succeed either weeping, or laughing, or convulsive motions of the Limbs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any straitness of the breath, or oppression of the heart: in others, before respiration troubles them, any way, a swelling in the bottom of the belly, with a vomiting, and rumbling of the belly, begins and often ends the fit; so that the difficulty of breathing, oftentimes follows these Symptoms at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, and is wont to be prevented, by the tying strictly of swathing-bands, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>hypochondria.</hi> Moveover, it seems, that this ascent as it were of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain round thing, from the <hi>Hypogastrium</hi> or lower part of the belly, can never proceed from the depression of the <hi>Diaphragma;</hi> because in the hysterical fit, this part is not always pressed down towards the lower parts, but oftentimes drawn up to the higher parts, and drives the Lungs upwards, so that the spirit or breath being almost shut forth, threatens the danger of Choaking. By these, and other reasons, we are at length perswaded to that opinion, that the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <note place="margin">The hystericall distemper chiefly belongs to the Brain and nervous stock.</note> named from the womb, is chiefly and primarily convulsive, and chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the brain and the nervous stock being affected, and whatever inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or irregularity from thence happens, about the motion of the blood, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly secondary, and is made dependingly, by the Convulsions of the Bowells.</p>
               <p>But that this doth consist within the bounds of the head, both the comparing of the symptoms, which happen in the living, and the anatomical observations of the dead, clearly shew; because we may observe, that this distemper often takes its rise, from a sudden fear, great sadnesse, or anger, or other violent pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, in which the spirits inhabiting the brain are chiefly affected besides, to some an ill manner of dyet, and various accidents whereby the humours being vitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are heaped more plentifully within the head, at first brings this evil. Yea, the manner of the fits clearly evinces the same, forasmuch, as a fullness of the head, a <hi>vertigo,</hi> a sparkling of the eyes, a ringing noyse of the ears, begin in many the hysterical fit, and often conclude it: Besides I have opened some wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, dead of other diseases, tho while they were sick, very obnoxious to hyste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical passions, in whom the womb being very well, I have found in the hinder part of the head, the beginnings of the nerves, moistned and wholly drowned with a sharp <hi>serum,</hi> as shall be more largely declared anon.</p>
               <p>Having weighed these, and other Reasons, we doubt not to assert, the Passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons commonly called Hysterical, to arise most often, for that the animal spirits, possessing the beginning of the Nerves within the head, are infected with some

taint; to wit, they being either acted or brought into Confusion, or being tincted with vitious humours, get to themselves an heterogeneous and explosive <hi>Copula,</hi>

For the animal spirits, chiefly for this occasion, contract a convulsive disposition: forasmuch as they, from a violent impression, are perverted out of their Courses, and their wonted manner of Influence, and acting; hence they not only repeat their inordinations, but also receive the heterogenious particles into their embraces, and more easily combine with them: Wherefore, forasmuch as the animal spirits, running thorow the nerves of the wandring pair, and Intercostals, are continually entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with all perturbations both of the Concupiscable, and irascible Appetite, it is no wonder, if they acquire a convulsive disposition, before the rest.</p>

For first of all, the disease being ready to fall upon one, oftentimes the <hi>Vertigo,</hi> a rolling about of the eyes, and a certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation os the brain, as it were praevious skirmishings, are stirred up, because the whole band of the Spirits, being in readiness for explosions, the more light com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of them, leaping back towards the brain, are first struck off; then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently a perturbation succeeds, in the bottom of the belly, or <hi>hypochondria,</hi> for that the Spirits within the enfoldings here and there, are next disturbed: For we have elsewhere shown, if at any time the animal Spirits are exploded, in a certain whole <hi>Series,</hi> those which abode in the extream parts, first of all enter into that assertion: Wherefore the beginnings of this Disease, are found to be or the most Part, in the head and Bowells: but that the Convulsions are first perceived, now in the bottom of the belly, now in the <hi>hypocbondria,</hi> the reason is, because the morbific matter, is sometimes carried by the passage of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costal nerve, into the utmost mesenteric enfoldings; but sometimes the same, being slid down, not beyond the ends of the wandring pair, subsists much neerer, to wit, about the enfoldings of the spleen, or stomack.</p>

               <p>It sometimes happens, that the convusive disposition is not drawn out so long, and largely, for besides that oftentimes the nerves only of the wandring pair, <note place="margin">From whence the diversity of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

These things happen indeed after a various manner, according as it happens, that the morbific matter, or explosive <hi>Copula,</hi> descending from the head, is gathered together, as it were heaps of gun-powder, more or less, now in this, now in that part! But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which matter, by what means, the same being brought forth in the head, first affects the beginnings of the nerves, and so constitutes the procatartick, or more remote Cause of the passion called Hysterical, now remains next to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into.</p>
               <p>As to the morbific matter or explosive <hi>Copula,</hi> which cleaving to the spirits, flowing within the head, and with them derived into the nervous passages, is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note place="margin">The more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Cause of the disease subsists, either nigh the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of the Nerves.</note> the cause of the distempers, commonly termed of the Womb; we say, that this, as in other kinds of Convulsions, is the heterogeneous particles, poured forth from the blood, which yet are wont to be affixed to the spirits, flowing into the beginnings of the nerves, cheifly for two causes: to wit, either by the fault of the spirits themselves, or by the force of the matter it self, instances of either kinde, are ordinarily met with. It sometimes happens, that the animal spirits, planted within the brain, and in the passage leading from it, to the <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia,</hi> are very much disturbed, by a sudden passion, as of fear, anger, sadness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And forced into disorders; and that by that means, they being driven out of their orders, do acquire to themselves heterogeneous particles, whereever met with; and combine with these, that by and by, for that reason, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire an explosive disposition, as we have already declared. Further in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, sometimes the morbific matter it self, being made more fierce and strong, in spite of the succour of the animal <hi>AEconomie</hi> or rule, is poured forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brain, and its appendix, from the bloody mass, which cleaving fast to the spirits, presently disposes them into explosions: This is ordinarily discerned

in the evil crises of feavours, also in some malignant distempers, also in Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butic and other Chronical diseases ill cured.

For in bodies so dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, both the animal spirits, from every light occasion, are moved in Confusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the passages of the brain, and nervous <hi>System,</hi> more easily lye open, for the running in of the heterogeneous, and explosive matter. In truth, for this reason, women are more obnoxious to convulsive distempers, than men, and some women then others, as we will shew more largely hereafter.</p>
               <p>But altho these kinde of passions of women, called hysterical; most often proceed from the fault of the head, or from the morbific cause, arifing within the <hi>Encephalon;</hi> yet sometimes, such distempers are stirred up, by reason of a Cause <note place="margin">Or near the womb, or other Inwards.</note> beginning somewhere else, <hi>viz.</hi> Now in the womb, now in the other Bowells; and of this Convulsive Pathologie, there are chiefly two heads, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ocall, is begun at either end of the nervous Trunk. Some time past I have seen a noble virgin, in whom a small Tumour arising, with most cruel pain, below the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> did stir up huge Convulsions; first in the lower belly, and afterwards ascending to the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and head, were at length stretch'd to the outward members: for once or twice in a day, after that great pains did torment her in the affected part, the <hi>abdomen,</hi> and by and by the <hi>hypochondria,</hi> were wont to be lifted up: then difficulty of breathing, on an Insensibility succeeded, and presently the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper being brought outwardly, most horrid Convulsions, and Contractions of the members, and Limbs followed. Sometimes it also happens, that convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive symptoms are induced in Child-bearing women, by reason of some hurt or evill brought to the womb: <hi>Harvie</hi> Relates, that wonderfull convulsions were caus<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>d by the injection of some sharp thing into the womb: So sometimes, tho rarely, it happens, that a morbific matter or explosive <hi>Copula</hi> is fixed to the fpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits dwelling about the extremities of the nerves and near the womb, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the place there affected and without fault of the brain.</p>
               <p>There yet remains another case, or manner of affecting, by which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive <note place="margin">2. Or by reason of an obstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Nervous juice.</note> disposition is produced from the fault or the parts, lodg'd at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the brain (tho in the mean time, the taint, which is the cause of this distemper, is often mediately communicated to the brain it self) to wit, when at any time, the nervous juice is hindred somewhere, in its motion or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, from thence stagnating in the nervous parts, and loading them, does often bring in a convulsive disposition: So, when some usual Evacuation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the superfluities of the nervous Liquor, were wont to be sifted forth, is stopp'd, as from Issues suddenly shut up, or old ulcers dryed up without a purge, many fall into convulsive distempers: Yea, it may obtain here some place, what is wont commonly to be noted for a cause, of the hysterical passions, in maids and widdows, to wit, the untimely restraint of the seminall humour, which ought to be bestowed about the pleasure os <hi>Venus;</hi> at least, if they receive help from the state of a conjugal Life, it therefore happens, because the restagnations of the nervous humour, which often fix a taint to the brain and nervous stock, by this means are prevented: Moreover, the nervous juice flows back towards its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106699:44"/>
because its passage is somewhere shut up, by a swelling or cancrous Tumour. Lastly in this City, a notable instance of this kinde of distemper hapned, <hi>viz.</hi> A certain maid of 12. years of age, had contracted an <hi>hernia</hi> or burstness, hence by the order of her Mother, she wore a truss ill fitted, for a fortnight, not without great pain and torment, a little hard knot much pressing upon the <hi>glandulas</hi> of the Groin: within this space (when before she was perfectly well) she began to complain of a giddiness and heavy dulness of her head; and so a little after, she felt convulsive, and as it were hysterical distempers, frequently salling upon her; rogether with it great swellings arose behinde her ears, and in her neck of the same side, to which she was never before obnoxious in all her lise. It is not to be doubted in this case, but that from those <hi>Glandulas,</hi> which are the Emun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries, or sinks of the nervous Liquor, being too much pressed together, the superfluities of that humour, wont to be sent away from thence, by the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic vessells, restagnating in the head, brought forth those evills: because the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising of the aforesaid symptoms, so suddenly and manifestly followed, upon the wearing of that Truss upon the Groin, that even her Mother laid the cause of the Disease, upon that occasion. Besides also I have observed in others, the recrements of the nervous humour, being somewhere stopp'd in their Course, restagnating towards the head, have not only brought in convulsive symptoms, but from thence the <hi>Kings Evill.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much for the formal Reason, of the different original of the distemper, called hysterical; as also of the <hi>genuine</hi> Causes, of its symptoms: Out of which, <note place="margin">Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesis answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> it seems to appear plainly, that those passions, do not depend always on the womb, but much more often, on the fault of the brain, and of other parts of the nervous stock: But many things are objected against these, which according to the old opinion, cast all the blame on the womb: To wit, it seems so to be done because the assault of this disease invades almost only women; yea and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are not well about their womb, <hi>viz.</hi> Child-bearing women, or such who have their courses stopt, are chiefly obnoxious to it: Besides it may be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued from things helpfull for it, because a plaister worn upon the lower part of the belly, also a strict girding of the belly, and <hi>hypochondria,</hi> by which the ascent of the womb may be hindred, do not seldom drive away the fit, just falling on them; this also shews it, that sweet things held to the nose brings on the fit, and stinking things drive the same away, it is said to happen quite contrary, if the same things be laid to the belly, or privy member.</p>
               <p>That we may wipe off these objections, we say first, that the symptoms, which seem hysterical, do not only happen to women: for we have shown already, by the history brought by us, that a certain man has been obnoxious to those kinde of fits, with the ascention of a bulk in the bottom of the belly: but that women are much more often troubled with those convulsive diseases than men, two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may be shown, <hi>viz.</hi> First, for that their animal constitution is much wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker: to wit, they have the brain and nerves softer, and of a less firm texture, that they are not able to suffer any thing strongly, or to resist every injury; also the animal spirits in them, being more prone to flight and distraction, more easily admit an heterogeneous and explosive <hi>Copula:</hi> from hence Women, from any sudden terror or great sadness, fall into mighty disorder of spirits, when men from the same occasion, are scarcely disturb'd at all. Secondly, women more readily receive the convulsive disposition, because they gather a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull heap of the morbific matter: for that, whilst they lead for the most part a sedentary Life, the blood, for want of ventilation, becomes more impure; besides in this sex it originally abounds with heterogeneous and fermentative particles; wherefore it is convenient for it, to be more often purged, by the flux of their Courses; by which notwithstanding, not always what is extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and incongruous, is wholly cast forth, from the bloody Mass, but that there remains, that which being poured on the brain, and its appendix, as oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is given, becomes the cause of the convulsive distemper: Moreover, when the menstrual flnx, being stop'd, a convulsive disposition is occasioned, it is not therefore to be thought, that such a distemper is rais'd up from the womb, but that the bloody mass, being more than usually imbued, with heterogeneous particles, carries them, together with the nervous juice, to the head: yea, chiefly for this reason also, child-bearing women, are found obnoxious to the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:106699:44"/>
passions, as it were hysterical, for besides that the membranes of the womb being hurt, a convulsion there begun, by reason of the felt trouble, creeps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and is at la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t communicated to the head; it most often happens, that the blood being infected, by the termes being retained, grows hot with a feavourish burning, and then instead of a <hi>crisis,</hi> the malignant infection, is carried to the brain, from whence convulsive, and not seldom soporiferous, or sleepy distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, are excited.</p>
               <p>But that it is argued, that this disease seems to be hysterical, because Remedies applyed about the <hi>abdomen,</hi> often bring help; it will be easy to shew, that the morbific cause planted in the mesentery, oftner than in the womb, is sometimes either taken away by that means, or restrained from its Influence: besides, the same kinde of applications, about the <hi>hypogastrium,</hi> are no less profitable, altho the original of the distemper, be derived from the head it self: for we have shewn before, that when the heterogeneous, and explosive matter, descending from the head, brings a convulsive disposition, to the spirits disposed within the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses of the interior nerves; the convulsive motions therefore excited, begin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>rom the extremities of the nerves, and so creep upwards towards their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings; so that first of all the <hi>viscera</hi> of the lower belly, then the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and lastly the brain it self are affected; but if the outmost spirits, <hi>viz.</hi> those dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the enfoldings of the mesentery, be restrained from entring into explosi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all the rest, in the remaining nervous passage, continue in their orders: and this, plaisters worn upon the navel, do often effect: for they repress, and compel into order, with their odour, the spirits from leaping forth; yea also, not seldom, they shake off and drive away, the <hi>Copula</hi> cleaving to them: wherefore, when the explosions there about to be made, are restrained, the convulsive fit is wholly prevented: which yet is more apparent, for that, if the Convulsion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the lower belly, and from thence ascending like a Globe, be presently suppressed, and by a strong binding together of those parts, it be hindred that it creep not upwards, oftentimes the convulsive passion is broken off, the <hi>praecordia,</hi> and the brain being untouch'd: wherefore it is a common custome, for sick wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to binde strictly the <hi>Epigastrium,</hi> with swaths or rolers, and so to stop the progress of the symptoms, towards the upper parts: For when the animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, enter into Convulsions successively, as it were a fiery enkindling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the tinder, or cherishing matter is cut off, or intercepted, the distemper is there restrained.</p>
               <p>As to the various effects of odors, to wit, that sweet things bring on the fit, but stinking things drive the same away, it may be said, that the former do loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen the animal spirits, by pleasing them, and too much release them from their wonted tasks of Influence, and so provoke them ready to be exploded, in such disorders, yea and as a flame put to them, do somewhat inkindle them: but on the contrary, stinking things repress the spirits, drive them back from excursi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and exorbitances, and compell them into order, yea like sulphur, mixt with <hi>aurum fulminans,</hi> take away from them their explosive force.</p>
               <p>What we have hitherto said, of the passions called from the womb hysterical, will yet more clearly appear, if for the Confirmation of our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> we shall add arguments taken from anatomical observations; I will therefore lay before you a notable Case, by which the former reason, and Causes of the convulsive distempers, may be very much illustrated.</p>
               <p>A very noble Lady of a most curious shape, and highly indued with a virtuous disposition, of minde and manners, of late lived near to this place, who being <note place="margin">Observatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </note> for many years obnoxious to convulsive distempers, for that she had originally, or hereditarily contracted this sickly disposition, and had experienc'd the fruits of this morbid seed, almost every lustre of her age, but chiefly as often as she was with child, (for she very frequently miscarried) was wont to be tormented above measure, with convulsive passions, as it were hysterical; because, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently after the restraint of her monthly flowers, the heterogeneous particles being translated to the brain and nervous stock, caused fits of this most cruell di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper.</p>
               <p>After she had newly conceived, in the first months, according to her old custom, she was presently molested with convulsive distempers; about the nineth week of her big belly, from taking cold, she fell into a dangero<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>s feavour, in which very
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106699:45"/>
acute pains tormenting her, in her loyns and bottom of her belly, for many days, seem'd to threaten an abortion: but these pains, as the event shew'd, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be termed Colical, proceeded from a sharp humour, falling down into those parts, from the brain, by the pipes of the nerves; for towards the declining of the feavour, this matter being somewhere else translated, a great loosness or Diarrhaea, pains of the feet, and as it were an ulcerous disposition succeeded.</p>
               <p>As soon as this Lady became well from her feavour, and those pains, the convulsive distempers returned, for every morning, wakeing from sleep, she was wont to suffer Convulsions, and cruel contractions, about the parts of her face and mouth, as also in her armes and thighs; which symptoms, without doubt, did arise from a serous heap or gathering, laid up in the head, about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the nerves; and by them imbibed, together with the nervous juice, more deeply in sleep; and when afterwards the same matter, was carried by the pipe of the interior nerves, into the foldings of the Mesentery, and loyns, most cruel pains of those parts, and also fits as it were hysterical, did most grievously in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect her.</p>
               <p>But these convulsive motions of her face and members, after a little time ceased, but yet she still remained weak, and without strength, with a pale coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, an insirm and trembling gate, and desirous only of congruous food, and hot Liquors: about the end of the third month, at which time she was wont continually to miscarry, her <hi>menstrua</hi> broke forth, which coming away for two or three days together, with little pieces of broken membranes, she expected to miscarry: But that flux ceasing, pains as it were of one in labour, in her <hi>abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> and loyns, as before arose, and for the space of a week, tormented her day and night; at length, having used a bath of <hi>Emollient</hi> herbs, and afterwards put to bed to sweat, she brought forth the burthen of her womb: the conception so coming away with mighty pain, was about the bigness, and like the figure of a Turkie egg: the exterior coat of it was torn and broken, the interior remaining whole, contained about half a pint of clear water and nothing else besides; there appeared no shape of a childe, or any rudiments that it would ever be one: Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards for 4. or 5. days, her flowers flowed forth, with some pieces of broken membrances: in the mean time, pains with their wonted fierceness tormented her, and when the space of a week being elapsed, they left not off of themselves, remedies at length were sought to allay them.</p>
               <p>To this end, first Liniments, Fomentations, Baths, and Clysters, were of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten administred; also medicines purging the filth of the womb, on which the cause of all the evill was cast, were taken inwardly: Short intermissions of her tortures, followed upon the use of the former; but then the distemper returned, with great trouble; yea the disease much increasing, in three weeks time, got many other horrid symptoms: for besides the pains in her belly and loyns, which became more cruel every day, also she was shortly after tormented in her back, neck, shoulders, as also in her arms and thighs, with most cruell pain; and that more bitterly, as soon as she was warm in her bed; besides, she was afflicted with a frequent giddiness, vomiting, and nauseousness, and often in a day, with most grievous convulsive fits, <hi>viz.</hi> First a bulk was seen to ascend in the bottom of her belly, and presently it lifted up her whole belly forceably, by and by respiration being restrained, an Insensibility, with a dead countenance succeeded: after that, she had thus lain as one dead, for three or four minuts of an hour, she was wont suddenly to leap up, that she could hardly be held down, or kept by those standing by; then follow'd cruell contractions, and distortions in all the parts of the mouth, and face, as also in all the members of the body: These symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were indeed judg'd to be hysterical, because this noble Lady so lately had miscarried.</p>
               <p>But weighing every one of these, I was at last of this opinion, that the cause of either fit, <hi>viz.</hi> Both the <hi>dolorifick,</hi> and the convulsive, did depend wholly on the evill affection of the brain, and nervous stock, and that without any fault of the womb; for that a sharp humour, being heaped up within the head, did from thence descend thorow the passages of the Nerves, into parts at a great distance; which lodging upon the membranes and <hi>fibres,</hi> and fermenting with the humour, flowing in from the bloody mass, did irritate them very much, and so stir'd up most cruel pains: Then afterwards, when the heterogeneous and explosive par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106699:45"/>
being admitted with what humour within the head, and entring into the nervous passages, did cleave to the spirits; therefore the convulsive disposition, then breaking forth into grievous fits, was induced, as shall be by and by more largely laid open.</p>
               <p>Instituting Curatory Intentions, according to this kinde of <hi>AEtiology,</hi> I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to have blood taken from this sick Lady, at what time she most grievously laboured, out of the <hi>Saphena vein,</hi> and within two days, to be given her a gentle Cathartick, and that to be reiterated, once or twice in a week: Also on other days, Morning and Evening, I gave her spirits of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> and at other hours, twice or thrice in a day, of the <hi>powder of Pearls</hi> and <hi>Crabs-eyes,</hi> with a dose of the following Julap. Take of the <hi>water of Snails,</hi> and of <hi>worms magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> each ℥ iii. of <hi>Saxifrage,</hi> and <hi>black cherries</hi> each ℥ iiii. of <hi>hysterical water</hi> ℥ ii. of the <hi>syrrop of Corralls</hi> ℥ i ss. of the <hi>tincture of Costor</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. mingle them: The bath of sweet herbs was frequently used, when necessity urged, she took <hi>Opiats</hi> always with good success: <hi>Vesicatories</hi> were applyed to the inward part of either thigh, also to the hinder part of her neck; also <hi>Fomentations, Oyntments, Clysters, Cuping-glasses, Sneezing-powders,</hi> with many other manner of administrations were prescribed, according to the exigences of the symptoms.</p>
               <p>By this method observed for about 14. days, the noble Lady having received very much ease, was wholly rid of her convulsive fits. Yea, the torments of her Bowells and members, and the other symptoms being very much lessen'd, she hoped quickly to recover her health: But after this, partly by reason of an ill or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of dyet, which the sick Lady always indulg'd her self in, or taking little, but chiefly, by reason of a sudden passion of fear and sadness, which an unluckie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident hapning within her own house, had caused, she fell into a relaps, by and by the disease growing into a much worse Condition, for both the Convulsions, and pains, did infest her more bitterly; yea and her stomach being almost tyred out, with continual vomiting, would not admit either of food or medicines. She took Asses milk for some days, with some success; which notwithstanding, for as much as breeding Choller in her stomach, she found it troublesome, she shortly omitted: at length in spite of all Remedies, prescribed carefully by the Consultation of many Physitians, my noble patient from day to day grew worse, and by degrees death approached: Two days before her death, the torments of her belly and loyns very much abated, and she became more than usually chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and conceived some hope of Recovery; But in the mean time she com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a pain and great heavyness in her head; and about the beginning of the night she slept foundly, but being awakened she fell into a very horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive fit, which presently pass'd into a quick deadly <hi>Apoplexie,</hi> for being made insensible, and speechless, she left this life within twelve hours.</p>
               <p>When various judgments had passed, about the cause of the sickness, of which this illustrious Lady dyed, most flinging all the evills on the distemper of the <note place="margin">The rational account of the dise<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Therefore in the first place, it was worth observation, about the habit of the body, that the members and lower parts, nigh and beyond the seats of the pains, were very much wasted; as her thighs, quite worn away, appeared like a Skelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: In the mean time, her face, neck, and arms, remained full, and plump enough: from whence it appears, that the nervous Liquor, does help no less to the business of nourishment, than to the exercise of the animal faculty: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when that Liquor, being much hindred in its passage, the loyns and belly, taken up with the continual Convulsions, did not descend, with a due influx, to the inferior parts, they for that reason, became presently both without strength, and lean, and wasted. This kinde of Atrophie, differs in this, from other hectical wasting, which happens from the vice of the blood, because in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, an hippocratick or wanish face, is the chief signe of the Disease, in that first mention'd, the countenance, and aspect, show little or nothing of evill.</p>
               <p>The dead body of this noble Lady, tho very lean, and that her bowells were

all the emptied, yet quickly putrified, for within 40. hours all the skin was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd, and appeared in this part livid, in that green, and in others blackish; and her Corps so suddenly putryfying, yielded a most horrid smell, the reason of which without doubt was, that by reason the muscles were exercised with perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Convulsions, the principles of their mixture, were so much loosned, that they being in a readiness for dissolution, quickly after death, fell asunder one from another, after the like manner, as we may observe of the flesh of wilde beasts, which being tyred with a long course, or beaten to death with Clubs, for this much sooner putrifies, then the flesh of those, which are kill'd quickly, and peaceably.</p>
               <p>Her belly being opened, the Intestines, and ventricle appeared whole enough, <hi>viz.</hi> Intire and well colour'd, but they were emptie, and as it were blown up, for as much as they were troubled, almost with perpetual evacuations, <hi>viz.</hi> Those placed above or below: in all this Cavity, no foot steps of an Ulcer, or Imposthum were perceived. Whilst we were searching the cause of the disease, and rolling the Inwards here and there, there was something met within the mesentery, worthy notice, to wit, about its middle, where it is fixed to the back, and contained the greater folds of the nerves, a substance somewhat loose, and inflated, as it were with many little bladders, equalling an hands breadth, was seen, after that manner, as when in a shoulder of Veal, the inter-space of the muscles, are blown up, by the Butchers, that those parts might swell up, and seem fuller, and fatter: In this place of the mesentery, because it was more tumid and softer, we thought some humour, the cause of the pain, to lodg there, but opening it, I found only the membranes to have been loosned one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to conclude nothing but winde, within its inter-spaces: which sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the membranes, and devulsion one from another was without doubt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by the frequent Convulsions or explosions of the spirits, which within the enfoldings, and nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> there thickly planted, were almost continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally provoked; and those Convulsions hapned, by reason of the heterogeneous, and explosive particles being derived thither, from the head, by the pipe of the Nerves.</p>
               <p>But as to those torments of the belly, and as it were an ascent of a bulk or substance in the convulsive distempers, and the inflation of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> it is not to be doubted, but that the seat of the morbific cause, did lye hid in that part of the mesentery: but because so much suspition was had of the womb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly affected, we did next inquire how much this Inward deserv'd it: Therefore having dilligently searched the tunnell, placed within the <hi>Os pubis,</hi> I found the womb in its due place, and as to all parts sound, and well furnished: its body was drawn to its just proportion, altho it was but 5. weeks since she had miscarried, <hi>viz.</hi> It was like a small pear in figure and magnitude; the <hi>Glandulas</hi> on either side of the bottom of it, which are called the testicles, appeared very small and flaggy, without any superfluous or virulent humour contained in them: the body of the womb, whereever it was dissected, equal'd a thumbs breadth in thickness, its inward Cavity was no bigger than what would hold a bean: within this hollowness, as use to be in the Caverns of other Inwards, was included a mucous or dreggy matter, in a very small quantity: but in truth, about the womb, or its <hi>appendix,</hi> there was nothing, to which might be imputed as a morbific cause, of the symptoms but now described: from whence therefore it may be demonstratively concluded, as I at first thought, that the passions termed from the womb hysterical, are most often excited, from some other cause, than the fault of the womb.</p>
               <p>The Intestines being removed, we found also the reins sound enough, but one of them was of an unusual figure, <hi>viz.</hi> It was cleft into many lobes, like the Kidney of a Calf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Milt, Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Caul</hi> without fault: the <hi>ventricle</hi> was much blown up, and its inward Coat was plain without folds, or wrincles, which certainly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by reason of its frequent Vomiting, this Inward being almost continually troubled with Convulsions: Besides, for this reason, the tone of the stomach being broken, it did neither rightly desire, or concoct the food, or aliment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Liver</hi> very much differ'd from a sound constitution, for it was tumid, and somewhat hard, of a pail colour, like rotten wood, wholly dry and without

blood, and this without doubt, the frequent use of Cordiall, and highly hot li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors had effected.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Lungs</hi> were of a blewish colour, and every where obstructed, and stuff'd with a stinking and frothy matter: Certainly this Inward and the Liver had been vitiated of a long time, wherefore as the blood being degenerate, and very much depraved of a long time, from its right temper, had yielded the first seeds of this sickness, so also it afforded a constant cherishment of it.</p>
               <p>But indeed, we sought, and that not in vain, for the chief and as it were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall cause of the disease, in the head; therefore the skull being taken off, the vessells of the <hi>Meningae,</hi> and those creeping about the brain, appeared full, and distended with blood, when in the rest of the body, scarce any blood had flowed forth, in the cutting of it: the thicker <hi>meninge</hi> being removed, thorow the other thin and pellucid one, was discerned a clear water, filling the enfoldings and crevices of the brain, and as it were overflowing its whole substance: In truth the serous heap of waters, had filled full all the Cavities, and inward places of the brain: the enfoldings of the <hi>choroides,</hi> or net-like membranes of the brain, being a long while immersed in water, and as it were boyled, were become dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colour'd and half rotten: nigh to the beginning of the Splanchnick nerves, or belonging to the Spleen, the water insinuating it self very much, had separated the <hi>pia mater</hi> from the trunk of the oblong marrow or pith, for two fingers breadth: without doubt, the morbific matter descending from the head, by the passage of these nerves, into the enfolding of the mesentery, was the cause of the pains and Convulsions: Further, the same matter also, afflicting the heads of other nerves, and paffing thorow their pipes, produced afterwards, these most cruel distempers in other parts, to wit, almost every where, of the whole body.</p>
               <p>As to the Cure, or means of healing, used in the passions commonly called Hysterical: forasmuch as the symptoms of this disease are very much convulsive, <note place="margin">The Method of Curlng the hyst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The Therapeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic or Curatory Indications, are either Curatory, to be administer'd in the fit; or preservatory which are instituted out of the fit, that take away the cause of the disease, and prevent its comings or accessions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to the first, if the fit is wont to be light, and without other perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the spirits, it may be permitted to pass away of it self; but if it being more <note place="margin">Curatory.</note> heavily troublesome, there will be need to bring some help to nature much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, this only thing is to be done, that the spirits being freed from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of an heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> they may remit their inordinations and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plosions: for this purpose, it is grown into use, to put to the nose stinking, and ill smelling things, the scents of which compell, and repress the too fierce spirits, ready to leap forth, into their orders, and also shake off from them, the heterogeneous <hi>Copula,</hi> and often drive it quite away: <hi>Asafaetida, Castor, Galba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> being put into fine Linnen and applyed to the nostrills are convenient; also burning of <hi>Partridg feathers, old skins,</hi> and <hi>sulphur.</hi> Besides the spirits and <hi>oyl of sut,</hi> or of <hi>Harts-horn</hi> do not seldome help: yet I have known these kinde of fumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, being very troublesome to some women, to increase the sit; it is probable that the same sometimes may too much irritate the spirits, and drive them into greater disorders; and as stinking things put to the nose, so the like poured into the mouth, do often bring help: wherefore we give often with good success, to hysterical people, <hi>Tinctures of Castor, Solutions of Assafaetida,</hi> and <hi>Galbanum, spirits of Harts-horn,</hi> and <hi>Sut,</hi> with proper waters. Take of the <hi>spirits of Harts-horn,</hi> from 12. to 15. and 20. drops, Iet them be taken in a little draught of the following Julap.

               <p n="2">2. The preservatory Indication comprehends these three Intentions, <hi>viz.</hi> In the first place to take away, or to derive to some other place the impurities of <note place="margin">Preservatory.</note> the blood, apt to be poured forth on the brain, and nervous stock. Secondly, to fortifie the brain, and so to strengthen the indwelling spirits, that they may either not at all receive, or may easily shake off the heterogeneous <hi>Copula.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iy, to amend whatsoever is enormous in the womb, and contributes to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive disposition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first Intention is performed by purging, and phlebotomy, and other common ways of purifying, and purging the blood and humours. If there be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for an emetic, I judge it best allways to begin with it, especially in Cacochymicks, or bodies full of evill humors, in the longing disease, and Pica, and in such whose great load of viscous phlegm, stuffed within the folds and coats of the ventricle, hinders the virtues of other medicines: The next day af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Vomit, unless any thing bids the contrary, let blood be taken, in women of a hotter temper, presently from the Arm, and afterwards if need be, from the foot, or from the sedal veins with Leeches; but in bodies troubled with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions, and less hot, let blood be taken more sparingly, and more rarely, and only in places scituate below the womb: After these Evacuations (if they are to be ordered) rightly performed, once within six or seven days, a purge is to be prescribed according to the following forms. Take of <hi>pill-fetida major,</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> iss. of the <hi>resine of Julap</hi> xii. grains of <hi>Tartar Vitriolat,</hi> and <hi>Castor,</hi> each ℈ i. of <hi>ammoniac</hi> dissolved in hysterical water, what will suffice to make xii. pills, for iii. doses. Or take of the <hi>resine of Jalap</hi> gr. xviii. of <hi>Calomelaus</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> i. of <hi>Castor</hi> ℈ i. make a powder, let it be divided into iii. parts for iii. doses, let it be given in the pap of a <hi>roasted apple,</hi> or in <hi>Conserves</hi> of <hi>Borage:</hi> so those induced with a more hot temperament, a dose of extract, or our solutive syrrop may conveniently be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred: for the revulsion of the morbific matter from the head, Issues made in the calf of the leg, or thigh, and sometimes vesicatories, legatures, and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full rubbings, are wont to be administred: But not only a purging of the blood, and a revulsion of its recrements from the head, but an alteration of its Liquor, and reduction of it to its due temperament have here a place: Wherefore in some hysterical people, steel Medicines help, in others the use of Spaw-waters, or whay, in others the baths are wont to be signally profitable.</p>
               <p>The second Intention, to wit, the rectification of the brain, and animal spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is performed with Cephalic, and properly anti-convulsive medicines: which indeed ate to be diligently exhibited, almost every day, when they do not purge or bleed: since there are various <hi>species</hi> of such like Remedies, and several man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of administrations, we will here add some of the more choice forms.</p>

               <p>The Liquors appropriat against the hysterical affections, and to be drunk after the aforesaid Medicines, are, either distilled waters, which are to be taken by themselves, or with other things, in form of a Julap, or decoctions, or tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures and Infusions.</p>

               <p n="3">3. As to the third Intention, which inhibiting the disorders of the womb, doth promote the cure of the passion called hysterical; I say, first of all what in times past was believed, concerning the Cause and scope of curing the disease, that the womb did ascend, therefore that it ought to be reduced into its right place; is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together fictitious, as we have elsewhere shown: The falling down of the womb, or its coming forth, oftentimes happens; but rarely, or never produces the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterical Distempers: Besides, the dislocation of the womb in childbearing Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, sometimes happens, presently after their bringing forth, to wit, when the body of the womb being made Capacious, and newly emptied, doth not sink down or fall within the Tunnel, in its right place, but upwards inclines now to the right side, now to the left, and there being drawn together like a purse, is folded into a great bulk, which kinde of bulk, remaining long, nigh the side of the groin, is wont to give a suspition of another child, or the secondine or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbirth to be left behinde, or also of some hard swelling tumor there increasing; but afterwards, when the <hi>menstruum</hi> coming plentifully away, the womb is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to its due magnitude, that tumor by degrees vanishes: but while it there remaineth unless for that reason, the <hi>Lochia</hi> or <hi>menstrua</hi> were stopp'd, it doth not produce the hysterical passions. For the reducing of this part the sooner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its due position, fomentations, Liniments, and Plaisters, are convenient. But most times that Symptom, passes over, of it self, without any further harm. To what other distempers the womb is obnoxious, in child-bearing, and by what method to be helped, we have fully shown in another place. As to the other vices of that part, which happen to some women, not bearing children, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that they chiefly are either a disease of the womb, made by the breaking of the unity, <hi>viz,</hi> which is either some ulcer, or Tumor; or an inhibition of some wonted excretion, or putting forth, to wit, a suppression either of the menstruous blood, or the whites, or the seminal humour: Moreover because of the <hi>

               <head>CHAPTER. XI. <hi>Of the Distempers commonly called</hi> Hypochondriack, <hi>which is shown to be, for the most part Convulsive: briefly also of</hi> Chalybeats <hi>or</hi> Steel-Medicines.</head>
               <p>IN the foregoing Chapters, we have clearly shown, that the Passions called hysterical, do not allways proceed from the womb, yea, more often srom the head being distemper'd; next we shall inquire concerning the hypochondriacal Distempers, of what original and nature they are, and upon the fault of what parts they chiefly depend. The vulgar opinion is, that the symptoms wont to accompany this disease, are wholly produced from the spleen; wherefore, they are ascribed very much to vapours, arising from this inward, and variously run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up and down, here and there; when in truth, these ficknesses for the most part are convulsions, and contractions, of the nervous parts: but that it might appear, by what causes they are wont to be excited, we ought to consider first, the Symptoms themselves, and to place them into some order or rank.</p>
               <p>As to the Distempers therefore, which are vulgarly termed <hi>hypochondriac,</hi> it is <note place="margin">A descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>The Symptoms which are imputed to this Disease, are commonly very mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, and are of a divers nature, neither do they observe in all, the like begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the same mutual dependency, among themselves: for they seem in these, most to affect the Inwards of the lower belly, in those the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> in others the Confines of the Brain: and in most, though not in all, the ventricle labours much; concerning the appetite it is often too much, but presently burthened with what it hath taken in; and when the food, staying longer in it, by reason of slowness of Concoction, their Saline particles being carried forth into a flux, pervert the whole mass of the Chyle, into a pulse or pottage, now Sour, or austere, now salt or sharp: from hence pains of the heart, great breakings forth of blasts, rumbling of winde, and often vomiting succeed; and because of a pneumatick defect, or of Spirits, the Chyme or juice, is not wholly made volatile, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried forth of doors, but that the ballast of the Viscous or Slimy matter, sticking to the coats of the ventricle, is left behinde; an almost continual Spitting infests them; a distention in the <hi>hypochondrium,</hi> and often there, and under the ventricle, a cruell pulsation is felt: also there pains ordinarily arise, which run about here and there, and for many hours miserably torment with a certain lancing: In the mean time, from the Contractures of the Membranes, and from the fluctuation of winds, stirred up by that means, rumbling and murmurs are produced: Also in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> oftentimes there is a great constriction and straitness, that the respiration becomes difficult and troublesome, upon any motion: also, most grievous asthmatical fits fall upon some: moreover, the sick are wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a trembling, and palpitation of the heart, with a noted oppression of the same: also a sinking down or melting away of the Spirits, and frequent fear of a trance, comes upon them, that the sick think Death is always seising them: In this Region, about the membranes, and chiefly the <hi>mediastinum,</hi> or that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the middle of the belly, an accute pain, which is now Circumscrib'd to one part, now extended to the shoulders, is a familiar Symptom of this Disease. But indeed in the head, an Iliad of evills doth for the most part disturb hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal people, to wit, most cruell pains returning at set times, do arise, also
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106699:48"/>
the swimming of the head, and frequent <hi>Vertigoes,</hi> long watchings, a Sea, and most troublesome fluctuation of thoughts, an uncertainty of minde, a disturbed fancy, a fear and suspition of every thing, an imaginary possession of diseases, from which they are free; also very many other distractions of Spirits, yea some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Melancholly, and madness accompany this sickness: besides these interior Regions of the Body beseiged by this Disease, wandring pains, also Convulsions, and numbness, with a sense of pricking, invade almost all the outward parts; nightly Sweats, flushings of the Blood in the face, and the palms of the hands, eratick feavours, and many other Symptoms, of an uncertain original, do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where arise; concerning which, forasmuch as the genuine Causes, and the manner of their coming to pass, could not be readily determined, presently all the fault is cast upon the Spleen, and Physitians accuse that, as if it were the chief author of every irregular Distemper; but by what right or authority, by and by shall be sought into: In the mean time, it is to be observed, that the chief Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of this sickness, are Convulsive, and depend immediately upon the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities <note place="margin">The hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driacal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the nervous kinde.</note> of the animal Spirits, and the nervous juice, rather than on the evill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the <hi>Viscera,</hi> serving for Concoction. But indeed, from whence the first rise of this most complicated Disease proceeds, and by what means it brings forth the divers manners of distempers, in so many places, will not be so easie to determine.</p>
               <p>It would be a tedious thing, to shew here, what the ancient and modern Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians thought of the <hi>hypochondriack</hi> Passion, and of its essence, and Causes; we <note place="margin">The causes of the hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac passion is inquired into.</note> will only take notice, that most of them do ascribe this sickly Disposition, to the only fault of the Spleen; In the mean time some contend that the whole confines of this Inward, partaking of part of the fault, the blood flowing every where in the Splenetick, and Epigastric Vessells (or those belonging to the Spleen and belly) for that it being guilty of an hot and dry intemperature, and so obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to too much fermentation, brings forth the original, or gives a beginning to this manifold evill: But the famous <hi>Highmore,</hi> affording relief, as well to the Spleen; as the Womb, hath cast the chief Cause of this Disease, wholly on the vitious Constitution of the ventricle; and from thence, he would have the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the aforesaid Symptoms, to be originally sought, But indeed, that he might frame a fit <hi>hypothesis,</hi> for the solving the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of this sickness, he first supposes, the tone of the stomach to become too loose, and weak, that for that reason, it hardly, and very imperfectly Concocts the aliments: so that the thin, and more Spirituous part of the Chyle, being sent from thence, sooner than it ought, to the blood, perverts its disposition, to a hot and sour temper; then the residue of the food, by a longer stay, within the Ventricle, degenerates into a ponderous, and viscous or clammy Phlegme; which also, by its Stagnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (even as it is observable in things to be eaten, being longer kept) becomes very sour, or sharp: But from hence, that learned Man argues, that from the blood made too serous and thin, its effervescencies quickly passing thorow it, are induced: and from the stomach, loaded with ballast of ropy or viscous matter, the winde and distentions of the Ventricle, and <hi>hypochondria,</hi> as also the belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and troublesome Spitting, do arise: whereby indeed, he wholly exempts the Spleen, from this fault, he contends, that it doth neither draw to it self the melancholly dregs of the blood, nor serves for any office whatsoever, about the Sanguification or the making of blood; but that its use almost only consists in this, that this Inward swelling up, or growing turgid with very hot blood, it administers heat to the adjacent Ventricle, and cherishes it with gentle warmth.</p>
               <p>Altho I may so far assent to this famous Author, concerning this opinion, that I yield, the ventricle doth often grievously labour in this Distemper, foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much <note place="margin">

                  </note> as the tone of which, being made lax, and its strength broken, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the indigestion of the aliment, a load of viscous Phlegm, or Petui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous matter, is begotten even in its bosom, to which, by reason of the Saline particles, being brought into a flux, by their long stay, oftentimes a notable soarness, and austereness happen; then because the fault in the first Concoction is not mended, the dyscrasies and disorders of the blood, receive that want of digestion in the second: But yet he cannot draw me into that opinion, that the v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ntricle is always chiefly in the fault, or that the other Symptoms, of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacal
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106699:49"/>
Disease, depend only on its vitious Constitution: For I have known many, cruelly afflicted with this sickness, who have been well enough in their stomach: although they have very much complained of the pulsation in the left hypochondrium, of the straitness of the breast, and a wandring pain excited in it, also of the trembling, and oppression of the heart, with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual fear, and disturbed Imagination; in the mean time, they were wont to desire food greatly, and to digest whatsoever was eaten, without any trouble of the ventricle, or heaviness, and also without any spitting or acid belching: yea, I have observed others, great drinkers, and using an evill manner of living, to have contracted a loosness of the stomach, with an ill digestion, windiness, and frequent vomiting, who sound enough about their <hi>praecordia,</hi> and animal facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were not at all accounted for <hi>hypochondriacs:</hi> Besides, in this Distemper, the ventricle is often rather sick from the vitiousness of other parts, or of the Blood, than from its own default; because, it is usual for those sort of sick people, to be well in their stomach, so long as they may lye abed, and breath it forth; but when they are raised up, the pores being shut up, and the dregginess of the bloudy mass stagnating within, presently to be afflicted with the pain of the heart, an aggestion of winde, and frequent endeavours to vomit.</p>
               <p>For these, and other Considerable Reasons, I judge the original of the <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacal</hi> Disease, to be derived from some other fountain, than the weakness of the Ventricle: but forasmuch, as among the parts here primarily suspected, to be affected, great complaints are made against the Spleen; it will be worth our while, to enquire, what office this Inward doth discharge, then, as often as it fails in it, whether it contributes to this Disease.</p>
               <p>Tho I may grant with Doctor <hi>Highmore,</hi> that the SpIeen doth cherish the Ventricle with its warmth, and so perhaps in some measure help Concoction: <note place="margin">The use of the Spleen is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into.</note> yet I do not conclude, this part to be framed chiefly for that end, but for some more noble uses; because, there seems to be need, for the digesting of the food in the stomach, not so much of heat, as of an active ferment: For fishes being actually cold, devour their food whole, and without the help of heat, easily concoct the same, being resolved as it were by a certain <hi>menstrum:</hi> besides, it is observed of the spleen, that though in man, its whole substance lyes near to the ventricle, in most other creatures, who are indued with a longish form, as to the greatest part of it, it is removed far from the Ventricle: Further, if the Spleen be the only Chimny, in which the blood warming the Ventricle is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, what is the reason, that it, rather than the Liver or Lungs, becomes of a livid or blewish colour, and is stuffed with a black blood, and that less hot?</p>
               <p>When I consider these things, which sometime since I have observed; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the use of the Spleen; it seems far more probable, that a certain dreggy <note place="margin">

What hath been ingeniously wrote, by a late author, <hi>viz.</hi> the most learned <hi>Velthusius,</hi> concerning the use of the Spleen, may have relation to this: for he hath determined as highly probable, a ferment to be contained in this Inward, whereby the sluggish particles of the blood, are brought into a state of activity: Because, taking notice, that in children, and others indued with a sanguine temperament, and more fat or dull habit of body, even as their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and disposition of minde were inclined to idleness, softness, and dulness, so theirSpleen was ever of a reddish colour, and full of florid blood, like the Liver: from hence he concludes, that the spleen doth but little perform its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

in these, as the gential parts before ripe age, or in those of weak loyns; but on the contrary, forasmuch as men of a middle age, and chiefly in those, who are of a severe Countenance, and of a lean body, as in them appear marks of cunning, Sagacity, fortitude, and constancy, so their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>pleen is found to be of a livid or blewish colour, and imbued with blood, as it were muddy: further he argues from hence, that the blood, being kept long in the spleen, as in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit or receptacle, turns plainly into ferment, by which its remaining mass, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence inspired, is made more subtil, and begets more acute Spirits, both in the vital, and in the Animal Kingdom or Government: For he supposes, our bodies naturally to abound, with too much humidity, by which indeed the function of the parts, and many of the <hi>viscera,</hi> are very much dull'd: but that the spleen, doth communicate to the mass of blood, solid, firm, and constant parts, and not easily to be dissipated; and that those do wipe away that moistness, and with it carry away in some measure, that softness, from the blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, which is predominate in tender age: almost after the same manner, as the north-winde, or the eastern gales, fanning and intimately penetrating the air, with the dryness and strength of their parts, breathe health or strength to the air, and to our Bodies.</p>
               <p>But since I have in anotber pIace, declared what I have formerly thought, concerning the Spleen, there will be no need to repeat it in this: yet I shall further note, that in bodies of living creatures, compacted out of a quinarie of elements, as the spirits ought to be more strong then the rest: so indeed they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intangled with a viscous humidity of Sulphur, and water, are so hindred, that oftentimes they are not able to exercise their strength or powers lively e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; hence saline particles, for that they are very much fermenting, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired for this, that the spirituous little bodies, almost overwhelmed by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace of the others, and stupifyed, might lie awakened, and set at liberty, and into motion. Wherefore we experience in our selves, when the spirits are dull'd, by the blood being too much exhal'd, that notable help is brought, by sharp liquors, as chiefly small wines, and Cider: for these kinde of Remedies sharpen the Spirits, and shake off all heaviness. Such a kinde of fermenting virtue, we easily believe to be continually exercised, by the Spleen being in right order, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the blood and nervous Liquor.</p>
               <p>For as this Inward is formed with a threefold sort of vessells, <hi>viz.</hi> with arteries, and veins, and besides with great enfoldings of the nerves, and a most thick Contexture of nervous <hi>fibres;</hi> we think the use of each of them, to be set apart for this end: to wit, by the Arteries, the blood is carried to the Spleen, hence it lays up its dreggs, composed of a fixed Salt, and an earthly matter, in its pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages and porosities, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> of motion, is given unto it; so that, for that reason, the bIood it self is carried more lively in the vessells; also from thence, the nervous juice, procreated from the blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more active supplies the animal regiment: But trulv, the Spleen doth not only by this means mediatly, and by the intervention of the blood, inspire the brain and nervous stock, with a fermentive virtue; but it may be lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that this is done somewhat more immediately, by the passage of the nerves, dispersed in the spleen: for, because in this part, anatomie discovers a great company of Nerves, and nervous enfoldings, and of <hi>fibres</hi> springing from them, it may well be doubted, for what use they should serve: Concerning this, it is first to be observ'd, that the ventricle, and the Spleen, have a most intimate Commerce with the brain; insomuch, that <hi>Helmont</hi> did place the seat of the Soul, in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious way, than by the aforesaid nerves: Wherefore, we may here dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servedly suspect, that not only the animal Spirits, are the messengers between the one part, and the other, but also, that the nervous Liquour, which is both the food, and the ventricle of these spirits, doth descend now from the brain to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards these Inwards, and now being received from these <hi>Viscera's</hi> by the nerves, doth creep thorow towards the head: which kinde of spleeny Juice, being dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:106699:50"/>
to the brain, sharpens the animal Spirits, and raises them up being slothfull, and irritates them into quick motions: from whence it is commonly said, the sharpness and sagacity of the minde, doth proceed from the Spleen, and Sple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netick people, are accounted Ingenious: But it is probable, that the rage, and force of the passions, being begun by the Spirits inhabiting the brain, are carried to the spleen, by the passage of the nerves; and so the spirits there dwelling, are pathetically troubled, and the blood flowing thither, is moved into a multitude of perturbations: for from hence it in some measure falls out, that in anger, sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and other distempers of the minde, according as the ferment if the Spleen, being more or less moved, is inspired to the blood, its liquor diversly boyls up: Further, for this reason it happens; that great inflations and Commotions, of the left <hi>hypocondrium,</hi> come upon splenitic people, from every violent passion.</p>
               <p>These things being thus premised, concerning the use of the spleen, it will be easie, according to our <hi>hypothesis,</hi> to lay open very many of the symptoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing <note place="margin">The reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>First, it sometimes happens, that the spongie substance of the spleen, from the faeces of the blood, being too much impacted, in its pores, and stagnating, <note place="margin">The Influences of the Spleen in producing the symptoms unfolded.</note> is very much stuffed, and obstructed: that from thence, it doth not sufficently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the recrements of the bloody mass: but the same being carried thither, but not received do flow back into the neighbouring branches of the Caeliack Artery, from whence they are presently carried, into the membranes of the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, the Caule, the mesenterie, and other nigh parts, and are wont to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to them; hence the tone of those <hi>viscera,</hi> are so much spoyled, that they do not rightly perform their due offices, about the concoction of the Chyle, and the membranes planted every way about, being much imbued with heterogeneous and irritative particles, for that they are almost continually pulled by convulsions here and there stirred up, they are grievously obnoxious to wandring pains, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractiòns, distentions, and the encrease of Windes; by reason of this kinde of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurgitation of the blood, from the Spleen, being obstructed, it is likely, that the pulsation, which is felt by hypochondriacks, under the Ventricle, is excited.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the faeculencies of the blood, are excluded from the Spleens being obstructed, being fixed (as was said) to its neighbouring parts, they bring forth the sickly distemper of the left <hi>hypochondrium:</hi> but though indeed, that Inward sufficently receives the melancholly or atrabilious juice, carried to it from the blood, by the Arteries, yet oftentimes it does not rightly Cook it, but the Salt being too much excited, it changes it into a too sharp, or acid, austeer, or sour; or some other kinde of vitious humour: whereby, when as the whole mass of blood, and the nourishabIe Juice, contained in its bosome, are almo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p n="3">3. From the blood being so depraved, by the fault of the Spleen, oftentimes the taint is carried to the animal government; for heterogeneous and Convulsive Particles, are poured frequently into the brain, and from thence, into the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous stock; so that the animal Spirits, dwelling in either province, conceive various irtegularities: by reason of the evill being impressed on the head, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacks use to be troubled with various phantasms, with an heap, and fluctuations of thoughts: besides, to them happen frequent <hi>Vertigoes,</hi> Scotomies, headaches, and often parlytical Distempers: then, forasmuch as the morbific matter, slides down from the head, into the nervous stock, Convulsive Diseases are excited, in very many parts of the body, but chiefly about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and <hi>Viscera</hi> of the lower belly: for when the Spirits flowing within the nerves, which respect those parts, are greatly disturb'd, by reason of the distemper of the minde, the Convulsive particles, the more readily enter into those pipes, and more easily impress on those Spirits, a Convulsive Disposition: Therefore, partly by reason of the infection mediatly transmitted to the Brain, and partly by reason of the hurt, (as hath been shown) immediatly Communicated from the Spleen, the Palpitation of the heart, trembling, and frequent swooning, Constrictions of the Breast, impediments of breathing, Pains of the stomach, belching, Vomiting, and many other accidents in those Inwards, happen to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriacks.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Besides these inordinations, which are wont to be derived by the passage of the blood, from the Spleen; into the humours and sollid parts, and to the brain it self, and nervous stock; there are other farther evills, which seem to arise from this Inward, also by the passage of the nerves: Because, as we have shown, their extreme branches, and the nervous <hi>fibres</hi> themselves, interwoven in the <hi>Viscera,</hi> do drink in with their outward most little mouths, a certain hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, and convey it sometimes upwards, it is highly probable, that the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> distributed to the Spleen, (of which as we but now hinted, there is a mighty Guard) do receive its most sharp juice, which Creeping higher, thorow the nervous pipes, becomes a Cause of Convulsive motions: In truth, that there may be those intimate Commerces, between the brain, and theSpleen, to wit, far sooner, than what can be made, by the compassing about of the blood, it may be lawfull to believe, that the nerves of the wandring pair, and the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>costal, to be the neerest means of the passage, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ereby these parts Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate one with the other, and mutually affect themselves. For it seems, that when the black bile or melanchollic tumor in the Spleen, grows turgid or swells up of its own accord, or is moved by some evident cause, its particles enter the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> thickly distributed to the same, which disturb the animal Spirits flowing in them, into explosions, or at least into some disorder: then the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being so distrubed, infect those next to them, and they others, till by their continued series, the passion begun within the Spleen, is propagated even to the brain, and there produces inordinate Phantasms, such as happen to hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacks, also on the other side, when a grievous distemper of the minde, occasionally excited, within the brain, doth disturb the Spirits inhabiting it, the impression being carried to the Phantasie, by the series of the Spirits, planted within the nerves of the wandring pair, and the Intercostals, and successive af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, it is brought even to the Spleen; hence its ferment being put more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to commotion, stirs up Convulsions, both in that Inward, and in the whole neighbourhood of fibres and membranes; and besides, forces the blood into eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bings and flowings, and into various aestuations or vehement motions; yea and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects the perturbations of the Spirits, upon the brain. From this kinde of reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal affection of the brain and Spleen, it comes to pass, that hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acks are so unquiet, unstable, and fluctuating, at every thing thats proposed, as if, according to the Poet, Ten mindes strove in them at once.</p>

trembling of the heart, of an assiduous vertigo, too much waking, and a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed phansie: About the 35th. year of his age, the disease growing worse, he began hardly to sleep, and yet more rarely to get it at night, and to be molested in the day time, with a world of fluctuating thoughts, to have in suspition all things and persons, and greatly to be afraid of every object: his <hi>Praecordia</hi> seemed to be very much bound, and straitened, and to sink down to the bottom, as if the heart it self were depressed even into the belly; which Symptom, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him, he became very sad, and dejected in minde: yet afterwards, those distempers of the minde remitting, he felt with it his heart to be a little lifted up and also his <hi>Praecordia</hi> to be loosened, and stretch'd forth; besides, he very often sustained pains and Contractions variously excited, about the muscles of the <hi>Viscera,</hi> and Members, and running up and down here and there.</p>
               <p>As to the nature of the disease, it is plain, that it is this kinde of Distemper, which is commonly called hypochondriacall: but as to what respects the Causes of these to be admired Symptoms, we may suppose, the mass of blood being degenerate, and stuffed with melanchollic or atrabilarie faeculencies, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister or continually to suggest its adust recrements to the head; from whence, the Liquor watering the brain and nerves, being made sharp, and improporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to the Spirits, did stir up the containing Bodies, into painfull Corrugati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or wrinklings, and Contractures: Further, when this Infection is chiefly derived from the head, into the Nerves of the wandring pair; and the intercostall, the brain and the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> are very much punished, by the malady from thence raised up. But that the Blood is depraved by that means, it seems to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the vice of the Spleen, forasmuch as this Inward, being amiss, it did not rightly strain forth the atrabilarie dreggs from the blood, but rather did more pervert whatsoever recrements it received from it, and the same being exalted into an hurtfull ferment, sent it back to the blood, and so very much infected its mass, and imbued it with a plainly acetous, and vitriolick evill Disposition.</p>
               <p>It is plain to be understood, that those symptoms troubling the Head, <hi>viz.</hi> too much waking, the <hi>vertigo,</hi> a disturbed phantasie, with many others, did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the heterogeneous particles poured forth from the Blood, into the brain: As to that straitness of the Breast, and falling down of the heart, with great fear and sadness, it may be thought, that the nervous <hi>fibres,</hi> inserted to the heart, and chiefly to the <hi>Pericordium,</hi> being moved into Convulsions, and wrinklings, do binde hard those parts, and pull them downwards; wherefore, there is perceived in the whole breast, as it were a certain constriction, and the heart it self seems to be depressed: Further, forasmuch the <hi>Praecordia</hi> being so streitened and depressed, the blood within the bosom of the heart is stop'd, and compell'd, as it were to stagnate, both the vital and the sensitive Soul, is much hindred, from its wonted expansion and irradiation, and for that Cause, being lessened and shortened in its constitution, those Cruell distempers of fear and sadness arise, but when the Convulsions remitting, that constriction of the heart and its <hi>appendix,</hi> is released, the Soul also, as a flame more expansed or enlarged, endeavours by little and little to shake off the Chains of those Passions. For the Cure of these Distempers, he had for a long time tried very many remedies, and medical Administrations, but without much benifit, at last he was somewhat ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the use of Spaw-waters, and from thence by degrees finding himself bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he became free from those grievous Symptoms, however, he still liv'd ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the <hi>hypochondriac</hi> Distemper.</p>
               <p>A Certain young Academic, originally of a Sanguine temper, fair, of a flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing Countenance, excellent disposition, and mild, by reason of immoderate <note place="margin">2. Observation.</note> and untimely Studies, in the mean time exercise, and good order of dyet being wholly neglected, had contracted an obstruction of the Spleen, or some other morbid distemper of that Inward: For he had almost continually infesting him, an inflation, and tumor of the left <hi>hypochondrium,</hi> with a most heavy <hi>Pain.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had laboured with this sort of Distemper, about half a year, he began to complain of a frequent giddiness, a blindness of his eyes, an unquietness of his minde, and of disturbed sleeps: Which Symptoms were then piainly impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to vapours arising from the Spleen: but after that followed, a trembling of the heart, with a frequent <hi>deliquium</hi> of the Spirits, a pulsation of the <hi>hypochondri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and at length pains, and Contractions in the outward members, with a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent

stupor, and a sense of pricking running up and down here and there: and last of all, being broken with a world of evills, contrary to his <hi>genius,</hi> and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Disposition, he became greatly hypochondriacall.</p>
               <p>That I may dispatch the Pathologie of this Case in a word, it appears here plain enough, that the Spleen was first of all in fault; by whose fault, when the bloody mass was depraved, the taint creeping from thence, into the humour wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the brain and nervous stock, and infecting it, did induce the aforesaid Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive Symptoms.</p>

Secondly, it must be endeavour'd that the obstructions of the Spleen, may be Corrected. Thirdly, that both the recrements of the bloody mass may be purged forth, and that its due disposition may be restored. Fourthly, and lastly, that the enormities of the brain and nervous stock, and also of the watering humour, and the inhabiting Spirits, contracted by the fault of the blood, and Spleen, may be amended, or taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: when any of these Intentions, or all of them together, shall be endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured at, fit times should be chosen, in which each being singly proposed, may be performed, without any neglect or hindrance of the rest.</p>
               <p n="8">8. As to the first Indication, when a great load of crude or adust matter, is wont to be laid up in the first passages, and when the tone of the Ventricle us'd to be spoyled, and its ferment variously perverted, against every one of these kindes of evills, you must bring timely help, with fit remedies; therefore, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle and moderate evacuations, both by Vomit if it prospers well, and by Stool, ought to be administred: For such, whose stomach easily casts forth its contents upw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Among the number of these kinds of medicines, (which are commonly called Digestives) are <hi>Elixir Proprietatis, Tinctura Sacra, powder of Aron</hi> Compound, <hi>Salt of Wormwood, Cream of Tartar, Tartar vitriolat,, Vitriol of Steel,</hi> with many others. Besides these inward Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, also external applications do often bring help: Because the Stomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill affected, a fomentation of <hi>white-wine,</hi> with <hi>wormwood, century,</hi> and other bitter plants boyled therein, also oyntments, or plaisters, often bring help: Concerning which, there will be no need here to discourse particularly; and to prescribe forms of the Medicines themselves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Indication, for the mending the vices of the Spleen, (to wit, if there shall be in the same any obstruction, Tumour, or pain, or simple dyscra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie or Intemperament,) is wont to be performed, or at least attempted, by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies both internal, and exrernal: Those which are of the former Sort, fall in with those indicated in the 3d place, (to wit, with such, as for the purifying the Blood is intended) because, when chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

In the mean time, some external Applications, under the form of a plaister; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

of the Spleen, and often bring notable help, forasmuch as they discuss tumors, and allay the Convulsive Distempers, and quiet them. Great plenty of these kinde of outward medicines, are every where extant among Authors, the choyce of which ought to be made, according to the various passions of the Spleen, or the divers Constitutions of the Patient, so that there will be no need here, to shew their particular forms.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Remedies indicated in the 3d place, to wit, which take away the dys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crasies or evill temper of the blood, contracted from the vice of the Spleen, and also clear the primary fault of the Spleen, are of a manifold, and divers kinde, and manner, the choice of which ought to be administred, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious infection of this, or that: of these, some are compounded, and prepared according to the prescription of Physitians, as <hi>Electuaries, Powders, Apozems, Tinstures, Infusions,</hi> and the like; others more simple, as <hi>whey, asses milk, Spaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waters,</hi> and <hi>Bathes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are two chief Cases of sick people, in which magisterial Remedies ought to be all accommodated, according to their strength and quallities: to wit, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the blood is thick, coldish, and earthy, with the Spleen being obstructed, which requires more hot, fermenting, and chiefly Chalybiate medicines; or the blood being clearly adust, and hot, ferments too much, and together greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the <hi>hypochondria,</hi> and in them, the blood and humours boyl up; in which state, Remedies only temperate, and allaying the fermenting, and immoderate boyling of the humours, are to be chosen, where chalibiats are wholly to be avoided.</p>
               <p>When therefore to a cold ventricle, cold discrasies or evill temperaments, of the blood and Spleen also happen, I am wont to prescribe, according to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing forms.</p>

               </p>
               <p>For those who are not pleas'd, but with medicines in an elegant form, and in a very little quantity, the tinctures of <hi>Antimony,</hi> and of <hi>Corrall,</hi> also of <hi>Steel,</hi> with the <hi>Spirit of wine,</hi> (the body being first dissolved by a proper <hi>menstrum,</hi> and redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to a <hi>Calx)</hi> are convenient: as aso the <hi>Spirits of Sut,</hi> of <hi>blood,</hi> or of <hi>harts-horn,</hi> to be taken twice a day, with a proper liquor, to 12. drops, more or less, are of known benefit, above any other medicine that I know of: moreover the often drinking of <hi>Coffee,</hi> also that made of the Infusion of the leaves of <hi>Thea,</hi> gives ease to some.</p>
               <p>If that the fervor of the blood, and too fermenting, with the trouble of the Spleen, and unquietness of the minde, be joyned to the hypochondriac Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>

use of Spaw-waters, which indeed, in either, yea, in all cases, of hypochondriac Melancholly, are almost always taken with good success: For want of those wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, our artificiall Spaw-waters, may be conveniently ordered, yea, and whey, and if any notable atrophie be, let Asses milk be dayly taken.</p>
               <p>Besides, these inward Remedies, and other outward Applications, before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recited, <hi>Phlebotomie,</hi> or the taking away of blood with Leeches, from the sedal veines, may be of use frequently: yea, sometimes it may be convenient, to open the Salvatella Vein, according to the prescript of the Ancients: Besides Caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, or Issues, which may continually carry forth the adust recrements of the blood, and by degrees excern them, are wont to be benificiall almost to all.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Indication, respecting the affections of the brain, and nervous stock, or the Convulsive Symptoms having relation to or coming upon the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is rarely in use of it self, and apart from the others, but that Remedies de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated to this end, are complicated with those abovesaid. Liquors indued with a volatile Salt, or an armoniac, as <hi>Spirits of Harts-horn,</hi> and <hi>Sut,</hi> are highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for this Intention, as also the rest but now recitied; wherefore such Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, unless any thing shall shew the contrary, may be dayly given at fit hours. Further, when Spaw-waters are drunk, let tablets or pills, such as are above-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, for the Convulsive distempers, be taken at least twice in a day. In the frequent turning, and giddiness, also in the passions of the heart, the sinking down of the Spirits, with dread, and as it were a fear of Death, just seizing on one, I have known very often, great help to be had, by the use of Chalibeat, or steel Medicines.</p>
               <p>Since we have made mention so often, of Chalibiat or steel-medicins, it will be worth our while, to inquire into their various preparations, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">The preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and effects of Steel Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines unfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</note> their divers manners of effects, which they are wont to produce in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane body, that it may from hence appear, by what means, and for what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, these or those preparations of Iron, are greatly profitable to some hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriacks, and to others as much hurtfull.</p>
               <p>The virtue and operation of Chalybeat, or steel'd mecicines, depends upon the porticles of the concerts, being after a various manner dissolved, unfolded, and brought forth into act: For steel, or Iron, consists chiefly of a <hi>Salt Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Earth:</hi> and but slenderly indued with Spirits and water: But the particles of the former Elements, chiefly the Sulphureous, and saline, being in their mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture combined together, with the Earth, remain altogether fixed, and sluggish, but being soluted, and pulled one from another, they come to be of a very effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Energy.</p>
               <p>The aforesaid particles are dissolved in a twofold manner, and set into the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of acting: <hi>viz.</hi> either by Art, whilst medicins are prepared, or by Nature after they are taken inwardly; for the metallic Body, is wont to be dissolved, and eaten, by the ferment of the ventricle, just like a Chymical <hi>menstrum:</hi> we will consider the several <hi>Species</hi> of either, and their manner of being made, that it may appear, what alteration is impressed, on the steeled medicine, in the preparation; and what effects every preparation of it, doth impresse on mans Body.</p>
               <p>The most simple way of preparing Iron, is a division of its body, into little integral parts, with a file, which resemble the nature of the whole mixture, and contain both little sulpureous bodies, and saline, combined among themselves, and with other terrestrial. The filings of Iron being inwardly taken, is dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the ferment of the ventricle, as it were by an acid <hi>menstrum;</hi> the signes of which are, both a sulphureous and unsavorie belching, as from the eating of hard eggs, also the blackness of the ordure, from steel being dissolved within the <hi>Viscera</hi> of Concoction, active particles, both Sulphureous and Saline, Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully sally forth, and being involved with the nutritious juice, are carried into the blood; which as they excell in a divers virtue, do often conspire, as it were with the joynt forces of either, to bring benefit to the sick. The Sulphureous little bodies being brought to the blood, add to it a new, and more plentifull Provision of Sulphur, wherefore its mass, if before it was poor and liveless, doth nimbly ferment within its vessells, and being inkindled farther in the heart, acquires a more intense heat, yea, and a deeper colour; for it is so observed, in many affected with the dropsy, arising from white phlegm, the Pica or evill

                  </gap>; but by the use of steel, the countenance soon to be more florid, and the blood to be imbued with a more intense tincture, and heat: moreover, from the filing of Iron, dissolved in the ventricle, also Saline particles are brought forth, and often they bestow a more plentifull fruit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r increase, both on the solid parts, and on the humors; for since their natures are vitriolick, and stiptic or binding, they bind together and strengthen the too lax, and weakned <hi>fibres</hi> of the <hi>Viscera,</hi> and so restore the broken tone: Besides these Saline particles, inhibit the force of the blood; repress it from too much heat, and boyling up, and froth, and retain it in an equall circulation: Besides (which is their chief virtue) they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and straiten the too loose, open, and gaping little mouths of the Arteries; that, for that reason, neither the <hi>Serum,</hi> nor the bloody <hi>latex,</hi> may sweat out, or be broke off, from the file of its circuit: Wherefore in the Dropsie, and great bleedings, Remedies, imbued with the Saline particles of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ron, are of famous and efficacious use, for very many Diseases proceed from this cause, forasmuch as the little mouths of the Arteries, being too open, and the interspaces of the vessells above measure loosned, the <hi>serum</hi> or bloody <hi>latex</hi> breaks forth; which kinde of Affections, the Vitriollic Particles of Steel, do often help, by binding and corroborating, the sanguiferous Vessells, and nervous <hi>fibres.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this manner, the <hi>filings of Steel,</hi> being taken inwardly, seems at once to add to the blood, both spurs, and a bridle. But forasmuch, as from this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, an incitation, much more than a restriction, doth arise, therefore it ought to be given only to them, whose blood is very thick, and cold, as country peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and strong persons; in very hot, and spirituous bloud, and in hot inwards, 'tis no ways convenient: moreover, in delicate persons, and men of a more tender constitution, 'tis dangerous, lest the little portions of the steel, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sufficiently dissolved, should like fragments of glass, be driven into the membranes of the <hi>Viscera,</hi> and there pertinaciously sticking, produce some ulcer, or deadly torments, which indeed I have known sometimes to happen.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After the filing of Iron, the next way of preparing it, is calcining it with Sulphur, to wit, let thin peeces of steel, being strongly fired, be laid upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> roler of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that the mettle may melt into little round balls, which are to be calcined to the consumption of the Sulphur, and pounded in a morter, are to be reduced into a subtle powder, which is of choice use. In this preparation of Iron, some sulphureous particles are exhaled, the signe of which is, that this powder, an acid liquor being poured upon it, much less boyls up, or grows hot than the limature or filing of Iron: but being taken by the same mouth, it excites a Sulphureons savour. In the mean time, in this preparation, the saline parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, seem to be somewhat augmented, by new ones sticking to them, from the mettall burning with Sulphur, so that active particles of either kinde, to wit, Sulphureous and Saline, come almost to an <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>quilibrium:</hi> and when by this means, this medicine, the substance of the mettle being loosned, may be finely poudered, it becomes of far more excellent use, than the filings ef Iron: In most Cases, where steel ought to be given in substance, as in a Cachexie or a fullness of evill humours, the longings of maids or the green-gckness, and such Iike, this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is convenient to be used.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the third place, follows the preparation of steel with vinegar: to wit, the filings of the whole steel, is moysten'd with vinegar, and dryed, till it may be reduced into an impalpable powder: in this preparation, the Sulphureous particles are yet much more, yea, as to the greatest part evaporated, only a few being left, in the mean time, the Saline, by reason of others sticking to them, from the vinegar, are much encreased, which are mingled with the terrene particles: This chalibiated powder, very little or nothing froths, or boyles up, a sharp liquor being sprinkled upon it, also being taken at the mouth, has with it scarce any sulphureous Savour: wherefore, it conduces less, to the taking away of the obstructions of the Bowells, or to the restoring the ferment of the blood: nevertheless, in a more hot Constitution, in hemorrhages or fluxes of Blood, and the hypochondriac Distemper, it is wont to be administred with greater success, then the former preparations.</p>
               <p>4ly. Follows the rust of Iron, which being an extract of the metallic body, seems to be as it were a fifth Effence: because, in this excrescency, some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106699:53"/>
of every kinde, to wit, sulphureous, saline, and terrene, being loosned from the whole substance, are combined among themselves; and constitute as it were a new mixture, more subtile, and defaecated or clearer from dreggs: For that in this concrete, there remains less particles of sulphur, therefore it doth not so potently ferment the blood, or take away the obstructions of the <hi>Viscera,</hi> as steel prepared with sulphur; but in more hot distempers of the parts, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, it egregiously performs the requisite Intentions, of a steeled Medicine.</p>
               <p>To this Class may be referred by right, our preparation of steel, to wit, in which all the particles of the mettal, being loosned from the bond of mixture, are contained together: which notwithstanding, (the concrete being first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into pouder) and immediatly dissolved, in any water or Menstruum. This powder being inwardly taken hath the like vertue as steel prepared with sulphur; but to the liquor or menstruum, in which it is dissolved, it imparts almost only saline, or chiefly vitriolic particles, the sulphureous flying away, and the terene sinking to the bottom. I am wont to give in great quantity, and not seldom with excellent success, common water impregnated with the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, instead of the natural acidulous or spawish waters: moreover, I make thereof medicated wine, beer, cyder, whey, or other Liquors, this pouder being dissolved in them; and prescribe them to be taken, for several intricate Intentions: So much for the preparations of Iron, in which the elementary par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of every kinde, are comprehended in a various proportion: There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main others, in which the particles almost only of one kinde, to wit, the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line, or earthie, are left, the rest, as to the greatest part, being driven forth: of which sort, are chiefly vitriol, or the Salt of steel.</p>
               <p n="5">5. For the making the vitriol of steel, first, the mettal is wont to be eaten thorow, with a very sharp and corrosive Liquor, and to be dissolved into ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary parts: In the dissolving, the saline particles of the menstruum, are joyned to the other salines of the Iron, and are with them intimately combined; in the mean time, the remaining sulphureous, and terrene, being laid aside, and excluded from their company; then common water being poured to this soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the salts of either kinde being combined, are imbibed by the Liquor, and that being lastly filtrated, and evaporated, they are reduced into christalls. This kinde of making of salt or salification, succedes, if you do it, either with the Spirit of vitriol, the oyle of sulphur, or stygian water, or any others, distilled from the stagmas of mineralls: Yea, <hi>Sal Armoniac</hi> only, being soluted by melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diffolves Iron after the same manner, and causes it to Chrystalize.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Salt of Steel</hi> thus prepared, hath a sweetish taste, with a certain sharp stipticity or binding, and participates much of the nature of <hi>vitriol,</hi> that it seems not to differ much from Verdigrease. Taken inwardly for a medicine, it somewhat ferments the humors, and powerfully bindes the nervous <hi>fibres:</hi> for cold Cache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cical, and Phlegmatic people, this medicine is not convenient, because there are in it no particles of <hi>Sulphur:</hi> but it is often administred with successe, in hot distempers of the bowels, where there is a predominancy of adust <hi>Sulphur</hi> and in wandring effervescencies, in scorbutical, and unequall heats, both of the blood and nervous stock, by it self, or mixed with other medicines, as an enforcement: but yet in more tender Constitutions, 'tis dangerous, lest the tone and <hi>fibres</hi> of the ventricle should be hurt, by its acrimouy, and too great constriction or astringency.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In the last place, follows the astringent <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> or the <hi>Crocus of Steel,</hi> prepared by fire, through a long Calcination, <hi>viz.</hi> The filings, the off-scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or thin plates of Iron, should be so placed in a reverberating for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ace, that they may be continually heated, by a most strong flame: The filing being thus exposed to the naked fire; first of all it grows reddish, and runs together into little hard round balls; but after 3. or 4. days, swelling up suddenly into an higher heap, it becomes extream light, impalpable, and of a most curious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Colour: In this preparation, the Sulphureous and saline particles, whilst by the force of the fire, they begin to come away from the concreet, do mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally take hold one of another, and so being combined together, grow into little balls; but afterwards, those particles, both Saline and Sulphureous, being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly profligated, and fiery particles succeeding in their place, the whole mass swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up into a bulk, and made as it were spungie, becomes most light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:106699:54"/>
A Medicine thus prepared, in some Cases, is of most excellent use, and second to none of the Chalybeats: to wit, almost in all extravasations, or too great eruptions of the <hi>Serum</hi> and blood, as in outward <hi>haemorrhages,</hi> or in inward bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in the <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> the <hi>Diabatis,</hi> and in a vehement Catarrh; also I have known no remedy better than this, in the <hi>Ascitis,</hi> or in the beginning of a Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie: and this also, I have heard to be highly approved of lately by a most famous and expert Physitian, of our own Country: Concerning which medicine notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, since it is wholly destitute, both of Saline and sulphureous Particles, and consists almost only of earthIy and fiery particles, it is very ambiguous, by what faculty it operates, and produces so praise-worthy an effect in man's body; for there seems to be in this, left no more <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> or dead head, or <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra damnata,</hi> then in vitriol, or in any of the other mettalls, distilled be a most intense fire. As to this if I may Conjecture, it seems first, that to this prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, some Activity is due, whereby it exerts it self, and unfolds its virtues, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by shutting up obstructions, or by binding together the Vessells, or ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous <hi>fibres</hi> of the <hi>Viscera,</hi> from the fiery particles, shut up in the most fixed earth, and from them breaking forth within the body: But the chiefest reason of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing consists in this, that the earthy particles, the Saline (by which they were strickly held) being wholly gone, desire greedily to be reunited to them, or such like: Wherefore, this <hi>Crocus martis,</hi> being immersed in our Bodies, snatches to it self, whatsoever Salts it meets with, and intimately binds them, and so, while it sucks up like a sponge, very many saline particIes, it takes away many enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, arising chiefly from the flux of the Salts. By this means, <hi>Burnt harts-horn, Spodium,</hi> and <hi>Antimony Diaphoretic,</hi> when they bring help exert or put forth their virtues.</p>

               <p>THe history before related, doth clearly manifest, that sometimes a Cough may be caused, without any great fault of the Lungs, by reason of the sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <note place="margin">An example of a Cough meerly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulsive.</note> down of the morbific matter, upon the pneumon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ck nerves, or those be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to respiration: to wit, where it was shown, in the Case of the noble Virgin, labouring with Convulsive fits, and also with a grievous and continual giddiness, that, when by the prescript of the Physitian, a fomentation of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalic Decoction, was applyed to her head, presently the Giddiness ceas'd, and in its place follow'd a great Cough, without any Spitting, but night and day, almost perpetually troubling her: which without doubt hapned, by reason of the Convulsive matter, being driven from the brain, into the beginnings of the nerves: This kinde of example, of a Cough meerly Convulsive, more rarely happens, in persons of ripe years, as the like distemper I have not often seen: But in children 'tis usual, (also sometimes I have known it in Men) for a cough <note place="margin">This distemper frequent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</note> to arise, from a serous Colluvies overflowing the Lungs: which, when at first it was Simple, and moderate, afterwards it became vehement, and Convulsive; so that in Coughing the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> being drawn upwards, and held in a long <hi>Systole,</hi> or frequently repeated, the Lungs being greatly straitned, were much hindred in their motion. In the mean time, by reason of the breathing being hindred, and the blood being restrained within the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> and for that cause stagnating in other places, the sick were in danger of being choaked, and often acquired a livid, or dead countenance. But in this Case, besides the Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raised up about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> by the force of Coughing, the Ventricle also, being often brought Into a consent, cast forth by vomit, whatever it contained in its bosom: yea, and I know in some tender ones, after this manner affected, the Disease wandring from thence into other parts, did raise up Convulsive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Face, eyes, and limbs, and at length became deadly. This kinde of Convulsive Cough is very frequent among children, and some years lays hold
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:106699:54"/>
on so many, that it seems to be plainly Epidemical; when it roots it self, it is very difficult to be cured, by Remedies, yea often being long protracted, it is hardly otherwise to be cured, but by the state of the year being changed.</p>
               <p>If the causes of the aforesaid Case be inquired into, it will be so plain, to refer the procatartic or more remote cause, to the redundancy of the Serous humour <note place="margin">The reason of it.</note> in the bloody mass, and in some sort in the whole body; a portion of which mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, dropping forth from the little mouths of the Arteries, on the Lungs, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the ordinary Cough; afterwards, when the serous Colluvies or heap of waters yet exuberateing in the Blood, and stuffed with Convulsive particles, is also heaped up within the head, the same entring the pneumonic nerves, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases the simple, into a Convulsive Cough: For when those nerves, being irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated first about their extremities, are exe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

                  </gap>er, laid up nigh their beginnings: and so, when at length, they are driven into irregular motions, in two places, to wit, in the head, and at the tale, and that for two distinct causes, <hi>viz.</hi> from the irritation of the Spirits, and from their explosion; it is no wonder, if the Cough, at first Common, being afterwards brought into this evill state, becomes so cruel and Convulsive: Moreover, when it sometimes happens, that the same matter, heaped up in the head, does enter some other nerve, therefore Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive passions of another manner, often come upon the Convulsive Cough.</p>
               <p>Having shown after this manner, that a cough doth arise, not only, nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by the fault of the Lungs, but sometimes from a solitary Convulsive cause, <note place="margin">The Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Asthma.</note> but oftener superinduced by this, on a pneumatic Distemper: also we do not doubt to determine almost the same thing, concerning another certain Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Asthma:</hi> For whether this Disease be continuall, or periodical, in either Case, the Symptom chiefly urging, is difficult Breathing; which indeed seems to be excited for this reason, because the Lungs being too <note place="margin">Sometimes i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> depends of the Lungs, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the nerves being affected.</note> much inflated, and distended, extremely fills the Cavity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> neither do they fall down as they should do, by turns: hence the Spirit or breath remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within, is not sent forth freely enough, neither indeed can fresh aire be easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly induced, by reason the space is before filled: whilest the Lungs are so longer contained in a continual, or very little remiss Diastole, oftentimes the <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phragma,</hi> is urged contrary to its manner, into a violent Systole, and being drawn upwards, is wont more and more to lift up the Lungs, and to hinder their fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down; whereby it comes to pass, that respiration becoms yet more difficult, and more laborious.</p>
               <p>We easily believe, that this kinde of hard breathing Distemper, doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happen by the fault of the Lungs, because anatomical Inspection hath plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detected it: For if a great Serous Colluvies, being layd up in the <hi>Thorax,</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much stuffs the Lungs, and so much obstructs all their pores and passages, that the blood being hindred in its Circute, cannot freely pass thorow the Pneumonic Vessells, for that reason indeed, such like anhelous Distempers are sometimes made: Then, as often as the blood growing more hot and rarified, by exercise or the heat of the Bed, requires a larger space for its Circulation, within the Lungs; then presently from such an occasion, a more frequent Respiration, or an asthmatical fit is stirred up: If beside this morbid Disposition of the Breast, the Sanguineous mass, also abounding with a serous water, should be apt to sudden fluxions and effervescencies of the Serum, from hence also, by reason of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent course of the Serum growing hot, into the Lungs, being before obstructed, and greatly filled, very often most grievous assaults of this Disease, and almost suffocating do happen. Moreover, sometimes, beside, the roots of the asthma (as it is said) being fixed about the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> certain shoots of the same disease, budding forth from the head, meet with the former, and being complicated with them, produce the more cruel fruits of the <hi>Dyspnaea,</hi> or want of Breath. For, because the Lungs being stuffed with <hi>Serum,</hi> another quantity of the same, more largely redounding in the blood, being imbued with Convulsive particles, is poured on the head, the same more readily entring the pneumonic nerves, than others, causes the <hi>Asthma</hi> of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> at first Simple and modetate, to become periodically vehement, and Convulsive.</p>
               <p>Of these kinde of Distempers, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Dyspnaea,</hi> being excited by the singular fault of the Lungs, and with a Companion, very many instances, and examples

have fallen under our observation, and do almost dayly happen. For there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more usual, then for those that are sick of an inveterate cough, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evill disposition of the Lungs, at length the Dropsie, or Scurvie hapning to become Asthmatick, to wit, when the Blood being made much more impure, lays up also its serous dreggs in the head, these more readily, and indeed more easily enter then others, the pneumonic nerves, as being weaker, and often ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritated neer their extremities, and in them do heap up matter, for a Convulsive <hi>Dyspnaea.</hi>

As I have observed this kinde of <hi>Dyspnaea</hi> or difficult breathing meerly Convulsive, to have hapned in many, I will here shew you one or two histories of it.</p>
               <p>A certain strong and fat Gentleman, having used for some time a more full and inordinate Diet, without any exercise, began to be ill about the beginning of the winter: at first he was troubled with a pain and heaviness of his head, with a grear giddiness, and fear of swoonding, and believing himself just about to dye, being otherways healthfull; within a few days, these Symptoms pass'd into an apparent <hi>Stupor,</hi> or rather Lethargie: he being let blood in his Arm, I caused carefully to be applied Cupping-glasses, Vesicatories, and sharp Ciysters, with many other Remedies: In the space of 42. hours coming to himself, he was sensible, and shook off all torpor or drousiness. But although his brain was clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet he was taken with a great weakness, and numbness in his members which Distempers however were shortly cured, with antiparyletic and antiscorbutic Remedies: But after a sortnight, he began again to complain of an heaviness and giddiness in his head, then the next day after, he fell into a horrid <hi>Asthma:</hi> that the Lungs being suddenly inflated, and endeavouring to come upwards, the Breath, which was very quick and laborious, was hindred, and not being able to come forth, he was in danger every minute of an hour to be choaked. This fit as it was cruel, so it pass'd over within 12. hours, without any spitting, cough, or vomit, and then, within a weeks space, he lost all the trouble of his breast; but then the like fit of the <hi>Dyspnaea</hi> or difficult breathing returning, exercis'd him somewhat more gently; and afterwards, he was wont to be troubled with such a fit of the <hi>Asthma,</hi> nigh to the great mutations of the Air, chiefly in great cold, or the falling of Snow.</p>
               <p>I knew another Gentleman, sick of an inveterate Scurvy, who having no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Cough, was troubled now with a great head-ach, and for many days with <note place="margin">2. <hi>Observation.</hi>

               <p>It is not to be doubted, but in the aforesaid Cases, those fits of the <hi>Asthma</hi> did wholly depend, on the Convulsive matter, being fallen into the nerves, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <note place="margin">The Reason.</note> to the stretching forth of the Lungs, which cleaving to the Spirits, and being by them struct off, or explosed, by reason of plentitude or irritation, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>Praecordia</hi> to be lifted uywards, and as it were inflated, and by that means hindred, from its reciprocal motion.</p>
               <p>Moreover, we suppose, that such a kinde of Convulsive <hi>Dyspnaea</hi> or difficult <note place="margin">An Asthma sometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citeed by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Bronchia <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

that they, being possessed by the morbific matter, should be irritated into frequent Convulsions, for that reason it follows, that the channells or passages which they compass about, must be greatly bound together, and in some places wholly shut up.</p>
               <p>There was a very choyce Virgin, of a tender constitution, and of a flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countenance, scarce past the second lustre of her Age, <hi>(i e.</hi> about 12. years <note place="margin">3 <hi>Observation.</hi>

This kinde of fit by degrees remitting, within 7 or 8. hours, at length gave over; but then after a week or two, it was wont to come again, either of it self, or from any the least occasion; after that the force of the Disease, its matter being bestow'd on very many of these kinde of fits, pass'd away, this excellent virgin was well enough for many weeks, yea sometimes months after, and breath'd freely, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fault of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> For this person, I instituted this following method, Spring and fall, and now it is more than two years, since she has had any fit of this Distemper.</p>

               <p>About the Autumn of the last year, another noble Virgin, being sick after the same manner, <hi>viz.</hi> with a Periodical <hi>Asthma,</hi> I was sent for to cure her, <note place="margin">4. <hi>Observation.</hi>
                  </note> who received great help by the aforesaid Remedies, being used in a little lesser dose, and the same repeated at the first of the Spring.</p>
               <p>In these Cases also, nothing seems to appear more clearly, than that the cause of the Disease, without any phlegm or viscous humour, being impacted in the Lungs, as is commonly beleeved, doth subsist within the nervous stock; and that this kind of <hi>Dyspnaea</hi> or difficult breathing, meerly convulsive, is excited, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Pneumonic nervs, being possessed by the Convulsive Distemper. The verity of this may be yet more clearly evinced, by an anatomical observation, lately Comunicated to me, by the learned Physitian Doctor <hi>Walter Needham.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">An Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calObservation</note> That most famous man told me, that he knew a Butcher of <hi>Wàllsallen</hi> in the County of <hi>Stafford,</hi> who when he had been long sick of a periodica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Asthma,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning within 14. or 20 days at farthest, at length he dyed in a fit. The Body being opened, all his <hi>Viscera</hi> appeared sound, chiefly his Lungs, neither were there to be seen any signes, either of excrement gathered together in the <hi>Bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia,</hi> or of the blood restagnating in the veins; this only hapned besides nature, that the bladder of the gall; contained in it many stones. But (added he) the causes unknown to us, certainly not Conspicuous to our eyes, were to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the nervous stock being affected.</p>
               <p>Sometime past I was consulted with, about a noble child, who being about 12. months old, was grieviously afflicted with Convulsion fits, and as it were E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pileptic, <note place="margin">Anoiher Anatomical Observation.</note> of which he quickly dyed. I often observed, that whilest the Convulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the outward parts intermitted, he was taken with a cruel sobbing, or hooping Cough: from whence I suspected, that the morbific matter, was no less fixed in the breast, than in the brain. But after its Death, the body being open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Lungs well furnish'd, appeared clear from any fault, that it clearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:106699:56"/>
that this cough meerly Convulsive, was excited by reason of the Distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the nervous stock.</p>
               <p>As to what respects the Remedies, and curatory means, which ought to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the aforesaid cases, when that convulsive Symptoms come upon the Cough, or difficulty of breathing, first excited from the default of the Lungs, and so by reason of the taint, communicated to the brain; it must be carefully heeded, that Convulsive medicines be aptly compounded, with those respecting all the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Thorax.</hi> Yea that sometimes these, sometimes those, being given by themselves, may between whiles fill up the times of curing, it will not be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in this place, to bring the bechic, or Pneumonic medicines, and forms of them, since an immense company of them, are extant every where, among Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Authors. It will be sufficient for our purpose, to add a method of medicine, also some more select Remedies, convenient for the Cough, and <hi>Asthma,</hi> meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Convulsive.</p>
               <p>As to the former Distemper, which is most familiar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>o children, the cure is difficult, and for the most part not to be performed, but of a long time. The <note place="margin">The cure of the Convulsive Cough.</note> chief Indications, will be to purge forth, both the serous and sharp humours, from the blood and <hi>Viscera,</hi> that their inclination and falling down in the brain, and perhaps also within the breast, may be sometimes prevented; then to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roberate those parts that they may not easily admit the superfluities, of the boyling Serum. For these ends, vomits and more gentle purges, for the most part are usefull, and in some measure ought to be repeated: Vesecatories are often profitable; yea, if the Disease be contumacious, Issues are to be made in the nape of the neck, or the arm, or about the Armpits. Drink and liquid ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are to be taken in a lesser quantity, than usual, and in stead of them, a Bochet is to be used, of <hi>Sarsa, China, Sanders, Shavings of Ivory,</hi> and <hi>harts-horn,</hi> with diuretic, and anticonvulsive Ingredients: In this Case, some remedies as it were special, are greatly commended, of which sort are pixed musk, given in powder, or boyled in milk, and so given dayly in a frequent dose: a decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or <hi>Syrrop of Cast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

For by such like Remedies, the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of the <hi>Serum,</hi> are deduced from the head, and nervous stock, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, thorow the urinary passages: For the same reason, a gentIe purge, eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating the ill juice, is often us'd: for this end, the decoction of an old Cock, with altering medicins, and gently purging, being stowed in its belly, is praysed by many: Besides, the remedies hitherto cited, some others are said to be appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate, and as it were Specifical to the <hi>Asthma,</hi> of which sort are, the <hi>bassom of Sulphur,</hi> turpintsn'd, also <hi>Spirits of Harts-horn,</hi> or of <hi>Sut,</hi> impregnaeed with the same; <hi>Syrop of Tobacco,</hi> of <hi>Ammoniack,</hi> our <hi>diasulphur Lohoch</hi> of <hi>Garlick,</hi> pills of the <hi>roots of Enula Campane</hi> made up with the <hi>milk of Sulphur;</hi> with the <hi>flowers of Benzoin,</hi> with liquid pitch, or liquid amber, with many others, which would be too tedious here to enumerate.</p>
