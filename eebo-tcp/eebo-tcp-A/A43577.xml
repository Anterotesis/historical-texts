            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Chriſtian Reader.</head>
            <p>NEXT to the immediate Injoyment of God (which is the Top and Height of a Gracious Souls felicity) it is no doubt an adventitious Comfort to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, that they ſhall meet with all the Holy Souls in Heaven, of whom they have heard, and with whom they have injoyed ſweet Communion in this lower World: What a raviſhing Tranſport of Love was there reciprocally betwixt loving <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> and his beloved <hi>David,</hi> in their mutual Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces when they <hi>kiſſed one another, and wept one with another, until</hi> David <hi>exceeded,</hi> 1 Sam. 20.41. Who can read that Paſſage with dry Eyes! But oh, what raptures of tranſcendent Joy will theſe Holy Souls be filled with, upon their meeting in Heaven! Where briny Tears ſhall be whiped from their weeping Eyes, and Sin and Sorrow ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:37114:3"/>
flee away! Such joy would break their Hearts and kill them (as the Father died for joy on his two Sons coming off Victors in the <hi>Olympick</hi> Games) did not Almighty grace inlarge their Veſſels to a vast Extent: When they told <hi>Jacob</hi> that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was yet alive, Jacob<hi>'s heart fainted, for he believed them not,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 45.26, 27.</note> but when he ſaw the Wagons ſent to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him, <hi>the ſpirit of</hi> Jacob <hi>revived:</hi> Oh but what full demonſtrations both of the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and excellency of our godly Friends felicity be in Glory! No heſitation remains either it be ſo, no bitter ingredients to allay this joy: How will theſe pure ſtreams mingle and recur with raviſhment to all Eternity! The once tender-hearted Mother, will turn her deſires into delight, and ſay, <hi>what my Son!</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pro. 31.2.</note> 
               <hi>and what, the Son of my womb! and what, the Son of my vows!</hi> Thou art welcome hither, now my ſad Agonies are turned into triumphant Songs: What ſweet ſolace will the godly Husband and gracious Wife take in each other! Once <hi>heirs together of the grace of life,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet 3.7.</note> now full poſſeſſours of the life of glory: The godly Chriſtian Friends that <hi>walked to the houſe of God in company,</hi>

               <hi>and took ſweet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel together,</hi> are now <hi>abundantly ſatisfied with the fatneſs of God's houſe,<note place="margin">Pſal 36.8.</note> and drink of the rivers of pleaſures,</hi> yea bath themſelves in this ocean of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: Surely it will be no ſmall acceſſion of their

joy to meet their old Friends, Relations and Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions there, never to part more: If <hi>Archimedes</hi> was ſo tranſported with finding out a Mathematical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that he cryed out [<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>] I have found, I have found it, much more will the glorified Saint be exceedingly raviſhed, when after all his Pains and Fears, he can ſay, I have found my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and all my Chriſtian Friends before the Throne; Oh happy day, Oh raviſhing ſight! To behold the Sun of righteouſneſs in all his Glory, and thoſe radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Stars glittering in that upper Firmament; this indeed will ſurprize the Soul with aſtoniſhment: The reading of the incomparable Writings of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Miniſters, hath been often a great refreſhment to ſtudious and ſerious Souls: <hi>Heynſius,</hi> the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Library keeper of <hi>Leyden,</hi> profeſſed, that when he had ſhut up himſelf among ſo many illuſtrious Souls, he ſeemed to ſit down there as in the very lap of Eternity, and pittied Rich Worldlings that were ſtrangers to his delights. Oh but what brave Souls are the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect! What pleaſure will they take in the graces and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of each other! If <hi>David</hi> could ſay of <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, very pleaſant haſt thou been unto me;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 1.26.</note> 
               <hi>thy love to me was wonderful paſſing the love of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men:</hi> O what love and delight will be above in the proper Element of Love! Where Souls will be filled with God, and delight in his Image ſhining in all the Saints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37114:4"/>It is certain, that all the real Saints that ever died ſince the World began, are taken up into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and enjoy God and each other; but whether the Saints departed or Angels, were participants of that Glory before which they have ſince Christ<hi>'s</hi> Aſcention into Heaven,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Owens Chriſtolog.</hi> v. 158.</note> is doubted by ſome, yea the contrary aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, which I diſpute not; nay, I am apt to think, every glorified Soul, looſed from the Fleſh, will be ſome addition to the Joy of the glorified above: O what acclamations of joy will every Soul landing ſafely in Glory cauſe, to Coeleſtial Inhabitants! Well met, Brethren, after a tedious, dangerous Voyage, in this Haven of Rest: Glad, full glad are we that you are got ſafe into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s boſom: And whether the Saints ſucceſſively going off the ſtage of the World, inform them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove of the State of the Church below? I have not to ſay: But as there is no Grief there, or occaſions of Sorrow, ſo there is multitudes of objects and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of Joy and Triumph, the felicitating ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the place, the company, the duration; all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford matter of Comfort: And why may we not think their Reflection upon their former State in this lower World, will contribute ſomething to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment! Yea, and their communicating Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences one to another in that bleſſed State: If any one doubt, whether glorified Souls will have ſuch mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, intelligible Entercourſes with each other, for Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction herein, let them read the excellent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of precious Mr. <hi>John Flavil,</hi> called <gap reason="foreign">

               <q>that is but a turning the key of the Will, and their Thoughts and Deſires are preſently ſeen and known by others to whom they will diſcover them, as a Man's Face is ſeen in a Glaſs, when he pleaſeth to turn his Face to it: Would one Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit make known his Mind to another, it is but to Will he ſhould know it, and it is immediately known: And this internal way of ſpeaking, is more noble, perfect and excellent then by Words and Signs, both in reſpect of clearneſs, and alſo of diſpatch and ſpeed:</q> See both cleared, <hi>ubi Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra, p. 280.</hi>

            <p>This is the Language of Spirits (called the Tongue of Angels, <hi>1 Cor. 13.1.</hi>) but after the Reſurrection when bodies are united to Souls, poſſibly there may be the uſe of bodily Organs, howbeit in a more excellent way then now they can: Yet in the glorified State the joy of the Soul ſhall redound to the Body;<note place="margin">Weemſe p. 202.</note> ſo that ſome think there will be no uſe of the baſer Sences but only of the noble Sences, as Seeing and Hearing: The best pleaſure is, that of

the Souls ſpiritual delights, are far more pleaſant then ſenſual; immediately after a gracious Soul is parted from the Body, it attains to that perfection of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with more eaſe then it could attain to a ſmall degree of Knowledge whilſt in the Body: Yet its queſtioned whether the glorified Soul ſhall be in a proficiency of Knowledge, which yet will be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to its Happineſs: For, the Soul being a Finite Being, cannot attain to a comprehenſive Knowledge of God, but what they injoy will be beatifical: O what an emphaſis is in that Word, <hi>ſeeing God face to face,</hi>

                  <hi>no not the Angels of Heaven, but my Father only:</hi> No nor Chriſt himſelf as Man: No ſay they, the Day and Hour cannot be known but the Year may: But that's a poor Evaſion, for by day and hour is meant the Time; and if Chriſt know not, no wonder if he foretold it not to his Diſciples, for wiſe Reaſons, that we might be always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: <hi>Grotius</hi> indeed ſaith, that <hi>Paul</hi> thought the coming of Chriſt would be in his days, yet you ſee here, that it would not be till cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Signs foretold ſhould come to paſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, they were ſtill to expect it as uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Ignorance of it is needful, but errour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it is hurtful; let us ſtudy what tends to Practice.</p>
               <p>In this Text the bleſſed Apoſtle doth vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently beſeech them by all that is dear unto them, that no pretence either of Spirit, Word or Apoſtolical Letter, do perſwade them that Chriſts coming is near at hand, and ſo torment their Minds or ſtagger their Faith when they find it otherwiſe: What thoſe preceding Signs are, ſee <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Paraphraſe on this Chapter, thoſe that can let them conſult it.</p>
               <p>All that I ſhall do is, to take notice of this ſolemn obſecration or obteſtation in this Text, wherein he adjures them:

Or, that which ſees <hi>through a glaſs darkly,</hi> then ſhall we ſee <hi>face to face,</hi> verſe 12. I muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs thoſe two words are beyond my compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, of <hi>knowing even as we are known,</hi>

               <p n="5">5. The Souls of Men live after they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Body: For, what is it which is gathered with the Saints? Its not the Body, for that is laid in the duſt, but its the Soul, for the Body and Soul meet not till the great Day of the Reſurrection: Nor doth the Soul ſleep in the duſt till then, for our Lord ſaid to the penitent Thief,<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Atomiſts</hi> and <hi>Epicureans</hi> will not grant an annihilation of any one <hi>Atom</hi> in the Univerſe, ſurely then not this excellent Creature, the Soul of Man: Yea the Soul of Man continues its inviduation, <hi>i. e.</hi> its diſtinct being, and falls not into one common univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Soul of the World, as ſome have imagined:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37114:19"/>
Spirits have a numerical Difference, a diſtinct Being: Nor are we to think that the Soul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns into the Eſſence of God, becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>The Spirit returns to God who gave it,</hi> Eccl. 12.7. It doth return to God to receive its Sentence from him, not into his Being, for then we ſhould make God Diviſible, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Parts, which is contrary to his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Divine Nature; thus Souls have a diſtinct Being, yet depending on God the firſt Being, and are individuals, and muſt be accordingly judged.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That the Soul being gathered with the Elect enters immediately into glory; to know where <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s Soul was, while he was in the Grave, requires more skill then I can pretend to: Some think it hovered about the Grave by Chriſt's order, as deſigning its re-entring the Body; but Scripture aſſures us of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Salvation of gracious Souls: <hi>They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into peace,</hi> when the Body reſts in its Bed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.2. They are pronounced <hi>bleſſed that die in the Lord:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13.</note> 
                  <hi>When Christ who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we appear with him in Glory,</hi> Col. 3.4. Now they ſhall be glorious in their Souls: At the Reſurrection, their Bodies will be Glorious,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phi.</hi> 3.21.</note> even like Chriſt's glorious Body: This anſwers that Query, whether the Saints ſhall have greater Glory at the Reſurrection then they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after their Death? It is eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37114:20"/>
that ſo far as there is an Addition of a glorified Body to the glorified Spirit, ſo far is the Glory greater, what further, I know not: Though Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> thinks the Word [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] when Fleſh is not joined to it, ſignifies, that Life which the Soul enters upon immediately after Death, called Reſurrection, <hi>i. e.</hi> Glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: Certainly the Soul hath ſome intuitive Knowledge in its ſeparate State and Felicity al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, ſo far as it is capable.</p>
               <p n="7">7. When theſe bleſſed Souls are thus gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together they ſhall never part, they ſhall live with God and each other for ever: Here we part and meet again, and meet and part again, and part ſo as we ſhall never meet again in this World: But in the other World we ſhall part no more through the Ages of Eternity: After Millions of Years the Comforts are as freſh as at the firſt Moment, never weary, nor interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they are <hi>before the throne of God,</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> For what End the Saints are gathered together.</head>
               <p n="4">4. THE next Head is to open the End or Deſign of the Saints gathering together, theſe are of Two Sorts, 1. Principal, 2. Secondary and Subordinate.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The primary and principal End is, the Glorifying of God; the great God doth all things for this great End, 2 Theſ. 1.10. <hi>When he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe:</hi> The glory of the Saints ſhall reflect glory to God: God takes himſelf honoured in his Saints Honour, as the Prince is magnified in the ſplendour of his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37114:21"/>
Court: If God be glorified in the bittereſt Sufferings of his Saints,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14.</note> how much more in their Exaltations? Oh what a Luſter will they caſt, when they are all crowned as Kings,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43.</note> when they ſhall ſhine as the Firmament, yea as Stars, yea as the Sun in its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian glory, O what a ſtrange change is this to be raiſed out of the Durſt and Dung-hill, to ſit upon Thrones? How came this to paſs, ſurely the Author of this Glory will have the chief ſhare therein, all God's perfections will be conſpicuous: The Saints meeting together in the foreſaid Manner, will tend to the glory of</p>
               <p n="1">1. God's Soveraignty, wherein he choſe theſe that were Children of Wrath even as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to make them Veſſels of Mercy, and left others as good as they to periſh and be baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from God to all Eternity; then thoſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Councels will be diſplayed, and that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture fully explained, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.15, 18, 22, 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. God's Wiſdom ſhall be illuſtrious in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving a way for Man's Redemption and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: This Wiſdom of God in a Myſtery, <hi>even the hidden wiſdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.7. Then the Secrets of this Wiſdom will be clearly laid open, to Angels and Men, which now they deſire
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:37114:21"/>
to look into, yea become Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars in the Church to learn more of, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.10.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The Power of God will be illuſtrious in bringing poor weak Creatures through ſuch a world of Difficulties and Oppoſitions, as Sheep in the midſt of Wolves, Lions, Bears, in an how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Wilderneſs, yea themſelves ſhall wonder how they ever got thither, and ſhall reflect with comfort and triumph, that they were <hi>kept by the power of God through Faith unto Salvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But no Attribute of God will ſhine ſo bright in that day of Saints meeting together, as that of his Free-grace, Love and Mercy, this orient Pearl in the Gold-ring of Glory will ſhine brighteſt: That up-hill City is built all of Free-ſtone, they had none mounted ſo high, had not the arms of love been under them: When this Head-ſtone of Glory is laid, it will be with <hi>ſhoutings, grace, grace unto it,</hi> Zech. 4.7. The Coeleſtial Pallace will ring with Accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations of Grace: Grace laid the Foundation, and Grace lays the Top-ſtone in Glory: The glorified Soul will ſtand amazed, and ſay, <hi>who am I O Lord God, and what is my houſe that thou hast brought me hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.18.</note> And Saints and Angels will ſtand gazing at them, and at God in them, that of ſuch filthy Beaſts hath made ſuch holy Saints, of ſuch Lepers not fit to be toucht, hath advanced them above the ordinary rate of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:37114:22"/>
Men, <hi>equal unto the Angels:</hi> Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſaints ſhall adore Free-grace,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 20.36.</note> Devils ſhall fret, Reprobates gnaſh their Teeth with envy, and Angels will gladly admit them into their Society: And God will be glorified in all.</p>
               <p>This is the firſt and chief End God hath in gathering the Saints together.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is alſo a ſecondary ſubordinate End of God's bringing his Saints together, and that is for their mutual Communion, Converſe and Society with each other, and all with God together.</p>
               <p>Negatively it ſhall not be.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To Trade, Buy and Sell, and have civil Commerce together, to make great Purchaſes, or to go to Fairs and Markets, or meet upon Exchange for Merchandice: There's no ſuch things there: <hi>Nor ſhall they Marry or be given in Marriage;</hi> nor converſe as Husband and Wives, <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Nor ſhall they ſuffer together, or be thrown into Priſons, Dens, Caves of the Earth, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure Hardſhips, ſeeking Relief, or begging their Bread; the Devil and his Inſtruments are there non-ſuited, <hi>the accuſer of the brethren is cast down,</hi> Rev. 12.10. And all his Angels, Agents.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Much leſs ſhall they Sin together, by Acts of Immorality, or idle Talk or Chat, there ſhall not be uttered one vain Word to all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; nor ſhall they Quarrel, or Contend, and thereby grieve and fret or vex the Spirits one of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:37114:22"/>
another, or ſadden the Hearts of each other; No, no, there ſhall be perfection of Grace, and compleat harmony of Minds and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Nor ſhall there be one word of Complaint as now there is, Chriſtians when they meet here, ſpend much of their Time in bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, or bemoaning one another, in mutual Compaſſion, confeſſing their Faults to each other,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>James</hi> 5.16,</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting Chriſtian Friends with their Grievances, begging their Advice, and the help of their Prayers; O ſaith one, I am Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, Hard-hearted, Unbelieving, have a treacherous Memory, am very Unprofitable; ſaith another, I am ſore aſſaulted with Satans Suggeſtions, helliſh Temptations; another ſaith, I am in the dark, God hides his Face, I know not what to make of my Condition; another complains of dark Providences, and is afraid of miſſing his Way, in ſuch a Caſe; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one hath his peculiar Ailings and Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances; and one while raiſe their Hearts to God, another while to Chriſtian Friends; but there ſhall be no ſuch thing as a whimper of complaining, when they meet together in that Solemn day.</p>
               <p n="2">2. More poſitively and affirmatively, the Ends and Buſineſs for which the Saints ſhall come together are theſe Two.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:37114:23"/>1. The former concerns their perſonal Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: The Second concerns their mutual Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and Entercourſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For their own perſonal Felicity, they ſhall meet together for theſe Ends:</p>
               <p n="1">1. To reſt together, as their Bodies ſhall reſt in the Grave, ſo ſhall their Soul reſt with God: This is the time of <hi>refreſhing that comes from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> Acts 3.19. <hi>Now they reſt from their labours,</hi> ſinful, evil,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13.</note> and natural, never more to be peſtered any more with the Hurries of a mad World, Temptations of a malicious Devil, or Corruptions of a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Heart: Reſt is ſweet, this Reſt is moſt ſweet, <hi>when they enter into Peace they reſt in their Beds,</hi> Iſa. 57.2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To be rewarded; <hi>great is their reward in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.12. This Reward doth greatly animate God's Saints in their Labours and Loſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, they ſtill <hi>have reſpect to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of Reward,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.26. <hi>Pro.</hi> 11.18.</note> and they ſhall not be diſappointed for it is a ſure Reward; and their Confidence <hi>hath great recompence of Reward,</hi> Heb. 10.35. Not by any thing we have done in point of commutative Juſtice, yet by diſtributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, by vertue of God's promiſe in the New Covenant, God will be as good as his Word.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They meet to rejoyce together, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>they rejoyce in hope of the Glory of God,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:37114:23"/>
Rom. 5.2. But Heaven is the true proper Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Joy: If at a diſtance and unſeen,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.10.</note> the Chriſtian <hi>can rejoyce with Joy unſpeakable and full of Glory,</hi> upon actings of a Faith of Adherence:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.</note> Oh what Joy will the Chriſtian have above, this is an entring into our Maſters Joy,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.21.</note> becauſe our Veſſels are too narrow for this joy to enter into us; O what tranſport of joy at the Saints arrival!</p>
               <p n="4">4. They meet to Reign: <hi>The Saints of the moſt high ſhall take the Kingdom and poſſeſs the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom for ever, even</hi> for ever and ever, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 18. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.5. Not only ſhall godly Miniſters <hi>receive a crown of glory that fadeth not a way;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.4.</note> but ſuffering Saints ſhall have the Crown of Life, <hi>which God hath promiſed to all that love him,</hi> James 1.12. Earthly Crowns are but rotten Trifles to this Crown that all Saints ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: This is an high tranſcendent Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They meet together to receive their Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance: At preſent they are but as Children in their Minority, but at Death they take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their rightful Inheritance, and it is an <hi>Inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not away, reſerved in Heaven for them,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.4. All God's Children are Heirs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.29.</note> and <hi>heirs according to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> and this Glory they have
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:37114:24"/>
hereafter is a <hi>reward of inheritance,</hi> Col. 3.24. The Kingdoms of the Earth countervail not this bleſſed Inheritance above.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They meet together to triumph upon their bleſſed Conqueſt: What ſtrange Triumphers ſhall Saints be hereafter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.37.</note> that are <hi>more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours here?</hi> All the Saints ſhall be cloathed with <hi>white robes and palmes in their hands,</hi> Rev. 7.9. O the triumphant Song they ſing, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.3. It is unintelligible by others, and cannot be learned by any but overcomers: O happy Souls!</p>
               <p n="7">7. They meet to ſee the Execution of God's Vengance upon the Wicked, Jude 14.15. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Lord cometh to execute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly, of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly deeds and hard ſpeeches,—the righteous ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce when he ſeeth the vengance,</hi> Pſal. 58.10. The more the Saints Will is melted into God's Will, the more content will they have in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Juſtice, not ſo much on God's Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but his Enemies, ſee 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They meet for a clear Manifeſtation of their inward Principles and outward Practices to each other: Saints are called hidden ones,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83.3.</note> their beſt part is moſt out of ſight; <hi>their life is hid with Chriſt in God, but when Chriſt who is our life ſhall appear, then ſhall we appear with him in glory,</hi> Col. 3.3, 4. Yea, and the <hi>Creature waiteth for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37114:24"/>
the manifeſtation of the Sons of God,</hi> Rom. 8.19. O what a diſplay will there be at that day of Men's inward States one to another, never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore known, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.1, 2.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They meet to have their Graces perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: This (and never till then) is the day when that is accompliſhed, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.12, 13. <hi>The perfecting of the Saints till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect Man unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt:</hi> Then will every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Soul be filled with Grace, to the full brim: He that <hi>begun a good work here, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form till the day of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1.6. Now they have attained to that they were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing after; O bleſſed day! Oh ſweet attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
               <p n="10">10. Yet, once more they meet together to injoy God immediately together: This Crowns all the reſt, this is the top of all, the Achme and higheſt Felicity of a rational Soul: This is that they have been long breathing after: Some glimpes of his bleſſed Face they ſaw through the glaſs of Ordinances, and were thereby <hi>changed into the ſame image from glory to glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.18. But that ſight of God was but <hi>through a glaſs darkly, but then face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. <hi>When he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is,</hi> 1 John 3.2. What Man dwelling on this ſide Death knows the meaning of that Word? God ſaid to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>

                     <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.20.</note> but then the Lord will unveil his bleſſed Face to glorified Souls: We cannot till now how a finite Soul is capable of ſeeing an infinite Object, but then as the faculties will be ſtrangely inlarged and extended, ſo this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will exceed our preſent low Apprehenſions: This is called the beautiful Viſion, promiſed <hi>to the pure in heart that they ſhall ſee God;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.8.</note> and its this that makes them compleatly Happy: That's one of the ſweeteſt words in the Bible, 1 Theſ. 4.17, 18. <hi>Then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord, wherefore comfort one another with theſe words.</hi>

                  <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> An Account of the Intercourſe the Saints have at their meeting together.</head>
               <p>THE former Head referred to the main Buſineſs of the Saints meeting together, which was glorifying God, injoying of him, which conſiſts in their perſonal Felicity.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:37114:25"/>2. This latter concerns their mutual Society, and familiar Entercourſe one with another, which will be additional to their comfort and happineſs in thoſe heavenly Regions.</p>
               <p>Communion of Saints is one Article of our Faith, and the great Priviledge of Believers in this lower World; both that which is Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick with all Saints through the World, and that which is Perſonal and Immediate with Members of the ſame Society: As ſoon as any Man commenceth Chriſtian, he eſpouſeth this Communion, Phil. 1.5. <hi>For your fellowſhip in the goſpel from the firſt day until now:</hi> Wicked Men talk their good Fellowſhip in feaſting, drinking, jeſting, gaming, alaſs they are all but Child's play, yea Devils ſport to this, and leave the Soul ſapleſs and guilty: But this Fellowſhip of God's Children is delectable, honourable and profitable, a diſtinctive Character of a Saint, an Emblem of Heaven, a ſtep to Communion with God.</p>
               <p>Yet that Fellowſhip they have in Glory far exceeds that they have below, for they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecated from the dregs of Corruption and ſinful Paſions, their Souls purified, their Graces per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and though they be different Lives, yet all center in God.</p>
               <p>That the Saints above have familiar Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe one with another, is generally aſſerted, and very probable; becauſe ſuch a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation doth greatly heighten their Comfort and Happineſs: But how this is carried on, is not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37114:26"/>
ſo Evident; whether it be <hi>[imprimendo]</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printing their Conceptions in the Minds of each other, as <hi>Scotus</hi> ſaith, or <hi>[repreſentando, ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nando]</hi> ordering their Conceptions in their own Minds, and ſo in ſome peculiar way repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them by certain Species to others: So <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas;</hi> or <hi>[ſonando]</hi> by forming Sounds, which after their way are intelligible: But we that are ſo much ſtrangers to the Nature of Spirits, cannot conceive of theſe things.</p>
               <p>Yet after the Reſurrection, when Bodies are united to their Souls, poſſibly they may hold Diſcourſe vocally; yet, it muſt be ſaid, whil'ſt in this World, in a ſound Senſe, that they <hi>know no Man after the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.16. How much leſs in Heaven, when their Bodies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Spiritual, will they know each other, or confer together in a low carnal Manner, as they do here in this World.</p>
               <p>Let the more learned read Dr. <hi>Tuckny</hi>'s Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couſe in his <hi>Praelect. Theol,</hi> Page 152 to 157, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Queſtion <hi>[Beati in ſtatu gloriae ſe mutuo ſunt aquituri:]</hi> That the Bleſſed in the State of Glory ſhall know each other, for which he brings Proofs out of Scripture, of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and this in Chriſt's Transfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſome Argument.</p>
               <p>But of this I ſhall ſay as he <hi>[quòd queſtio iſta in ſe contineat veritatem theologicam non fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem fidei Articulum]</hi> that this Queſtion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it a Theological Truth, not a Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Article of Faith; not neceſſary to our
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37114:26"/>
Salvation, but uſeful to our Edification and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.</p>
               <p>Now if it be asked, what Subjects the Saints glorified ſhall in all probability diſcourſe upon, I confeſs its an high an hard Queſtion; for, I do find in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4. that when the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was lifted up into the Third Heavens, he heard [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>wordleſs Words, or Words that could not be uttered,</hi> or which it is not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Man to utter: God forbid that I ſhould preſume to expreſs either the Matter or the Manner of theſe Conferences above: But words or things they are that are uttered, and we may lawfully gueſs at what the Saints above confer of, by the holy laudible Diſcourſes they have here; and they may be ſuch as theſe:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning the Work of Creation: For though the viſible Heavens and Earth ſhall be burnt up, yet nevertheleſs, according to his Promiſe, they ſhall ſee <hi>new heavens and new earth, wherein dwells Righteouſneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.12, 13. Fire purifies,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 18.5.</note> ſo the viſible Heavens which were defiled with Men's Sin, ſhall be purged with Fire,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.21.</note> and the <hi>creature ſhall be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the bondage of corruption:</hi> And oh what a brave ſhew will that preſent? Far beyond Golden Mountains, Rocks of Pearl or Diamonds, or Chriſtal ſtreams: A ſemblance of it we have in <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. which is the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Workmanſhip of the great Creator, enough to imploy the Eyes and Tongues of thoſe Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37114:27"/>
Inhabitants to the Praiſe of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> Rev. 4.9, 10, 11. and though the firſt Creation be paſt away, yet the mighty Fabrick of this vaſt Univerſe will poſſeſs the Thoughts of the Saints, with admiration of God's Power, Wiſdom, Holineſs which ſhines therein, and they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, upon with Diſcourſes one to another, and adoring God: To the Honour of his Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Concerning Man's Apoſtacy: How ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently God had placed Man in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate of Perfection in his own Image, with perfect Faculties in the Image of of God,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.6.</note> 
                  <hi>with dominion over the works of God's hands:</hi> Yet he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably made defection from God, and roſe up in rebellion againſt God, by violating the Moral Law engraven in his Heart; and the Poſitive Law of not eating the Fruit of one Tree: Whereby he utterly ruined all his Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, made himſelf and his Off-ſpring ſubject to God's wrath and curſe here and hereafter to all Eternity: This will be greatly aggravated to the advancement of Free-grace in our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance out of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Eſpecially the Saints ſhall diſcourſe of the Means of our Redemption: The infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Grace and Love in God's Contrivance of it; the tranſcendent Love, Care, Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt in the managing of it, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Birth, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention of the Son of God, his Offices, ſuited to our
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37114:27"/>
State, and all his Mediatory Undertakings: This will be a Voluminous Book for Saints to read, fairly written in indelible Characters;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.20, 21.</note> and the glorious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before their Eyes, at the right Hand of God, in heavenly Places, above Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities; to be a perpetual Monitor of his glorious Tranſactions: This ſhall be the trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Harmony of the Coeleſtial Inhabitants to all Eternity, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 9, 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The priviledge of Believers; the bleſſed Fruits of Chriſt's purchaſes: Now they ſhall more fully underſtand and take the due dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Benefits of Reconciliation, Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Adoption, peace of Conſcience, joy of the Holy-Ghoſt; theſe priviledges will be better underſtood then, and diſcourſed of one to another: O what bleſſed Effects of Divine Grace! We enjoyed them, but did not duly conceive of them, now we ſee what it is to be the Children of God, to be Juſtified, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; theſe were greater Mercies then we were aware of: Let us caſt our Eye back, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what we were once, what Bruits, Sots, but how we <hi>were waſhed, ſanctified, juſtified, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. Ah, what a pleaſant Theam is this!</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Ordinances injoyed: Oh, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſavory Sermons have we heard! How often have we been feaſted together at the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? What ſweet Fellowſhip have we had with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37114:28"/>
the Saints in the lower World! Many an Heart-melting Faſt, many a Soul-refreſhing Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, many an edifying, Heart-warning Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: I could then ſay, <hi>it was good for me to draw nigh to God:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.28.</note> Thoſe Duties led us to this Glory: God help us to improve Ordinances, and now we are got quite above Ordinances.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The difficulties of our Pilgrimage: While the Saints ſtand on the ſhore of Eternity, and look back at the ſtormy tempeſtuous Sea they have paſſed, the Pirats, Rocks and Sands they eſcaped, by the conduct of the great Pilot, it fills them with Admiration and Aſtoniſhment: How many roaring Devils, ſurious onſets of Men: What Temptations, Perſecutions they have paſſed through, what hard Duties they have performed, what Corruptions they have mortified, what Burthens they have born; all theſe do accent their Joy to an high pitch.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Miniſters, and their Hearers will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their former Experiences: Oh, will the Convert ſay, it was a bleſſed Day that ever I ſaw ſuch a Miniſters Face, or heard his Voice: I remember the Text, the Doctrine, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that firſt touched my Heart:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſat under that ſhadow with great delight, the fruit was ſweet to my Soul,</hi> God healed me by the ſame Hand, that wounded me; poſſibly the Miniſter never knew till now all the Souls he hath been an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to Convert: Now they have a reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:37114:28"/>
Joy, when <hi>ſower and reaper rejoyce toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> John 4.26.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Godly Relations will mutually reflect on Days that are paſt, though now not as Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife, yet as <hi>quondam</hi> in that Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: They <hi>were heirs together of the grace of life,</hi> prayed, wept,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.</note> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and ſweetly converſt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the Father wept over the miſcarrying Child, prevail'd with God, his Miſcarriages coſt him dear, but his Converſion was as life from the dead, that was a coſtly Child, how the more lovely the gracious Child reflects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, recounts the godly Fathers and Mothers Prayers and Tears, Counſels, Admonitions.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The diſtinction Grace hath made betwixt them and others: Such a one as well Born, Bred, Educated as we, ſometimes under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, ſat under the ſame means of Grace, of fine Parts, made a Profeſſion, and were once as likely for Heaven as I, but fell into groſs Sin, or kept in a courſe of Formality, and theſe are now ſwallowed up in Eternal Torments, why, am not I in their Caſe? <hi>Who made us to differ?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.</note> It was nothing but Free grace that gave me a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting-heart: I was as likely to Periſh as he, and as unable to help my Self as he.</p>
               <p n="10">10. Chriſtians will diſcourſe of the various Providences of God in this World: I was Sick and the Lord raiſed me up, had I dyed then, I had been undone, for I was in a graceleſs
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:37114:29"/>
State: God <hi>in faithfulneſs afflicted me,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.75.</note> I had periſhed, if I had not periſhed, I was wandring, and God brought me home by weeping Croſs: I had not been thus Happy, if I had not been Miſerable; all things did work for my Good: The Lord ſupplyed my Wants, ſupported me in Troubles, vouchſafed many Mercies in my Pilgrimage, wereby he rendred my Condition comfortable: Many a particular Diſpenſation of Providence will be then laid open to others.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The ſeaſons of ſpecial Inlargement; they will then declare what God hath done for their Souls: Many things that paſſed betwixt God and their Souls, that were not fit to be divulged in this World, will then be laid open to the glory of God, and their own and others joy and abundant content as thoſe two Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſaid, Luke 24.32. <hi>did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us by the way?</hi> Oh, what ſweet Intercourſe with God had my Soul in ſuch a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,<note place="margin">

               <p n="12">12. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> They ſhall diſcourſe of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity they are now advanced to, and the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of it: This State is beyond, <hi>what eye
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37114:29"/>
hath ſeen, ear heard, or could enter into the heart of Man;</hi> little,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.</note> ah little did I then know what I now enjoy: One hour in this blisful State, compenſates all my days of Service or Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: O that I had done more for God! I am ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> aſhamed that God ſhould ſo abundantly reward ſo little Work: But God acts like himſelf, I did but little for God, but God doth much for me: Who would not ſerve ſuch a Maſter? My Sufferings were but light and momentary, but this is a far more <hi>exceeding and eternal weight of glory:</hi> O What a beautiful Maſter have we ſerved:<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</note> Nor is this for a ſhort Seaſon, to have an End, but it is laſting, everlaſting; it would damp our Joy, if we were in danger to loſe this Felicity, but let us take Courage, we ſhall never be expelled out of this our Paradice as <hi>Adam</hi> was out of his: This Happineſs ſhall run Paralel with the Life of God, and live of Eternity.</p>
               <p>You'l ſay, how do you know that this ſhall be their Diſcourſes, have you been there to hear it, or who told you?</p>
               <p>I Anſwer no, but we may rationally gueſs at it, partly from ſome general Hints in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, partly from their profitable and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Diſcourſe on Earth, which will then be heightened, and indeed becauſe they ſhall ſpeak and act ſuch things as moſt tend to the Glory of God, and their own greater Joy and Comfort.</p>

1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14, 17. when all the Elect ſhall be gathered to Chriſt: Now this gathering of Saints to Chriſt doth comprehend theſe Four things;
<list>
                     <item>1. The State and Qualification of the Object.</item>
                     <item>2. The Reaſon or Relation betwixt them.</item>
                     <item>3. The Frame and Diſpoſition of the Subject.</item>
                     <item>4. The Sight, Viſion or Fruition of him.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall very briefly open all theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The State and Qualification of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that is Chriſt, under a double Notion, 1ſt. As God, Man; 2dly. As advanced to the right Hand of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſhall be gathered to him as God and Man, which is a State of the higheſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: Compleat Man as glorious a Creature as <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, and yet much more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to his Saints, by that reflecting on what he hath done and ſuffered for them and the Fruits thereof; this is he of whom 'tis ſaid, when he <hi>bringeth in his firſt begotten into the world, he ſaith and let all the Angels of God wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him,</hi> Heb. 1.6. This is the admirable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, conſiſting of his two Natures, Divine and Humane; never did created or uncreated Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture afford the like: In whom all Perfections meet, in whom all Excellencies are united.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As exalted to the right Hand of God: They are not now to be gathered to Chriſt, as he was in his State of Humiliation, when Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes flockt to his Preaching, working Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:37114:31"/>
when he was but in the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, or going to ſuffer on the Croſs, no, nor yet in his State of Transfiguration, which was Glorious but Temporary; but now he <hi>is ſet down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high,</hi> Heb.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9, 10.</note> 1.3. God hath now given him <hi>a name above every name far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all principalities and powers and hath put all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.20, 21, 22. It is this State of Glory in which Chriſt is inthroned, and now receiving Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage from all ranks of Creatures (Devils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined to their Priſons,) attended with innumerable Angels; 'tis Chriſt in this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous State, that the Saints are to be gathered to.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reaſon thereof, which conſiſts in the Relation betwixt Chriſt and his Saints, all which carry abundance of delight and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in them: For, it is not as Strangers or E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies that love him not, nor yet as Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors brought to the Bar, that dread him as Judge: But they are gathered to Chriſt under theſe ſweet Relations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As Sheep to their Shepheard, whoſe Voice they <hi>know here, and follow him,</hi> John 10.3, 4. yea they own him with a more then ordinary endearedneſs, becauſe he laid down his Life for the Sheep, <hi>verſe</hi> 15. and carried thoſe <hi>poor lambs in his arms,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.11.</note> and leades them to quiet reſting-pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,

                     <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and none ſhall make them afraid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. As Souldiers to their Captain, not to Fight, but to take the Spoil, the Captain of our <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is made perfect through ſufferings:</hi> He is now <hi>crowned with glory and honour and brings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sons unto glory,</hi> Heb. 2.9, 10. He pitcheth out a Crown to every Souldier, and ſets the victorious Champion with him on his own Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As Scholars to their Maſter, who ſets them not in a low Form, as under Graduates, but they commence the higheſt degree of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the Univerſity of Glory, to know as much as Creatures are capable, they <hi>ſhall know as they are known,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.12. Now he is a veſſel unto Honour, meet for his Maſters uſe,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.21.</note> ſet on the ſhelf of Glory.</p>

The Frame and Diſpoſition of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: There is in every Child of God, a kind of natural Propenſity, which inclines them in a peculiar Manner towards Chriſt as the Nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle towards the Loadſtone, by which they move and bend Heaven wards: <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my Soul ſaith</hi> David, Pſal. 116.7. As all Creatures move to their center, ſo doth the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Soul God-wards; and can never be quiet till it be cloſely joined and cemented to him, and that God that hath fixed theſe innate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples in the Soul, will promote and perfect them: Now this Frame and Diſpoſition of a Child of God, proceeds 1ſt. From the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of Conſcience, and Deficiency he finds in other things: 2dly.

               <p n="4">4. The gathering to Chriſt, includes the Sight, Viſion and Fruition of Chriſt, the full Injoyment of him: Beholding God is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fruitive Viſion of him: <hi>Bleſſed are the pure

This is by ſight of him and <hi>appearing with him in glory,</hi> Col. 3.4. This blisful ſight of Chriſt, is that which makes Heaven, for where the King is, there is the Court; this Glory is in conformity to him, and communion with him: This is it to be gather<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed to Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to have Chriſt fully revealed to us, the approach to him under deareſt Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Soul diſpoſed and duly qualified to injoy him, and full Viſion and Fruition of him: If any of theſe be wanting, we cannot in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Senſe be gathered to Chriſt.</p>

               <p>THE Improvement I ſhall make of this Point, ſhall be 1st. for Doctrine, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of our Minds and Judgments in theſe Ten Inferences and Conſectaries.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God is Omniſcent and Omnipotent known, <hi>unto God are all his works from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world,</hi> Acts 15.18. He is infinite in Knowledge and Wiſdom, that takes account of the meaneſt Creatures, and he is of infinite Power to gather them up; theſe are the Lord's People, and his Inheritance, which he hath brought out by his <hi>mighty power and ſtretched out arm,</hi> Deut 9.29. As God brought his <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> ſo he laid out the ſame Power in bringing them into <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo the ſame Power that converted Sinners, will alſo ſave them, for they are <hi>kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Jeſus Chriſt is a compleat Saviour, He <hi>is able to ſave to the uttermoſt,</hi> Heb. 7.25. [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] every way, to all intents and purpoſes, Soul and Body in all caſes, difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, conditions, in all Diſpenſations: Yet it
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:37114:35"/>
hath a further meaning, He is able to ſave total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, finally, perfectly and perpetually, ſo as none ſhall need to come after him, to finiſh what he hath begun; yet further, He ſaves, ſo as he ſhall never ceaſe to be a Saviour to all Eternity: For, though he finiſhed his ſuffering Work on Earth, and his crowning Work at the great Day of Judgment, yet the God-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying Work ſhall be by him, through the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Eternity; as he ſhall be lookt on as the Authour, ſo he will be the Object of their Happineſs, and embrace them in the Arms of his Love for evermore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That Death is not terrible to a gracious Perſon: Its true to Nature it may well be called <hi>the king of terrours;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Job</hi> 18.14.</note> it is a diſſolving of this compound Man, but it is the ſhell and cloathing of the Soul that's laid by, an Elementary compoſition that's diſſolved, the Soul is thereby ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and takes its flight into another World, a World of Spirits: A better State then here, Death is but a bridge, a portal that opens the Door to Heaven: Chriſt hath unſtung Death, perfumed the Grave, and made it a means of Manumiſſion into the bleſſed Society of God, Angels and Saints, thouſands better then we are gone, who are we to be exempted? Its no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trodden Path, our beſt Friends are above, let us not be afraid to follow them.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:37114:36"/>4. That Heaven is a capacious place; all the Saints in the Old Teſtament are gone thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Millions in New-Teſtament days, are mounted to Glory, <hi>an hundred forty four thouſand of all the Tribes of Iſrael,</hi> and a <hi>great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude which no man could number,</hi> Rev. 7.49. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> came from Heaven at Chriſt's Transfiguration; <hi>Abraham</hi> in glory, and all his ſpiritual Off-ſpring, which makes a vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; yet there's room enough left in thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Manſions above: How ſmall a point is this habitable World compared with Heaven, where there <hi>is innumerable company of Angels and ſpirits of juſt Men made perfect:</hi>

But yet there ſhall be no Emulation, nay, they ſhall rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in each others Graces and Glory.</p>
               <p n="9">9.

irradiate their Souls, and they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort one anothers: Not but that there is enough in God to delight them, but this is in ſome reſpect accumulative: The Saints above will look on each others Grace as if it were their own: Yea there will be a mutual Aptitude and Diſpoſition to ſerve each other, and contribute to their Felicity.</p>

they can find none good enough to whom they think fit to vouchſafe intimate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity.

If it be an Article in their Creed, 'tis no part of their Practice, as though they had never ſubſcribed to it; yea, there are ſome, that were once forward for this Work of Chriſtian Communion, that are now fallen off, like thoſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> that believed, of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Not forſaking the aſſembling of our ſelves together, as the manner of ſome is,</hi> Heb. 10.25. The <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old, and the Sectaries of late, have made dreadful Rents and Schiſms in the Church; the more Holy Chriſtians are, the more Catholick Spirits they have: They are moſt likely to be ſenſual, that needleſly <hi>ſeparate themſelves, yea, not having the ſpirit,</hi> Jude 19. however they may boaſt themſelves to be more full of the Spirit than others they ſeparate from. Well, Sirs, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what you do, how you prejudice your ſelves, weaken your Brethrens Hands, ſadden their Hearts, yea, you weaken the Intereſt of Religion hereby: What, Friends, ſhall one Heaven hold you, and cannot one Church hold you?

However matters will go then, it becomes all the Saints to be very choice and chary of the Holineſs and Comſort of their Fellow-members on Earth, and to ſay, with <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 8.13. <hi>Wherefore if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, leſt I make my brother to offend.</hi> Happy are they that neither give Offence careleſly, nor take Offence cauſeleſly.</p>

Then Conſcience brings in the Minor, I have found my Heart and Life thus changed by Converſion; then the holy Spirit brings in the Inference or Concluſion, therefore I do groundedly hope, I ſhall obtain the Inheritance of Glory with the reſt of the Saints: This is called the witneſſing of the Spirit <hi>with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that we are the Children of God,</hi> Rom. 8.16.</p>

By familiar Converſe you may incourage them in Sin, and prejudice your Selves: Hence all Pious Perſons have been afraid to aſſociate with Sinners, ſo <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 26.4. <hi>I have not ſat with vain Perſons, neither will I go in with diſſemblers:</hi> For, in their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I ſhall get either Guilt or Grief; if I Act as they, I ſhall be guilty; if not, I ſhall be grieved: The beſt is, to meddle as little as I can with them, for God's Honour, and my own Peace: I will reſolve with Old <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 49.6. <hi>O my Soul come not into their Secret: I dare not touch the Rope, leaſt I hear the Bell:</hi>

               <p n="5">5. THE laſt uſe is of Conſolation, or Incouragement to the People of God, that there ſhall be ſuch a bleſſed ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Saints of God that have lived in all Ages, ſhall then meet and know and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy each other with mutual Content. 'Tis worth obſerving, that <hi>Plato</hi> brings in <hi>Socrate</hi>'s comforting himſelf with the hopes that upon his Removal hence, he ſhould be with <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Muſaeu</hi>'s, with <hi>Heſiod</hi> and <hi>Homer:</hi> Yea, he ſhould greatly be pleaſed with the Society of <hi>Palamedes</hi> and <hi>Ajax:</hi> But oh how much more content ſhall tranſlated Saints take in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of thoſe Coeleſtial Inhabitants, of whom they have ſo often read, and heard of with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, when they ſhall ſay, there ſtands holy <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch</hi> that walkt with God, and was tranſlated Body and Soul to Heaven: There ſtands <hi>Noah</hi> that juſt and perfect Man, the Father and Founder of a New World: There ſtands <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> the Father of the Faithful, and Friend

of God: There ſtands juſt <hi>Lot,</hi> wreſtling <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob:</hi> The beloved <hi>Joſeph</hi> more glorious now then in <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Court: There ſtands meek <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> Lawgiver, once King in <hi>Jeſhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run,</hi> that converſed with God face to face: There ſtands <hi>Aaron</hi> the Saint of God far more glorious now then in his prieſtly Garments in the Holy of Holies: There appears holy <hi>Lot,</hi> patient <hi>Job,</hi> zealous <hi>Joſiah, David</hi> the Man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God's own Heart: Behold a troop comes up of Old and New Teſtament Saints, all the Prophets, Apoſtles, Miniſters, Martyrs, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſours, and Saints in all Ages; which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent a ſplendid ſhew, next to the infinite God, and our glorious Redeemer:<note place="margin">Romam in flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re Paulum in ore Chriſtum in corpore.</note> If <hi>Auguſtin</hi> judged it a brave ſight, and worth wiſhing for to ſee <hi>Rome</hi> Flouriſhing, hear <hi>Paul</hi> Preaching, and behold Chriſt in the Fleſh, much more will it be a raviſhing ſight to behold our glorifyed Redeemer ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with myriads of bleſſed Souls: This will be a delectable ſight.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Saints that have injoyed ſweet Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on together in this World, ſhall injoy ſweeter and perpetual Communion above; they that have kept day's of Faſting and Prayer, day's of Thankſgiving and Conference, that have ſitten under the ſame Preaching, have ſung Pſalms together, have ſat down together at the holy Supper, and feaſted upon the Fruits of Chriſt's meritorious Sacrifice, ſhall now drink

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Saints that parted ſorrowfully with their Relations by Death, now meet them again to part no more. Death drew a Cloud over our Natural and Chriſtian Friends: They diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, and we ſaw them again no more; but now we are met again in a better place than in our Houſes, or Temples made with hands. We once took mutual content in each other, but that was but a ſhadow, a ſaint reſemblance
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37114:60"/>
of that we now enjoy; the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Wife <hi>were heirs together of the grace of life,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7.</note> now they are Poſſeſſors together of the fulneſs of that Grace in Glory. We prayed, wept, diſcourſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: We loved each other in the Fleſh, but now our ſpark is become a flame; we love one another at another rate. The Godly Child will ſay, This is my tender-hearted Mother, my prudent, pious Father, that ſhed many a Tear for me. The Parent ſhall ſay, This my Child coſt me many times a ſad heart, many a bitter groan, he is the Son of my Vows; then the Child of my Hopes, now the Child of my Joys; his miſcarriages coſt me dear, his happineſs raiſeth my Spirits; he cauſed me to make many an Errand to the Throne of Grace, he now raiſeth my Spirit into an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie of Joy: My Prayers are fully heard, my Joy is fulfilled in the Enjoyment of God with my dear Relations.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Souls fully refined from the dregs of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Corruption, ſhall then without ſuch allays injoy each other: Alas, we cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe together here, but ſome piece of Vanity interpoſeth it ſelf: Our diſcourſes are oft im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent, ſometimes unſavory, ſometimes giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and often taking offence: Alas, what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, diſtances, diſſentions are there among Chriſtians: Even <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> may part in a pet: Alas, what Animoſities and Heart-burnings are to be found here in this lower

World even among the Saints! That we may ſadly ſigh and ſay <hi>[tant aene animis coeleſtibus irae]</hi> how comes it to paſs that ſuch helliſh ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Flames ſhould riſe out of heavenly Hearts! But now thoſe Flames are quenched, now they all unite in an harmonious Melody, ſinging the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb, now they are <hi>perfect, of good comfort, of one mind,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11.</note> 
                  <hi>they live in peace, and the God of love and peace is with them,</hi> and they are with God. They ſhall never quarrel more. O the delectable Melody of this Palm-bearing Company! Far beyond the Muſick of the Sphears: Not one jarring ſtring in all that bleſſed Conſort: They have left behind them all their cudgils at the entrance of this Temple of Peace: Their Hearts are centred in God, and their Loins are ſtreight with each other: <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> are there perfectly agreed, never to contend more.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Saints ſhall be perfectly drained from the Converſe with vile Perſons in this dirty World! Here the godly and wicked are mixed: It is impoſſible to forbear ſome civil Converſe with carnal Neighbours, for <hi>then muſt we needs go out of the world:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.</note> Even notorious Blaſphemers, Idolaters, Covetous, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37114:61"/>
but Saints ſhall be gathered together: There ſhall <hi>be no more the Canaanite</hi> (or Hypocrite) <hi>in the houſe of the Lord of hoſts:</hi> Not a prophane <hi>Eſau,</hi>

               <p n="6">6. Godly Miniſters and their gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts ſhall meet together with Joy: Oh what reciprocal Joy, and tranſcendent Satisfaction will they take in each other, <hi>when both he that ſoweth and he that reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſhall rejoyce together:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>John</hi> 4.36.</note> O ſaith the glorified Saint, yonder is my ſpiritual Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under whoſe Miniſtry I have ſate with trembling many a time, by aſtoniſhing Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions upon my Conſcience, when the Law hath thundred wrath againſt me: The ſame hand hath cloſed the wound and applyed a plaiſter of a Goſpel-promiſe to my bleeding Soul: Many melting, heart ſcearching Truths, have theſe Ears heard from that Mouth, that have come warm to my Heart: Bleſſed be God that ever I ſaw his Face or heard his Voice: The Miniſter ſhall be ſurprized with a tranſport of Joy when he ſhall ſee his ſpiritual Children, begot in the bonds of the Goſpel, over whom he hath wept many a Tear, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled with Cares and Fears, and for whom he hath put up many affectionate Prayers: Now he ſhall ſee, and ſay his Labour was not in

               <p n="7">7. Chriſtians that have been ſcattered by Perſecution, ſhall now quietly meet and part no more: How will they with comfort reflect on the ſolemn Aſſemblies ſorrowfully broken up by Officers and unruly Bailiffs, their Names taken, their Perſons dragg'd before Magiſtrates, their Houſes rifled, and themſelves hurried to Priſon; now thoſe days are over and gone, no danger of Conventicles or unlawful Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies in that upper Region, they ſhall wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God on an Hill, in the Mountain of the height of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> They ſhall no more be proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by Murthering or ſcattering Acts, they ſhall now be out of date, they ſhall no more hear the Voice of the Oppreſſour, there have been many ſuch days as thoſe in the Apoſtles times, great perſecutions againſt the Church,<note place="margin">
