            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> am confident you all beleive
that if it had not been absolutely
necessary to consult with you, I
would not have called you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
at this time, when the Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
hath so spread it selfe over
so many parts of the Kingdom.
I take it for a good Omen to see so good an appearance
this day, and I doubt not every day will add to your
number, and I give you all my Thanks for your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
so farre with my desires.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:95795:3"/>
The Truth is, as I entred Upon this Warr by your
advice and encouragement, so I do desire that you may
as frequently as is possible, receive information of the
Conduct and effects of it, and that I may have the
continuance of your cheerfull Supply for the carrying
it on. I will not deny to you, that it hath proved more
chargeable, then I could Imagine it would have been;
the addition they still made to their Fleets beyond their
first purpose, made it unavoydably necessary for Me
to make proportionable preparations, which God
hath hitherto blessed with Success in all encounters.
And as the Enemy have used their utmost endeavours
by Calumnies and fals Suggestions to make themselves
friends, and to perswade others to assist them against Us,
so I have not been wanting to encourage those Princes
who have been wrong'd by the Dutch, to recover their
own by force; and in order thereunto, have assisted the
<hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Munster</hi> with a Very great summ of ready
Money, and am to continue a supply to him, who is
now in the bowels of their Country with a powerfull
Army.</p>
            <p>These Issues, which I may tell you have been made
with very good conduct and husbandry (nor Indeed do
I know that any thing hath been spent that could have
been well and safely saved) I say, this expence will not
suffer you to wonder, that the great supply which you
gave me for this warr in so bountifull a proportion, is
upon the matter already spent: So that I must not only
expect an assistance from you., to carry on this warr,
but such an assistance as may inable Me to defend my
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95795:3"/>
self and you against a more powerfull Neighbour, if he
shall prefer the Friendship of the <hi>Dutch</hi> before Mine.</p>
            <p>I told you when I entred upon this warr, that I
had not such a Brutall appetite, as to make warr for
wars sake, I am still o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the same minde; I have been
ready to receive any propositions that <hi>France</hi> hath
thought sit to offer to that end, but hitherto nothing
hath been offered worthy My acceptance, nor is the
<hi>Dutch</hi> less insolent, though I know no advantage they
have had, but the continuance of the Contagion; God
Almighty I hope will shortly deprive them of that
encouragement.</p>

            <head>THE
LORD CHANCELLOR'S
SPEECH
To both Houses of
PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens, and
Burgesses of the House of Commons,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He King is not content, you see, to
leave you to your selves, to make
a state of this War, and the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
that hath attended it, by your
own Observations, and the general
Communication of all that hath
fallen out; which, in truth, hath
left few Men ignorant of any
thing, who have had any curiosity to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
but, takes care that you be informed by Himself,
that you may know all that He knows, that so you may
be able to give Him your Councel upon the clearest Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>In order to this, it will not, I hope, be unseasonable
or ingrateful to you, to refresh your memory, by looking
some years backwards, even to the time of His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties
happy Restauration, that we may take the better
prospect of the Posture we are now in, and how we have
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:95795:4"/>
come into it. What inclinations His Majesty brought
home with Him, to live in Amity with His Neighbors of
<hi>Holland,</hi> though He had received Indignities enough
from them; and, in truth, had been little less proscribed
there, then He had been in <hi>England,</hi> needs no other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation,
then that He chose that place to imbark Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in, when He was pressed by the two Neighbor Kings,
(from whom He had received more Civilities) to have
made use of their Ports: It cannot be denyed, but that
His Reception in <hi>Holland</hi> was with great Civility and
Lustre, and a sufficient Evidence, That they had a
full sense of the high Honor His Majesty had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to them, and the departure from thence was with
equal and mutual satisfaction in each other; which made
many Men the more wonder, that albeit the Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours
who were to follow, had been nominated before
the King left the <hi>Hague,</hi> there was so long an interval
before their arrival here, that the two Neighbor Kings,
and many other Princes, had finished their Ambassies of
Congratulation, before we had heard any more from the
Vnited Provinces.</p>
            <p>You all remember, how long it was before the Armies
were disbanded, and the Fleets paid off; during which
time His Majesty lived upon His credit, and easily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
a great Debt for the meer support of Himself and
His houshold, which was not so easily discharged after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.
There was one thing that exceedingly surprized
Him, when He found (which will be incredible to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity)
that a Triumphant Nation, that had made it
Self terrible to Christendom, by having fought more
Battles then all the Neighbor Kingdoms and States to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
had ever done in so few Years, and seemed to be
in a posture ready to fight them over again: That had
so long reigned over the Ocean in formidable Fleets,
should at the time of His Majesties happy return, as if
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95795:5"/>
on the suddain all their Arms had been turned into
<hi>Plough-Shares,</hi> and their swords into <hi>Pruning hooks,</hi>
not have in all the Magazins, in all the Stores, Armes
enough to put into the hands of five thousand men,
nor Provisions enough to set out ten new ships to sea;
which his Majesty did not desire should be known to
his best neighbours, how little soever he suspected their
affections; nor did indeed, so much as make it known
to his Parliament; but made it his first care, without
the least noise, and with all imaginable shifts to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for the full supply of those important Magazins
and Stores, which have been ever since replenished as
they ought to be.</p>
            <p>He had not the least imagination, that any of his
neighbours would want only affect to interrupt the happy
calme that he and themselves enjoyed; and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved,
to retrench the vast expence of the Navy, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
which he found the Nation even to groan, and out of
that good husbandry to provide for more necessary dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bursments:
Yet, that the world might not think that
he had abandoned the Ocean, and that the memory of the
glorious actions the English had so lately performed
upon it, might not vanish in an instant, after he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
such a Guard, as the narrow Seas never ought to
be without, in the Spring he sent a strong Fleet against
the Pyrats of <hi>Argiers</hi> and <hi>Tripoly</hi> (who had grown
to that strength and boldness, that they interrupted the
whole trade of Christendome) as the only Enemies He
would choose to have.</p>
            <p>It was a designe of great glory, and equal expence,
crowned in the end by God Almighty with the success
we could wish, and with an entire submission to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
Flagg, and as great security to all his Majesties
Subjects, in their Trade, as the engagement and honour
of Infidels could give; and this Agreement ratified with
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95795:5"/>
all formality (the like whereof had never been before)
by the Great Turke himselfe.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, the King again renewed his resolution
for a further retrenchment of his Naval expence, even
to the lessening the Guard in the narrow Seas, His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
in all places receiving lesse interruption in their
Trade, then they had in any former time undergone; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
he received intelligence from the Straights, that the
faithless people of <hi>Argiers,</hi> who had so lately Submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to him, had committed new insolencies upon some of
his Subjects, or rather upon forraigne persons taken by
his Subjects into their protection, and which the Turks
pretended they might doe, without violation of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but his Majesty resolving to admit none of those
elucidations, lost no time in sending a new strong Fleet
into the Mediterranean, to chastise those perfidious Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates;
and after a chargeable war made upon them, for
nere, or full twelve months; &amp; after having taken seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of their Ships from them, and upon the matter block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up in their harbours, he received a second
submission from them, with better and more advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
conditions then the former.</p>
            <p>I must not omit one circumstance, that about this
time, the Dutch, who received much more prejudice and
dammage from the Turks, then the English had done,
besought his Majesty, that he would once more send a
Fleet into those Seas against those Pyrats, and that it
might upon all occasions joine with one they were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ready to send out to the same Christian end, and
for the utter extirpation of those Sea-Robbers; and
within a very short time after the English Fleet was
gone, they likewise sent <hi>De Ruyter</hi> with a good fleet thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
which was so far from any conjunction with us,
that when our Ships chased any <hi>Argier-men</hi> neare them,
they never offered to obstruct their flight, but quickly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:95795:6"/>
made it manifest, that they rather brought mony with
them to buy a dishonourable and disadvantageous Peace,
then to make a war upon them.</p>
            <p>Matters standing thus, the Kings Fleet being gone
into the Straights against the Turkish Pyrats, and there
remaining few ships in the narrow Seas, we began eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day to heare of depredations by the Dutch upon our
Merchants in all parts; instead of delivering up the
Island of <hi>Poleroon</hi> in the <hi>East Indies,</hi> as by the Treaty
they ought to have done, they by their Naval power in
those parts hindred us from trading there, and would
not suffer our ships to take in their lading of such mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
as the Factors had provided and made ready
for their fraight, upon pretence that those Ports, where
the Merchandize was ready to be imbarked, were in the
dominions of some Princes whom they had declared to be
their Enemies, and so they would not suffer any traffique
to be maintained with them; and they published the like
Declaration, and challenged the same soveraignty in
<hi>Affrica;</hi> and by virtue thereof would not suffer our
Ships to trade upon that Coast, where we had a Tradelong
before the Dutch had any footing in those parts.</p>
            <p>These insolencies made that noise in the world, that
the English Merchants felt the effects of it in all places,
till it reached the eares of the Parliament, which in
<hi>April</hi> last was twelve months presented the same to his
Majesty, and besought him that he would take some
speedy and effectual course for the redress of those wrongs
dishonours and indignities, which were the greatest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
of our Trade, and declared, that in the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof, they would with their Lives and Fortunes
assist his Majesty against all oppositions whatsoever.</p>
            <p>My Lords and Gentlemen, You very well remember,
that though his Majestie was very well pleased with the
great Zeal you shewed for the advancements of Trade,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95795:6"/>
He was far from Resolving to make a War upon the
warmt'h of that Declaration, but told you, that He would
examine and peruse the Particular Complaints which
had been Represented to His Parliament, and would
thereupon Demand Justice and Reparation from the
States General, which Demand He Appointed His Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
residing there to make in a short Time after; What
effect that Candid Way of Proceeding found, is enough
known to the World; instead of other application, They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Themselves wonderfully offended with the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the Parliament, with many Insolent Expressions
suitable to the Manners of a Common-wealth; They gave
present Orders for Equipping a very Great Fleet, and
the Raising many Land-Soldiers, making Greater Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
for War then they had done in many Yeares
before; They had made a Complaint to His Majestie, that
a Captain of one of the Ships which his Majestie had
lent to the Royal Company, had in his Voyage thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
taken a Fort belonging to them, neer <hi>Cape Verte,</hi>
for which they demanded Satisfaction; the King As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
them, That he had not the least Commission
or Authority from him for so doing; That He expected
him home very speedily, and then he should be sure
to undergo that Punishment which the nature of his
Offence required, when the matter should be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
and they should be sure to Receive Full Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration;
This satisfied them not, but in Great Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
they Resolved to send forthwith a Strong Fleet to
<hi>Guinney,</hi> and granted a Commission (which they took
care to publish) to the Commander in Chief, to make War
upon the English in those parts, and to doe them all the
mischief they could. The King found Himselfe now
Obliged, in what Straight soever, to provide for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of his Subjects in those parts, and for the
Support of that Trade, which I doubt is not enough
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95795:7"/>
taken to heart, and the value thereof not enough under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood;
And in order thereunto, with great speed, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a Fleet to be made ready for that expedition, under
the Command of His Highness <hi>Prince Rupert,</hi> who
was under <hi>Sail</hi> for the Voyage, when his Majesty found
it necessary to stop the Prince his further prosecution
of it, upon good intelligence that the Dutch had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
their Admiral with a Fleet of fifty Sail to
convoy the other Fleet designed for <hi>Guinney,</hi> through
the Channel, in contempt of his Majesty, who had a
very small Fleet in readiness; and that <hi>De Ruyter</hi> was
likewise sent out of the Straights from prosecuting the
Turks, to make War upon the English in <hi>Guinney;</hi>
When at the same time they had earnestly pressed the
King upon many professions of desire to prevent a War,
that <hi>Prince Rupert's</hi> Fleet might stay in Harbour, as
theirs should doe, till some means might be found for
an Accommodation of all Differences; and in Truth,
this very difficult Stratagem of pretending one thing,
and intending another; of promising with all solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and never resolving to performe; of swearing
this day not to doe a thing, when they had served their
turne by having done it Yesterday, that no body could
know, is the Highest Pinacle of their Wisdome of
State; by which they Governe their Affaires, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
their Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The winds were not favourable to this Triumphant
Designe, and now the King found the Value of the
Vote and Declaration of his Parliament, it was a Rich
and a Massy Vote, which in a short time he coyned into
200000 ready money in the Chamber of the City of
<hi>London,</hi> with which he gave Order forthwith to
make ready more Ships, and the Duke going himselfe
to the Fleet, by his Indefatigable Industry, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
Expedition, added so many good Ships to those
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:95795:7"/>
under the Command of <hi>Prince Rupert,</hi> that in <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember</hi>
he put Himselfe on board the Fleet, Resolving
to stop the Dutch, if the wind gave them leave
to persue their former Resolution; which, from the
Time the Duke was known to be at Sea, they fairly
declined, and were content rather to be safe in their own
Harbours, then to look to the Security of their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants;
it was High Time now to seize upon as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of their Ships as came in our way, to Satisfie the
Dammages We had Reason to believe We should sustain
from <hi>De Ruyters</hi> expedition into <hi>Guinney,</hi> with the
Commission mentioned before; but there was not the
lading of one Ship sold, or disposed of, till His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie
received Full Information of <hi>De Ruyters</hi> having
begun the War upon the Coast of <hi>Africa,</hi> by Seizing
upon our Ships, taking our Forts, and Committing all
the Acts of Hostility which his Commission directed
him unto; His Majestie likewise at the same Time,
receiving new Advertisement of their Refusal to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
up the Island of <hi>Poleroon</hi> to Him, which they
were Bound to by their Treaty; And will you not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
after all this, at the Confidence of these Men;
and more, that any Neighbour-Prince should have that
Confidence in them, as to declare, that the King Our
Master is the Aggressor, that He first began the War.</p>
            <p>From this time the War began to be more in Earnest,
and to be carried on at another Expence; though His
Royal-Highness ventured Himselfe in <hi>November</hi> in a
Fleet consisting of little more then fifty Ships, to stop the
Dutch from passing through the Channel; Yet, in <hi>April</hi>
(which was within few daies after Your Prorogation at
the end of your last Session) He went again to Sea with a
much stronger Fleet, and more Proportionate to the Great
Preparations the Enemy had made; and even after
He was gone to Sea, upon great additions of strength
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:95795:8"/>
every day made by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> more good Ships were
sent to reinforce the Fleet; insomuch, as upon that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
third of <hi>June,</hi> when they had the Courage to visit
our Coast, after the Duke had, in vain, called upon
them at their own Doors, and took many of their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
Ships in their sight, the English Fleet consisted
of very few less then 100 Sail.</p>
            <p>The Action, and the Blessing of that day, hath been
celebrated in all the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and in the
hearty Devotions of all true <hi>English-men;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
I shall say no more of it here, save onely, That
whether the Publick Joy then, even upon the Solemn
Thanksgiving Day, was superior to the universal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
that spread it self over the Nation before, I
appeal to the Breasts of all here present: We, who had
the Honor to be near the King at that time, observed
Him to be in that Agony, that cannot be expressed; an
Agony Himself could not have long endured, even when
by all the Intelligence He received hourly from the
Coast, He had reason to assure Himself of the Victory.
In that great Action, we sunk, burned and took,
Eighteen good Ships of War, whereof half were the best
they had, with the loss of one single smal Ship of ours, but
of many noble and gallant Persons, of too much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
to be ventured (if there had not been a greater ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
against such Trash; and whose Memories ought
ever to be preserved and extolled, and made pretious to
Posterity.</p>
            <p>No diligence was omitted, but all imaginable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
used in refreshing, repairing, and setting out the
Fleet again; in order to which, the King Himself made
a Journey thither, and stayed till He saw all ready and
fit to sail; but then, no intreaty, no importunity could
prevail with Him to venture His Brother again, though
His Family, and all Preparations for the Voyage were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:95795:8"/>
still on Board: His Majestie too well Remembred,
and still felt the Impressions he had undergone
the Third of June, and having got his Brother in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Armes again, He would not returne without
Him, committing the Charge of the Fleet to the
Earle of <hi>Sandwich,</hi> who had acted so Good a Part
in it.</p>
            <p>Within few days after the beginning of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
the Earle of <hi>Sandwich</hi> went again to the
Coast of <hi>Holland,</hi> with a Fleet in no Degree, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
to the Former, and Rode before the <hi>Texel</hi>
to Envite the <hi>Dutch</hi> to a New Engagement,
They having used all the Arts at Home to Conceal
the Losse and Dishonour they had undergone;
and Pretended to be Very Ready and Solicitous
for another Battail, When there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
of their Purpose to Come Out; And
upon Sure Intelligence that the <hi>East-India</hi>
Fleet was comming about by the North, He recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Orders to go for <hi>Norway,</hi> upon such Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
as was not made Good, so that he was
disappointed of the Expectation he had very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably
carried with him thither, and at a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
when that Climate gives little Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to abide in those Seas; I am not yet to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
upon that Matter, till We heare a Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ter
Account from some of our Freinds; however,
though he could not meet with their whole Fleet,
as he Endeavoured to doe, yet he hath had
the Good Fortune in two Encounters to take
Eight of their Great Ships of War, two of their
Best <hi>East India</hi> Ships, and about Twenty of their
Merchants Ships, all under the protection of their
Fleet, or ought to have been; and was then by tempest,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:95795:9"/>
and other Reasons, which no Wisdome of his could
prevent, obliged to put into our own Harbours.</p>
            <p>I doe not mention the Great Numbers of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
we have taken, an Army of Prisoners, who
intruth do us more harme at Land, then ever they did
at Sea, and are a Charge that never fell under our
Estimate and Computation; I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
that We had entred upon a War and never
thought of Prisoners, and Sick and Wounded men;
but that the Prisoners and Wounded men should
bring upon us so Prodigious an Expence, and of
which we can yet see no bottome; insomuch, as
in one Place, I think Colchester, that Charge
comes to Twelve hundred pound the Week: I
say, such an Expence never came into our Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The King tels you, he hath enabled the Prince and
Bishop of <hi>Munster</hi> to demand Justice from those
who have so notoriously Oppressed him, with such
outragious circumstances of Insolence and Scorne,
as are enough known to the World; and He hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
it Bravely, in such an Equipage, as hath not
been made for little Money, in which he can take, as
well ask satisfaction.</p>
            <p>After all this, since there is a justice due to the
worst Enemies, we must doe them this right, that
they doe not at all seem weary of the War; they doe
not discover the least inclination to Peace. It is
true, the <hi>French King</hi> hath offered his Mediation,
and truly if he intends no more then a Mediation, it
is an office very worthy the most Christian King;
I wish with all my heart, that (as a Mediator) he
would make equall Propositions, or that he would
not so importunately press His Majesty to consent to
those he makes, upon an Instance and Argument,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:95795:9"/>
that he holds himself engaged by a former Treaty
(of which we never heard till since the beginning
of this War, and had some Reason to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
the contrary) to assist the <hi>Dutch</hi> with Men
and Money, if His Majesty doth not consent.</p>
            <p>His Majesty, tels you, that he hath not an Appetite
to make War for Wars-sake, but will be alwayes rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to make such a Peace as may be for his Honour,
and the Interest of his Subjects; and no doubt it will
be a Great Trouble and Grief to him to find so great
a Prince, towards whom he hath manifested so great
an Affection, in Conjunction with his Enemies; Yet
even the Apprehension of such a War, will not Terrifie
him to purchase a peace by such Concessions as he
would be Ashamed to make You Aquainted with; of
which Nature you will easily Believe the Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hitherto made to be, when you know that the
release of <hi>Poleroon</hi> in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> and the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing
the Fort of <hi>Cabo Corso</hi> upon the Coast of
<hi>Guinney,</hi> are two; which would be upon the matter
to be content with a very vile Trade in the <hi>East-Indies,</hi>
under their Controule, and with none in
<hi>Guinney;</hi> and yet those are not Propositions unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
enough to please the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who reproach
<hi>France</hi> for interposing for Peace, instead of assisting
them in the War; boldly insisting upon the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
the Contagion in <hi>London,</hi> and some other parts
of the Kingdom gives them; by which, they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
say, the King will be no longer able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a Fleet against them at Sea; &amp; as if God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
had sent this Heavy Visitation upon the Kingdome
on their behalfe, and to expose it to their Malice and
insolence; They Load us with such Reproaches as
the Civility of no other Language will admit the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
the Truth is, they have a Dialect of Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:95795:10"/>
so peculiar to their Language, and their People,
that it is high time for all Kings and Princes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
them to some Reformation, if they intend to hold
Correspondence or Commerce with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> You see in what posture
we stand with reference to our Neighbours abroad, who
are our declared Enemies, their Malice &amp; Activity to
make others declare themselves so too; the great Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
they make, &amp; even Declarations, that they
will have another Battail, towards which, they have
in readiness an equal number of new, greater, and
better Ships, to those they have lost, furnished with
larger and greater Artillery; so that if they were to
be manned with any other Nation but their own, they
might be worthy our apprehension: What Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are to be made on our part, you can best
judge: I have fully obeyed the Command that was
laid upon Me, in making You this plain, clear, true
Narrative of what hath passed; I have no Order to
make Reflection upon it, nor any Deduction from it:
The King Himself hath told You, that the noble, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralel'd
Supply You have already given Him, is,
upon the Matter spent; Spent with all the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions
of good Husbandry, that the nature of the
Affair will bear: What is more to be done, He leaves
entirely to your own generous understandings, being
not more assured of any thing that is to come in this
World; then that the same Noble Indignation; for
the honor of the King and the Nation, that first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked
you to inflame the King Himself, will continue
the same Passion still boyling in your Loyal Breasts;
that all the World may see, which they hoped never
to have seen, that never Prince and People were so
entirely united in their Affections, for their true,
joynt, inseparable Honor, as their onely sure infallible
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:95795:10"/>
expedient to preserve their distinct several Interest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> Having yet onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
you a short view of your forraign Enemies, it
may not be altogether unseasonable that you take a
little Prospect of those at home, Those unquiet and
restless Spirits in your own Bowels; upon whose
Infidelity, I doubt, your Enemies abroad have more
dependance, then upon their own Fleets. I must
appeal to every one of your Observations, whether
the Countenances of these Men have not appeared to
you more erected, more insolent in all Places since
the beginning of this War, then they were before:
In what readiness they were, if any misfortune had
befallen the Kings Fleet (which they promised them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves)
to have brought the Calamity into your
Fields, and into your Houses, is notoriously known:
The horrid Murtherers of Our late Royal Master,
have been received into the most secret Councels in
<hi>Holland,</hi> and other infamous prostituted Persons of
our Nation, are admitted to a share in the Conduct of
their Affairs, and maintain their Correspondence here
upon liberal Allowances and Pensions: Too many of
His Majesties Subjects, who were lent by this Crown
to assist and defend this ingrateful State against their
Enemies, have been miserably wrought upon, for the
keeping a vile, mean subsistance, rather then lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
to renounce their Allegiance, and become Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to their native Countrey; some of whom, have
wantonly put themselves on Board the Enemies Fleet
without Command or Office, purely out of appetite
and delight to rebel against their King, and to worry
their Countrey; it is great pity these Men should not be
taught by some exemplary Brand, that their Allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
is not circumscribed within the four Seas, but
that they have obligations upon them of Duty and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95795:11"/>
Loyalty towards the King, in what part soever of
the World they shall inhabit.</p>
            <p>Their Freinds at home Impatient of Longer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays
for the Successes they have promised themselves,
and for the Succours which others had promised to
send to them, made no doubt of doing the business them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
if they could but appoint a lucky day to begin
the work, and you had heard of them in all places up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the third of the last month (their so much celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Third of September) if the Great Vigilance and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable
Industry of the Good General, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
awake for the Kings Safety, and the Peace of
the kingdom, had not two days before Apprehended
the Seditious Leaders, and given Advertisements for
the Securing of others in most parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
by the Confessions of Many of Whom, their
Wicked Designe is enough Manifested and ready for
Justice; Yet some of the Principal Persons are not
yet taken, and some others got themselves rescu'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
they were apprehended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords and Gentlemen,</hi> let it not I Beseech
You, be said of us, what was heretofore said of the
Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> when they were prosperous enough,
and when they had obtained greater Victories over
their enemies abroad then We have done, <hi>Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus
ingeniis citiùs defuit ars, quâ civem regant,
quàm quâ hostem perdant.</hi> Let not those Scorpions
be Kept Warme in our Bosoms till they Sting us to
Death; let not those who Hate the Government,
would Destroy the Government, be sheltred under the
Shadow and Protection of the Goverment. It is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssible,
and God knows it is but possible, that some
men who are not Friends to this or that part of the
Government (for you are not to Believe that they
always discover, what in Truth they are Most angry
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95795:11"/>
with) who would not buy those Alterations they
Most Desire at the Price of a Civil War; they would
bring it fairly about, wait for a Godly Parliament,
and do all by their Consent; yet those Persons must
not take it ill that we cannot desire they should ever
have it in their Power to bring those Alterations to
pass, by those means they now seem to abhor; and I
do heartily wish, I am sure they will not be the worse
Men, nor the wore Subjects for it, that they would a
little reflect upon what is past, remember how much
they have once done, more then they intended to have
done; nay, what they heartily abhorr'd the thought
of doing; and they will then finde the onely way to
preserve themselves innocent, is to keep their
Minds from being vitiated by the first Impressions,
by Jealousies, Murmurings, and Repinings, and above
all, by their Conversations with those Men, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
toward them, who would Sacrifice the Peace
of the Kingdome to their own Ambition, Pride, and
even to their Humour; If you carefully provide for
the suppressing Your Enemies at home, which will put
You to little other Expence, then of Courage, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
and Circumspection, you will find your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
abroad less exalted, and in a short time more
enclined to live in amity with You, then to make
War upon you, especially when they see you doe <hi>In
bello pacis gerere negotium;</hi> and that you take the
carrying on the War to Heart, as the Best, and the
only Expedient to Produce a Happy and an Honest
Peace.</p>
