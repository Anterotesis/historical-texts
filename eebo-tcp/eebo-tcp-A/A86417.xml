         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:114870:4"/>
things on the left ſide appeare to be on the right, &amp; all things on the right ſide to be as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the left; yet the naturall right of Preſervation which we all receive from the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable Dictates of Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will not admit it to be a Vice, though it confeſſe it to be an Unhappineſſe. Now that with <hi>Cato</hi> himſelfe, (a Perſon of ſo great a renowne for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome) Animoſity ſhould ſo prevaile inſtead of Judgement, and Partiality inſtead of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the very ſame thing which he thought equall in his Popular State, he ſhould cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as unjuſt in a Monarchical, other men perhaps may have leiſure to admire. But I have been long ſince of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, That there was never yet any more-then-vulgar-pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that had the luck of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceptable to the Giddy
<pb facs="tcp:114870:4"/>
People; but either it hath not been underſtood, or elſe having been ſo, hath been levell'd and cryed downe. The more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Actions and Apothegms both of the Greeks and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans have been indebted for their Eulogies not ſo much to the <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as to the <hi>Greatneſſe</hi> of them, and very many times to that proſperous uſurpation (with which our Hiſtories doe ſo mutually upbraid each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) which as a conquering Torrent carryes all before it, as well publick Agents as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Actions, in the ſtreame of Time. Wiſdome properly ſo call'd is nothing elſe but this, <hi>The perfect knowledge of the Truth in all matters whatſoever.</hi> Which being derived from the Regiſters and Records of <hi>Things,</hi> and that as 'twere through the Conduit of certain definite Appellations, cannot
<pb facs="tcp:114870:5"/>
poſſibly be the work of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Acuteneſſe, but of a well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballanc'd Reaſon, which by the <hi>Compendium</hi> of a word, we call <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> For by this it is, that a way is open'd to us, in which we travell from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of particular things to the Inference or reſult of univerſall Actions. Now look how many ſorts of things there are which properly fall within the cognizance of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, into ſo many branches does the tree of Philoſophy divide it ſelfe. And from the diverſity of the matter about which they are converſant, there hath been given to thoſe branches a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Names too: For treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Figures, tis call'd <hi>Geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try;</hi> of motion, <hi>Phyſick;</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall right, <hi>Moralls;</hi> put all together, and they make up <hi>Philoſophy.</hi> Juſt as the Britiſh, the Atlantick, and the Indian
<pb facs="tcp:114870:5"/>
Seas, being diverſly chriſten'd from the diverſity of their ſhoares, doe notwithſtanding all together make up <hi>The Ocean.</hi> And truly the Geometricians have very admirably perform'd their part. For whatſoever aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance doth accrew to the life of man, whether from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the Heavens, or from the deſcription of the Earth, from the notation of Times, or from the remoteſt Experiments of Navigation; Finally, whatſoever things they are in which this preſent Age doth differ from the rude ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſſe of Antiquity, we muſt acknowledge to be a debt which we owe meerly to Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry. If the Morall Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers had as happily diſcharg'd their duty, I know not what could have been added by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Induſtry to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that happineſſe, which is
<pb facs="tcp:114870:6"/>
conſiſtent with humane life. For were the nature of humane Actions as diſtinctly knowne, as the nature of <hi>Quantity</hi> in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ometricall Figures, the ſtrength of <hi>Avarice</hi> and <hi>Ambition,</hi> which is ſuſtained by the erroneous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of the Vulgar, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Wrong,</hi> would preſently faint and languiſh; And Mankinde ſhould enjoy ſuch an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Peace, that (unleſſe it were for habitation, on ſuppoſition that the Earth ſhould grow too narrow for her Inhabitants) there would hardly be left any prete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce for war. But now on the contrary, that neither the Sword nor the Pen ſhould be allowed any <hi>Ceſſation;</hi> That the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law of Nature ſhould loſe its growth, not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing a whit beyond its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſtature; that there ſhould ſtill be ſuch ſiding with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb facs="tcp:114870:6"/>
factions of Philoſophers, that the very ſame Action ſhould bee decryed by ſome, and as much elevated by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that the very ſame man ſhould at ſeverall times em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace his ſeverall opinions, and eſteem his own Actions farre otherwiſe in himſelfe then he does in others; Theſe I ſay are ſo many ſignes, ſo many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Arguments, that what hath hitherto been written by Morall Philoſophers, hath not made any progreſs in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth; but yet have took with the world, not ſo much by giving any light to the underſtanding, as entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Affections, whileſt by the ſucceſſefull Rhetoricati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their ſpeech they have confirmed them in their raſhly received opinions. So that this part of Philoſophy hath ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſame <hi>destiny</hi> with the
<pb facs="tcp:114870:7"/>
               <hi>publick Wayes,</hi> which lye open to all paſſengers to traverſe up and down or <hi>the ſame lot with high wayes and open ſtreets;</hi> Some for divertiſement, and ſome for buſineſſe; ſo that what with the Impertinencies of ſome, and the Altercations of others, thoſe wayes have never a ſeeds time, and therefore yield never a harveſt. The onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which unluckines ſhould ſeem to be this; That amongſt all the writers of that part of Philoſophy, there is not one that hath uſed an idoneous Principle of Tractation. For we may not, as in a Circle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the handling of a Science from what point we pleaſe. There is a certain Clue of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, whoſe beginning is in the dark, but by the benefit of whoſe Conduct, wee are led as 'twere by the hand into the cleareſt light, ſo that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb facs="tcp:114870:7"/>
of Tractation is to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from that Darkneſſe, and then the light to be carried thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the irradiating its doubts. As often therefore as any writer, doth either weakly forſake that Clue, or wilfully cut it aſunder, he deſcribes the Footſteps, not of his progreſſe in <hi>Science,</hi> but of his wandring from it. And upon this it was, that when I applyed my Thoughts to the Inveſtigation of Naturall Juſtice, I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently advertiſed from the very word <hi>Juſtice,</hi> (wich ſignifies a ſteady Will of giving every one his <hi>Owne)</hi> that my firſt enquiry was to be, from whence it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, that any man ſhould call any thing rather his <hi>Owne,</hi> then <hi>another mans.</hi> And when I found that this proceeded not from Nature, but Conſent, (for what Nature at firſt laid forth in common, men did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb facs="tcp:114870:8"/>
diſtribute into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>Impropriations,</hi> I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted from thence to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Inquiry; namely to what end, and upon what Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſives, when all was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every mans in common, men did rather think it fitting, that every man ſhould have his Incloſure; And I found the reaſon was, that from a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of Goods, there muſt needs ariſe Contention whoſe enjoyment ſhould be greateſt, and from that Contention all kind of Calamities muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voydably enſue, which by the inſtinct of Nature, every man is taught to ſhun. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus arrived at two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximes of humane Nature, the one ariſing from the <hi>concupiſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> part, which deſires to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to it ſelfe the uſe of thoſe things in which all others have a joynt intereſt, the other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb facs="tcp:114870:8"/>
from the <hi>rationall,</hi> which teaches every man to fly a contre-naturall Diſſolution, as the greateſt miſchiefe that can arrive to Nature; Which Principles being laid down, I ſeem from them to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated by a moſt evident connexion, in this little work of mine, firſt the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Leagues and Contracts, and thence the rudiments both of morall and of civill Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. That Appendage which is added concerning the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, hath been done with this intent, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of God Almighty in the Law of nature, might not ſeem repugnant to the written Law, revealed to us in his word. I have alſo been very wary in the whole tenour of my diſcourſe, not to meddle with the civill Lawes of any particular nation whatſoever, That is to ſay, I

But in after times. <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> is ſaid to have been the firſt, who truly loved this civill Soience, although hitherto not throughly understood, yet glimmering forth as through a cloud in the government of the Common weale, and that he ſet ſo great a value on this, that utterly abandoning, and deſpiſing all other parts of Philoſopy, he wholly
<pb facs="tcp:114870:11"/>
embraced this, as judging it onely wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the labour of his minde. After him comes <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle, Cicero,</hi> and other Philoſophers, as well Greeke, as Latine, and now at length all men of all Nations, not only Philoſophers, but even the vnlgar, have, and doe ſtill deale with this as a matter of eaſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and proſtitute to every Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit, and to be attained without any great care or ſtudy, and which makes mainly for its dignity, thoſe who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves to have it, or are in ſuch employment, as they ought to have it, doe ſo wonderfully pleaſe themſelves in its <hi>Idaea,</hi> as they eaſily brooke the followers of other arts to be eſteemed and ſtyled ingenuous, learned, skilfull, what you will; except prudent: for this Name, in regard of civill knowledge, they preſume to be due to themſelves onely. Whether therefore the worth of arts is to be weighed by the worthineſſe of the Perſons who entertain them, or by the number of thoſe who have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of them, or by the judgement of the wiſeſt; certainly this muſt carry it, which ſo neerly relates to <hi>Princes,</hi> and others engaged in the government of mankinde, in whoſe adulterate Species

               </gap> doe delight themſelves, and in which the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wits of <hi>Philoſophers</hi> have been converſant. The benefit of it when rightly delivered (that is) when deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from true Principles by evident connexion, we ſhall then beſt diſcerne, when we ſhall but well have conſidered the miſchiefes that have befallen man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde in its counterfeit and babling form; for in ſuch matters as are ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the exerciſe of our wits, if any errour eſcape us, it is without hurt; neither is there any loſſe, but of time onely: but in thoſe things which every man ought to meditate for the ſteerage of his life, it neceſſarily happens; that not onely from errours, but even from ignorance it ſelfe, there ariſe offences, contentions, nay even ſlaughter it ſelfe. Look now, how great a prejudice theſe are, ſuch, and ſo great is the benefit ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from this doctrine of morality, truly declared. How many Kings (and thoſe good men too) hath this one errour, That a Tyrant King might lawfully be put to death, been the ſlaughter of? How many throats hath this falſe poſition cut, That a <hi>Prince</hi> for ſome cauſes may by ſome certain men be depoſed? And
<pb facs="tcp:114870:12"/>
what blood-ſhed hath not this errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine cauſed, That Kings are not ſuperiours to, but adminiſtrators for the multitude? Laſtly, how many rebellions hath this opinion been the cauſe of, which teacheth that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge whether the commands of Kings be juſt or unjuſt, belongs to private men; and that before they yeeld obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, they not only may, but ought to diſpute them? Beſides, in the morall Philoſophy now commonly received, there are many things no leſſe dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then thoſe, which it matters not now to recite. I ſuppoſe thoſe antients fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw this, who rather choſe to have the Science of Juſtice wrapt up in fables, then openly expoſed to disputations: for before ſuch queſtions bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be moved, Princes did not ſue for, but already exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the ſupreme power. They kept their Empire entire, not by arguments, but by puniſhing the wicked, and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good; likewiſe Subjects did not meaſure what was juſt by the ſayings and judgements of private men, but by the Lawes of the Realme; nor were they kept in peace by diſputations, but by power and authority: yea they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verenced the ſupreme power, whether
<pb facs="tcp:114870:13"/>
reſiding in one man or in a councell, as a certain viſible divinity; therefore they little uſed as in our dayes, to joyn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ambitious, and helliſh ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to the utter ruine of their State; for they could not entertain ſo ſtrange a phanſie as not to deſire the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that by which they were preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; in truth, the ſimplicity of thoſe times was not yet capable of ſo learned a piece of folly. Wherefore it was peace, and a golden age, which ended not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>Saturn</hi> being expelled, it was taught lawfull to take up arms againſt Kings. This I ſay, the Antients not only themſelves ſaw, but in one of their fables, they ſeem very aptly to have ſignified it to us; for they ſay, that when <hi>Ixion</hi> was invited by <hi>Jupiter</hi> to a banquet, he fell in love, and began to court <hi>Juno</hi> her ſelfe; offering to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her, he clasp't a clowd, from whence the <hi>Centaures</hi> proceeded, by nature halfe men, halfe horſes, a fierce, a fighting, and unquiet generation; which changing the names only, is as much as if they ſhould have ſaid, that private men being called to Counſels of State, deſired to proſtitute juſtice, the onely ſiſter and wife of the ſupreme, to
<pb facs="tcp:114870:13"/>
their own judgements, and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but embracing a falſe and empty ſhadow inſtead of it, they have begotten thoſe hermophrodite opinions of morall Philoſophers, partly right and comely, partly brutall and wilde, the cauſes of all contentions, and blood-ſheds. Since therefore ſuch opinions are daily ſeen to ariſe, if any man now ſhall diſpell thoſe clowds, and by moſt firm reaſons demonſtrate that there are no authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doctrines conccening right and wrong, good and evill, beſides the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted Lawes in each Realme, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and that the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any future action will prove juſt or unjuſt, good or ill, is to be demanded of none, but thoſe to whom the ſupreme hath committed the interpretation of his Lawes; ſurely he will not only ſhew us the high way to peace, but will alſo teach us how to avoyd the cloſe, darke, and dangerous by-paths of faction and ſedition, then which I know not what can be thought more profitable.</p>
            <p>Concerning my Method, I thought it not ſufficient to uſe a plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtyle in what I had to deliver, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept I took my begining from the very matter of civill goverment, and
<pb facs="tcp:114870:14"/>
thence proceeded to its generation, and form, and the firſt beginning of juſtice; for every thing is beſt underſtood by its conſtitutive cauſes; for as in a watch, or ſome ſuch ſmall engine, the matter, figure, and motion of the wheeles, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well be known, except it be taken in ſunder, and viewed in parts; ſo to make a more curious ſearch into the rights of States, and duties of Subjects, it is neceſſary, (I ſay not to take them in ſunder, but yet that) they be ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, as if they were diſſolved, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that wee rightly underſtand what the quality of humane nature is, in what matters it is, in what not fit to make up a civill government, and how men muſt be agreed among themſelves, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to grow up into a well-grounded State. Having therefore followed this kind of Method; In the firſt place I ſet down for a Principle by experience known to all men, and denied by none, to wit, that the diſpoſitions of men are naturally ſuch, that except they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained through feare of ſome coercive power, every man will diſtrust and dread each other, and as by naturall right he may, ſo by neceſſity he will be forced to make uſe of the ſtrength hee
<pb facs="tcp:114870:14"/>
hath, toward the preſervatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of himſelf. You will object perhaps, that there are ſome who deny this, truly ſo it happens, that very many do deny it. But ſhall I therefore ſeem to fight againſt my ſelf becauſe I affirm that the ſame men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, and deny the ſame thing? In truth I do not, but they do, whoſe actions diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow what their diſcourſes approve of. We ſee all countries though they be at peace with their neighbours, yet guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their Frontiers with armed men, their Townes with Walls and Ports, and keeping conſtant watches. To what purpoſe is all this, if there be no feare of the neighbouring power? Wee ſee even in well-governed States, where there are lawes and puniſhments ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for offendors, yet particular men travell not without their Sword by their ſides, for their defences, neither ſleep they without ſhutting not only their doores againſt their fellow Sebjects, but alſo their Trunks and Coffers for feare of domeſtiques. Can men give a clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer teſtimony of the diſtrnſt they have each of other, and all, of all? How ſince they doe thus, and even Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes as well as men, they publiquely profeſſe their mutuall feare and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
<pb facs="tcp:114870:15"/>
But in diſputing they deny it, thats as much as to ſay, that out of a deſire they have to contradict others, they gainſay themſelves. Some object that this principle being admitted, it would needs follow, not onely that all men were wicked (which perhaps though it ſeeme hard, yet we muſt yeeld to, ſince it is ſo clearly declar'd by holy writ) but alſo wicked by nature (which cannot be granted without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety) But this, that men are evill by nature, followes not from this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for though the wicked were fewer then the righteous, yet becauſe we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſtinguiſh them, there is a neceſſity of ſuſpecting, heeding, anticipating, ſubjugating, ſelfe-defending, ever inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the moſt honeſt, and faireſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition'd; much leſſe do's it follow that thoſe who are wicked are ſo by nature, for though from nature, that is from their firſt birth, as they are meerly ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Creatures, they have this diſpoſition, that immediately as much as in them lies, they deſire and doe whatſoever is beſt pleaſing to them, that either through feare they fly from, or through hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe repell thoſe dangers which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach them, yet are they not for this
<pb facs="tcp:114870:15"/>
reaſon to be accounted wicked; for the affections of the minde which ariſe onely from the lower parts of the ſoule are not wicked themſelves, but the actions thence proceeding may be ſo ſometimes, as when they are either offenſive, or againſt duty. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe you give Children all they aske for, they are peeviſh, and cry, I and ſtrike their Patents ſometimes, and all this they have from nature, yet are they free from guilt, neither may we properly call them wicked; firſt, becauſe they cannot hurt; next, becauſe wanting the free uſe of reaſon they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from all duty; theſe when they come to riper yeares having acquired power whereby they may doe hurt, if they ſhall continue to doe the ſame things, then truly they both begin to be, and are properly accounted wicked; In ſo much as a wicked man is almoſt the ſame thing with a childe growne ſtrong and ſturdy, or a man of a childiſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition; and malice the ſame with a defect of reaſon in that age, when na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ought to be better governed through good education and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe therefore we will ſay that men are naturally evill, becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:114870:16"/>
they receive not their education and uſe of reaſon from nature, we muſt needs acknowledge that men may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive deſire, feare, anger, and other paſſions from nature, and yet not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the evill effects of thoſe unto na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The fonndation therefore which I have laid ſtanding firme, I demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in the firſt place, that the ſtate of men without civill ſociety (which ſtate we may properly call the ſtate of nature) is nothing elſe but a meere warre of all againſt all; and in that warre all men have equall right unto all things; Next, that all men as ſoon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as they arrive to underſtanding of this hatefull condition, doe de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ire (even nature it ſelfe compelling them) to be freed from this miſery. But that this cannot be done except by compact, they all quitt that right which they have unto all things. Furthermore I declare, and confirme what the nature of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts is; how and by what meanes the right of one might be transfer'd unto another to make their compacts valid; alſo what rights, and to whom they muſt neceſſarily be granted for the eſtabiſhling of Peace, I meane what thoſe dictates of reaſon are, which may
<pb facs="tcp:114870:16"/>
properly be term'd the Lawes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and all theſe are contain'd in that part of this booke which I entitle <hi>Liberty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe grounds thus layd, I ſhew farther what civill government, and the ſupreme power in it, and the divers kinds of it are; by what meanes it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo, &amp; what rights particular men, who intend to conſtitune this civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, muſt ſo neceſſarily transfer from themſelves on the ſupreme power, whether it be one man, or an aſſembly of men, that except they doe ſo it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appeare to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e no civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the rights which all men have to all things, that is the rights of Warre will ſtill remaine. Next, I diſtinguiſh the divers kindes of it, to wit, Monarchie, Ariſtocratie, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratie, and paternall Dominion, and that of Maſters over their Servants, I declare how they are conſtituted, and I compare their ſeverall conveniences and inconveniences each with other: furthermore, I unfold what thoſe things are which deſtroy it, and what his or their duty is who rule in chiefe. Laſt of all, I explicate the natures of the Law, and of ſinne, and I diginguiſh
<pb facs="tcp:114870:17"/>
Law from Counſell, from compact' from that which I call Right; all, which I comprehend under the title of <hi>Dominion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the laſt part of it which is enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>Religion,</hi> leſt that right which by ſtrong reaſon I had confirm'd the Soveraigne powers in the preceding diſcourſe have over their Subjects, might ſeem to be repugnant to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, I ſhew in the firſt place how it repugns not the Divine right, for as much as God overrules all rulers by nature, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by the Dictates of naturall reaſon. In the ſecond, for as much as God himſelfe had a peculiar dominion over the <hi>Jewes</hi> by vertue of that antient Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. In the third, becauſe God doth now rule over us Chriſtians by vertue of our Covenant of Baptiſme; and therefore the authority of Rulers in chiefe, or of civill government, is not at all, we ſee, contrary to Religion.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place I declare what duties are neceſſarily requir'd ſrom us, to enter into the <hi>Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> and of thoſe I plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, and conclude out of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimonies of holy writ, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb facs="tcp:114870:17"/>
to the interpretation made by all, that the obedience which I have affirm'd to be due from particular Chriſtian Subjects unto their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes cannot poſſibly in the leaſt ſort be repugnant unto Chriſtian Religion. You have ſeene my Method, receive now the reaſon which mov'd me to write this; I was ſtudying <hi>Philoſphie</hi> for my minde ſake, and I had gathered together its firſt Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in all kinds, and having digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them into three Sections by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, I thought to have written them ſo as in the firſt I would have treated oſ a body, and its generall properties; in the ſecond of man and his ſpeciall faculties, and affections; in the third, of civill government and the duties of Subjects: Wherefore the firſt Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have contained the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>irſt <hi>Philoſophie,</hi> and certaine elements oſ Phyſick; in it we would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the reaſons oſ Time, Place, Cauſe, Power, Relation, Proportion, Quantity, Figure, and motion. In the ſecond we would have beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about imagination, Memory, intellect, ratio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ination, appetite, Will, good and Evill, honeſt and diſhoneſt,
<pb facs="tcp:114870:18"/>
and the like; what this laſt Section handles, I have now already ſhewed you. Whilest I contrive, order, pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and ſlowly compoſe theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for I onely doe reaſon, I diſpute not. It ſo happen'd in the interim, that my Country ſome few yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the civill Warres did rage, was boyling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

raſhly admit not for Gods Word all which either openly or privately they ſhall pretend to bee ſo. I ſay more plainly, if any Preacher, Confeſſor, or Caſuist, ſhal but ſay that this doctrin is agreeable with Gods word, namely, That the chief ruler, nay any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate man may lawfully be put to death without the chiefes command, or that Subjects may reſiſt, conſpire, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant againſt the ſupreme power, that ye by no means beleeve them, but inſtantly declare their names. He who approves of theſe reaſons, will alſo like my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in writing this book.</p>
            <p>Laſt of al, I have propounded to my ſelf this rule through this whole diſcourſe; Firſt, not to define ought which concerns the juſtice of ſingle actions, but leave the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be determined by the laws. Next not to diſpute the laws of any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſpecial, that is, not to point which are the laws of any country, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what the laws of all countries are. Thirdly not to ſeem of opinion, that there is a leſſe proportion of obedience due to an <hi>Ariſtocraty</hi> or <hi>D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb facs="tcp:114870:19"/>
is the moſt commodious govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which one thing alone I confeſſe in this whole book not to be demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but only probably stated) yet every where I expreſly ſay, that in all kind of Government whatſoever, there ought to be a ſupreme and equall power. Fourthly, not in any wiſe to diſpute the poſitions of Divines, except th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe which ſtrip Subjects of their obedience, and ſhake the foundations of civill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Laſtly, leſt I might imprudently ſet forth ſomewhat of which there would be no need, what I had thus written, I would not preſently expoſe to publique intereſt, wherefore I got ſome few co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies privately diſperst among ſome of my friends, that diſcrying the opinions of others, if any things appeared errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, hard, or obſcure, I might correct, ſoften, and explain them.</p>
            <p>Theſe things I found moſt bitterly excepted againſt: that I had made the civill powers too large, but this by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall Perſons; that I had utterly taken away liberty of conſcience, but this by Sectaries; that I had ſet <hi>Princes</hi> above the civil Laws, but this by Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers; wherefore I was not much moved by theſe mens reprehenſions, (as who in
<pb facs="tcp:114870:20"/>
doing this did but do their own buſineſs) except it were tye thoſe knots ſomewhat faster.</p>
            <p>But for their ſakes who have a litle been ſtaggered at the Principles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to wit the nature of men, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or right of nature, the nature of compacts and contracts, and the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of civill government, becauſe in finding fault they have not ſo much followed their Paſsions, as their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, I have therefore in ſome places added ſome annotations whereby I preſumed I might give ſome ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their differing thoughts; Laſtly I have endevoured to offend none beſide thoſe whoſe Principles theſe contradict, and whoſe tender mindes are lightly offended by every difference of opinions.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if ye ſhall meet with ſome things which have more of ſharpneſſe, and leſſe of certainty then they ought to have, ſince they are not ſo much ſpoken for the maintenance of parties, as the eſtabliſhment of peace, and by one whoſe juſt grief for the preſent calamities of his country, may very charitably be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſome liberty, it is his only requeſt to ye Readers, ye will deign to receive them with an equall mind.</p>

                     </gap>lves ſhould then call Lawes. Which Axiom, though received by moſt, is yet certainly Falſe, and an Errour proceeding from our too ſlight contemplation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; for they who ſhall more narrowly look into the Cauſes for which Men come together, and delight in each others company, ſhall eaſily find that this happens not becauſe naturally it could hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen no otherwiſe, but by Accident: For if by nature one Man ſhould Love another (that is) as Man, there could no reaſon be return'd why every Man ſhould not equally Love every Man, as being equally Man, or why he ſhould rather frequent thoſe whoſe Society affords him Honour or Profit. We doe not therefore by nature ſeek Society for its own ſake, but that we may receive ſome Honour or Profit from it; theſe we deſire Primarily, that Secondarily: How by what
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114870:24"/>
advice Men doe meet, will be beſt known by obſerving thoſe things which they doe when they are met: For if they meet for Traffique, it's plaine every man regards not his Fellow, but his Buſineſſe; if to diſcharge ſome Office, a certain Market<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendſhip is begotten, which hath more of Jealouſie in it then True love, and whence Factions ſometimes may ariſe, but Good will never; if for Pleaſure, and Recreation of mind, every man is wont to pleaſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf moſt with thoſe things which ſtirre up laughter, whence he may (according to the nature of that which is Ridiculous) by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of another mans Defects and Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, paſſe the more currant in his owne opinion; and although this be ſometimes innocent, and without offence; yet it is manifeſt they are not ſo much delighted with the Society, as their own Vain glory. But for the moſt part, in theſe kind of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, we wound the abſent, their whole life, ſayings, actions are examin'd, judg'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd; nay, it is very rare, but ſome preſent receive a fling before they part, ſo as his reaſon was not ill, who was wont al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes at parting to goe out laſt. And theſe are indeed the true delights of Society, unto which we are carryed by nature. <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by thoſe paſſions which are incident to all Creatures, untill either by ſad experience, or good precepts, it ſo fall out (which in many never happens) that the Appetite, of preſent matters, be dul'd with the memory of things paſt, without which, the diſcourſe of moſt quick and nimble men, on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is but cold and hungry.</p>

But if it ſo happen, that being met, they paſſe their time in relating ſome Stories, and one of them begins to tell one which concernes himſelfe; inſtantly every one of the reſt moſt greedily deſires to ſpeak of himſelf too; if one relate ſome wonder, the reſt will tell you miracles, if they have them, if not, they'l fein them: Laſtly, that I may ſay ſomewhat of them who pretend to be wiſer then others; if they meet to talk of Philoſophy, look how many men, ſo many would be eſteem'd Maſters, or elſe they not only love not their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All Society
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114870:25"/>
therefore is either for Gain, or for Glory, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> not ſo much for love of our Fellowes, as for love of our Selves: but no ſociety can be great, or laſting, which begins from Vain Glory; becauſe that Glory is like Honour, if all men have it, no man hath it, for they conſiſt in compariſon and precel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; neither doth the ſociety of others advance any whit the cauſe of my glorying in my ſelfe; for every man muſt account himſelf, ſuch as he can make himſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of others. But though the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of this life may be much farthered by mutuall help, ſince yet thoſe may be better attain'd to by Dominion, then by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of others: I hope no body will doubt but that men would much more greedily be carryed by Nature, if all fear were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to obtain Dominion, then to gaine Society. We muſt therefore reſolve, that the Originall of all great, and laſting Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, conſiſted not in the mutuall good will men had towards each other, but in the (*) mutuall fear they had of each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                     <hi>Society among men, and none living out of it, ſince we diſcern all deſirous of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, and mutuall correſpondence, it may ſeeme a wonderfull kind of ſtupidity, to lay in the very threſhold of this Doctrine, ſuch a ſtumbling block before the Readers, as to deny</hi> Man to be born ſit for Society: <hi>Therefore I muſt more plainly ſay, That it is true indeed, that to Man, by nature, or as Man, that is, as ſoone as he is born, Solitude is an enemy; for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants have need of others to help them to live,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114870:25"/>
and thoſe of riper years to help them to live well, wherefore I deny not that men (even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture compelling) deſire to come together. But civill Societies are not meer Meetings, but Bonds, to the making whereof, Faith and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts are neceſſary: the Vertue whereof to Children, and Fooles, and the Profit whereof to thoſe who have not yet tasted the miſeries which accompany its defects, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; whence it happens, that thoſe, becauſe they know not what Society is, cannot enter into it; theſe, becauſe ignorant of the benefit it brings, care not for it. Manifest therefore it is, that all men, becauſe they are born in Infancy, are born unapt for Society. Many alſo (perhaps moſt men) either through defect of minde, or want of education remain unfit during the whole courſe of their lives; yet have they Infants, as well as thoſe of riper years, an humane nature; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Man is made ſit for Society not by Nature, but by Education: furthermore, although Man were born in ſuch a condition as to deſire it, it followes not, that he therefore were Born ſit to enter into it; for it is one thing to deſire, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be in capacity <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">III. The cauſe of mutuall fear conſiſts partly in the naturall equality of men, partly <note place="margin">That men by nature are all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall.</note> in their mutuall will of hurting: whence it comes to paſſe that we can neither expect from others, nor promiſe to our ſelves the leaſt ſecurity: For if we look on men full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown, and conſider how brittle the frame of our humane body is, (which periſhing, all its ſtrength, vigour, and wiſdome it ſelfe periſheth with it) and how eaſie a matter it is, even for the weakeſt man to kill the ſtrongeſt, there is no reaſon why any man truſting to his own ſtrength ſhould conceive himſelf made by nature above others: they are equalls who can doe equall things one againſt the other; but they who can do the greateſt things, (namely kill) can doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall things.

                  </argument>
                  <p n="1">I. ANother of the Lawes of Nature is, <note place="margin">The ſecond Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</note> to <hi>performe Contracts,</hi> or <hi>to keep truſt;</hi> for it hath been ſhewed in the foregoing Chapter that the Law of Nature com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands every man, as a thing neceſſary, to obtain Peace; to conveigh certain rights from each to other, and that this (as often as it ſhall happen to be done) is called a <hi>Contract:</hi> But this is ſo farre forth onely conducible to peace, as we ſhall performe our ſelves, what we contract with others, ſhall be done, or omitted; and in vaine would Contracts be made, unleſſe we ſtood to them. Becauſe therefore, <hi>to ſtand to our Covenants,</hi> or <hi>to keep faith,</hi> is a thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the obtaining of peace, it will prove by the ſecond Article of the ſecond
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114870:40"/>
Chapter to be a precept of the <hi>naturall Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither is there in this matter, any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception <note place="margin">That Faith is to be kept with all men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> of the perſons, with whom we Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, as if they keep no faith with others; or hold, that none ought to be kept, or are guilty of any other kind of vice: for he that Contracts, in that he doth contract, denies that action to be in vaine, and it is againſt reaſon for a knowing man to doe a thing in vain; and if he think himſelf not bound to keep it, in thinking ſo, he affirms the Contract to be made in vain: He therefore, who Contracts with one with whom he thinks he is not bound to keep faith, he doth at once think a Contract to be a thing done in vaine, and not in vaine, which is abſurd. Either therefore we muſt hold truſt with all men, or elſe not bargain with them; that is, either there muſt be a declared Warre, or a ſure and faithfull Peace.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The breaking of a <hi>Bargain,</hi> as alſo <note place="margin">Injury de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd.</note> the taking back of a gift, (which ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſome action, or omiſſion) is called an INJURY: But that action, or omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, is called <hi>unjuſt,</hi> inſomuch as an <hi>injury;</hi> and an <hi>unjuſt</hi> action, or omiſſion, ſignifie the ſame thing, and both are the ſame with <hi>breach of Contract and truſt:</hi> And it ſeemes the word <hi>Iniury</hi> came to be given to any action, or omiſſion, becauſe they were <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Right;</hi> he that acted, or omitted, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving before conveyed his Right to ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And there is ſome likeneſſe between that, which in the common courſe of life we call <hi>Injury;</hi> and that, which in the Schools is uſually called <hi>Abſurd.</hi> For even as
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114870:41"/>
he, who by Arguments is driven to deny the Aſſertion which he firſt maintain'd, is ſaid to be brought to an <hi>Abſurdity;</hi> in like manner, he who through weakneſſe of mind does, of omits that which before he had by <hi>Contract</hi> promis'd not to doe, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mits an <hi>Injury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and falls into no leſſe contradiction, then he, who in the Schools is reduc'd to an Abſurdity. For by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting for ſome future action, he wills it done; by not doing it, he wills it not done, which is to will a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="4">IV. From theſe grounds it followes, that an (*) injury can be done to no man but <note place="margin">An injury can onely be done to him with whom we Contract.</note> him with who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we enter <hi>Covenant,</hi> or to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſomewhat is made over by deed of gift, or to whom ſomwhat is promis'd by way of bargain, and therefore <hi>damaging</hi> and <hi>inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> are often disjoyn'd: for if a Maſter command his Servant, who hath <hi>promis'd</hi> to obey him, to pay a ſumme of money, or carry ſome preſent to a third man; the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, if he doe it not, hath indeed <hi>damag'd</hi> this third party, but he <hi>injur'd</hi> his Maſter onely. So alſo in a civill government, if any man offend another, with whom he hath made no Contract, he damages him to whom the evill is done, but he injures none but him to whom the power of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment belongs: for if he, who receives the hurt, ſhould expoſtulate the miſchief; and he that did it, ſhould anſwer thus, What art thou to me?

But there are certain naturall Lawes,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114870:49"/>
whoſe exerciſe ceaſeth not even in the time of War it ſelf; for I cannot underſtand what drankenneſſe, or cruelty (that is, Revenge which reſpects not the future good) can ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance toward peace, or the preſervation of any man. Briefly, in the ſtate of nature, what's juſt, and unjust, is not to be eſteem'd by the Actions, but by the Counſell, and Conſcience of the Actor. That which is done out of neceſſity, out of endeavour for peace, for the preſervation of our ſelves, is done with Right; otherwiſe every damage done to a man would be a breach of the naturall Law, and an injury againſt God.</hi>

                     <hi>Naturall Law</hi> is the ſame with the <hi>Morall.</hi> Let us ſee wherefore this is true. We muſt know therefore, that <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill</hi> are names given to things to ſignifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or averſion of them by whom they were given. But the inclinations of men are diverſe, according to their diverſe Conſtitutions, Cuſtomes, Opinions; as we may ſee in thoſe things we apprehend by ſenſe, as by taſting, touching, ſmelling; but much more in thoſe which pertain to the common actions of life, where what this man <hi>commends,</hi> (that is to ſay, calls <hi>Good)</hi> the other <hi>undervalues,</hi> as being <hi>Evil;</hi> Nay, very often the ſame man at diverſe times, <hi>praiſes,</hi> and <hi>dispraiſes</hi> the ſame thing.

ſhould be diſcord, and ſtrife: They are therefore ſo long in the ſtate of War, as by reaſon of the diverſity of the preſent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, they mete Good and Evill by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe meaſures. All men eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this ſtate as long, as they are in it, to be evill, and by conſequence that <hi>Peace</hi> is good.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114870:50"/>
diſpraiſed by thoſe, and termed vice. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there as yet any remedy found by Philoſophers for this matter; for ſince they could not obſerve the goodneſſe of actions to conſiſt in this, that it was in order to Peace, and the evill in this, that it related to diſcord, they built a <hi>morall Philoſophy</hi> wholly eſtranged from the <hi>morall Law,</hi> and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to it ſelf; for they would have the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>vertues</hi> ſeated in a certain kind of <hi>mediocrity betweene two extremes,</hi> and the <hi>vices</hi> in the <hi>extremes themſelves;</hi> which is apparently falſe: For to dare is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and under the name of <hi>fortitude</hi> is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a vertue, although it be an extreme, if the cauſe be approved.

good which among them differs not from their private; but man ſcarce eſteems any thing good which hath not ſomewhat of eminence in the enjoyment, more then that which others doe poſſeſſe. Thirdly, thoſe creatures which are voyd of reaſon, ſee no defect, or think they ſee none, in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſttation of their Common-weales; but in a multitude of men there are many who ſuppoſing themſelves wiſer then others, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to innovate, and divers Innovators innovate divers wayes, which is a meer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, and civill warre.

This ſame may be confirm'd by experience in all the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are, or ever have beene; for though it be ſometimes in doubt, <hi>what Man,</hi> or <hi>Counſell,</hi> hath the <hi>Chief Command,</hi> yet ever there is ſuch a Command, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes exercis'd, except in the time of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Civill War, and then there are two <hi>Chiefe Commands</hi> made out of one: Now thoſe ſeditious perſons who diſpute
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114870:69"/>
againſt abſolute Authority, doe not ſo much care to deſtroy it, as to conveigh it on others; for removing this power, they together take away Civill Society, and a confuſion of all things returnes. There is ſo much obedience joyn'd to this abſolute Right of the Chief Ruler, as is neceſſarily requir'd for the Government of the City, that is to ſay, ſo much as that Right of his may not be granted in vaine. Now this kind of obedience, although for ſome rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons it may ſometimes, by Right, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, yet becauſe a greater cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, we will call it SIMPLE. But the obligation to performe this growes not immediately from that Contract by which we have conveigh'd all our Right on the City, but mediately from hence, That, without obedience, the Cities Right would be fruſtrate, and by conſequence there would be no City conſtituted. For it is one thing if I ſay, I give you Right to Command what you will; another, if I ſay, I will doe whatſoever you Command; and the Command may be ſuch, as I would rather die then doe it; foraſmuch therefore as no man can be bound to will being kill'd, much leſſe is he tyed to that, which to him is worſe then death: if therefore I be commanded to kill my ſelf, I am not bound to doe it; for though I deny to doe it, yet the Right of dominion is not fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, ſince others may be found, who being commanded, will not refuſe to doe it; neither doe I refuſe to doe that which I have contracted to doe. In like manner, if the Chief Ruler command any man to kill
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:114870:70"/>
him, he is not tyed to doe it, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conceiv'd that he made any ſuch Covenant; nor if he command to execute a Parent, whether he be innocent, or guilty, and condemned by the Law, ſince there are others, who, being commanded, will doe that, and a Son will rather die, then live infamous, and hated of all the world. There are many other caſes, in which, ſince the Commands are ſhamefull to be done by ſome, and not by others, Obedience may, by Right, be perform'd by theſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd by thoſe; and this, without breach of that abſolute Right which was given to the Chief Ruler. For in no caſe is the Right taken away from him, of ſlaying thoſe who ſhall refuſe to obey him. But they who thus kill men, although by Right given them from him that hath it, yet if they uſe that Right otherwiſe then right Reaſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, they ſin againſt the Lawes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (that is) againſt God.</p>

But it appears not to moſt men how a City is contain'd in the Perſon of a King; and therefore they object againſt Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Command: Firſt, that if any man had ſuch a Right, the condition of the Citizens
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:114870:70"/>
would be miſerable: For thus they think, He will take all, ſpoil all, kill all; and every man counts it his onely happineſſe that he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoil'd and kill'd. But why ſhould he doe thus? not becauſe he can; for unleſſe he have a mind to it, he will not doe it. Will he, to pleaſe one, or ſome few, ſpoil all the reſt? Firſt, though by Right, that is, without injury to them, he may doe it, yet can he not doe it juſtly, that is, without breach of the Naturall Lawes, and injury againſt God. And therefore there is ſome ſecurity for Subjects in the Oaths which Princes take. Next, if he could juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly doe it, or that he made no account of his Oath, yet appeares there no reaſon why he ſhould deſire it, ſince he findes no good in it. But it cannot be deny'd but a Prince may ſometimes have an inclination to doe wickedly; but grant then that thou hadst given him a power which were not abſolute, but ſo much onely as ſuffic'd to defend thee from the injuries of others, which, if thou wilt be ſafe, is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for thee to give; are not all the ſame things to be feared? for he that hath strength enough to protect all, wants not ſufficiency to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe all. Here is no other difficulty then, but that humane affaires cannot be without ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience. And this inconvenience it ſelf is in the Citizens, not in the Government; for if men could rule themſelves, every man by his own command, that's to ſay, could they live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Lawes of Nature, there would be no need at all of a City, nor of a common co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercive power. Secondly, they object, That there is no Dominion in the Chriſtian world Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute; which indeed is not true, for all Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies, and all other States, are ſo; for although

                  <p n="1">I. VVE have already ſpoken of a <note place="margin">There are three kinds of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment onely. Democraty, Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</note>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114870:77"/>
ſpecies. As for the difference of Cities, it is taken from the difference of the Perſons, to whom the <hi>Supreme Power</hi> is committed; this <hi>power</hi> is committed either to <hi>one Man,</hi> or <hi>Councell,</hi> or ſome <hi>one Court</hi> conſiſting of many men. Furthermore, a <hi>Councell of many men,</hi> conſiſts either of all the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, (inſomuch as every man of them hath a Right to Vote, and an intereſt in the ordering of the greateſt affaires, if he will himſelfe) or of a part onely; from whence there ariſe three ſorts of Government: The one, when the <hi>Power</hi> is in a <hi>Councell,</hi> where every Citizen hath a right to Vote, and it is call'd a DEMOCRATY. The other, when <hi>it</hi> is in a <hi>Councell,</hi> where not all, but ſome part onely have their ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and we call it an ARISTOCRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY. The third is that, when the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority</hi> reſts onely <hi>in one,</hi> and it is ſtiled a MONARCHY. In the firſt, he that governes is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, The PEOPLE. In the ſecond, the NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BLES. In the third, the MO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARCH.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. Now, although Ancient Writers of Politiques have introduc'd three other <note place="margin">Oligarchie is no ſtate of a City diſtinct from Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocratie; neither is Anarchie any state at all.</note> kindes of Government oppoſite to theſe, to wit, <hi>Anarchy</hi> or confuſion to <hi>Democraty, Oligarchy,</hi> that is, the command of ſome few, to <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi> to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> yet are not theſe three diſtinct formes of Government, but three diverſe Titles given by thoſe who were either diſpleas'd with that preſent Government, or thoſe that bare Rule. For men, by giving names, doe uſually, not onely ſignifie the things
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114870:77"/>
themſelves, but alſo their own <hi>affections,</hi> as <hi>love, hatred, anger,</hi> and the like, whence it happens that what one man calls a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocraty,</hi> another calls an <hi>Anarchy;</hi> what one counts an <hi>Ariſtocraty,</hi> another eſteemes an <hi>Oligarchie;</hi> and whom one titles a <hi>King,</hi> another ſtiles him a <hi>Tyrant;</hi> ſo as we ſee theſe names betoken not a <hi>diverſe kinde</hi> of Government, but the <hi>diverſe opinions</hi> of the Subjects concerning him who hath the Supreme Power. For firſt, who ſees not that <hi>Anarchy</hi> is equally oppoſite to all the forenam'd Formes? For that word ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies that there is no Government at all, that is, not any City. But how is it poſſible that <hi>no City</hi> ſhould be the ſpecies of <hi>a City?</hi> Farthermore, what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween an <hi>Oligarchie,</hi> which ſignifies the Command of a <hi>few,</hi> or <hi>Grand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="3">III. But men, by reaſon of their paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">That a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny is not a diverſe state from alegitimate Monarchy.</note> will very hardly be perſwaded that a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and Tyranny, are not diverſe kindes of Cities, who though they would rather have the City ſubject <hi>to one,</hi> then <hi>many,</hi> yet doe they not beleeve it to be well govern'd unleſſe it accord with their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: But we muſt diſcover by Reaſon, and not by Paſſion, what the difference is between a <hi>King,</hi> and a <hi>Tyrant:</hi> but firſt, they differ not in this, That a <hi>Tyrant</hi> hath
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114870:78"/>
the <hi>greater power,</hi> for greater then the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> cannot be granted; nor in this, That one hath a limited power, the other not; for he, whoſe authority is limited, is <hi>no King,</hi> but his <hi>Subject</hi> that limits him. Laſtly, neither differ they in their manner of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; for if in a <hi>Democraticall,</hi> or <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocraticall</hi> Government ſome one Citizen ſhould, by force, poſſeſſe himſelf of the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Power,</hi> if he gain the conſent of all the Citizens, he becomes a legitimate <hi>Monarch;</hi> if not, he is an <hi>Enemy,</hi> not a <hi>Tyrant.</hi> They differ therefore in the ſole exerciſe of their command, inſomuch as he is ſaid to be a King, who governs wel, and he a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Tyrant</hi> that doth otherwiſe. The caſe therefore is brought to this paſſe, That a King legitimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſtituted in his <hi>Government,</hi> if he ſeeme to his Subjects to Rule well, and to their liking, they afford him the appellation of a King, if not, they count him a <hi>Tyrant:</hi> Wherefore we ſee a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> and <hi>Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> are not diverſe Formes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but one and the ſelf-ſame <hi>Monarch</hi> hath the name of a <hi>King</hi> given him in point of Honour, and Reverence to him, and of a <hi>Tyrant</hi> in way of contumely, and reproach. But what we frequently finde in bookes ſaid againſt <hi>Tyrants,</hi> took its origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall from Greek, and Roman Writers, whoſe Government was partly <hi>Democrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> and partly <hi>Ariſtocraticall,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not <hi>Tyrants</hi> onely, but even <hi>Kings</hi> were odious to them.</p>
                  <p n="4">IV. There are, who indeed doe think it <note place="margin">That there can no mixt ſtate be form'd out of theſe fore-nam'd kindes of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> neceſſarily, That a <hi>Suprem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Command</hi> ſhould be ſomewhere extant in a City;
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114870:78"/>
but if it ſhould be in any <hi>one,</hi> either <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Councell,</hi> it would follow (they ſay) that all the Citizens muſt be ſlaves. Avoiding this condition, they imagine that there may be a certaine Form of Government <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded</hi> of thoſe three kinds we have ſpoken of, yet different from each particular, which they call a <hi>mixt Monarchie,</hi> or <hi>mixt Ariſtocraty,</hi> or <hi>mixt Democraty,</hi> according as any one of theſe three ſorts ſhall be more eminent then the reſt: For example, if the naming of Magiſtrates, and the arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of War, and Peace, ſhould belong to the King, Judicature to the <hi>Lords,</hi> and contribution of Monies to the <hi>People,</hi> and the power of making Lawes too <hi>altogether,</hi> this kind of State would they call a <hi>mixt Monarchie</hi> forſooth. But if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that there could be ſuch a State, it would no whit advantage the liberty of the ſubject; for as long as they all agree, each ſingle Citizen is as much ſubject as poſſibly he can be; but if they diſagree, the State returns to a Civill War, and the Right of the <hi>private Sword,</hi> which certainly is much worſe then any ſubjection whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: (*) But that there can be no ſuch kind of Government hath been ſufficiently demonſtrated in the foregoing Chapter, Artic: 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p>But that there can be no ſuch kinde of <note place="margin">Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Government] <hi>Most men grant, That a</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>ought not to be divided, but they would have it moderated, and bounded by ſome limits. Truly it is very reaſonable it ſhould be ſo; but if theſe men, when they speak of mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating, and limiting, do underſtand dividing it,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114870:79"/>
they make a very fond diſtinction. Truly, for my part, I wiſh that not onely</hi> Kings, <hi>but all other Perſons endued with Supreme Authority would ſo temper themſelves as to commit no wrong, and onely minding their charges contain themſelves within the limits of the naturall, and divine Lawes: But they who diſtinguiſh thus, they would have the chief power bounded, and reſtrain'd by others; which, becauſe it cannot be done, but that they who doe ſet the limits, must needs have ſome part of the power, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be enabled to doe it, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is properly divided, not modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">V.

                  <p n="1">I. IN the two fore-going Chapters we <note place="margin">What Lord and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant are.</note> have treated of an <hi>inſtitutive,</hi> or <hi>fram'd Government,</hi> as being that which receives its originall from the conſent of many, who by Contract and Faith mutually given, have oblig'd each other.

The 2d is, If a man taken Priſoner in the Wars, or overcome; or elſe diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own forces, (to avoid Death) promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes the Conquerour, or the ſtronger Party, <hi>his Service, i. e.</hi> to do all whatſoever he ſhall command him; in which Contract the good which the vanquiſht, or inferiour, in ſtrength doth receive, is the grant of his life, which by the Right of War in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By vertue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this promiſe, there is as abſolute ſervice and obedience due from the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſht, to the vanquiſher, as poſſibly can be, excepting what repugns the Divine Lawes; for he who is oblig'd to obey the Commands of any man before he knowes what he will command him, is ſimply, and without any reſtriction tyed to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of all Commands whatſoever. Now he that is thus tyed, is call'd a <hi>SERVANT,</hi> he to whom he is tyed, a <hi>LORD.</hi> Thirdly, there is a Right acquir'd over the Perſon of a Man, by Generation; of which kind of acquiſition ſomewhat ſhall be ſpoken in the following Chapter.</p>

                  <p n="6">VI. Among other grievances of ſupreme <note place="margin">The exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous under command of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, then under the Monarch.</note> authority one is, that the Ruler, beſide thoſe monies neceſsary for publick charges, as the maintaining of publick Miniſters, building, and defending of Caſtles, waging warres, honourable ſuſtaining his own houſhold, may alſo, if he will, exact others through his luſt, whereby to enrich his <hi>ſonnes, kindred, favourites,</hi> and <hi>flatterers</hi> too. I confeſse this is a grievance, but of the number of thoſe which accompany all kindes of government, but are more tolerable in a <hi>Monarchy</hi> then in a <hi>Democraty;</hi> for though the <hi>Monarch</hi> would enrich them, they cannot be many, becauſe belonging but to one, but in a <hi>Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craty,</hi> look how many Demagoges, (that is) how many powerfull <hi>Oratours</hi> there are with the people (which ever are many, and daily new ones growing) ſo many <hi>Children, Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, friends, &amp; Flatterers,</hi> are to be rewarded; for every of them deſire not onely to make their families as potent, as illuſtrious in wealth, as maybe, but alſo to oblige others to them by benefits for the better ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of themſelves. A <hi>Monarch</hi> may in great part ſatisfie his Officers and Friends, becauſe they are not many, without any coſt
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:114870:99"/>
to his Subjects, I mean, without robbing them of any of thoſe Treaſures given in for the maintenance of War, and Peace; In a <hi>Democraty;</hi> where many are to be ſatisfied, and alwayes new ones, this cannot be done without the Subjects oppreſſion. Though a <hi>Monarch</hi> may promote unworthy Perſons, yet oft times he will not doe it; but in a <hi>Democraty</hi> all the <hi>popular men</hi> are therefore ſuppos'd to doe it, becauſe it is neceſſary; for elſe, the power of them who did it would ſo encreaſe, as it would not onely become dreadfull to thoſe others, but even to the whole City alſo.</p>
                  <p n="7">VII. Another grievance is, that ſame <note place="margin">Innocent Subjects are leſſe obnoxious to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under a Monarch then under the People.</note> perpetuall fear of death which every man muſt neceſſarily be in, while he conſiders with himſelf that the Ruler hath power not onely to appoint what puniſhments he liſts on any Tranſgreſſions, but that he may alſo in his wrath, and ſenſuality, ſlaughter his innocent Subjects, and thoſe who never offended againſt the Lawes. And truly this is a very great grievance in any forme of Government whereſoever it happens: (for it is therefore a grievance becauſe it is; not, becauſe it may be done) but it is the fault of the Ruler, not of the Government; For all the acts of <hi>Nero</hi> are not eſſentiall to Monarchie; yet Subjects are leſſe often undeſervedly condemn'd under <hi>one Ruler,</hi> then under the <hi>People:</hi> For Kings are onely ſevere againſt thoſe who either trouble them with impertinent Counſells, or oppoſe them with reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full words, or controule their Wills; but they are the cauſe that that exceſſe of power
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114870:99"/>

X. Beſides, there are many reaſons why <note place="margin">Civill deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations are unadvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to many, by reaſon of the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of most men.</note> deliberations are leſſe ſucceſſefull in great Aſſemblies, then in leſſer Councells; whereof one is, that to adviſe rightly of all things conducing to the preſervation of a Common-weal, we muſt not onely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand matters at home, but Forraign Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires too; at Home, by what goods the Country is nouriſhed, and defended, and whence they are fetched; what places are fit to make Garriſons of; by what means Souldiers are beſt to be raiſed, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; what manner of affections the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects bear toward their Prince, or Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of their Country, and many the like: Abroad, what the power of each neighbouring Country is, and wherein it conſiſts; what advantage, or diſadvantage we may receive from them; what their diſpoſitions are both to us-ward, and how affected to each other among themſelves, and what Counſell daily paſſeth among them. Now, becauſe very few in a great Aſſembly of men underſtand theſe things, being for the moſt part unskilfull (that I ſay not incapable) of them, what can that ſame number of adviſers with their imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Opinions contribute to good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſells, other then meer letts and impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Another reaſon why a great Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly <note place="margin">By reaſon of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquence.</note> is not ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>it for conſultation is, becauſe every one who delivers his opinion holds it neceſſary to make a long continued Speech, and to gain the more eſteem from his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditours, he poliſhes, and adornes it with the beſt, and ſmootheſt language, now the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:114870:102"/>
nature of <hi>Eloquence</hi> is to make <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill, Profitable</hi> and <hi>Unprofitable, Honeſt</hi> and <hi>Diſhoneſt,</hi> appear to be more or leſſe then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they are, and to make that ſeem <hi>juſt,</hi> which is <hi>unjuſt,</hi> according as it ſhall beſt ſuit with his end that ſpeaketh. For this is to perſwade; and though they reaſon, yet take they not their riſe from true Principles, but from vulgar received opinions, which, for the moſt part, are erroneous; neither en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour they ſo much to fit their ſpeech to the nature of the things they ſpeak of, as to the Paſſions of their mindes to whom they ſpeak, whence it happens that opinions are delivered not by right reaſon, but by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain violence of mind.

                  <p n="12">XII.

But ſome will ſay, theſe things doe not neceſſarily, nor often happen; he may as well ſay, that the chief Parties are not neceſsarily deſirous of vain glory, and that the greateſt of them ſeldom diſagree in great matters.</p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. It followes hence, that when the <note place="margin">By reaſon of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetledneſſe of the Laws.</note> legiſlative power reſides in ſuch convents as theſe, the Laws muſt needs be inconſtant, and change, not according to the alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſtate of affaires, nor according to the changeableneſse of mens mindes, but as the major part, now of this, then of that <hi>facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> do <hi>convent;</hi> inſomuch as the Laws do flote here, and there, as it were upon the waters.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. In the fourth place, the counſels <note place="margin">For want of ſecrecy.</note> of great aſsemblies have this inconvenience, that whereas it is oft of great conſequence,

that they ſhould be kept ſecret, they are for the moſt part diſcovered to the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they can be brought to any effect, and their power, and will, is as ſoon known abroad, as to the <hi>People</hi> it ſelfe <hi>commanding</hi> at home.</p>

from hence, namely, becauſe the government it ſelf, or the adminiſtration of its affairs, are better committed to one, then many; or on the other ſide, to many, then to ſome few; for Government, is the <hi>power,</hi> the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, is the <hi>act,</hi> now the <hi>power</hi> in all kind of government is equall; the <hi>acts</hi> only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that is to ſay the <hi>actions,</hi> and <hi>motions</hi> of a common-weale, as they flow from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberations of many, or few, of skilfull, or impertinent men. Whence we underſtand, that the conveniences, or inconveniences of any government, depend not on him in whom the authority reſides, but on his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and therefore nothing hinders, but that the common-weale may be well governed, although the <hi>Monarch</hi> be a woman, or youth, or infant, provided that they be fit for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, who are endued with the publique Offices, and charges; And that which is ſaid, <hi>Woe to the land whoſe King is a childe,</hi> doth not ſignifie the condition of a <hi>Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> to be inferiour to a Popular ſtate, but contrariwiſe, that by accident it is the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of a Kingdome, that the <hi>King being a childe,</hi> it often happens, that many by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and power, intruding themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to publique counſels, the government comes to be adminiſtred in a <hi>Democraticall</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that thence ariſe thoſe infelicities which for the moſt part accompany the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion</hi>

Now that this Opinion cannot conſiſt with the very being of Government, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from hence, that by it the knowledge of what is <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evill,</hi> that is to ſay, the definition of what is, and what is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lawes, would return to each ſingle Perſon: Obedience therefore will ceaſe as oft as, any thing ſeemes to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded contrary to the Civill Lawes, and together with it, all coercive juriſdiction, which cannot poſſibly be without the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the very eſſence of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; Yet this Errour hath great props, <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and others; who, by reaſon of humane infirmity, ſuppoſe the Supreme Power to be committed with moſt ſecurity to the Lawes onely; but they ſeem to have lookt very ſhallowly into the nature of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who thought that the conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Power, the interpretation of Lawes,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:114870:111"/>
and the making of Lawes, (all which are powers neceſſarily belonging to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) ſhould be left wholly to the Lawes themſelves. Now although particular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects may ſometimes contend in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and goe to Law with the Supreme Magiſtrate, yet this is onely then, when the queſtion is not what the Magiſtrate may, but what by a certain Rule he hath declared he would doe; As, when by any Law the Judges ſit upon the life of a Subject, the queſtion is not whether the Magiſtrate could by his abſolute Right deprive him of his life; but whether by that Law his will was that he ſhould be deprived of it; but his will was, he ſhould, if he brake the Law, elſe, his will was he ſhould not: This thetefore, that a Subject may have an acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Law againſt his Supreme Magiſtrate, is not ſtrength of Argument ſufficient to prove that he is tyed to his own Lawes. On the contrary, it is evident, that he is not tied to his owne Lawes, becauſe no man is bound to himſelf. Lawes therefore are ſet for <hi>Titius,</hi> and <hi>Caius,</hi> not for the Ruler: however, by the ambition of Lawyers, it is ſo ordered, that the Lawes, to unskilfull men ſeeme not to depend on the Authority of the Magiſtrate, but their Prudence.</p>

There are alſo ſome who divide the Supreme Authority ſo as to allow the power of War, and Peace, unto one, (whom they call a <hi>Monarch)</hi> but the right of raiſing Monies they give to ſome others, and not to him: But becauſe monies are the ſinewes of War, and Peace, they who thus divide the Authority, doe either really not divide it at all, but place it wholly in them, in whoſe power the money is, but give the name of it to another, or if they doe really divide it, they diſſolve the Government: for neither upon neceſſity can War be wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor can the publique Peace be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without Money.</p>

                  <p n="7">VII. There are two things neceſſary <note place="margin">That diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers are neceſſary for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the People.</note> for the Peoples defence; <hi>To be warned, and to be forearmed;</hi> for the ſtate of Common-wealths conſidered in themſelves, is natural, that is to ſay, hoſtile; neither if they ceaſe from fighting, is it therefore to be called Peace, but rather a breathing time, in which one enemy obſerving the motion and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the other, values his ſecurity n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Artic. from this, that contracts are invalid in the ſtate of nature, as oft as any juſt fear doth intervene; It is therefore neceſſary to the defence of the City, Firſt, that there be ſome who may as near as may be, <hi>ſearch into,</hi> and <hi>diſcover</hi> the counſels and motions of all thoſe who may prejudice it; for <hi>diſcoverers</hi> to Miniſters of State, are like the beames of the Sunne to the humane ſoule, and we may more truly ſay in viſion politicall, then naturall, that the ſenſible, and intelligible Species of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things, not well conſidered by others, are by the ayre tranſported to the ſoule,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:114870:120"/>
(that is to ſay to them who have the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Authority) and therefore are they no leſſe neceſſary to the preſervation of the State, then the rayes of the light are to the conſervation of man; or if they be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to Spiders webs, which extended on all ſides by the fineſt threds, doe warn them, keeping in their ſmall holds, of all outward motions; They who bear Rule can no more know what is neceſſary to be commanded for the defence of their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects without <hi>Spies,</hi> then thoſe Spiders can when they ſhall goe forth, and whether they ſhall repair, without the motion of thoſe threds.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. Farthermore, its neceſſarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite <note place="margin">To have Souldiers, Armes, Garriſons, and Money, in readineſs in times of Peace, is neceſſary for the Peoples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</note> to the peoples defence, that they be <hi>fore-armed.</hi> Now to be fore-armed is to be furniſht with Souldiers, Armes, Ships, Forts and Monies, before the danger be inſtant; for the liſting of Souldiers, and taking up of Armes after a blow is given, is too late, at leaſt if not impoſſible. In like manner, not to raiſe Forts, and appoint Garriſons in convenient places, before the Fromiers are invaded, is to be like thoſe Country Swains (as <hi>Demosthenes</hi> ſaid) who ignorant of the art of Fencing, with their Bucklers guarded thoſe parts of the body where they firſt f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lt the ſmart of the ſtrokes. But they who think it then ſeaſonable enough to raiſe Monies for the maintenance of Souldiers, and other Charges of War, when the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger begins to ſhew it ſelf, they conſider not ſurely how difficult a matter it is to wring ſuddainly out of cloſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fiſted men ſo vaſt a proportion of Monies; for almoſt all men,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114870:120"/>
what they once reckon in the number of their goods, doe judge themſelves to have ſuch a right and propriety in it, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves to be injured whenſoever they are forced to imploy but the leaſt part of it for the publique good. Now a ſufficient ſtock of monies to defend the Country with Armes, will not ſoon be raiſed out of the treaſure of Impoſts, and Cuſtomes; we muſt therefore, for fear of War, in time of Peace hoord up good ſumms, if we intend the ſafety of the Common-weal. Since therefore it neceſſarily belongs to Rulers for the Subjects ſafety to diſcover the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Counſell, to keep Garriſons, and to have Money in continuall readineſſe, and that Princes are by the Law of Nature bound to uſe their whole endeavour in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the welfare of their Subjects, it followes, that its not onely lawfull for them to ſend out Spies, to maintain Souldiers, to build Forts, and to require Monies for theſe purpoſes, but alſo, not to doe thus, is unlawfull. To which alſo may be added, whatſoever ſhall ſeeme to conduce to the leſning of the power of forraigners whom they ſuſpect, whether by ſleight, or force. For Rulers are bound according to their power to prevent the evills they ſuſpect, leſt peradventure they may happen through <note place="margin">A right inſtruction of Subjects in civill doctrines is neceſsary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of Peace.</note> their negligence.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. But many things are required to the conſervation of inward Peace, becauſe many things concur (as hath been ſhewed in the foregoing Chapter) to its perrurba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We have there ſhewed, that ſome things there are which diſpoſe the minds of
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:114870:121"/>
of men to ſedition, others which move and quicken them ſo diſpoſed. Among thoſe which diſpoſe them, we have reckoned in the firſt place certaine perverſe doctrines. Its therefore the duty of thoſe who have the chief Authority; to root thoſe out of the mindes of men, not by commanding, but by teaching; not by the terrour of penalties, but by the perſpicuity of reaſons; the Lawes whereby this evill may be withſtood are not to be made againſt the Perſons erring, but againſt the Errours themſelves. Thoſe errours which in the foregoing Chapter we affirmed were inconſiſtent with the quiet of the Common-weal, have crept into the mindes of ignorant men, partly from the Pulpit, partly from the daily diſcourſes of men, who by reaſon of little employment, otherwiſe, doe finde leaſure enough to ſtudy; and they got into theſe mens mindes by the teachers of their youth in publique ſchooles. Wherefore alſo, on the other ſide, if any man would introduce ſound Doctrine, he muſt begin from the <hi>Academies:</hi> There, the true, and truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated foundations of civill Doctrine are to be laid, wherewith young men being once endued, they may afterward both in private and publique inſtruct the vulgar. And this they will doe ſo much the more cheerfully, and powerfully, by how much themſelves ſhall be more certainly convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the truth of thoſe things they profeſs, and teach; for ſeeing at this day men receive propoſitions, though falſe, and no more intelligible, then if a man ſhould joyne together a company of termes
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:114870:121"/>
drawn by chance out of an urne, by reaſon of the frequent uſe of hearing them; how much more would they for the ſame reaſon entertain true doctrines ſuitable to their own underſtandings, and the nature of things? I therefore conceive it to be the duty of Supreme Officers to cauſe the true elements of civill Doctrine to be written, and to command them to be taught in all the Colledges of their ſeverall Dominions.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. In the next place we ſhewed that <note place="margin">Equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution of publique burthens conduceth much to the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of peace.</note> grief of mind a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iſing from <hi>want</hi> did diſpoſe the Subjects to Sedition, which want, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though deriv'd from their own luxury, and ſloth, yet they impute it to thoſe who go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the Realm, as though they were drai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and oppreſt by publique Penſions. Notwithſtanding it may ſometimes happen that this complaint may be juſt, namely, when the burthens of the Realm are une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually impoſed on the Subjects; For that which to all together is but a light weight, if many withdraw themſelves, it wil be very heavy, nay, even intollerable to the reſt: Neither are men wont ſo much to grieve at the burthen it ſelf, as at the inequality. With much earneſtnes therefore men ſtrive to be freed from taxes, &amp; in this conflict the leſſe happy, as being overcome, do envy the more fortunate. To remove therefore all juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, its the intereſt of the publique quiet, and by conſequence it concernes the duty of the Magiſtrate, to ſee that the publique bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens be equally born. Furthermore, ſince what is brought by the ſubjects to publick uſe, is nothing elſe but the price of their bought Peace, its reaſon good, that they who equally ſhare in the peace, ſhould alſo
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:114870:122"/>
pay an equall part either by contributing their Monies, or their labours to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-weal; now it is the Law of Nature (by the 15. Article of the 3. Chapter) that every man in diſtributing right to others, doe carry himſelf equall to all; wherefore Rulers are by the naturall Law obliged to lay the burthens of the Common-weal equally on their Subjects.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. Now in this place we underſtand an equality, not of Money, but of Burthen, that is to ſay, an equality of reaſon between the Burthens, and the Benefits.

It may therefore be demanded whether Subjects ought to contribute to the publique, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rate of what they gain, or of what they ſpend, that is to ſay, whether the perſons muſt be taxt, ſo as to pay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution according to their wealth, or the goods themſelves, that every man contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute according to what he ſpends. But if we conſider, where Monies are raiſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to wealth, there they who have made equall gain, have not equall poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, becauſe that one preſerves what he hath got by frugality, another waſtes it by luxury, and therefore equally rejoycing in the benefit of Peace, they doe not equally ſuſtaine the Burthens of the Common-weal: and on the other ſide, where the goods themſelves are taxt, there every man, while he ſpends his private goods, in the very act of conſuming them he undiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:114870:122"/>

                  <p n="15">XV. The liberty of ſubjects conſiſts not in being exempt from the Lawes of the City, or that they who have the ſupreme power cannot make what Laws they have a mind to; but becauſe all the motions and actions of ſubjects, are never circumſcribed by Lawes, nor can be, by reaſon of their vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; it is neceſſary that there be infinite ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:114870:124"/>
which are neither commanded, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, but every man may either doe, or not doe them, as he lifts himſelfe. In theſe, each man is ſaid to enjoy his liberty, and in this ſenſe liberty is to be underſtood in this place, namely, for that part of naturall Right, which is granted and left to Subjects by the civill Lawes. As water incloſed on all hands with banks, ſtands ſtill and corrupts; having no bounds, it ſpreds too largely, and the more paſſages it findes, the more freely it takes its current; ſo ſubjects, if they might doe nothing without the commands of the Law would grow dull, and unwildly, if all, they would be diſperſt, and the more is left undetermined by the Lawes, the more liberty they enjoy. Both extremes are faulty, for Lawes were not invented to take away, but to direct mens actions, even as nature ordained the banks, not to ſtay, but to guide the courſe of the ſtreame. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this liberty is to be taken from the ſubjects, and the Cities good; wherefore in the firſt place it is againſt the charge of thoſe who command, and have the authority of making lawes, that there ſhould be more lawes then neceſſarily ſerve for good of the Magiſtrate, and his Subjects; for ſince men are wont commonly to debate what to do, or not to do, by naturall reaſon, rather then any knowledge of the Lawes, where there are more Lawes then can eaſily be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, and whereby ſuch things are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, as reaſon of it ſelfe prohibites not of neceſſity, they muſt through ignorance, without the leaſt evill i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For the end of puniſhment is not to

compell the will of man, but to faſhion it, &amp; make it ſuch as he would have it who hath ſet the penalty. And deliberation is nothing elſe but a weiging, as it were in ſcales, the conveniencies, and inconveniencies of the fact we are attempting; where, that which is more weighty, doth neceſſarily according to its inclination prevaile with us. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Legiſlator doth ſet a leſſe penalty on a crime, then will make our feare more conſiderable with us, then our luſt; that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of luſt above the feare of puniſhment, whereby ſinne is committed, is to be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Legiſlator (that is to ſay) to the ſupreme, and therefore if he inflict a greater puniſhment, then himſelfe hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in his Lawes, he puniſheth that in another, which he ſinned himſelfe.</p>

But we muſt know that the words of the Law may be underſtood in a twofold ſenſe, the one as containing two parts (as hath been declared above in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Art.) namely, that of abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting, as, <hi>Thou ſhalt not doe this;</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging, as, <hi>he that doth this, ſhall be puniſht;</hi> The other, as containing a condition, for example, <hi>Thou ſhalt not doe this thing, unleſſe thou wilt ſuffer puniſhment;</hi> and thus, the Law forbids not ſimply, but conditionally. If it be underſtood in the firſt ſenſe, he that doth it, ſins, becauſe he doth what the Law forbids to be done, if in the ſecond, he ſins not, becauſe he cannot be ſaid to doe what is forbidden him, that performs the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; For in the firſt ſenſe, all men are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to doe it; in the ſecond, they only who keep themſelves from the puniſhment. In the firſt ſenſe, the vindicative part of the Law obligeth not the guilty, but the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to require puniſhment; in the ſecond, he himſelfe that owes the puniſhment is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to exact it, to the payment whereof, if it be capitall, or otherwiſe grievous, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obliged. But in what ſenſe the Law is to be taken, depends on the will of him
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:114870:138"/>
who hath the Soveraignty. When there is therefore any doubt of the meaning of the Law, ſince we are ſure they ſinne not who doe it not, it will be ſin if we doe it, howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Law may afterward be explained; for ſo to doe that which a man doubts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be a ſin or not, when he hath free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to forbear it, is a contempt of the Lawes, and therefore by the 28.

And the ſame Right is derived from <hi>nature,</hi> in this very thing, that it is not by nature taken away; for when by nature all men had a Right over all things, every man had a Right of ruling over all as ancient as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe; but the reaſon why this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht among men, was no other but mutuall fear, as hath been declared above in the ſecond Chapter, the 3. art. reaſon namely dictating that they muſt foregoe that Right for the preſervation of mankinde, becauſe the equality of men among themſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſtrength and naturall pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers was neceſſarily accompanied with warre, and with warre joynes the deſtruction of mankinde. Now if any man had ſo farre exceeded the reſt in power, that all of them with joyned forces could not have reſiſted him, there had been no cauſe why he ſhould part with that Right which nature had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him; The Right therefore of Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over all the reſt, would have remained with him, by reaſon of that exceſſe of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er whereby he could have preſerved both himſelfe and them.

From whence we may underſtand, that we muſt obey the City in whatſoever it ſhall command to be uſed for a ſign of honouring God, that is to ſay, for <hi>Worſhip;</hi> provided it can be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a ſign of honour, becauſe that is a ſign of honour, which by the Cities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is us'd for ſuch.</p>
                  <p n="17">XVII. We have already declared which <note place="margin">God ruling by nature onely, the City, that is ſay, that man or Court which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God hath the Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is the Interpreter of all the Lawes.</note> were the Laws of God, as wel ſacred as ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, in his government by the way of Nature onely. Now becauſe there is no man but may be deceived in reaſoning, and that it ſo falls out, that men are of different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the moſt actions, it may be demanded farther, whom God would have to be the <hi>Interpreter of right Reaſon,</hi> that is to ſay, of his Lawes. And as for the <hi>Secular Lawes,</hi> I mean thoſe which concern juſtice, and the carriage of men towards men, by what hath been ſaid before of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a City, we have demonſtratively ſhewed it agreeable to reaſon, that all <hi>Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature</hi> belongs to the City, and that <hi>Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature</hi> is nothing elſe but an <hi>Interpretation of the Laws,</hi> and by conſequence, that every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where Cities, that is to ſay, thoſe who have,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:114870:149"/>
the Soveraign power, are the <hi>Interpreters of the Lawes,</hi> As for the <hi>Sacred Lawes,</hi> we muſt conſider what hath been before demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the fifth Chap. the 13. art. that every Subject hath transferr'd as much right as he could on him, or them, who had the ſupreme authority: but he could have transferred his right of judging the manner how God is to be honoured, and therefore alſo he hath done it; That he could, it appeares hence, that the manner of honouring God before the conſtitution of a City was to be fetcht from every mans <hi>private Reaſon;</hi> but every man can ſubject his <hi>private Reaſon to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the whole City:</hi> Moreover, if each Man ſhould follow his own reaſon in the <hi>worſhipping</hi> of God, in ſo great a diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of worſhippers, one would be apt to judge anothers worſhip uncomely, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious; neither would the one ſeem to the other to honour God: Even that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which were moſt conſonant to reaſon, would not be a <hi>worſhip,</hi> becauſe that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>worſhip</hi> conſiſts in this, that it be the <hi>ſign of inward honour;</hi> but there is no ſign but whereby ſomewhat becomes known to others, and therefore is there no ſign of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour but what ſeems ſo to others; Again, that's a true ſign which by the conſent of men becomes a ſign, therefore alſo that is honourable, which by the conſent of men, that is to ſay, by the command of the City, becomes a ſign of honour. It is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore againſt the will of God, declared by the way of reaſon onely, to give him ſuch ſigns of honour as the City ſhall command; wherefore Subjects can transferre their
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:114870:150"/>
Right of judging the manner of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip on him or them who have the Soveraign power; nay, they muſt doe it, for elſe all manner of abſurd opinions, concerning the nature of God, and all ridiculous ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies which have been uſed by any Nations, will bee ſeen at once in the ſame City, whence it will fall out, that every man will beleeve that all the reſt doe offer God an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front; ſo that it cannot be truly ſaid of any that he worſhips God; for no man wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips God, that is to ſay, honours him outwardly, but he who doth thoſe things, whereby hee appeares to others for to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him. It may therefore bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the <hi>Interpretation</hi> of all Lawes, as well <hi>Sacred,</hi> as <hi>Secular,</hi> (God ruling by the way of <hi>nature</hi> only) depends on the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the City, that is to ſay, that man, or councell, to whom the Soveraign power is committed, and that whatſoever God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, he commands by his voyce. And on the other ſide, that whatſoever is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by them, both concerning the manner of honouring God, and concerning ſecular aſſaires, is commanded by God himſelfe. <note place="margin">Certain doubts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</note>

                  <p n="18">XVIII. Againſt this, ſome Man may demand, firſt, Whether it doth not follow, that the City muſt be obeyed if it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us directly to affront God, or forbid us to worſhip him? I ſay, it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, neither muſt we obey; for to affront, or not to worſhip at all, cannot by any Man be underſtood for a manner of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; neither alſo had any one, before the conſtitution of a City, of thoſe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge God to rule, a Right to deny
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:114870:150"/>
him the honour which was then due unto him; nor could he therefore rransfer a Right on the City of commanding any ſuch things. Next, if it be demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the City muſt be obeyed if it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſomewhat to be ſaid, or done, which is not a diſgrace to God directly, but from whence by reaſoning diſgracefull conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences may be derived: as for example, if it were commanded to worſhip God in an image, before thoſe who account that honourable? Truly it is to be (*) done. For Worſhip is inſtituted in ſigne of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, but to Worſhip him thus, is a ſigne of honour, and increaſeth Gods Honour among thoſe who do ſo account of it; Or if it be commanded to call God by a name which we know not what it ſignifies, or how it can agree with this word, <hi>God?</hi> That alſo muſt be done, for what we do for Honours ſake, (and we know no better) if it be taken for a ſigne of Honour, it is a ſigne of Honour, and therefore if we refuſe to doe it, we refuſe the enlarging of Gods Honour. The ſame judgement muſt be had of all the <hi>Attributes</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> about the meerly rationall Worſhip of God which may be controverted, and diſpu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Laſtly, if that Man, or Councell, who hath the Supreme Power, command himſelfe to

be Worſhipt with the ſame <hi>Attributes,</hi> and <hi>Actions,</hi> where with God is to be Worſhipt, the queſtion is, whether we muſt obey?

partly to live, partly to live well; I ſay, the underſtanding of theſe (becauſe CHRIST hath not delivered it) is to be learnt from reaſoning, that is to ſay by making neceſſary conſequences, having firſt taken the beginning from experience; but mens reaſonings are ſometimes right, ſometimes wrong, and conſequently that which is concluded, and held for a truth, is ſometimes truth, ſometimes errour; now, errours even about theſe Philoſophicall points doe ſometimes publique hurt, and give occaſions of great ſeditions, and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: It is needfull therefore, as oft as any controverſie ariſeth in theſe matters contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to publique good, and common Peace, that there be ſome body to judge of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, that is to ſay, whether that which is inferred, be rightly inferred or not, that ſo the controverſie may be ended; But there are no rules given by CHRIST to this purpoſe, neither came he into the world to teach <hi>Logick.</hi> It remaines therefore that the Iudges of ſuch controverſies be the ſame with thoſe whom God by nature had inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted before, namely thoſe who in each City are conſtituted by the Soveraign.

But what <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>looſing,</hi> or <hi>remitting</hi> and <hi>retaining of ſinnes,</hi> is, admits of ſome ſcruple. For firſt, to <hi>retain</hi> his <hi>ſinnes</hi> who being baptized into remiſſion of ſins, is truly penitent, ſeems to be againſt the very Covenant it ſelfe of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Nor yet on the other ſide, it is to be imagined, that <hi>remiſsion of ſinnes</hi> is nothing elſe but an exemption from Eccleſiaſticall puniſhments; for what evill hath excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication in it, beſide the eternall pains which are conſequent to it? or what benefit is it to be received into the Church if there were ſalvation out of it? We muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hold, <hi>That Paſtors have power, truly, and abſolutely to forgive ſinnes, but, to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and to retain them, but, of the impenitent.</hi> But while men think that to Repent, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but that every one condemn his Actions, and change thoſe Counſels which to himſelfe ſeem ſinfull, and blameable, there is an opinion riſen, that there may be repentance before any Confeſſion of ſinnes to men, and that repentance is not an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:114870:185"/>
but a cauſe of Confeſſion, and thence, the difficulty of thoſe who ſay that the ſins of the penitent are already forgiven in Baptiſme, and theirs who repent not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be forgiven at al, is againſt Scripture, and contrary to the words of <hi>Chriſt, Whoſe ſoever ſins ye remit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o reſolve this difficulty know in the firſt place, that a true acknowledgement of ſin is Repentance, for he that knows he hath ſinned, knows he hath erred, but to will an errour is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, therefore he that knowes he hath ſinned, wiſhes he had not done it, which is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Farther, where it may be doubtfull, whether that which is done be a ſin or not, we muſt conſider, that repentance doth not precede confeſſion of ſins, but is ſubſequent to it: for there is no repentance but of ſinnes acknowledged. The penitent therefore muſt both acknowledge the fact, and know it to be a ſinne, that is to ſay, againſt the Law. If a man therefore think, that what he hath done, is not againſt the Law; its impoſſible he ſhould repent of it. Before repentance therefore, its neceſſary there be an applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the facts unto the Law, but its in vain to apply, the facts unto the Law with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Interpreter; for not the words of the Law, but the ſentence of the Law-giver is the rule of mens actions; but ſurely either one man, or ſome men are the Interpreters of the Law, for every man is not judge of his own fact whether it be a ſin or not, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fact of which we doubt whether it be a ſinne or not, muſt be unfolded before ſome man or men, and the doing of this is confeſſion. Now when the Interpreter of the
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:114870:185"/>
Law hath judged the fact to bee a ſinne, if the ſinner ſubmit to his judgement, and reſolve with himſelfe not to do ſo any more, tis repentance; and thus, either it is not true repentance, or elſe it is not antecedent, but ſubſequent to confeſſion. Theſe things being thus explained, it is not hard to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what kinde of power that of <hi>bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>looſing</hi> is; for ſeeing in remiſſion of ſinnes there are two things conſiderable, one the <hi>Judgement</hi> or <hi>Condemnation</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fact is judged to be a ſinne; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (when the Party condemned does acquieſce, and obey the ſentence, that is to ſay, Repents) <hi>the remiſſion of the ſinne, or,</hi> (if he repent not) <hi>the Retention:</hi> The firſt of theſe, that is to ſay, the Judging whether it be a ſinne or not, belongs <hi>to the Interpreter of the Law,</hi> that is, the <hi>Soveraign Judge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the ſecond, namely Remiſſion, or retention of the ſinne, <hi>to the Paſtor,</hi> and it is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which the power <hi>of binding</hi> and <hi>loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> is converſant. And that this was the true meaning of our Saviour Chriſt in the inſtitution of the ſame power, is apparent in the 18. of <hi>Mat.</hi> verſ. 15, 16, 17, 18. thus, He there ſpeaking to his Diſciples, ſayes. <hi>If thy Brother ſinne against thee, goe, and tell him his fault betweene thee and him alone,</hi> (where we muſt obſerve by the way, that if thy Brother ſinne againſt thee, is the ſame with, if he doe thee injury; and therefore Chriſt ſpake of thoſe matters which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the <hi>civill Tribunall)</hi> he addes, <hi>if he heare thee not</hi> (that is to ſay, if he deny that he hath done it, or if having confeſt the fact, he denies it to be unjuſtly done) take with

But if <hi>he refuſe to hear the Church,</hi> that is, if he doe not ſubmit to the <hi>Churches</hi> ſentence, but ſhall maintain that to be no ſin, which She Judges to be a ſinne, that is to ſay, if he repent not (for certain it is that no man repents himſelfe of that action which She conceives not to be a ſinne) he ſaith not, <hi>Tell it to the Apoſtles,</hi> that we might know that the definitive ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the queſtion, whether it were a ſin or not, was not left unto them, but to the Church; <hi>but let him be unto thee</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>as an Heathen, or Publican,</hi> that is, as one out of the <hi>Church,</hi> as one that is not baptized, that is to ſay, as one whoſe <hi>ſinnes are retained.</hi> For all Chriſtians were bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into remiſſion of ſinnes.

This aſſent ſhall be called knowledge, and to know this truth is nothing elſe but to acknowledge that it is made by our ſelves; For by whoſe will and rules of ſpeaking the number .. is called two, ... is called three, &amp; ..... is called five, by their will alſo it comes to paſſe, that this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis true, <hi>Two</hi> and <hi>three</hi> taken together makes <hi>five.</hi> In like manner if we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what it is that is called <hi>theft,</hi> and what <hi>injury,</hi> we ſhall <hi>understand</hi> by the words themſelves, whether it be true that <hi>theft is an injury,</hi> or not. <hi>Truth</hi> is the ſame with a <hi>true Propoſition,</hi> but <hi>the Propoſition is true</hi> in which the <hi>word conſequent,</hi> which by <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians</hi> is called <hi>the praedicate,</hi> embraceth the <hi>word antecedent</hi> in its amplitude, which they call <hi>the Subject,</hi> and to <hi>know truth</hi> is the ſame thing as <hi>to remember</hi> that it was made by our ſelves in the common uſe of words: Neither was it raſhly, or unadviſedly ſaid by <hi>Plato</hi> of old, <hi>that knowledge was memory:</hi> But it happens ſometimes that words al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they have a certaine, and defin'd ſignification by conſtitution, yet by vulgar

The queſtion about <hi>the propriety of the Church,</hi> is a queſtion about the <hi>Right of Soveraignty;</hi> for, it being known what a <hi>Church</hi> is, it is known at once to whom the Rule over Chriſtians doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: for if every Chriſtian City be that Church which Chriſt himſelfe hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded every Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſubject to that city, to hear, then every ſubject is bound to obey his City, that is to ſay, Him, or them who have the ſupreme power, not only <hi>in temporall</hi> but alſo <hi>in ſpirituall matters;</hi> but if every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian City be not that Church, then is there ſome other Church more univerſall, which muſt be obeyed. All Chriſtians therefore muſt obey that Church juſt as they would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey Chriſt if He came upon Earth.
