         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THough there have been many
Books Extant of this kind,
yet I think something hath been
deficient in them all, I have therefore
adventured to make another, which I
suppose comprehends all the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishments
necessary for Ladies, in
things of this Nature. For you have here</p>
                  <p>1. The Art of Preserving and Candy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all Fruits and Flowers, as also of
making Conserves, both wet and dry,
and also the preparing of all sorts of
Syrups, Iellies, and Pickles.</p>
                  <p>2. Here are some Ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ellent Receipts
in Physick and Chirurgery, for Curing
most Diseases incident to the Body. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with some Rare Beautifying
Waters, Oyls, Oyntments, and Powders,
for Adornment of the Face and Body,
and to cleanse it from all Deformities
<pb facs="tcp:66090:4"/>
that may render Persons Vnlovely;
There are also added some Choise Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
and Experiments in the Art of
Angling; a Recreation which many
Ladies delight in, and is not therefore
thought altogether improper in a Book
of this Nature.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, You have here a Guide to all
manner of Cookery, both in the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
and <hi>French</hi> Mode, with the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all kind of Sallets and Sauces pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

for making all sorts of Pyes, Pasties
Tarts, and Custards, with the Forms
and Shapes of many of them to help
your Practice, with Bills of Fare upon
all Occasions. So that in the whole, I
hope it may deserve the Title of the

may acquire Acceptance at your fair

                     <p>The Pike chuses Sandy, or Clay ground,

                     <p>One, who was the best trouler of Pikes
in <hi>England.</hi> used always to troul with a
Hazle-Rod twelve Foot long, with a Ring
of wyre in the top of his Rod for his Line
to run through, within two Foot of the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:66090:114"/>
Rod there was a hole to put in a winder,
to turn with a Barril, to gather up his
Line, and loose it at his pleasure; this
was his manner of trouling with a small
Fish.</p>
                     <p>There are several other ways to take
Pikes; there is a way to take a Pike, which
is called the Snap, for with Angling you
must have a pretty strong Rod, for you
must Angle with a Line no longer than
your Rod, which must be very strong,
that you may hold the Fish to it; your
Hook must be a double Hook, made of a
large wyre, and Armed with wyre one or
two Links long; you must Bait the Fish
with the Head upwards, and the point
must come forth of his Side, a little above
his vent.</p>
                     <p>In all your Baitings for a Pike, you
must enter the Needle where the point
cometh forth, so draw your Arming
through, until the Hook lyeth as you
think fit, then make it fast with a thread
to the wyre, but first tye the thread about
the wyre, otherwise the Fish will skip up
and down, so fall to work: The Bait must
be a Gudgeon, a small Trout, Roch, or
Dace.</p>
                     <p>Now, I will pawn my Credit, that I
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:66090:115"/>
will shew a way, either in Ware, Pond,
or River, that shall take more Pikes, than
any Trouler shall do by Trouling; and it
is this.</p>
                     <p>First, take a forked stick, a Line of
twelve Yards long wound upon it, at the
lower end leave a Yard to tye; either a
bunch of Flaggs, or a Bladder, to Buoy
up the Fish, to carry the Bait from the
Ground, that the Fish may swim clear;
the Bait must be alive, either a small Trout,
Gudgeon, Roch, or Dace; the forked
stick must have a slit on the one side of the
fork to put the Line in, that the live Fish
may swim at the gauge you set the Fish to
swim at, that when the Pike takes the
Bait, the Pike may have the full Liberty
of the Line for his feed; you may turn as
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ou please of these loose in the Pond or
River all day long, the more the better,
and do it in a Pond-wind; the Hooks
must be double Hooks.</p>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>To Bait the Hook.</head>
                     <p>Take one of the Baits alive, and with
your Needle enter the Fish within a straws
breadth of the Gill, so put the Needle in
betwixt the Skin and the Fish, then draw
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:66090:115"/>
the Needle out at the hindermost fin, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Arming through the Fish, untill
the Hook come to lye close to the Body;
but I hold it better, if it be Armed with
wyre, to take off the Hook, and put the
Needle in at the hindermost fin, and so
come forth at the Gill, then put on the
Hook, and it will hurt the live Fish the
less, so knit the Arming with the live Fish
to the Line.</p>
                     <p>But I judge the Baiting with a live Fish
is done far better, as it is done, Baiting
with a Minew, to Fish for a Trout.</p>
                     <l>A Rod twelve Foot long, and a Ring of
wyre,</l>
                     <l>A winder and Barril will help thy desire,</l>

or a Duck,</l>
                     <l>Will kill two for one, if thou have any
luck.</l>
                     <p>Chub takes a black Snail about <hi>August;</hi>
and for a Bait, take the fourth Receipt
prescribed for Roch and Dace, but colour
it with Saffron, or Gambogia.</p>

must be downward at the bent of the hook;

                     <p>If you Fish at Snap for a Pike, give
