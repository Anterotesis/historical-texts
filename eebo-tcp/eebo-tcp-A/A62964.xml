            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right Honourable HENRY Ld. Walgrave, BARON of CHEWTON, COMPTROLLER OF HIS Majesty's Houshold.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>VVHen I consider'd that the design of my Authors in this Poem, was to shew transcendent Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, Piety and Constancy successful; I was
<pb facs="tcp:93341:3"/>
directed by Duty, as well as Inclination, to present it to your Lordship's Protection. The same pious Affections and Habits of Mind, were no less your Lordship's choice than Education. Nor is our <hi>Armusia</hi> more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than your Lordship in a beauteous and royal Recompence, whose Perfections are but faintly shadowed in the Character of <hi>Quisara:</hi> No single merit obtain'd your Lordship so great a Blessing, but those universal Endowments and eminent Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of Mind, by which you have charm'd the Affections of all good Men, and which will adorn your Lordship's Name as long as Learning, Piety and Loyalty, shall preserve a Reputation in the World. Amongst the present Ornaments of our Court, whose Accomplishments have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb facs="tcp:93341:3"/>
them happy Objects of their Prince's Favour, your Lordship is allow'd to have no inferiour Claim. For as in the natural Body, our Animal Spirits are Supply'd by our most refin'd and vital Blood, such noble and ancient Families, as your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's, are the proper Supplements to a declining Nobility. Many are your Advantages, both of Birth and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But not contented with descended Glories, your Lordship has imbellished those Honours with no less noble and acquir'd Endowments. To you, my Lord, our Foreign Ministers may resort, to inform themselves of the Manners and Languages of their own Courts. Your Lordship with the Experience and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of <hi>Ulysses</hi> has seen both Men
<pb facs="tcp:93341:4"/>
and Countries, from which you have inrich'd your self with all that was good, and left all their Vices and Vanities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. But these, my Lord, your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualifications are fitter to adorn our Annals, than a private Dedication. All my present Ambition is to beg your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's favourable Censure on this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Essay. It had been Presumptuous in me without some Obligation (which I could not well de cline) to attempt an Alteration in any Composure of <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher.</hi> Those Defects in Manners, that were too palpable through the Work, must be imputed to the Age in which they Wrote; but still there are so many and transcending Beauties in all their Writings, that I iudg'd it saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<pb facs="tcp:93341:4"/>
to Rob their Treasure for a Tribute to your Lordship. The Metal is still the same, but whether it has gain'd or lost by the new Stamp, must be submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your Lordship, by him, that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ambitious to be allow'd</p>
