         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THO the Sacred Majesty of Kings (I am sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
ought not in common Cases to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach'd
by every little Busy-body, or frivolous
Remonstrance-maker; yet when our Prince's
Palace is on Fire, and his Sacred Person in the midst of
Flames, the meanest of his Subjects hath the Privilege then
to give him warning of his Danger, and to assist to quench
the Fire: And this I am afraid, Sir, is at present too near
our Case, or I would not have assum'd the Boldness to
disturb your Repose, or have plac'd my self so disadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
before your Majesty, as I must expect to appear,
under the Character of a Publick Censor of the Manners
of your Ministers, and a petty State-Reformer. But it is
not I alone that am thus concern'd and busy for the Publick;
the whole World are at this time mournfully reflecting
upon the miserable Estate we are fallen into from that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
and glorious Prospect of things which we had in 1688
and 1689: This hath put all Men upon Enquiry into the
Causes of the unhappy Change of our Affairs; and I find
it agreed on all Hands, That the principal occasion of our
Misfortunes (or rather Mismanagements) is from the
intrusting those with the Government of all, who were the
Creatures and Tools of the two last Reigns, and are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
Enemies to your Majesty's Government; those
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:97874:3"/>
who opposed your coming to the Crown; those who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
to your Face King <hi>Iames</hi> the only Rightful King;
Those who sold their Country and betray'd it to the two
last Kings, and will be always ready to sell it even to the
French King, if he prove the fairest Chapman.</p>
            <p>I have heard that <hi>Thurloe,</hi> who was Secretary of State to
<hi>Cromwel,</hi> being ask'd by King <hi>Charles</hi> II. how they did
support their Government so long, when all the Nobility,
Gentry and Clergy were against it? he replied, <hi>By in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusting
those only in the Management of all Affairs, who were
as heartily against that Nobility, Gentry and Clergy.</hi> I do not
apply this literally; for, God be prais'd, your Majesty hath
a great part of all these several degrees of Men, who are
most heartily and zealously in your Interests: But I mean
by this, that you are to oppose your Enemies with their
Enemies, not with their Friends. And that the Design of
keeping out King <hi>Iames</hi> with Jacobites, seems to be as
impracticable, as his Project prov'd of setting up Popery
with a Protestant Army.</p>
            <p>Yet there are some about your Majesty (who for base
and private Ends) endeavour to possess you with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
Politicks of courting and buying your Enemies
into your Service, and would perswade you, that King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s <hi>Tories</hi> are the only Party truly principled for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,
and are fittest for Employment, as being long
practis'd in Business: And that (on the contrary) your
Majesty's best Friends, whom they call <hi>Whigs,</hi> are not only
ignorant, and unacquainted with Publick Business, but are
Haters of Monarchy, of Common wealth-Principles; and
at best, for making their Kings no more than Dukes of
<hi>Venice,</hi> and Kings of Clouts. Now this is a Notion so
false, so fatal to the Prosperity of your Affairs, and so dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to the very Being of your Government, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but think it highly necessary, that this Matter should
be fairly stated and laid before your Majesty: I am sensible
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:97874:3"/>
how unfit I am for the Task, and how open I lie to a Charge
of Presumption in attempting it. But as the Son of <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
who was from his Birth dumb, broke Silence when he saw
his Father in the Hands of his Murderers; so (since I saw
no other Champion appear in this Cause) I resolv'd to
break through all Impediments, even those of Nature, and
to endeavour the Rescue of my King out of the Hands of
those who have already been the Ruin of two Kings, your
Majesty's Predecessors, and who will undoubtedly bring
you and your Affairs into great Difficulties, if you be not
delivered from their Counsels.</p>
            <p>In order to this, I have impartially made a Collection
(in the following Dialogue) of all the Arguments which
<hi>Whigs</hi> employ against the <hi>Tories,</hi> or <hi>Tories</hi> against the
<hi>Whigs,</hi> and submit it to your Majesty's discerning Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and most piercing and distinguishing Wisdom, (upon
the whole) which of them are most proper for your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty
to employ; those who were in the Interests of <hi>Popery</hi>
and of <hi>France,</hi> or those who oppos'd both to the Death. I
appeal to you, Sir, whether a <hi>Tory</hi>'s being for the Divine
Right of Succession, and consequently for King <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Monarchy, makes him the fitter in Principle to be employ'd
by King <hi>William?</hi> Or, whether his boasted Skill in Business
will be of any use to your Majesty, if he be in Principle and
Inclination for K. <hi>Iames,</hi> and believes K. <hi>William</hi> a King <hi>de
facto</hi> only, without a Rightful Title, and in plain English,
an Usurper? If these Gentlemen (as their Principles will
naturally lead them to do) use all their Skill in their several
Stations, to obstruct and make difficult your Affairs, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
your Designs to your Enemies, to countenance and
protect K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Friends in all their Plots and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
furnish them with Intelligence, help them to Passes,
Escapes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which things (it cannot be denied) have
been and are daily done by some Persons employ'd in this
Government: Of what Use, Sir, or Service then is this
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:97874:4"/>
boasted Skill in Business to your Majesty's Interests? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
Men less conversant in Publick Affairs, who have a
Zeal for your Government, would be of more Use and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to you; Men who were persecuted by K. <hi>C.</hi> and K. <hi>I.</hi>
either in their own Persons, or in the Persons of their Friends,
who were fin'd, imprison'd, and some of their Relations
hang'd in those Reigns, are more likely to act in earnest
against K. <hi>I.</hi> and in the supporting your Majesty and
your Government, than those who had their Fortunes
and their Families rais'd by K. <hi>I.</hi> and his Brother K. <hi>C.</hi>
and who hope to be rais'd yet more by his Return, or at
least, to secure in his Government what they have got in
this, by obliging him and his Friends, at the Price of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing
you and yours.</p>
            <p>For Example: Is it reasonable to believe the E. of <hi>N.</hi>
whose Father and Family was rais'd by K. <hi>C.</hi> and K. <hi>I.</hi> for
prostituting the Law (and his nauseous Rhetorick) to the
Designs of those two Brothers, who himself was a Privy-Counsellor
with Father <hi>Peters,</hi> and chosen by K. <hi>I.</hi> at the
time of the Revolution to treat with your Majesty at <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerford,</hi>
in order to delay your Progress to <hi>London;</hi> and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who so violently oppos'd your Majesty's being crown'd
King, as to lay an eternal Obligation on K. <hi>I.</hi> by it: I say,
Sir, is it reasonable to believe this Gentleman so proper a
Secretary of State to your Majesty, as the E. of <hi>S.</hi> who hath
so mortally disobliged K. <hi>I.</hi> by being so early, and so zealous
in your Interests, who went at the Head of that Message to
K. <hi>I.</hi> wherein he was required to retire from <hi>Whitehall;</hi>
who hath since that been so instrumental to place and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
the Crown upon your Head; and hath, in a word,
broken all Measures so with K. <hi>I.</hi> as to leave no Possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of a Reconciliation to him, and consequently hath
no Retreat from this Government, but is oblig'd in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Sense, to serve Your Majesty faithfully and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:97874:4"/>
Or can your Majesty think Mr. <hi>K.</hi> who (it is generally
said) believes himself the Son of K. <hi>I.</hi> and it is known
by all the World, owes his Fortune to him; who (if we
may believe Report) at the time of the Revolution, agreed
with Captain <hi>Tosyer,</hi> to carry the Ships he then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in the <hi>Straits</hi> to K. <hi>Iames</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> (had not
the common Sailers very rudely oppos'd the Project;)
who after this acquitted himself so ill at <hi>Cadiz,</hi> in letting
the <hi>Thoulon</hi> Squadron pass by him in his sight, without
fighting them; and to conclude, hath made so unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
a Campagne of it this Summer; can your Majesty
(give me leave to say, Sir) think this Gentleman (after
all this) fitter to command the Fleet of <hi>England,</hi> than
Mr. <hi>R.</hi> whose Provocations to K. <hi>I.</hi> are never to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
by him; who was one of the most instrumental
Men in <hi>England</hi> in placing You upon the Throne; who last
Year gave you the greatest and most glorious Victory that
ever was obtain'd by us at Sea; and whose Courage, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
and Fidelity the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> hath unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
attested?</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, (If I may presume so far) will Your
Majesty be pleas'd to examine what Honour, what Profit
hath accrued to You, or the Nation, by your employing
these Gentlemen who have of late been at the Head of the
Ministry. For God's sake, Sir, cast up the Account of
the last four Years Management, and see what You have
gain'd by changing <hi>VVhigs</hi> for <hi>Tories;</hi> Have not Your
Affairs gone backward both at Home and Abroad? Have
not Mismanagements been multiply'd? Have You not
cool'd Your Friends, and yet not gain'd your Enemies?
Do not almost all the <hi>Tories</hi> You employ drink K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Health in Your Wine, and serve Him in Your Offices? Do
They not obstruct all Business which ought to be dispatch'd,
and dispatch all Business which ought to be obstructed?
browbeat Your Friends, and delay them in their most
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:97874:5"/>
just Pretences, but comply with your Enemies in their most
unreasonable Demands; nay, connive at their Cabals and
Conspiracies, and snatch them out of the Hands of Justice,
when the Law hath pass'd Sentence of Death upon them
for their Treasons? Would not such Ministers and Friends
as these be less dangerous to You, when profess'd Enemies,
nay in Arms against You in the Field, than in your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
Cabinet and Offices? Undoubtedly they would.</p>
            <p>But I know the common Answer to all these kind of
Complaints is, That it is more easy to find Faults than
Remedies. If You please therefore, Sir, we will consider
of Remedies, and I think there may be some found out
both easy and certain, and they are these: First, Sir, be
pleased to remove from your Person, Council and Offices
of Trust, Men bred up and confirm'd in Principles de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive
to our English Government, and hateful to Your
People; and to discountenance all State-Projectors, and
Mountebank-Ministers, who make Wounds in the State
to recommend their Balsam: Throw out, Sir, these <hi>Achans</hi>
to be ston'd by the People, who will otherwise (I fear)
prevent God's Favour to You; who blast Your Success
Abroad, and rob You of the Affections of Your Subjects
at Home, with their <hi>Accursed Thing,</hi> I mean that Tinsel
Power with which these Miscreants dazle the Eyes of
Princes, and lead them out of the right way; God is dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with it: For uncontroulable and unaccountable
Power is the Right and Attribute of God alone; and (as
the Scripture tells us) <hi>He will not give his Glory unto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
nor suffer those to act <hi>as Gods,</hi> who are to <hi>die like
Men.</hi> Your People also will be displeased with a Despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Power; for the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are bound by
Laws, by Mutual Compacts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (as You your Self,
Sir, have set forth most unanswerably in your Declaration
when You came over;) and if these are broken, English-Men,
who believe themselves Subjects to the Crown of

               <hi>England,</hi> (as by Law establish'd) and not
Slaves to any particular Person<note n="*" place="margin">Otherwise K. <hi>I.</hi> would have a fairer Pretence, than I hope we shall ever allow him.</note>; they
become impatient, angry, and at length
perhaps unreasonable. And whenever
they see their King beset with Ministers
of Lawless Principles, (those wholesale Merchants of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary
Power) they grow mistrustful and uneasy, and are
apt in such Cases to shut their Purses, and open their
Mouths. And give me leave to say, Sir, had not the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
been made apprehensive and jealous, by seeing these
Men in the Ministry, whose mischievous Methods they
were so well acquainted with, and did so much abhor;
no general Excise, no Loans, no Powers would have been
thought by the People of <hi>England,</hi> too much to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted
You with; so highly they esteem'd your Generous
Relief of them, your unequal Courage, and the many
other admirable Vertues they saw shine in You. An English
King is the greatest Monarch upon Earth, when he reigns
in the Hearts of his Subjects; and all other Methods to
Power and Greatness have been found ineffectual in <hi>England.</hi>
I remember I once saw written over a Mercer's Shop,
<hi>Keep thy Shop, and thy Shop will keep Thee:</hi> and tho it
be a homely Allusion, it is very applicable to the present
Point; <hi>Keep your Laws, Sir, and your Laws will keep You;</hi>

will support Your just Prerogative at Home, and Your
Honour Abroad. And, Sir, by the way, do not let Your
Flatterers give You a cheap Opinion of a Power deriv'd
from the People; for it is undoubtedly from their Consent,
that all Power must come: Nor let them make You uneasy
that Your Title to the Crown is from the universal free
Choice of the Commons of <hi>England:</hi> Believe me, Your
Ministers, nor the two Learned Bishops who have scribled
upon this Subject, will never be able to find You a better.</p>

In the next place, Discharge all <hi>Iacobites</hi> and <hi>Trimmers</hi>
from Offices of Trust: For such as either desire K. <hi>Iames,</hi>
or from their Fear, or Wisdom, endeavour to deserve from
him (so much as their Pardon) I humbly conceive are
unfit for Your Service at this Juncture; tho when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is more settled, I am for entertaining all who give
Proofs of their Penitence for their past Actions and Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, Purgatives will not alone perfect the Cure of
your Government, and restore it to perfect Health; You
must make use of Alteratives too, there must be a Change
of Measures, as well as a Discharge of Men: And the
Method I would humbly offer is this.</p>
            <p>First; To make the Interest of <hi>England</hi> your chief De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
and Aim; and since You are an <hi>English</hi> King, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
entirely an <hi>English</hi> Man. <hi>England</hi> is a Nation jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
of Rivals in her Prince's Favour, and thinks her self
deserving of all his Care, and all his Caresses: If the
People of <hi>England</hi> think You have a favourable Opinion of
them, they will endeavour to deserve it; if not, they may
perhaps deserve your worst Opinion too. This Humour
of the Nation Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> found early, and apply'd
her self so happily to it, as by this single Point to master
all her Difficulties, (the greatest it may be that ever Prince
had to struggle with); whereas her Successors, by contrary
Measures, brought themselves into very unfortunate Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Sir, let me desire You to avoid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
your Self in Elections of Members in Parliament,
or influencing them when chosen: the Parliament is a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
part of the English Constitution, and, like the <hi>Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi>
Ark of old, is not to be touch'd profanely, but with
great Danger to those who touch it so. And therefore, Sir,
it will be your true Interest to leave the People free to their
Choice and to leave the Members free to their Opinions
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:97874:6"/>
when they are chosen. It is still-fresh in our Memories,
how much the Practices of the late Reigns in corrupting
Elections, and Closeting the Members of Parliament, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd
the Nation, and they had reason to resent it; for if
(for the sake of a Vote) a Member of Parliament shall be
placed in an Office of Trust he is not fit for, this is destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Government two ways at once: For, to speak in
the Phrase of the Ministry, it is making a Parliament of
Clouts, and an Officer of Clouts at the same stroke. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
Bills offer'd by Parliament of publick Benefit, and
for the securing of our Antient Government, and the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental
Rights of the Subject, was highly displeasing to
the Nation also in the late Reigns, and will be so in all
Reigns: As was likewise the denying the People their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
Right of frequent Parliaments. They had also in
the late Governments an Invention to make a Pump of the
Parliament, and by pouring in a Pint of Water, to fetch out
a Tun: This was justly most provoking to the Nation, and
treasur'd up Wrath against the Day of Wrath.</p>
            <p>The refusing of Bills, and the Contempt of Addresses
from the Parliament against Ministers, or in any other
cases, hath likewise given great Offence in former Reigns.
For tho the House of Commons, seconded by the House of
Lords, cannot reach the Life of Estate of any Person, but
by a full Proof in form of Law; yet because it is so difficult
a matter to come at such a Proof, a Vote of the House of
Commons against any Minister, hath always been esteem'd
by all Kings (who were well with the People) a sufficient
Reason for the removing them from Court; and I have
heard that our King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth (a Warlike and a
Wise Prince) upon an Address from the Parliament against
some of his Ministers, reply'd. <hi>I know no Evil by these Men,
but if they are thought unfit by my Parliament for my Service,
I shall not think fit to continue them in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All these things, Sir, therefore are most carefully to be
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:97874:7"/>
avoided by your Majesty: They will appear with a worse
Grace in You, who have declar'd and made War against
these Practices, than in your Predecessors: For as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
says, <hi>Thou who hast said, Ye shall not commit Adultery, dost
thou commit Adultery? Thou who hast said, Ye shall not steal,
dost thou steal?</hi> You must by no means, Sir, give this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of Clamour and Recrimination to your Enemies.
But be pleas'd to follow this General Rule, always to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of the Ministers, and to avoid the Schemes and
Counsels of K. <hi>Charles</hi> and K. <hi>Iames</hi>'s Government, and
then You can scarce err: For whatever is opposite to their
Principles and Practices, is the direct Road to your Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Success.</p>
            <p>In the next place, Sir, let Rewards and Punishments be
duly and impartially distributed; this is a Rule to which
all Ages and Governments have paid the greatest Respect
and Observance; and to which the present Monarch of
<hi>France</hi> does chiefly owe the Prosperity of his Affairs: and
without this Principle no Government can subsist. Your
Ministers who serve You well and faithfully, must be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish'd
from those who betray You, or serve You care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
and idely; and not smil'd or frown'd upon as they are
supported or persecuted by this or that Party or Faction.
(And by the way, Sir, a Prince in <hi>England</hi> that rules ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws and Interests of his People, will never
have occasion to make his Court to any Party or Faction;
nor can any Minister or any Party serve You against the
Interest of the Nation.) Let your Souldiers be encourag'd,
and preferr'd according to their Bravery and Abilities, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Favour or Affection: The Bravest otherwise will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the Example of Cowards, if they find they have no
Advantage over them by their Courage: For <hi>all Men would
be Cowards if they durst.</hi> To an English Souldier a Smile or
a kind Word, is as acceptable at some times as a Month's
Pay; and if you will condescend to a Commendation of
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:97874:7"/>
what they do well, they will endeavour in the next occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
to exceed what they did before: For if You are once
Master of their Love, Your are sure to have the Disposal
of their Lives. Nor need You fear to punish them severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
provided You reward them bountifully. Let the Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of your Enemies be rebuk'd, and Rebels and Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
to your Government be severely punish'd, and not
courted and caress'd; for in the present State of Affairs all
Mercy to your Enemies is Cruelty to your Self and Friends:
and it encourages your Enemies, and disheartens your
Loyal Subjects, to see these Insolents brave the Government
unpunish'd, and to see your treacherous Ministers sollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Pardon of every condemn'd Traitor; and making
their Court to K. <hi>I.</hi> at the Price of your Safety, is most
provoking to every good Man. Besides, it looks like your
having a Doubt of your own Right and Title to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to be thus backward in asserting it; and is so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted
by the <hi>Iacobites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Intelligence is another Point of mighty Consequence, and
can scarce be purchas'd too dear: For it is the Soul of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and directs all its Actions properly, and without
it You consult in the dark, and execute blindfold; You
know not what to act, what to fear, where to attack, or
where to defend: I do not mean by this that we are to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate
into the <hi>French</hi> King's Counsels, or rifle his Cabinet,
that I am afraid is out of the reach of our Power, and of
our Purse; But I cannot but think we may be able to know
the Marches of their Armies, and the Motions of their
Fleets, without selling our Souls to the Devil for Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
or breaking our Exchequer.</p>
            <p>Thus, Sir, I have set before Your Majesty, what, in my
poor Judgment, is for your Interest to pursue, and what is
for your Service to avoid; what will make your Majesty and
this Nation happy, what will make both unhappy: and I
heartily pray the Great, Good and Wise God, to direct, bless
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:97874:8"/>
and prosper your Majesty in all your Glorious Designs for
the Defence of these Kingdoms, and of <hi>Christendom</hi> against
the common Enemy. If I have us'd too great a Freedom,
or have offended in what I design'd for your Service, I am
sorry for it: I call God to witness, my Plainness proceeded
from my Zeal and Affection to your Interests, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperity
of your Affairs, and not from any factious, saucy,
or unmannerly Principle. I wish some abler Pen had taken
upon them this Part. But I must own, it provok'd me to
see my Country and my King so forsaken; the one of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates,
the other of honest Counsel; and this urg'd me to
take upon me those two Characters, of Advocate and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viser,
both which I confess my self very unfit for: Not, but
that as I said in the beginning, I take it to be the Privilege,
nay and the Duty too of every English Subject, (provided
it be perform'd with a decent and due Respect) to lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the King such Matters as may be dangerous to his
Person or Government, to be conceal'd from his Knowledg:
(for we are not ty'd up in <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Spanish</hi> Forms, where
the King must be wet to the Skin, if he whose proper Office
it is be not in the way to put on his Cloak.) And I beg
your Majesty to believe what I have said is from a Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
and Sincerity, which will in all Accidents and Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
preserve me unalterably,</p>

            <p>AT the beginning of the late Revolution, I dare say,
it was not expected by thee or me, That it would
have been necessary in this Reign, to have enter'd
into Argument, whether the Principles of <hi>Whig</hi>
or <hi>Tory</hi> are most agreeable to the Constitution of the English
Monarchy; or which Party were to be chosen for the Support
of our present King and Queen. But such is our Fate, that
I am afraid it requires an abler Pen than mine to convince
some, who it is highly necessary should be convinc'd, that any
of the Measures of the late Reigns were mistaken: they are
taught to believe those Monarchs in the Right; nay, even
those evil Counsellors too, which were so m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul'd in the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of 88; and none are Rogues and Villains, and deserve
to be hang'd, but those who were most active in the bringing
the present King and Queen over, and in setting the Crown
upon their Heads. I thought it therefore high time that this
Matter should be set right; and in order to it, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and Practices of <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Tory</hi> should be truly and
impartially examin'd; which I have endeavoured to do to the
best of my Knowledg, and shall be well pleased to see any other
do it better from my poor Hint. I acknowledg the Looseness of
the Style, the want of Method in the following Paper, and the
many Repetitions this Dialogue way of writing is liable to,
will lay it open to the Lash of every Pedant, and School-master:
But know, I write not for Fame, or out of any Vanity of being
an Author: <hi>And therefore I come not to you,</hi> as the
<pb facs="tcp:97874:9"/>
Apostle says, <hi>in the enticing words of Man's Wisdom,
but in Plainness and in Truth,</hi> &amp;c. I have stated the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
so fairly, that some of the <hi>Tories</hi> may be Fools enough
perhaps to think I have given them a Victory, (and triumph as
their Admirals did in their being gazetted, because the Council
was so favourable, as to suffer them to pass for mistaken Block-heads,
instead of wilful knavish Liars.) But indeed I thought
the <hi>Tories</hi> had so weak a Plea, that I might well allow them
to make the most of it, and have left nothing unsaid which I
have ever heard them say in their Defence. What they
have done the honest People, and the Interest of <hi>England</hi>
most Mischief by, is that Sham of a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> which
I have in the following Discourse (I hope) convinc'd all honest
Men is a false Notion, impracticable and impossible in <hi>England;</hi>
however this is the Breast-work which they have always cover'd
themselves with, when they designed to fire upon the Rights and
Privileges, the Laws, Liberties and Properties of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
And whenever they do raise this Breast-work, we must en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to beat it about their Ears; I am sure it is too weak to
resist any Attack, and I hope (as <hi>Bays</hi> say) <hi>They fly, They fly,
They fly, who first did make that Lie.</hi> What I have here
written, is with an honest Design of doing Service to my Country;
and if it either happens to inform or convince any, to embrace the
Publick Interest, and the common Good of themselves and Fellow-Creatures,
I have my end. And for the <hi>Tory Criticks,</hi> they
may bite till their Teeth meet through my Book, yet I shall be as
insensible of their Malice, as they have been of the King's Mercy,
Favour and Friendship to them. I will comfort my self, honest
Reader, that I have thee on my side; and so long as thou dost
continue firm in the supporting the English Laws and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
thou dost build upon a Rock, against which, I hope, the
Gates of Hell shall not prevail; and so long I will build upon
thee, and hope for all Good from thee, and pray for all Blessings
upon thee.</p>

Property in what he hath gotten by his Treachery; nay, his
Estate is as often the Snare, as the Comfort of his Life. It
proves sometimes a <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard, and makes him the Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sore
of some hungry Court-Favourite. And I would ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a small Estate fenc'd about with Laws, and the Possession
thereof secur'd to you and your Family, is not of more Value,
than a much greater Revenue, of which you cannot assure your
self the Possession one Minute? Your Fore-Fathers thought the
Laws and Liberties of <hi>England</hi> worth their Care and Contest,
and waded through Rivers of Blood to leave them in force to
their Posterity. And the Church once made it an Article of
their Religion, <hi>Nolumus Leges Angliae mutari:</hi> But thou dost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
all the Principles of Humanity, of common Sense, and
of Religion; and oughtest to be driven out of a Country which
thou makest open Profession to sell, and betray. And as for
what you say of the Ingratitude of Princes, and People, the one
to his faithful and affectionate Subjects, the other to their zealous
Patriots; this does not discharge you from your Duty to either.
But (in Answer to the first) if you will serve Princes no farther
than you serve your Country in serving them; that Service will
always reward it self: and for the <hi>Mob,</hi> as you are ever pleas'd

And let his Example teach you better Principles, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing

amongst Men of Sense, and Estates in <hi>England,</hi> and ever will be.

               <p>As for your original Rise, 'tis certain, you owe your
being known in the World, to the horrid and execrable Designs
of the two late Kings to set up Arbitrary Power and Popery
amongst us: then were all the Jails, Brothels, and Kennels raked
for Villains of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Arl—ns, Clif—ds, Of—s,</hi> were then thought upon for
Ministers of State; and under them were bred such a pack of
Wretches, as the Court of <hi>Tiberius</hi> would have been asham'd of.
In the Law they were of the same sort with the Ministry; What
Age can parallel your <hi>N—ms,</hi> your <hi>N—ths,</hi> your <hi>Ieff—ys,
Sc—gs, Rain—ds, Wri—s,</hi> &amp;c. and their under Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<hi>Gra—m</hi> and <hi>Burt—n?</hi> &amp;c. Then as to the Pillars of
what they then called the <hi>Church of England,</hi> tho so disguised at
that time, that it was scarce known by its most dutiful, most
affectionate, and most pious Children; I need say no more of
them, than that they were composed of Bishops, and a Clergy
preferr'd by two Kings, who were about to set up <hi>Popery</hi> and
<hi>Tyranny:</hi> And therefore were to choose such Men into the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
of the Church, who they thought would be most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying
with those Purposes, and whose Looseness of Morals might
bring most Discredit upon the Protestant Religion: and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
remembers <hi>Park—r, Cart—t,</hi> or knows <hi>Cr—w,</hi> and
<hi>Wat—n,</hi> will (I think) be of the Opinion they were not ill

               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>But you see whatever Purposes they were chosen for,
several of the Bishops <hi>opposed Popery</hi> with the greatest Bravery
imaginable.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>True, they did oppose a Popish Clergy being brought into
their Bishopricks, Churches and Colleges; and who but a mad
Man would have expected any other from them? But did they
ever stick at any thing that might advance Arbitrary Power over
the Laity? Did they not conjure the People to Passive Obedience,
Non-resistance? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Did they not tie us Hand and Foot, and
throw us like <hi>Daniel</hi> into the Lions Den? Nay, did they ever
stick at building his Popish Church for him, whilst he contented
himself to make use of their Hands? But when they saw that
after they had gone so far in the Service, others were taken in to
finish the Work, and to reap the Fruit of what they had sow'd
and planted: This was indeed intolerable, and then it was, and
not before, that they begun to make a Noise about the <hi>Protestant
Religion,</hi> and <hi>English Liberties,</hi> and to preach backward all their
former Sermons.</p>

               <p>I own they were for some time, like Fishes who have got
a Worm in their Heads, they did frisk and leap out of their
own Element; but like them too, they soon plung'd into it again:
for K. <hi>I.</hi> was scarce got to <hi>Feversham,</hi> before they repented what
they had done, and from that day to this have given all the
Proofs and Marks of an invincible Hatred and Enmity to the
present Government: They opposed the King's coming to the
Crown, fell into Cabals for the weakning his Government when
he was King, and raised Rebellion without, and Plots within the
Kingdom for the restoring of K. <hi>I.</hi> &amp;c. Nay, at this time it is
undeniable, that when ever the Clergy are most numerous, the
Jacobites are most numerous too; there are more Jacobites ten
for one in every Cathedral Town, than in any other Towns,
accounting number for number: And how the Universities are
generally disaffected to this Government, is notorious; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
and rail against the very Bishops and Clergy-men pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd
in this Reign. The Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> himself,
whose Learning, Piety, and Excellencies of all kinds, are so eminent,
that it seems impolitick in them, as well as unjust to
reproach him, yet him too do they rail, scoff at, and treat with
the foulest Invectives. In short, those who every day piously
attend the Service and Religious Worship of the Church, who
most frequently are Communicants in the holy Sacrament, these
they will notwithstanding call <hi>Presbyterians, canting, whining Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,</hi>

but those who drink with them, and come up to all their highest
Points of Dominion, Tyranny, and Uncharitableness to all those who
are not of their Faction: I will not call it their Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I think it a Dishonour to the best Reform'd Church in the
World, to be served by such a Clergy as are not only a Scandal to
the Name of <hi>Protestant,</hi> but to the Name of <hi>Religion;</hi> and who,
under the Title of <hi>Protestant Priests,</hi> are labouring with all their

Clergy-men, the Lay Knaves and Fools are directed to take Oaths
with Mental Reservations, and private Interpretations and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctions.
And having no Principle, but that of Self-Interest, in
which case you ever renounce all Justice, all Humanity to your
Fellow-Creatures; you profess Slavery to some, that you may Lord

a Turn, make a Jest of Liberty and Property: And to gratify
your Pride or Avarice, you have betray'd your Country, perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
and murdered your innocent Country-men and Fellow-Citizens,
sold your Neighbours to the French King, and your
Laws and Religion to the late Kings; and even from the same
Principles have been endeavouring to bring about the same
Practices in this Reign too; and in order to it, have been tempting
your Lord and Master, in the Language of the Devil to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<hi>All this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me;</hi>

               <p>Fair Appearances, and great Numbers prove nothing;
the lewdest Strumpets are often fair, and Fools and Knaves have
in all Ages out-numbred the Wise and Honest. How ye <hi>Tories</hi>
came to have so great a Countenance from the last Court, I have
already shew'd, and will (since you command me) shew you how
ye became the Favourites of this Court too, even by the same
Means, and the same Men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that made you Favourites in King
<hi>Charles</hi>'s Time. For the M. of <hi>C.</hi> after all his mischievous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement
of Affairs in that Reign, having by an ill Fate to this
poor Nation, got into some small pretence of Merit, by little
Assistances he gave to the late Revolution; upon this he sets up
again for Ministry. But being apprehensive that those honest
Gentlemen, who had so bravely exposed their Lives and Fortunes
for the Redemption of their Country, and were so well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with his Methods in the late Reigns, would be jealous of his
having too great a Credit with the King, he thought it his best play
to begin with them; and from his first Coming to Court,
labour'd to insinuate Jealousies into the King of those Gentlemen
as <hi>Commonwealths-men, Haters of Monarchy,</hi> &amp;c. and having like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
an implacable Pique to Parliaments, for their Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

that part of the Government envious of the King's Power, and
always endeavouring to make him a King of Clouts, a Duke of

he made way to bring in his old Practices, and his old working
Fools (whom he represented to be Men of Business, and Friends
to Monarchy) into this Court too; and being assisted afterwards
by the E. of <hi>N.</hi> and some others, ye have indeed carried all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> who was esteem'd a wise and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

And for his dear Friends of the Church, not all his Renunciation of
his old Religion, and his old Friends; not all his Gifts, his Caresses,
and his Courtship could reconcile them to him, or so much as save
his Life, when they had it in their Power to destroy it. For those
jealous Gentlemen, the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> never would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

believe that they shall mend themselves, by changing us for you,

               <p>First, because you are for a Commonweath-Government,

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>That is, that we are mad Men, and void of all common
Sense and Reason: for whoever hath either of these, will know a
Commonwealth, a <hi>Chymera</hi> impracticable, and impossible to be
brought about in <hi>England.</hi> If <hi>Machiavel</hi> be of any Authority, he
says in his 55<hi>th</hi> Chapter upon Government, <q>That where there
is not an Equality in the Conditions and Estates of a People,
it is impossible for that People or Nation to erect and settle a
Commonweath.</q> He gives you Examples to confirm this, but
I think there are some more to our purpose, as being more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
and nearer home. Upon the Revolt of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi>
from the <hi>Spanish</hi> Yoke, it was necessary for them to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under some Form of Government; and the Form being
in their own free Choice, seven of the seventeen Provinces, who
were a Trading sort of People, much upon an Equality in their
Condition and Fortune, and had few Families of Nobility or
Gentry among them, fell naturally into a Commonwealth-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment:
But the other ten Provinces, having great numbers of
Nobility and Gentry, tho they were more immediately under the
Tyranny of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and had been more particularly sensible
of <hi>D'alva</hi>'s Cruelty and Oppression, notwithstanding chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to continue under the hated Government of <hi>Spain,</hi> than to
accept of the Invitation the other seven Provinces had made them
of coming into the more hated Project of a <hi>Commonwealth:</hi> so
impossible it is to reconcile Men distinguished by Titles and
Fortunes, to mix themselves in a common Level with the People
upon any Consideration or Disgust whatsoever. And whoever
will look over what passed here in <hi>England</hi> from the Year 1648,
to the Year 1660, will be yet more convinc'd of the Truth of
this Assertion, and of the Nonsense of any Commonwealth-Design
in this Nation: Perhaps there was never at any time so
many Men of strong Inclinations for a Commonwealth-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as then, nor of greater Abilities to effect such a Design:
And yet they found the Nobility, Gentry and Dignified Clergy
such a Rub in their way, as no Art, no Force could remove: and
at last they were brought into that Confusion and Disorder by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97874:14"/>
attempting it, that the very People and Army who were in this
Project of a Commonwealth, and had overthrown the Monarchy
in order to it, and could support <hi>Cromwell</hi> in a single Person, yet
after his Death saw a necessity of restoring the Monarchy again,
and assisted towards it. But this was the Dust which the two last
Courts threw into the Peoples Eyes when they would make them
blind to Arbitrary Power and Popery: And is now one great
Artifice the <hi>Iacobites</hi> depend upon, whereby to separate the
Friends of this Government from its Support; tho it will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
be a Jest to understanding Men. I have heard a Story of
a Lady, who passing through a Crowd to her Coach, and having
a rich Jewel on her Breast, cover'd the Jewel with one of her
Hands; which a Pick-pocket in the Crowd observing, steps up
to her, and claps his Hand upon a Place below, which he thought
would oblige her to remove her Hand from her Breast, to
defend it: But the Lady apprehending the Thief's Design,
very prudently neglected the false Attack, and apply'd both
her Hands to the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>curing her Jewel, and by that means came
off safe. And so Gentlemen, whenever you make your false
Attack upon our Commonwealth, we shall for the future, take
it for the Signal to us, that your real Aim is at our Liberties
and Properties, and shall apply both our Hands and Hearts
to the securing those Jewels of inestimable Price. But to be
serious, in our case the <hi>Whigs</hi> (as I said in the beginning of our
Discourse) have given sufficient Proof how little they design'd
a Commonwealth, and how hearty they were to the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
in their struggling so zealously to set the Crown on the
King's Head.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>We own you were for giving him the Name of a King:
But after all, speak sincerely, Did you design to make him any
more than a King of Clouts, a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> or a Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>We design'd to make him as great a King as the Laws
of <hi>England</hi> and our Ancient Constitution make any King: And
if you pretend to make him more, take the Honour of it. But,
Sir, upon this occasion your Party were for making his present
Majesty less than either a Duke of <hi>Venice,</hi> or Statholder of
<hi>Holland:</hi> For in proposing to make him a <hi>Regent,</hi> you make him
only a Journy-man-King, a Subject to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to him: But what the <hi>Whigs</hi> did to deserve being suspected
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97874:14"/>
of a Commonwealth-Design, or of any Intention to lessen the

               <p>You are wilfully so then; for what could the meaning
of the Convention be to settle the Revenue of the Crown from
three Years to three Years, and to take away the Revenue of
the <hi>Chymney-Money,</hi> one of the fairest Flowers of the Crown,
but lessening the King's Power, and making his Government
precarious?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>The Chimney-Tax being grown a Grievance more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
and more odious to the common People than any other; and
the danger of being enslav'd by giving such great Revenues (for
Life) to the two last Kings (by which they were enabled to
maintain standing Armies, and to subsist without Parliaments)
was so fresh in the Memories of all thinking English-Men, and so
apprehended by them, that the King's Friends thought it greatly
for his Service to take away the Burden of the one, and the
Apprehension of the other from the People, and by using diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Methods to those which had been follow'd in the former
Reigns. To make his present Majesty's Government more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
to all good Men, and that He might hereby reign in
the Hearts of his Subjects, and be distinguished by them: which
Method, if pursued, would have given us a fairer Prospect of our
Affairs, than at present I am afraid we have. But this is not the
Interest of wicked Ministers, who when Kings take these Courses,
lose their Dominion over them: their business is therefore to
make Princes jealous of Encroachments of Parliaments, of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth-Designs
amongst the People, to represent the King's
Interest separate from the Interest of his Subjects; and then to
ingratiate themselves with him, and raise themselves in his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
for their Parts and Abilities, they offer him Schemes of
Politicks, to prevent Designs against him which were never thought
on. Thus these <hi>honest Iago's</hi> first work a Prince up to Jealousies
and Hatred of his People, by false Suggestions; and then, as a
Remedy against the Mischiefs they have suppos'd, put him upon
Designs ruinous to his Country and himself. But in the mean
time, by appearing thus zealous for what they call the King's
particular Interest and Glory, they insinuate themselves into
some sort of Princes Favour, they become Confidents of all
Court-Intrigues, and grow great and rich; they dispose all Offices<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:97874:15"/>
and crush all who are not their Creatures; and at last come to
awe and govern Kings themselves. As Waiting-Women, who
when they have debauched their Mistresses by their Mercenary
Sollicitations, and are become the Trustees of their Frailty,
they no longer taste the Busk, nor bitter Reproofs for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing
of a Pin or Patch; but from Servants become Mistresses,
no Faults are then found with them, no Liberty denied them;
even the Purse, and the rich Petticoat is absolutely at the
Waiting-woman's Service, till at last they bring their Mistresses
to Infamy and Beggary. And so to return to the Ministry
again; By this kind of Management they make their Masters
Kings of Clouts, necessitous, miserable, and despis'd Princes.
For Example; What made the late King <hi>Iames a King of
Clouts,</hi> but those Evil Counsellors, who put him upon De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotick
and Dispensing Power, and propagating a Religion
against Law? Who put him upon preferring Papists and <hi>Irish,</hi>
to Protestants and <hi>English?</hi> Who advised his seizing Colleges
and Charters, setting up High-Commission-Courts, and making
Parliaments and Laws a Nose of Wax? Deny this if you can,
Mr. <hi>Tory.</hi> Nay, as to your Idol-King, <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, (who
notwithstanding I believe much the worse of the two Brothers, as
sinning against a better Understanding, and greater Obligations)
was it not by these Counsels, and some of these Counsellors,
that this Gentleman was made a <hi>King of Clouts</hi> too, from having
all the Advantages at the time of his Restoration that ever
King was blessed with? He was belov'd, delighted in, and courted
by his Subjects; was respected Abroad, in Plenty and Power at
Home; and could direct the Votes of a Parliament with a Nod
(more than he could at last with his Exchequer): yet after all
this in a few Years, by the Management of some of our present
Evil Counsellors, who gave him ill Impressions of his Subjects,
made him out of Love with Parliaments, and poison'd him with
Lawless Power, and Love of Tricks, (the worst of Poisons to an
English King) who, for their own filthy Interest, perswaded him
to sell <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> break the <hi>Triple League,</hi> and enter into Measures
with <hi>France,</hi> destructive to the Interest of this Nation, and of all
<hi>Europe.</hi> By these Measures he at last became distasteful to his
Subjects, and was forsaken by a Parliament the most attach'd to
him, and in love with his Person to a Fault; so that at last<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97874:15"/>
Necessities drove him to become a Pensioner to
<hi>France</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">A fine Character for an English King.</note>. And if you will believe Mr. <hi>Dreyden,</hi>
his Poet-Laureat, concluded his Reign in these
miserable Circumstances of being [despis'd
Abroad, and living on Tricks at Home.] And how these Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens
Father and Grandfather were made <hi>Kings of Clouts</hi> by
the like Measures and the like Ministers, by endeavouring at Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
Power, and laying aside Parliaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even the Histories
of those Times publish'd by their own Authority, make it out
plainly. And now, Mr. <hi>Tory,</hi> if you please we will examine a
little into the few Examples we have of Princes who have practis'd
a contrary Method to the before-mentioned one; we will enquire
what Effects that sort of Government hath produced; and we
need go no farther, I think, than Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, the
immediate Predecessor to the Scotish Race, to fetch a Comparison
that will answer all Objections: And to give the Beauty of her
Government its due Lustre, let us set it off with the Difficulties
that attended it and surrounded it in the beginning. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
her in the first place—of the weaker
Sex,—a Woman—having no<note n="*" place="margin">A new Distinction our Statesmen have lately found out.</note> rightful, tho
a lawful Title;—The greatest part of her
Subjects of a contrary Religion to her—The
Queen of <hi>Scotland,</hi> her next Neighbour, a Pretender to the
Crown—<hi>Ireland</hi> in open Rebellion: The King of <hi>Spain,</hi>
the greatest Monarch of <hi>Europe</hi> at that time, her mortal Enemy,
and Invader—Plots and Conspiracies by the Papists against
her at Home—And no Ally Abroad but the <hi>Dutch,</hi> then
an Infant State, and supported by her.—And yet we see
this poor, weak Woman in the midst of all these Disadvantages,
Absolute and Uncontroul'd at Home, Aweful and Glorious
Abroad. This indeed seems very extraordinary; Let us enquire
therefore what Methods were then practised in order to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
such wonderful Success: Was it by corrupting Elections,
or making Pensioners of Parliament-Men?—No, for her
Courtiers pleaded (as well in Bar of being Parliament-Men as
of being Sheriffs) that they were the Queen's Servants: So that
by this we may reasonably conclude there was nothing to be
got by it in those days.—Was it by employing her Sister
Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Ministers, or courting her Enemies the Papists?—
No,—For she made <hi>England</hi> too hot for the one, and adorn'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97874:16"/>
almost every Gibbet in the Nation with her Justice upon the
other.—Was it by a standing Army then?—Not
that neither; for she had no Army, nor no Guards, but her
Gentlemen-Pensioners, and Yeomen of the Guard. I know you'll
say, <hi>How the Devil could she bring Matters about as she did, without
using any of the admired Methods of our late Times?</hi>—In good
sooth, even by so homely and plain a Receipt, that you'll laugh
at me when I tell it you—Only—by loving, and courting the
Love of her People, and not preferring <hi>Scotish, French,</hi> not <hi>Irish</hi>
Favourites to them (as in the late Reigns)—By being just
to their Rights and Liberties, and devoted to their Interests—
By rewarding bountifully, and punishing severely;—By
encouraging honest Men, and—browbeating State-Projectors
and Tricksters; Knaves who perswade Princes, that their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
is separate from the Interest of their People;—who
counsel them to stretch Prerogative, or be over-fond of it;—
who endeavour to breed unkind Thoughts in them to their best
Friends and honestest Subjects. This sort of Gentlemen were
out at Heels in her time. She, like a truly wise Woman, never
seem'd fond of Despotick Dominion, nor of those who flatter'd
her with it, and put her upon it; for she knew, that <hi>Nolo Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minare</hi>
is the readiest way to Power in <hi>England,</hi> and that it is
soonest <hi>found of those who seek it not.</hi>—She—wisely thought,
that to be the <hi>Deliverer of Europe,</hi> a greater Character than to
be <hi>Conqueror of it;</hi> and that it would be more truly glorious to
redeem one single Town from Slavery, than to enslave the whole
World. Not like some of her Successors, who (unworthy to
be Soveraigns of the Noble Order the Kings of <hi>England</hi> wear)
have chosen rather to be the <hi>Dragon</hi> than St. <hi>George,</hi> rather to
destroy than to defend their Kingdoms.—She never took
Money from her Subjects, but she gave them a Penny-worth
for their Penny; and was seldom nice in according them such
Laws as they thought necessary to their Safety. For being well
assur'd of her own just Intentions, she never suspected theirs.
And thus at last she got an absolute Power even over the
Laws,—as a good Wife gets a Power over her Husband,
by loving and obeying him. And now I think I have sufficiently
exemplified what sort of Ministers and Methods they are which
make Princes <hi>Great and Glorious Monarchs,</hi> and which make them
<hi>Kings of Clouts.</hi> And whether this latter Character belongs to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97874:16"/>
the <hi>Whig</hi> or <hi>Tory,</hi> I submit to the Judgment of every impartial
and reasonable Man. But go on with your Charge.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>It is objected against you <hi>Whigs</hi> also, that you do not love
the King's Person.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>What an Accusation hast thou blundered upon, thou
very <hi>Irish Tory,</hi> thou eternal Trifler! Not love the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?
—'Tis a Thought fit only for a Chamber-Maid, when the
Chaplain or Valet offer their Service to her. Kings are to be lov'd
by Millions of their Subjects who never see their Persons, (as
Heaven is by Mankind) for their Providence and Care of their
People; for the Influences they dispense of their Justice and
Mercy, and for the universal Good and Benefits which they
scatter amongst their Subjects. And in this Point their Thoughts
and Designs should be God-like; and by any other sort of Lovers
than these, any King will be as slenderly accompanied in his
Misfortunes, as King <hi>Iames</hi> was to <hi>Feversham.</hi> But besides,
this Accusation is as false as it is foolish: pray, Sir, Who
shew'd the most early Inclination to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s
Person, the <hi>Whigs</hi> or the <hi>Tories?</hi> Who went into <hi>Holland</hi> first
and begun the Project of the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s coming over
hither, <hi>Whigs</hi> or <hi>Tories?</hi> Who put the Crown upon his Head
when he did come, <hi>Whigs</hi> or <hi>Tories?</hi> But to come nearer to
the Point; Did not the <hi>Whigs</hi> shew a most apparent Partiality
to the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s Person in all the Points of the Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Crown, and particularly in giving it Him for Life,
overlooking at the same time the P. of <hi>D</hi>'s Title, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal
Succession? Did they not to a Man stand by the King's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in the Debate concerning the P. of <hi>D</hi>'s Revenue, and
leave the Disposal of that Affair entirely to the King's Pleasure?
And now after four Years being us'd like the worst of Enemies
for all these Services; after being shut out from speaking to the
King, and almost from seeing him; after being discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced
and frown'd upon, they have notwithstanding (like
the humerous Lieutenant) ever shewed a <hi>grutching to his Grace</hi>
upon the least Encouragement, or Invitation; and have at the
opening of every Sessions, for three Winters successively, still
been ready to swallow the same Sweetnings, and to be coaks'd
by a Clap on the Cheek, like an old City-Cuckold and Cully,
and have been wrought into a Credulity, which nothing but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97874:17"/>
their Fondness and Dotage on the King's Person, could have
effected.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>But you will not deny that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you have sometimes express'd
your selves peevishly concerning the King.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>And what Lover that hangs or drowns himself for
his Mistress, does not do the same? Railing in a Lover is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Symptom that he is far gone in the Distemper: And no
Woman ever yet resented it when it came from that Cause<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
But our Court hath not learn'd to distinguish between those
who are angry with them, in concern for their Prosperity,
and those who seem pleas'd with them in hopes that they are
in the way to Destruction. And to speak plainly, Sir, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality
and Courtship which the King hath shewed to you
<hi>Tories,</hi> in spight of all your apparent Hatred of his Person, as
well as your profess'd Dislike of his Title and Government,
and the Aversion he hath shew'd to the <hi>Whigs,</hi> and Contempt
of all their Advances and Addresses, hath begotten ugly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings
in jealous and prying Men, as if there were a Biass to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Principles of former Governments, rather than to
those this Government declar'd for, and set up upon: And even
the wise and well meaning <hi>Tories</hi> begin once again to smell a
T—d when you hold it so near their Noses. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> come,
proceed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>You are likewise accus'd of being wedded to a Party, and
by that means will reduce his Majesty to be King of a Faction only
of his Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>This will appear much otherwise, if you will please to
remember who brought in the E. of <hi>N.</hi> to be Secretary of State,
and many others of that Party, and how few of your Faction were
displac'd by the <hi>Whigs</hi> when they had Interest with the King.
But this Charge will appear most foully true upon you, who by
the basest Ingratitude and Villany fell upon undermining those
who brought you into the Government the minute you were
possess'd of the King's Ear. And yet you see, notwithstanding all
your barbarous Treatment of us, We have always come in chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to all Votes for Money, all Loans, and all other Measures to
support your Credit and the Common Interest, till both are fallen
so low, that the Peoples Clamours were never so loud, nor their
Dissatisfactions never so great. You, like <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Harlot, are
for tearing the Government asunder, if you may not have the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:97874:17"/>
Possession of it. We have shew'd on the other hand true Mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Tenderness,
and consented rather that it should remain in
your Possession entirely, than be torn in pieces betwixt us, till
it appear'd to all the World what a vile Step-Mother you have
been, and how you have starv'd and abus'd a Government worthy
your most indulgent Tenderness and Care. And yet I am not
for refusing any <hi>Tory</hi> that gives Proof of his sincere Repentance,
and of a Love to his Country, but with all my Heart would give
my share of the fatted Calf to make the returning Prodigal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come;
tho I cannot but think it reasonable, that you should sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively
seek the Government, and not the Government sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missively
seek you; that you should own your Sin against Heaven,
and against your Country, and give Security of another course of
Life for the future, and not justify your Faults, and persevere in
them. If I could see amongst any of you the least Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for the common Good and Benefit of Mankind, and the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal
Welfare of your Fellow-Creatures, to which you are bound
by the Law of God, and the Law of Nature, and to which all
the Heathens who were not barbarous, paid a most profound
Reverence and Obedience, and preferr'd to all private Interest,
to Wives, Children, Estate, nay to Life it self. If I can find
any amongst you a Lover of his Country, a sincere Supporter of
the Laws, Liberties and Interest of the English Nation, I am
as much his Servant, tho he be a <hi>N—,</hi> a <hi>C—,</hi> or
a <hi>R—,</hi> as if he were a <hi>S—,</hi> a <hi>R—,</hi> a <hi>S—,</hi>
or a <hi>T—.</hi> But instead of shewing any Regard to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
of the Nation, any Bowels for your Country, any Self-denial
in point of private Interest: Have you not sold your
Country, and their Birth-rights upon all occasions (like <hi>Esau</hi>)
for a Mess of Pottage? Have not some of you put off Human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
Human Reason, and all common Honesty, so far, as to
conspire to bring in a <hi>French</hi> Power, to gratify your private and
personal Piques? To bring in <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> to rule over you,
because you cannot Tyrannically rule over your Fellow-Subjects?
Remember what the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> got by being so active in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing
the two late Popish Kings, hoping to be reveng'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
upon the <hi>Independents,</hi> and other Dissenters: Were they not
mingled in the same Persecution with the others, nay, more
oppress'd and mark'd out for Wrath, as being more numerous
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:97874:18"/>
and more considerable than any other Sect? Just so must the
<hi>Church</hi> and their Proselytes expect to fare from the Hands of
their <hi>Popish</hi> Friends (whose Cause they are so zealously propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating;)
they may admit them to the Honour of being the
<hi>Cat's-foot,</hi> but not a bit of the <hi>Chesnut:</hi> No <hi>Whig,</hi> no <hi>Fanatick,</hi>
but will then have as fair Quarter (at least) from King <hi>Lewis,</hi>
as you, (for King <hi>Iames</hi> I take to be only a Cypher, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
to your <hi>French</hi> Lord and Master, who when he hath
finished his Work, will finish his Life too.) And do you <hi>Iure
Divino,</hi> you truly Loyal Gentlemen, think that you will find
more Favour then for being more attach'd to King <hi>Iames</hi>'s
Interest? No, be assured the most inveterate Enemies of King
<hi>Iames</hi> will meet with as favourable a Treatment at least as
you, who have professed your selves so violently enamour'd of
King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Person, and of the right Line. Reflect a little up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Conduct at the time of the late Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
He knew long before the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s design of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a Descent into <hi>England,</hi> and could have prevented it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
ways; but instead of that, he writes to <hi>Barillon,</hi> then his
Ambassador in <hi>England,</hi> to know in what Condition King <hi>Iames</hi>
was to oppose the Prince's Forces: He being a Foreigner, and
judging only by outward Appearances, represents the Army of
King <hi>Iames</hi> sufficiently powerful to resist what Force the Prince
of <hi>Orange</hi> could bring: whereupon the <hi>French</hi> King believing that
the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> would by this means weaken and destroy
one another, and leave a fair Game for him the next Year against
the Emperor and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and to take away all Apprehension
from the <hi>Dutch</hi> of their needing an Army for their own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and to give all Encouragement to their Design upon <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
he draws all his Troops from the side of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and falls
upon <hi>Philipsburg;</hi> which Army if he had marched towards the
<hi>Spanish</hi> Frontiers in <hi>Flanders,</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> durst not have transport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a Man; and the whole Design of the Descent had been at an
end. From hence it is plain what Friendship the <hi>French</hi> King had
for his <hi>dear Brother</hi> King <hi>Iames,</hi> and what you may expect from
this Man of Honour and good Nature, when you have serv'd
his Turn. Come, grow wise and honest, and let us not divide
under this or that Ministry, under this or that Faction or Party,
but let us all unite against the common Enemy; let us make the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:97874:18"/>
Publick Interest, and the Support of the Government as it is esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
by Law, our chief and only Aim; and for all Projectors and
Conspirators, whether for a <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> a <hi>French Tyranny,</hi> or
any other <hi>Tyranny,</hi> I wish they were all hang'd on the same Tree,
the first for Fools, the others for Miscreants and Villains: And
thus much, and no more am I for being wedded to a Party.</p>

               <p>I own you have told us a fair Tale; but nothing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

               <p>If your mean the French Story needs proving, the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
of <hi>Barillon</hi> when he return'd to <hi>Versaille</hi> upon the account
of mistaking and misrepresenting the English Affairs, is notorious:
But besides, the Story proves it self more than a thousand Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;
and for the rest, I have related nothing but what every
English-man is knowing of. And as for what you charge me with
in relation to the <hi>Church,</hi> I see little Reason for it, unless, as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> says, you account me your Enemy because I tell you the
Truth. For my part I reverence the <hi>Church of England</hi> as much
as any Man: But I am not for sacrificing the Laws and Liberties
of the Publick, nay, the very Nation it self, to a Foreign Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,
for the sound of a Word. I have a due Respect for the
Priesthood too, and am their <hi>Servant,</hi> but never can submit to be
their <hi>Slave:</hi> I honour their Coat, but cannot be content to strip
my self of mine, in respect to it. A moderate Respect is decent,
and our Duty; more I take to be Superstition at least, if not Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry;
and to worship a Wooden Priest, appears to me as bad
as worshipping a Wooden God.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>Now you are running into your usual Violence and Heat;
and let me tell you as a Friend, it does you no good neither with
the Church, nor Court, which latter hath a very low Opinion of
those Men who express too much Warmth in what they say or
do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>And therefore their Affairs have succeeded accordingly.
Let the Nation be Judges, Whether, if Men of Warmth had been
put in Office by our Ministers, the Taxes would not have been more
justly and carefully collected, than they have been by those Luke-warm
Managers they have employ'd; who, like the unjust Steward,
when the King's Due was <hi>an hundred,</hi> bid their Neighbours write
down <hi>fifty?</hi> Or, do you think the Deputy-Lieutenants of <hi>Surry</hi> would
have absconded last Year, when they were ordered to raise the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:97874:19"/>
                  <hi>Militia</hi> upon King <hi>Iames</hi>'s coming down to <hi>Normandy,</hi> if they
had been Men of Warmth to the Government? Or, that King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Friends would dare to profess their Opinions, and carry
on their Designs so publickly? That they would presume to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
the Government in every Coffee-house; nay, in the <hi>Mall</hi> and
<hi>Whitehall</hi> it self? That they would dare to threaten you to your
Teeth as they do, with Invasions, Descents and Rebellions, or
would venture to correspond with <hi>France,</hi> and go forward and
backward every Day to King <hi>Iames;</hi> nay, raise Regiments of
Horse and Foot under your Noses for a Rebellion, if Men of
Warmth and Zeal were in the Government? But it is from hence
that all these Insolencies take their Rise, that the Enemies of the
Government are come from hating it, to despite it; that its
Friends are discouraged to appear for it; and that those Officers
and Souldiers who in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s time would have broken the
Heads of those whom they heard reflect upon the King's Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
or Government, will in this Reign hear both treated very
odly; not that they want an Affection to either, but out of a fear
to offend by shewing themselves <hi>Men of Warmth,</hi> and <hi>Party-men,</hi>
those Characters being so abominable to our Court.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>You <hi>Whigs</hi> have been the occasion of all this too: for
you were so irreconcileable to some Ministers of State at the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Revolution, because they had made a few Slips in
the last Reigns; or perhaps because they had hang'd some of
your Friends, a Father, or Brother, or so; that you forc'd them
to take in some Persons which they themselves thought not very
proper for this Government: But if you will run a Man down, he
will support himself at any rate; for Men are but Men: And
withal I believe they hop'd that a Place would buy any Party

               <p>This is very far fetch'd, Mr. <hi>Tory,</hi> tho it is not the first
time I have heard it. But as to the first part of this Paragraph,
the Matter of Fact is false: The <hi>Whigs</hi> were willing to forget all
past Miscarriages, and be reconciled to any Minister that could
be honest, as I shew'd you before. But these Gentlemen quickly
convinc'd all the World, that they were grown so old and stiff
in their former Mischiefs, that they were capable of no other
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>end or Impression, but what they had taken in the last Reigns.
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:97874:19"/>
And it was plain to every Man that had Eyes, that they were no
sooner in the Ministry, but they fell into their old Schemes
which no honest Man could come into; and which I am afraid the
Court hath not found the good Effects from, which these <hi>Evil
Counsellors</hi> promis'd. It's true, by giving Places to all that were
supple, and complying, you have brought in the Knaves of all
Parties: But since that which brings them into the Service of the
Government, is their own Interest, and not that of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
it will be reasonable for our Rulers to expect, that the
whole Design of such Men, will be rather how to serve themselves
of the Government, than how to serve it. To conclude, Sir,
notwithstanding all you have said in Excuse of your Ministers and
their Methods, I cannot but remain in my first Opinion, That
<hi>the Men of easy Phlegme, born on the Confines of Indifference,</hi> as
Sir, <hi>Samuel Tuke</hi> in <hi>F—ch-like Fustian</hi> describes our luke-warm
Neutrals, are not fit Men to be employ'd in our Government, as
the Case stands at present, but will prove as destructive to it as
downright <hi>Iacobites.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>All this is taking things for granted which we deny; and
accusing Men of what you do not prove; and if it were so, you
confess there are Knaves of your Party too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>The Truth of what I say in relation to your Party, is
so notorious to all the World, that it would be as impertinent to
go about proving it, as to prove there is a Sun; even you your
selves have confess'd, and pretended to repent of your Principles
and Practices in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time, tho you are now return'd to
your Vomit. And as to what you say of our having Knaves
amongst us, I must confess it too true; and am as much afflicted as
you can be, that any <hi>Whig</hi> should invade your undoubted and
sole Right of being Knaves, and selling and betraying their Fellow-Subjects:
But yet we hope we may claim a Distinction to be
made, betwixt our Party, who not only profess, but have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
to the Death, the Religion, Rights and Liberties of their
Country; and yours, who in King <hi>Charles</hi>'s and beginning of King
<hi>Iames</hi>'s Reign gave up all these things; and who, though you are
employ'd in, and sworn to the present Government, make pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Rejoicings at the Slaughter of our Armies, and Destruction
of our Fleets. If the <hi>Whigs</hi> have the Misfortune of some Knaves
professing themselves of their Party: Our Saviour himself had a
<hi>Iudas</hi> amongst his Twelve, and yet that did not at all discredit
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:97874:20"/>
the Doctrine and Principles of the Apostles; not does our having
some Knaves among us, make it as reasonable and equal to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to your Party, that are the professed Enemies of their King
and Country, as to depend on those who have generally in all
Times, and on all Occasions declar'd their Affection to their
Country, Love of its Laws and Religion, and have since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
shewed their Zeal for the present Establishment.</p>

in this critical time without some Marks of their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
and Regeneracy; and by our Easiness give them the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity

And I tell you once more, it is the Opinion of some
wise Men, that the King cannot follow a more fatal Counsel than
to confine himself to any one Party of his Subjects.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>Then your Patrons have been advising him fatally these
four Years; for they have been perswading the King to throw
himself entirely into your Hands.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>They never refus'd to receive any <hi>Whig,</hi> that would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
and come under their Protection; but if the King will
choose any one Party, I think we of the <hi>Church</hi> are the most nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
and considerable, and are fittest as such to be employ'd
by him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>Now you are retired into your Sanctuary, <hi>the Church,</hi> you
think you are safe, and it is indeed dangerous pursuing you: But
however I'll venture it; and since you force me, I must repeat
again some of those Arguments I have given you already, why
you are not fit to be trusted by this Government. First, you <hi>Tories</hi>
do not believe your selves King <hi>William</hi>'s Subjects, and therefore
are very unfit to be employ'd by him as his Servants. Secondly,
It cools the Affections of the People, to see those employ'd in
Places of highest Trust, who they have a Demonstration are not
for the Government even when they are in it. And by this Method
it is plain the King (according to the Fable) loses his <hi>Shoulder
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:97874:20"/>
of Mutton,</hi> by catching at the <hi>Shadow;</hi> and by aiming at both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
he hath neither.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>I confess I am for the King's relying on one Party as much
as you are (tho not yours;) but however, there are great and wise
Men, as I told you, of another Opinion; and I have heard it
ask'd, Why this Method of uniting all Parties should not have
as good an Effect here as in <hi>Holland,</hi> for there the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>
reconcil'd all to the common Interest?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>I'll tell you why; First, it appears all Parties there sincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
intended the Good of the Government; which, it is too plain,
is not your Case. Secondly, Neither Party had any other Head to
repair to, as you <hi>Tories</hi> have; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> had no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
Rival to the Right of Statholder: But the King hath here
a Rival, a Father-in-Law, who pretends a Right to the Crown,
who is supported by the greatest Power that ever was known in
<hi>Europe,</hi> so as to make the Event appear doubtful, even to those
who are most zealous for this Government: And by this means
the Friends of King <hi>Iames</hi> are encouraged to be firm to his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
and Neutrals; nay, and even his fearful Enemies are frighted
from acting with a Zeal against him. Is this a time then to be
trying Experiments, to put our selves and Affairs into the Hands
of Men bred up, and principled against the Design of this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment?
Is this a time to reconcile our selves to our Enemies,
and to take Men out of Plots, and place them in our Cabinet?
No sure, with my Lord <hi>N—</hi>'s leave, <hi>this is not the time.</hi> In
this time of Danger, those who have been the antient and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd
Enemies of King <hi>Iames,</hi> and who have most reason to
expect being hang'd if he return, are most fit for the King to
rely on. But when these Difficulties are master'd, as much Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
as you please. In the mean time your Education in
<hi>Toryism,</hi> your Obligations to King <hi>Iames,</hi> and, which is more
than both, your present Hopes from him, will make you so averse
to this Government, that no Favour, no Courtship can engage
your heartily in its Interests; and it is Nonsense to expect you
should fight for a Title you have always declar'd to disapprove
of.</p>

               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>You are always harping upon that String: But supposing
we do not approve of the making him King, yet we know how
to obey Kings when they are made: But you, after you have made
a King, are using him like your Creature; clipping his Power, and

                  </gap> finding Fault with his Conduct. For my part, <hi>if I were a King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

dislik'd my Conduct.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>Why, then Mr. <hi>Tory,</hi> you would be none of the wisest
Princes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For he who finds fault with your Conduct, may be
your Friend; but he who finds fault with your Title, must be
your Enemy, or else a Knave, and acts against his Conscience.
But how does this Article appear of the <hi>Whigs</hi> being dissatisfied
with the King's Conduct in any Point, but in his employing you,
and the Consequences of it? Is it from giving chearfully what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Sums were demanded in Parliament; Is it being ready to
advance Money upon the most remote Funds, in offering their
Persons to the Publick Service in all times of Danger, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all Brow-beatings, and Discouragements; by breaking all
Measures with King <hi>Iames</hi> and his Party, that they discover their
Dislikes, and Dissatisfactions to the King, or his Government?
But if they disapprove that the Friends of King <hi>Iames</hi> should be
King <hi>William</hi>'s Ministers, that those should be plac'd in all Offices
who hate him and betray him, Will he have Reason to take their
Dislike of this part of his Conduct so very unkindly from them,
as to forgive it less than your renouncing his Right and Title to
the Crown? But your <hi>Tories</hi> have got a Trick of bringing Kings into
your Quarrels, (as the Priests do God Almighty into theirs) and
by placing them before you, hope to make your selves safe, not
caring how much you expose them; and you impudently place
your own Crimes unfairly upon others: and whilst you your
selves are daily Libelling and Lampooning the King's Person and
Conduct most maliciously, and triumphing in all his Misfortunes
ingratefully, (witness the publick Insolencies at the <hi>Bath,</hi> and
<hi>Windsor,</hi> upon the late Defeat in <hi>Flanders</hi>) you, according to
your wonted Modesty, charge the <hi>Whigs</hi> with your own Faults;
and avoid being Criminals, by turning Accusers.</p>

But why are you angry with us for being in Places? Did we
seek them? Were we not sought, courted, intreated to accept
of Employments? And since you provoke me, I'll tell you the
Reason; the King found none of you <hi>Whigs</hi> capable of, or fit
for Business; he saw you too of a sowre, morose Temper, jealous
of Prerogative, affecting Popularity, childishly fond of Trifles,
and tenacious of Lawless Liberty; whilst we are frank, and
easy in all these Matters, and know the Respect that is due to
Crown'd Heads.</p>

               <p>Come, you will make no Prince have the worse Opinion of
us for that; <hi>The Right Line, Passive Obedience,</hi> and <hi>Non-Resistance,
Prerogative,</hi> &amp;c. will always sound well in every King's Ear. And
when he considers us Enemies to his Title only out of a Principle
of Loyalty, he will have reason rather to accuse his own Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
than our Vertue; we plainly and honestly told him our
Principles, that we believ'd him a King <hi>de facto</hi> only; and our
Honour in this Point made him rely upon our Honour in others.</p>

               <p>Let us examine then how honourably, how gratefully

Pretences, and only mention those who have accepted Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> been plotting the Dethroning
this King, who hath trusted them so generously, and courted them
so kindly? Particularly, did not one of your Party at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of this Government, give notice to the King's Enemies of
Warrants against them, in order to their making their Escape, and
was discharg'd his Employment upon it? Did not a Brother of a
certain Secretary, give out Blank Passes under the Hand and Seal
of that Secretary, by which a Correspondence was carried on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
this Place and <hi>France</hi> securely? And was not this Gentleman
upon this Account laid aside gently and privately, and this Matter
huddled up for fear of any Reflection upon our Monarchical Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
and put upon the Publick as Passes forg'd, (as indeed they
were by our own Officers) and a Lame Proclamation put out with
Rewards to the Discoverer, but without a Pardon for Life, when

late Commander of the St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and which hath been told in

serve the Government, and how fit you are to be trusted. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Layton</hi> being ordered to Cruise twenty Leagues off <hi>Vshant,</hi>
by a Storm of Wind was driven to <hi>Cape Clear,</hi> where he met a
French Privateer, and took her: the Captain of the Privateer ask'd
<hi>Layton</hi> the Name of his Ship, which he told him; upon this the
Privateer looking into his Pocket-Book, ask'd <hi>Layton</hi> how he came
there; for by his Intelligence the Station of the St. <hi>Albans</hi> was
to be twenty Leagues from <hi>Vshant,</hi> and no further. And the like
Story is told of a Transport-Ship going to <hi>France</hi> with Prisoners,
some few Months ago, who meeting with divers Privateers, ask'd
them how they durst be so bold as Cruise there, when four English
Men of War were within six Leagues of them? they reply'd, they
knew the Station of those English, and that they could not come
where they were a cruising but by breaking their Orders. But
the Relation of the Sailer who was taken, and for some time
serv'd aboard an Irish Privateer, is yet more remarkable, for he
deposeth, That they told him (thee Months before the <hi>Streights</hi>
Fleet sailed from <hi>Spithead</hi>) both the time when they were to sail,
the number of their Convoy, and likewise that the Main Fleet
was to go no further than beyond <hi>Vshant.</hi> Now how they could
come by this Intelligence, but from Officers imploy'd by and
sworn to the Government, I know not; and if so, how faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

how fit you are to be employ'd in this critical Time, I appeal to

               <p>As the case stands, one honest Man will be of more
Service than ten such able Men; the Forms of Business will be
quickly learned; and want of Experience will be less fatal to us,
than want of Fidelity. Most of the under-Places require a very
indifferent Understanding, and little Experience to carry the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness
on: And if you ascend to the Ministry, I cannot help
thinking my Lords <hi>Sh—y,</hi> or Sir <hi>I. Tr—d</hi> as able Secretaries
as the E. of <hi>N.</hi> and Mr. <hi>R—ll</hi> as able an Admiral as Mr. <hi>K.</hi>&amp;c.
What is it your able Men have done for us, pray, this four Years?
Was ever any Government in so promising a Condition, as ours
was at the time of the Revolution? Were we not the Hopes of
all our Allies, and the Terror of our Enemies? And is not the
case alter'd with us? I fear it is: To be plain, a Ministry from
<hi>Wapping</hi> could not have made worse work on't than yours have
done. Ministers who know not so much as what Money their
Affairs will require, but ask the Parliament too little, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
it so as to make it less. That want Intelligence so much,
that Matters of the greatest Consequence have been publick in
every Coffee-house three days before it comes to the Secretary's
Office; particularly the loss of our Merchants Fleet, and beating
our Army in <hi>Flanders:</hi> As if (as one said) Secretaries, like
Cuckolds, were to know their Dishonour and Misfortunes last.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:97874:23"/>
Then the Return of our Fleets for want of Provisions, laying
out Money in false Expeditions, and wanting it thereby in true
Necessities; imperfect Orders, from whence proceeds imperfect
Execution; and besides they prove an Excuse to Officers even in
the most fatal Miscarriages: with a thousand more Mismanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Treacheries from the top to the bottom of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,

               <p>I have answer'd you that before; I think it would be

Tho I am far (at the same time) from granting you that
Point, for I am sure there are more Men of Sense and Capacity
found amongst the <hi>Whigs,</hi> than amongst the <hi>Tories:</hi> and that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
is not of such mighty Consequence as you would infer,
will appear, if you will please to call to mind the Men employ'd in
Publick Affairs by <hi>Cromwel:</hi> Was ever Government better serv'd
than his? and yet he chose Men of the most private Condition,
and one would have thought most unqualified for Publick Business,
Taylors, Draymen, broken Shop-keepers, raw Scholars, and
some few of the midling Gentry. But being careful to choose
Men principled against the Government of King <hi>Charles,</hi> and
zealous for the Interest of the Government then on foot; they
did Wonders, supported their Friends, and were aweful to
their Enemies; and this with all the Nobility, Gentry and
Clergy, both <hi>Church of England</hi> and <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> in perpetual
Combinations and Conspiracies against them at home, and a
War in <hi>Ireland, Scotland, Holland,</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> too, upon their Hands.
And you have an Instance of it in this Government, in the Person
of one of the Secretaries of <hi>Scotland,</hi> who (tho bred in a very
private way) hath shewed himself a most successful Statesman,
and of great Consequence to the Welfare of the King's Affairs
in that Country, and this meerly from his incorruptible Honesty,
Zeal and Integrity to the present Government, without Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience,
or great Insight into Business.</p>

               <speaker>Tory.</speaker>
               <p>I must grant there is something in what you say, Union
and Integrity will do great Matters: But you <hi>Whigs</hi> cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to this, for you are not two of you in the same Mind; you
have no Government, no Discipline in your Party, no Firmness
to one another, or to any Point: Your great <hi>P. F</hi>—turns
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:97874:23"/>
Cadet, and carries Arms under the General of the <hi>West-Saxons;</hi>
the two <hi>H—s</hi> are Engineers under the late Lieutenant of
the Ordnance, and bomb any Bill, which he hath once
resolv'd to reduce to Ashes, though it were for Recognition,
or any thing else that is most necessary to our Security: Your
<hi>Iack S.</hi> and <hi>Iack G.</hi> whenever they touch Penny, will touch Pot
too, and drink all in the Bowl, be it never so deep. And besides
this, you are always laughing, despising, or railing at one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
some of you are too wise, some of you too witty, and some
of you too honest for the rest; jealous and envious of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Favour and Preferment; every Man thinking himself fittest
to be at the Head of Affairs, and hating, and reflecting upon
those who are so, and despising to be govern'd or directed by
them. And at the same time those who are at the Top, disdaining
to look down upon those below them, tho they were the Steps by
which they did ascend; they grow stately to their Friends, and
unmindful of their Fortunes, impatient of Addresses, hard of
Access, huddling into little Cabals, where they are wise and witty
among themselves: whilst we <hi>Tories</hi> on the contrary, have but
one Heart, one Voice, one Purse and one Interest; excuse and
justify one anothers Faults, prefer the meanest Fool or Knave of
our Party; and in return the Underlings are every Man in a
perfect Obedience to this Superior, to vote, rail, write or talk
according to Direction, and not otherwise.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Whig.</speaker>
               <p>I owe there is too much Truth in what you say, and
you speak Truth so seldom, that we ought to allow it you when
you do: But I hope we have seen the Error of our Disunion, and
shall amend it for the future: And however we may have had
Personal Differences, and likewise may have been too much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided,
and too obstinate in some Opinions, yet still in all Times,
and under all Discouragements, we have all agreed to the same
end, (<hi>viz.</hi>) The Publick Good of our Country, and the Support
of its Laws and Liberties; and in this present Reign have been
and are unanimous against King <hi>Iames</hi> and his Interest, and have
at all times with one Consent own'd his present Majesty, Right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
and Lawful, which I take to be the <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> to distinguish
those who are alone fit to serve this Government. And till
there be an Act of Recognition in Force, I will be bold to say
all the other Steps of our ablest and honestest Statesmen, will be
upon Boggy Ground: nor can any Man be reasonably employ'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:97874:24"/>
in any Office who hath not taken this Test; for whoever thinks
King <hi>William</hi> not Rightful, must think King <hi>Iames</hi> is so; and
the same Conscience which leads them to believe him Rightful,
will incline them to assist that Right when they have opportunity:
(but to return to the Point of your Charge) we must confess
likewise that we have not been so much under the Government
of our Superiours as you are, nor so industrious in supporting
each others private and particular Interests. But to the first I
might answer, That Fools and Beggars are more easily led by
the Nose than Men of Sense and Estates: And as to the latter, I
must put you in mind, that the Societies of <hi>Ignatius</hi> and of
<hi>Newgate,</hi> are both of them as much united as you, in universal
Mischief; for Roguery makes a stronger Glew and Cement, than
Vertue, because there are more Men capable of the former than
of the latter. And tho it were to be wish'd, that the <hi>Whigs</hi>
were more friendly, and had more Concern for the Support of
one another in all their honest Pretences; yet God forbid there
should ever be such a Friendship and Partiality amongst them,
as to condemn and disgrace those who gain Victories, because
they are not of their Party, and to support and defend those
who have lost the Ships, Trade and Honour of the Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are their Creatures. But on the other side, where it
is without offence to Justice, and the Publick Interest, all Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity
and Friendship is to be admir'd, prais'd, and pray'd for;
and I hope you will find it amongst us for the future, till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the Subject of your Envy, instead of being an Occasion of
Reproach. To put an end to this Argument; 'Tis plain with
all your Friendships, and Union, and other Politicks, you have
brought the Nation, and all its Allies, to the lowest Condition
both in Power and Reputation. You have almost put it out of the
Skill of any Conduct to recover us; and whoever now takes the
Administration of Affairs upon them, will be apply'd to the
Government, like Pigeons to the Feet of dying Men. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
to those who are true Lovers of their Country, no Time
seems too late to attempt its Relief, no Difficulty so great as to
discourage them from endeavouring it; and tho as the Case stands,
it is more than probable, we <hi>may</hi> miscarry under the best Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
yet it is undeniable we <hi>must</hi> miscarry under yours. And
so I take my Leave.</p>
