            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">G</seg>Entle Reader, ſeeing mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Subiectes (by authoritie) are aduaunced, I preſumed ſo much the rather to offer this (the loweſt of all) to thy grauer iudgment; not onely for the extraordinary power I finde in them (although ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rely it be great in deede) but for the mightie autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that hath ſupported and ſuſteyned them hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, euen ſince the beginning of the world, I meane of this vniuerſall <hi>Abce,</hi> which at firſt (peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) for the name ſake, thou wilt deſpiſe as friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, idle, and childiſh, it being nothing leſſe; for the authoritie thereof is very needfull to be kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: the waightieſt buſineſſe of the earth is built thereon, children vnderſtanding it not: and it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foordeth much matter for the wiſeſt. But as they are counted childiſh becauſe of their doctrine and
<pb facs="tcp:20634:4"/>
education, ſo I hartely deſire that euen children may, either by this, or ſome other greater paines, obtaine the right vnderſtanding of theſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, with the full vſe and authoritie of them.</p>
               <p>Firſt therefore, If I be demaunded whether through the world there were not many ſundry <hi>Abces</hi> inuented of diuers men? I anſwere, there was but one: and that one, of God himſelfe, the true <hi>Hagiography</hi> or <hi>Hieroglyps</hi> of our firſt Fathers: to wit, the two and twentie ſeuerall vncorrupted Formes or Letters of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue: Which being graunted the eldeſt, conſequently muſt be thought the Mother and very Matrix of all other; ſo that the authoritie of all <hi>Abces</hi> ryſeth from hence, as this from God. And as nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile without authoritie, which indeed is God; which our elders well foreſaw by comparing their owne indeuours therewith: ſo muſt we conclude, that nothing euer by man could be made ſo conſtant and ſo durable as to outlaſt the very Heauens for glory, and the Earth, that can not be mooued.</p>
               <p>Therefore when you ſeeme to beholde in this mirror at the firſt aſpect, diuers <hi>Abces,</hi> as if diuers men had faigned or created new formes &amp; figures at their pleaſure, thinke not ſo; for they be all one and the ſame generation, going foorth as the dayes of the yeere which the Sunne bringeth vnto all Countries of a diuers complexion: or as graund Nephewes to the thouſandth degree that haue their continuance of both their Parents (that is) of
<pb facs="tcp:20634:4"/>
their firſt author and peregrination, or confuſion.</p>
               <p>But that I may the better explane my purpoſe, I will handle their Creation, their Authoritie, their Dignitie, their Peregrination, and their vſe, in their proper places: and of their vniuerſall Kindred and poſteritie, in the laſt place generally.</p>

As, if all things were to be comprehended by this limitation or circumſcription <hi>Bara Elohim (Eth) haſhamaim,</hi> God created the figure, ſigne, or letter, of the Heauens, &amp;c. Or the very hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglypſis of them, this worde beeing the ſingular of <hi>Othoth,</hi> which ſignifieth Figures, Letters, Cauſes, Signes, or Tokens, of all ſortes. Where note, that God by his diuine inſight, hath diligently obſerued the ſhapes, the figures, and the lines of euery of his workes; becauſe he vſed to commende the perfection of them: ſo with his very finger hath he drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them, and with his ſpirit ſtamped them ſecretly in all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for vs.</p>
               <p>This worde <hi>Eth,</hi> maketh the Pronowne demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratiue <hi>Zoth. i. this,</hi> which is thus to be deriued and expounded, <hi>Zou</hi> or <hi>Ze, oth,</hi> which properly ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth, This Token, this Figure, this Letter, this Cauſe.</p>
               <p>Here could I more at large dilate vpon this word <hi>Eth,</hi> but this for my preſent purpoſe may ſuffice.</p>
               <p>Hitherto of the Creation of theſe little Figures, whereby men may coniecture, that in the time of <hi>Cain,</hi> they were playne to be read and vnderſtood: and that <hi>Tubal-Cain</hi> ingraued them in his coſtly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments.
<pb facs="tcp:20634:6"/>

I Thought good by the way, to ſhew this my Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Syllables, that it may be the more familiar when my time and experience ſhall better ſerue, to declare the full vſe and benefite thereof: In the meane while, the Reader ſhall ruminate thereon. And now for the vnderſtanding of this my charactericall Table following: Firſt, it is thus deuided into Rewes and Columnes; that is, euery perticular <hi>Abce</hi> lying col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laterally correſpondent each vnder other, is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded each by other, according to their proper ſoundes throughout euery Columne. Wherein, becauſe Languages for the moſt part (as I haue ſayd) differ one from other in number of Letters, or order of <hi>Abce</hi> Rew, I (not vniuſtly) do conſtraine all <hi>Abces</hi> to be conformable to the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> enlarging it by <hi>Dages</hi> and <hi>Compoſition,</hi> from the proper two and twentie <hi>Soundes</hi> or <hi>Letters,</hi> into ſo many as may well interpret the largeſt (that is thirtie) although ſome <hi>Alphabets</hi> by ruder collection, haue been vnneedfully extended to thirtie or fourtie. But where thou ſeeſt ſometimes both Rew &amp; Pilla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> vnorderly broken off, there note, that ſuch a Language lacketh that liſping found, which (thou ſhalt perceiue) other tongues abounded withall.</p>
               <p>As for the ſeuerall names of the Letters of euery <hi>Abce,</hi> let each Countrey tearme the whole Pillar, as ſhe calles her owne (being all Letters of the like force) becauſe I hold it litle materiall to be taught: Onely it may giue inſight of correction vnto ſome Countries, that haue borrowed the ſound, &amp; not the Letter. And to other that haue vſed the Letter and not the ſound, which (of all other) in our <hi>Engliſh Abce</hi> is moſt abſurd:
<pb facs="tcp:20634:12"/>
to the great hindrance and vexation of the little ones: that (as it were) enter Purgatorie before their time, being often puniſhed, but not for them ſelues. But for the fault of the Literature, &amp; for the rudnes of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which doth ſo ofen amaze and aſtoniſh them; as in the double ſound or efference of <hi>C.</hi> of <hi>G.</hi> of <hi>I.</hi> of <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>th.</hi> and of <hi>ch.</hi> Where the ſound of their Name ſhould properly begin euery word, they make to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure the Tongue to readines in ſpelling and reading; it being for the moſt part otherwiſe, and alſo in the moſt improper names of <hi>H.</hi> and <hi>Y.</hi> one being called <hi>Atch,</hi> and the other <hi>Wy,</hi> as if they ſhould beginne <hi>tcheer,</hi> or <hi>wee,</hi> according to their Names: but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt learne to ſpell <hi>ch, ee, r, heere: wy, ee, yee:</hi> in ſtead of <hi>he, eer,</hi> and <hi>ye, ee, yee,</hi> (to them moſt horrible) and for this they endure much, that Parents of meane affection, ſhould ſcarce approue. By which it comes otherwiſe to paſſe then in other Languages, that we cannot ſpell our <hi>Abce</hi> vntill we vnderſtande the whole Tongue. In ſome other <hi>Abces,</hi> the like im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections are found. But of our owne, in this will I haue to doe, aduiſing my Countrey-men, that ſeeing new Letters or Figures will not eaſily be receiued, (conſidering the trauayle of ſome other yer now, to that purpoſe) they will duly diſtinguiſh with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of wryting, as it hath been aunciently vſed, (neither is it at this time altogether vnuſed, but neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, with ſtrokes or prickes: aptly offering it ſelfe in this my Table) theſe Letters of two ſoundes, and name them accordingly by their right name, ſuch as
<pb facs="tcp:20634:13"/>
are wrong chriſtned: and giue effectuall names to ſuch as are nameleſſe. Which matter is ſo natiue, ſo eaſie, ſo pregnant, ſo commendable; and laſtly ſo voyde of all new-fangelneſſe, that nothing elſe is heere wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but that which may with prayſe be prayed the allowance of the beſt.</p>
               <p>Now for further inſtruction concerning my Table, euery <hi>Abce</hi> beareth his Countreys name, or the name that other Countreys call it, at the ende of the Rew to the left hand. And whether the ſeuerall Countreyes did write towards the left hand, or towards the right, in the margent at the right hand, you haue a Hand or Fiſt to direct you.</p>

               <head>AFFINITIE.</head>
               <p>OF their Affinitie and declination of forme, the explaning of the firſt Columne may ſuffice to teach the Reader how to marke the courſe of all the other Columnes, and the true variation of ſtrokes and lines, by diſmembring or new framing the Letters accordingly. Therefore I muſt ſpeake of the firſt <hi>Hebrew</hi> letter in the firſt Columne, how he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryeth himſelfe through all learned Tongues: that is, of Varietie, of Facion, and Behauiour. And alſo of his generall entertainment &amp; acquaintance with all other of the ſame Columne, whereas it conſiſteth of three diuers ſtrokes or limbes; to wit, the ſtroke <hi>Conſtant,</hi> which is the ſlope line, that for the moſt part continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth inuariable: The ſtroke <hi>Diuers,</hi> which is the hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:20634:13"/>
line that is euer now and then heere and there: And the ſtroke <hi>Defectiue,</hi> which is the maiſter or commaunding ſtroke, that in proper perſon is ſeldome preſent.</p>
               <p>Therefore in this Metamorphoſis, the Reader may not alwayes looke for this articular trinitie, becauſe in ſome <hi>Abces</hi> it will portend but two of the limbes, and in ſome but one; and that with a ſtrange motion: In ſome place halting, in other vtterly may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, of the firſt ſort, the Complet body are theſe by transformation; The ſixteenth, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenteenth, two and three and twenteth, and ſeuen and twenteth <hi>Abce;</hi> that is, the <hi>Illyric, Croatic, Aethiopick, Armenian, Aegyptian</hi> or <hi>Phrygian</hi> Rew. The firſt is diſcerned by exalting the line <hi>Conſtant</hi> and tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the leafe. The ſecond, by rayſing of the line <hi>Conſtant,</hi> and counterpoyſe of the ſtroke <hi>Diuers</hi> and Maiſter line. The third, by exalting the ſtroke <hi>Diuers</hi> to the head of the line <hi>Conſtant,</hi> the <hi>Conſtant</hi> and the Maiſter lines deſubtending it. In the Capitall of the fourth, by depresſing the former eleuation of the line <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtant,</hi> &amp; exalting the hornes of the <hi>Diuers</hi> &amp; maiſter Line, all three members of the curent Letter being in degree equall, and naturally floriſhing. All which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions (if you turne the Leafe byas, or vpſide downe at your pleaſure) you will the eaſier confirme.</p>
               <p>Of the ſecond ſort, are all the other of the firſt Pillar, except <hi>Arabique, Siriac, Perſian, Turkiſh,</hi> and <hi>Tartarian;</hi> which are included in <hi>Arabique</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:20634:14"/>
                  <hi>Siriac:</hi> onely the twenteth and the one and twenteth Rew, which are but one ſtroke, the <hi>Conſtant</hi> line erected: yet in the very head of this line, is ſome ſmall ſenſible trace of a ſecond ſtroke to be obſerued.</p>
               <p>But where you find the ſecond ſort full of variety of buylding, be not amazed at the Architecture thereof: for the frame and proportion is euer cleere, and that meerely nothing elſe but ſhadow-floriſhing or traine: as of the heele of a mans Foote in the Sand or Snow, in reſpect of the ſtep it ſelfe.</p>
               <p>The ſound of this Pillar or Letter is not vſurped by any other Columne, nor is commutable with any other Letter: therefore his deriuation is the more cleere.</p>
               <p>The like is to be marked of the ſecond Columne, and all the reſt: ſauing that betweene many of them (that is to ſay, Letters of the ſame Inſtrument, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the lippes, the teeth, pallat, or hisſing Letters) there is vſuall communitie, ſelfehood, and commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the ſecond and thirde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the three and foure and fiue and twenteth, the fourth and fifth with the ſeuenteenth two and ſeuen and twenteth: and ſometime with the nine and twenteth: the ſixth and ſeuenth with the fourteenth and the thirtie eighth with the thirteenth: the eleuenth with the ſixe and twenteth: the one and twenteth with the nine and twenteth: the ninth with the tenth: the eleuenth with the twelfth: the fifteenth with the ſixteenth and the fourth: and ſo with a continuall and mutuall reference of the Letters of each <hi>Abce</hi> by
<pb facs="tcp:20634:14"/>
it ſelfe, and compariſon with the ſame of other Rewes, thou ſhalt finde their proper and auncient Culture moſt cleare. For all the reſt, each Pillar will cleare it ſelfe to him that hath any inſight or delight therein, as Figures or Letters of a diuers condition: but one ſubſtaunce and the ſame effect.</p>
               <p>Heerein alſo note, that of the two-and-twentie <hi>Hebrew</hi> Letters, I haue prouided fiue Vowels, <hi>Alef, He, Vau, Jod, Hnaim;</hi> the eighth, the ninth, the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, one-and-twenteth, and ſixe-and-twenteth Pillar, to anſwere either directly or in trauers, as I haue ſhewed to the Vowels of all other Languages both in place and voyce; propounding this for my warrant: That all Letters, that are not Conſonants, be Vowels.</p>
               <p>That they are no Conſonants, the tranſlation or traduction of theſe words <hi>Adam, Abel, Ruth, Ezekiel, Eber:</hi> and alſo of a great part of the Latine tongue will effectually proue: as, <hi>Hnad, Hnuf, Hnur, Ad, auis, orior: VAV, ue, ſeu, ſiue: Hen, en: Elleh, illae: Iaijn, vinum,</hi> Greeke <hi>Oinon:</hi> of which, we need no farther example, becauſe they are alreadie notably knowne.</p>
               <p>And conſidering their proper Pillars, thou ſhalt finde them to agree both in facion and place, with their oppoſed Figures.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, I aduiſe that euery Letter hencefoorth keepe to his owne ſound, as by all other he ſhalbe heere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced according to his name, obſeruing euer this libertie, or rather proprietie of ſpelling, to begin and end all Syllables with a letter whoſe name and power
<pb facs="tcp:20634:15"/>
is all one, (reiecting idle letters) and produce the long Syllable by Accent for ſuch a difference: <hi>Mad, mád:</hi> for <hi>mad, made:</hi> as where <hi>Ce,</hi> is vſed for a <hi>Ka,</hi> there <hi>K:</hi> where <hi>Ph,</hi> is for <hi>F,</hi> there <hi>F:</hi> where <hi>Ch,</hi> is for <hi>Q,</hi> there <hi>Q:</hi> The reſt by obſeruation, is eaſely learned.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Vowels, and all other Vowels and Accentes (becauſe they be thinges ſo vnconſtant and ſo moueable, both for employment and affection) I meant not heere to handle any thing, but to content my ſelfe with <hi>Alef</hi> and <hi>Tau,</hi> and with that ſeale <hi>Eth,</hi> to ſigne and ſeale my worke; delyuering it to the vſe of <hi>Ezra</hi> the moſt excellent Scribe; or moſt exquiſite Workman <hi>Bezaleel:</hi> and conſequently to all other of the like faculties, Optik, or Mechanicall whatſoeuer.
