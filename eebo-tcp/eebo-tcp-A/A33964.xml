            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHAT was in a great meaſure proved before the <hi>Committee of Parliament</hi> in the year 1666, that <hi>London was burned by the treachery of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> and hath withal been ſuſpected a long time by our <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>diſcerning Patriots, that a Plot was by them laid to ſubvert the Government of the Nation, and introduce the Popiſh Religion,</hi> hath been ſo fully proved by a variety of Evidence before the greateſt <hi>Courts of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> ſince the firſt diſcovery of the late Helliſh Plot, and that with this advantage (to convince us of the <hi>Villany</hi> and danger of that party), <hi>That they had upon it grafted a deſign for the haſtening of the other to aſſaſſinate his moſt Sacred Majeſty, and ſeveral eminent Peers,</hi> and by a <hi>Popiſh army</hi> to <hi>maſſacre</hi> all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> as none can deny it with any degree of modeſty. And if any had any inclinations to it, the murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and <hi>Aſſaſſination</hi> of Mr. <hi>Arnold,</hi> the manifold <hi>lyes, perjuries, ſuborna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> which have been proved againſt them, the <hi>device</hi> of the <hi>Meal-tub</hi> Plot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to ſpoil the credit of the manifold proofs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, have been ſuch <hi>convictions</hi> as none hath been able to outface, unleſs ſuch as have dreamed of a liberty, yea and a merit too, for, and in doing any thing for the reputation of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as they nickname the <hi>Synagogue of Rome.</hi> It is as evident that the deſign of the <hi>Popiſh faction</hi> was to have caſt the <hi>Odium</hi> of theſe actions upon the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> The <hi>Odium</hi> of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfreys</hi> death ſhould have been caſt upon <hi>Debauches</hi> of that <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,</hi> had it not been unluckily diſcovered that he was murthered within the Walls of <hi>Sommerſet</hi> Houſe. But that of the <hi>Kings Death</hi> (could they have effected it) ſhould have been thrown on the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians,</hi> (a name under which of late they have comprehended all <hi>Diſſenters.)</hi> This ſhould have engaged our credulous and furious
<pb facs="tcp:45468:3"/>
men to have helped them to have deſtroyed the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> while they ſhould have got their <hi>Catholick Army</hi> in a capacity at laſt to have deſtroyed them alſo. This reſtleſs party having had this long in their deſign, no doubt wonderfully influenced ſome to procure ſuch a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of Religion upon his <hi>Majeſties Reſtauration</hi> as ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>Diſſenters</hi> enough; nor is it reaſonable to think that all the latter ſevere Acts againſt <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were not the fruits of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, conſidering how <hi>conducive</hi> they were to make a great number of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> willing for their own eaſe to have had an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Toleration,</hi> which (though nothing is or can be more contrary to <hi>Popiſh</hi> Principles) would admirably have ſerved their deſign, giving an undiſturbed liberty to their <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Jeſuits</hi> (who can never have an abode in any place without contriving the ruin of thoſe they call <hi>Hereticks)</hi> in our own bowels to have contrived our ruin. Or if this failed (as indeed it did) yet they knew that this way they ſhould employ all our <hi>Courts of Judicature</hi> againſt <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> ſo as they ſhould not look after them; and beſides, raiſe a mighty <hi>odium</hi> and <hi>prejudice</hi> in the hearts of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> one againſt another, ſo as whatever <hi>Villany</hi> they ſhould have effected, it would have been eaſie to have charged it upon <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> and there had been a party of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in name ready prepared to give credit to it. It is now evident to all who will not wilfully ſhut their eyes, how near they were to have accompliſhed their deſign. But God in infinite mercy hath prevented the accompliſhment. After all this one would rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably think that there ſhould not be one <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who ſhould not think it high time for our <hi>Superiors</hi> to unite all <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi> A thing the more eaſie and reaſonable, becauſe it is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent that it may be done without the leaſt offence to God, or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the generality of <hi>Reformed Churches;</hi> and by the abatement only of ſome things which being abated, we ſhall be much more like all <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> than we are.</p>
            <p>But againſt this ſome make a mighty <hi>outcry,</hi> (out of what deſign God knoweth) For it is a little myſterious, that thoſe men who all along have been great pleaders for a <hi>reconciliation</hi> betwixt us and the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and the true Diſciples of thoſe <hi>Biſhops,</hi> who to prevent the <hi>offence of that Church,</hi> took upon them in the time of King <hi>Charles the firſt</hi> to expunge paſſage out of the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> and to bring us as near as poſſible to them, <hi>erected Altars, brought in Tapers,</hi> and twenty things more; ſhould, now that they ſee the effect of thoſe endeavours for, and favours to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> not be
<pb facs="tcp:45468:3"/>
willing for the reconciling of all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to abate thoſe things which themſelves own no where ſpecially commanded by God; and this too at a time when the <hi>Popiſh</hi> bloody Knives are at all our Throats.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially conſidering that the true cauſe of retaining our <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> at the firſt, and forming our <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod it is, was originally a deſire ſo far to commend our Worſhip to the <hi>Papiſts</hi> (whoſe Religion lyes all in <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Set-forms)</hi> that they might be proſelyted to us; and the effects we have ſeen after an hundred years and upwards, is but the hardning of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and the <hi>alienating</hi> infinite numbers of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from us.</p>
            <p>I am aware that a late Author in his Book call'd, <hi>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of Separation,</hi> hath given us an account of three other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the firſt Impoſition of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> upon the Reformation. 1. <hi>A due reverence to Antiquity. 2. To manifeſt the juſtice and equity of the Reformation, by letting the Papiſts ſee we did not break communion with them for things meerly indifferent. 3. To ſhew our conſent with other Proteſtant Churches.</hi> But he had better have ſaid nothing. For will ſome ſay, How have we reverenced <hi>Antiquity</hi> in retaining three of their <hi>ceremonies,</hi> and leaving out twenty more of greater <hi>antiquity</hi> (if we may believe the Books we have) than the <hi>Surplice</hi> and <hi>kneeling at the Sacrament,</hi> two of the three we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained can pretend unto? Beſides that, all the account we have of <hi>antiquity</hi> is from Books Printed within 200 years (for Printing is very little older), from Manuſcripts, which if they bear date <hi>three hundred years</hi> after Chriſt, muſt be 1100 years old when they were Printed. If we ſtretch <hi>antiquity</hi> to 600 years after Chriſt, they muſt be 800 years old, and all that time generally kept in the hands of the known depravers of all Books that ever came in their hands where was any thing not for the purpoſes of their Church. Now what reverence is due to any ſuch worm-eaten Records of <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> let any men of ſenſe judg.</p>
            <p>His ſecond reaſon is as invalid; for what need was there of our keeping two or three <hi>Ceremonies</hi> to teſtifie we did not differ from them for meer <hi>matters of indifferency,</hi> when ſo many Books, ſo many Diſputations, teſtified we differed from them becauſe of their <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> in many things, and their Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification by Works, &amp;c.</hi> The laſt is yet of all the moſt weak; for how did we by it ſhew our conſent with other <hi>Proteſtant Churches?</hi> In the year 1552 which was the laſt of King <hi>Edward;</hi> in the year 1558, which was the
<pb facs="tcp:45468:4"/>
firſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there were no <hi>Proteſtant Churches</hi> but the <hi>Luther an Churches,</hi> the <hi>Suitzerland</hi> Churches, and that of <hi>Geneva,</hi> beſides ſome in <hi>Germany,</hi> which followed the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland</hi> and <hi>Geneva.</hi> In retaining theſe Ceremonies we ſhewed a <hi>diſſent</hi> to the <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> in <hi>Suitzerland,</hi> and at <hi>Geneva,</hi> and all thoſe who followed their order, and ſhewed our conſent only with the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches ſo imperfectly reformed, that in the <hi>Synod at Do<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rt</hi> the Meſſengers of all <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches there met, made a difficulty to afford them the name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> though I think the name <hi>Proteſtant</hi> better agreed to them than that of <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelici,</hi> which was the name the <hi>Reformed</hi> were known by for the ten firſt years after the Reformation began. Beſides, that for <hi>Kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Sacrament,</hi> the <hi>Saxon</hi> Churches retain it upon their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar notion, wherein they differ from all other <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches, viz. <hi>The Corporeal Preſence of Chriſt in and with that Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the retaining of ſome Ceremonies in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Churches, a double account is to be given. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Ambſdorfius</hi> were great Zealots for them, partly to quiet the people, who had ſo lately been <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and it may be partly in oppoſition to <hi>Zuinglius,</hi> and ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to <hi>Caroloſtadius,</hi> who had made himſelf the Author of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſome, during <hi>Luther</hi>'s abſence, when he was hid for fear of a <hi>Decree at Worms. Melancthon</hi> (a very learned man) being of a more ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t <hi>ductile ſpirit,</hi> with <hi>Juſtus Jonas,</hi> and ſome others, took <hi>Luther</hi>'s part. <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> was run down; both <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and <hi>Caroloſtadius</hi> ſaw that the retaining any of the Popiſh Ceremonies would have no deſired effect, but rather <hi>ſcandalize</hi> their friends, and harden the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> and the taking them away afterward, would be called a <hi>Refining</hi> upon a <hi>Refining;</hi> they therefore, though they bare with much ſome few years, yet took the firſt opportunity to throw them all out where they had to do. The caſe was much the ſame with us in <hi>England;</hi> our Ceremonies were retain'd upon no ſuch pretences as were before expreſſed. There was no <hi>Reverence</hi> in it ſhewed to <hi>antiquity.</hi> No <hi>conſent</hi> ſhewed with the <hi>moſt</hi> or <hi>beſt Reformed</hi> Churches at that time. But our beſt and moſt eminent Miniſters had been <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> uſed their <hi>Miſſal,</hi> practiced all their <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> At that time to have receded from the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in all things fit to have been receded from, might have been oddly lookt upon by the people. Beſides that the people in times of <hi>Popery</hi> were much ſtrangers to any thing of <hi>Religion</hi> but <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and hearing <hi>Maſs;</hi> hence (as may be ſeen in the firſt <hi>Edition</hi> of the <hi>Common Prayer)</hi> many things
<pb facs="tcp:45468:4"/>
were put in, which were left out by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the <hi>2d Edn.</hi> of it in K. <hi>Edw.</hi> time. And had it pleaſed God after Q. <hi>Maries</hi> time to have continued us ſuch <hi>Biſhops</hi> as <hi>Cranmer, Hooper, Latimer, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verdale,</hi> &amp;c. there is little doubt but theſe Controverſies had long ſince been at an end. But our <hi>Biſhops</hi> many of them were ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men as could abide here all Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time; others of them were ſuch as indeed had been beyond Sea, but very <hi>zealous</hi> there to keep up the Book, in the framing of which themſelves had an hand (amongſt theſe was Dr. <hi>Cox),</hi> the ſame reaſon held as in K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6. time, for humouring the people; thus the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies came at firſt to be eſtabliſhed. For the <hi>Forms of Prayer,</hi> there was not the ſame reaſon for eſtabliſhing ſome <hi>Forms at preſent</hi> in that ſtate of the Church; there could ſcarce have been any <hi>Praying</hi> or <hi>Preaching</hi> without ſome Forms both of Prayers and Sermons; there were twenty reading Miniſters for one who had any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent abilities either to <hi>Pray</hi> or <hi>Preach.</hi> But the reaſon was the very ſame for the eſtabliſhing ſo many of the <hi>Old Forms,</hi> and keeping <hi>Methods</hi> agreeing to none of any Reformed Church. I offer it to any knowing perſons to judg whether (whatever be ſaid by ſome) this was not the true reaſon of the firſt eſtabliſhment; and they were no invaluable reaſons for the continuance of them for ſome few years until people were brought off more from their old <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions.</hi> I find that in moſt places of <hi>Germany</hi> at firſt, the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was gradual, ſome <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Superſtitious uſages</hi> were caſt out one year, ſome the next, ſome ſeveral years after the Goſpel was firſt Preached in thoſe places.</p>
            <p>But why theſe ſhould be continued after twenty years, when it was ſeen that the continuance of them had no effect to bring in <hi>Papiſts,</hi> but gave a great ſcandal to, and made a great diviſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and when people were further enlightned, and their firſt heats for their old ways of worſhip were abated, is a much greater myſtery; yet we ſhall find that in the 25, 26, 27 years of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> there was a more ſevere urging theſe things than ever before. I am loth to think any rancor againſt thoſe at that time called <hi>Puritans,</hi> was the <hi>Original</hi> cauſe; but do believe that an <hi>imployment</hi> for thoſe who managed the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> without uſing their power againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> or <hi>Moral Debauchees,</hi> might be no little argument in the cauſe, and a deſign driven by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Atheiſts</hi> in the Nation to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Such Conſiderations as theſe could never affect an <hi>Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:45468:5"/>
ſo as to make a firſt eſtabliſhment of them. But the ſucceeding <hi>Parliaments</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> found them in <hi>poſſeſſion</hi> (that we ſay is <hi>nine parts of a Law)</hi> and ſome <hi>Zealots</hi> in the Church ſtrained their wits to make them appear <hi>lawful,</hi> and ſo within the power of the <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour,</hi> and for many of them ſeveral good: men had not then <hi>light</hi> enough to diſcern their <hi>unlawfulneſs.</hi>

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> as there were very few that wrote to purpoſe on that argument (Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> was almoſt the only man in his age.) Indeed the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> the <hi>reading the Old Tranſlation of the Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Apocryphal Books,</hi> the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription,</hi> That <hi>there was nothing in the Common Prayer Book, and Book of Ordaining Prieſts and Deacons, but what was agreeable to Gods Word,</hi> were an hundred year ſince argued againſt as <hi>unlawful,</hi> as I could prove by ſeveral writings of the <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> of thoſe times (I have ſeen an ancient Manuſcript of them big enough for a juſt folio), ſome things were not then practiſed, non required to be put in ure, though they were in the Queens <hi>Injunctions,</hi> &amp;c. (ſome of them at leaſt.) In all the caſes of <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> in Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> time, I find not a Miniſter complaining for being inforced to <hi>receive,</hi> or to <hi>adminiſter the Sacrament</hi> to people <hi>kneeling;</hi> I find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any ſuffering <hi>for not bowing at the name of Jeſus,</hi> not ralling in the <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> not ſetting it <hi>Altarwiſe,</hi> not reading the <hi>ſecond ſervice at it,</hi> with many more ſuch things which were brought into practice by Archbiſhop <hi>Laud,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Wren,</hi> and others. One great pretence of keeping up many of theſe things, was to avoid the <hi>ſcandal of the Papiſts,</hi> and to <hi>intice them to our Religion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We have now ſeen the effects of this in the experience of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, which have been too ſad to particularize; it were eaſie to make a Book of <hi>Acts and Monuments</hi> twice as big as Mr. <hi>Foxes,</hi> with the ſufferings of holy and good men, upon theſe accounts in that time. What manner of perſons the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are, the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of twenty years ſince his <hi>Majeſties Restauration,</hi> hath ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informed the world. What have the moſt fiery of their adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to object againſt them except in the matters of their God? What kind of friend the <hi>Popiſh party</hi> hath been, hath been alſo made ſufficiently evident.

might poſſibly have appeared more reaſonable if I would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted the lamentable ſtories of the ſufferings of good men on this account, (of which I have a plenty) but I had rather they ſhould be forgotten, moſt of the Authors of them before this time have given up their account, and know whether they did good or evil; and if any be alive, I hope all good men will ſay, <hi>Father forgive them, for they knew not what they did.</hi> Only let it be the <hi>Religious care</hi> of our <hi>Superiors</hi> to prevent any further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of this nature in our Streets, for the Lord moſt certainly heareth the <hi>crys of the Innocent and oppreſſed.</hi>

            <head>The <hi>Hiſtory of Conformity:</hi> or a Proof of the <hi>Miſchief of Impoſitions,</hi> from the experience of an Hundred years.</head>
            <p>THE notion of <hi>Conformity</hi> with us in <hi>England,</hi> hath always ſignified a <hi>compliance</hi> with, and <hi>obedience</hi> to ſuch commands of <hi>Superiors</hi> in matters of <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> as are no where expreſly <hi>originated</hi> in the Word of God, but ſuppoſed to be there left to liberty; and being neither there <hi>commanded,</hi> nor <hi>forbidden,</hi> are preſumed to be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Superiors</hi> juſt commands.</p>
            <p>The power of <hi>Superiors</hi> to command in things which the parties commanded do agree <hi>indifferent,</hi> was never yet diſputed by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of <hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> But there being many things which Superiors call <hi>indifferent,</hi> which the Inferiors verily believe to be <hi>unlawful,</hi> the difference hath chiefly been about theſe, and ſtill is ſo to this day.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>Reformation</hi> of this <hi>Nation</hi> from <hi>Popery</hi> in the days of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the <hi>6th,</hi> in the year 1552, (which was 6 <hi>Edw. 6th)</hi> there were <hi>Articles of Faith</hi> agreed on; and in the 2. <hi>&amp; 3 Edw. 6. cap. 1. &amp; 5. &amp; 6 Edw. 6. cap. 1. two</hi> Acts were made <hi>referring</hi> to two <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Books</hi> made in the ſhort Reign of that excellent Prince.</p>
            <p>It muſt be known, that before this time in the time of K. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. there were great <hi>foundations for Reformation</hi> laid, in the <hi>ſuppreſſion of Monaſteries,</hi> taking away the Popes <hi>Supremacy</hi> deſtruction of <hi>Appeals to Rome, Printing the Bible in Engliſh;</hi> but there was no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> or <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> For the <hi>Doctrine,</hi> it appeareth to have been <hi>Popiſh</hi> by the <hi>ſix Articles;</hi> the firſt of which yet was ſo penned, as though it eſtabliſhed a <hi>corporal preſence</hi> of <hi>Chriſt in the Supper,</hi> yet it ſeemed to leave it <hi>indefinite,</hi> whether in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Lutheran</hi> ſenſe, which poſſibly gave Archbiſhop
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:45468:6"/>
               <hi>Cranmer</hi> (who as well as <hi>Latimer</hi> and other good men at that time were <hi>Lutherans)</hi> a latitude to be an agent in <hi>Lamberts</hi> condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The other five articles againſt <hi>giving the Cup</hi> to the <hi>Laity,</hi> and for <hi>Private Maſſes,</hi> and <hi>Monkiſh Vows, Auricular Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>Prieſts Marriages,</hi> were <hi>perfectly Popiſh.</hi> So as in that time no <hi>Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformist</hi> appear'd, but as to Doctrine, of which <hi>Lambert</hi> the Martyr was one, and ſo were all thoſe that ſuffered upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>ſix Articles,</hi> together with multitudes who fled into other Countries to avoid that Perſecution.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Worſhip</hi> of thoſe days was the <hi>Maſs,</hi> only ſome parts of it were in <hi>Engliſh.</hi> The <hi>Government of the Church</hi> was alſo in the ſame <hi>method;</hi> for though three Acts had been made to authorize K. <hi>H.</hi> 8. to call together 32 perſons to make a Book of new <hi>Canons;</hi> yet for ought appeareth to us, it was not done. And poſſibly a due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that ſeveral of our greateſt <hi>Reformers</hi> were <hi>Lutherans</hi> at firſt, may ſatisfie us as to the firſt eſtabliſhment of our <hi>Liturgy</hi> in the method it was, and retaining of ſome Ceremonies; the <hi>Saxon</hi> Churches having before reformed in that method, keeping as much as they could both of the <hi>Old Prayers</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> And it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry likely that when after Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time the <hi>Reformation</hi> came to be re-ſetled, ſome of thoſe who had a great hand in it, were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the <hi>Lutheran Principles,</hi> as to the <hi>Corporal Preſence, Forms</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> or at leaſt had a very great Reverence for <hi>Cranmer, Latimer</hi> and others (who were then dead as <hi>Martyrs),</hi> and choſe to fix things according to their ſentiments in theſe matters, without ſo due weighing things as the matter required, or having not ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a proſpect of the evils which experience hath ſince let us ſee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thereupon.</p>
            <p>In the firſt <hi>Parliament</hi> of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. the firſt <hi>Statute</hi> tells us, that before that time (in the times of Popery) they had ſeveral Forms, one uſed at <hi>Sarum,</hi> another at <hi>Bangor,</hi> &amp;c. and the whole Miniſtry of the Nation were juſt come out of <hi>Popery,</hi> and neither fit to <hi>Pray</hi> nor <hi>Preach,</hi> which was the reaſon both of that eſtabliſhment, and alſo of the <hi>Book of Homilies,</hi> and of the <hi>Original</hi> cauſe of that <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> on the Miniſtry, <hi>not to preach without licenſe.</hi> For the truth is, hardly one of an hundred of the <hi>Priests</hi> newly proſelyted from <hi>Popery,</hi> were fit to Preach at all, which made our <hi>Rulers</hi> reſtrain <hi>Preaching</hi> only to ſuch as ſhould be licenſed. Beſides, that there was juſt reaſon to fear that thoſe <hi>Priests</hi> but for ſuch a <hi>Law,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>Book,</hi> would have returned to their former <hi>Maſs-ſervice.</hi> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45468:7"/>
which, the <hi>Book</hi> was provided, 2, 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and corrected 3, 4 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. And all Miniſters injoin'd by Statute to <hi>read thoſe Prayers,</hi> and all the people to <hi>bear them.</hi> There was before that time no <hi>Noncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formist</hi> to direct the Act againſt, only <hi>Papiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But upon the ſecond <hi>Edition</hi> of the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable party, who oppoſed themſelves to it. Three years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Biſhop <hi>Hooper</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> had declared themſelves againſt ſome <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> But the laſt year of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. was the firſt time we read of any oppoſition to the <hi>Common Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt</hi> was quickly at an end by the coming in of Q. <hi>Mary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The buſineſs of <hi>Church-Government</hi> as to the rules of it, was left by King <hi>Edward</hi> undetermined; for he died before he had given his <hi>Royal ſanction</hi> to that <hi>Syſteme</hi> of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws</hi> which was drawn up by Archbiſhop <hi>Cranmer</hi> and others, by vertue of his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> directed to them in the fifth year of his Reign.</p>
            <p>In all his time no <hi>Subſcription</hi> was required by <hi>Statute</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> (that I can find) eſtabliſhed by his authority under the broad Seal, either to the <hi>Articles of Faith,</hi> or to the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer, &amp;c.</hi> nor do I read of one Miniſter <hi>ſilenced,</hi> or <hi>ſuſpended</hi> upon any ſuch account, or any people vexed for <hi>Nonconformity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our prudent <hi>Reformers</hi> knowing they had to do with a people who were <hi>Papiſts</hi> the other day, in their firſt <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> varied as little as they could from the <hi>Popiſh Miſſal,</hi> and kept as many of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as they conceived were conſiſtent with any degree of <hi>Reformation.</hi> In the ſecond <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> they va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>more;</hi> but yet we are aſſured by Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> in his <hi>Church Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory,</hi> Lib. 7. that <hi>the party now diſaffected to the Liturgy became very conſiderable.</hi> This was in the very beginning of the <hi>Reformation, Anno</hi> 1553.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Mary</hi> ſucceeding, put an end to all theſe conteſts in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> for the whole time of her Reign, which was but five years. To avoid her Perſecution, multitudes fled beyond the Seas, fixing ſome at <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſome at <hi>Geneva,</hi> ſome at <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> ſome at <hi>Embden,</hi> ſome at <hi>Francfort,</hi> and other places.</p>
            <p>We have no account, that I know, how thoſe governed themſelves as to Religious matters, who fixed at any of thoſe places, ſave only at <hi>Francfort</hi> and <hi>Geneva;</hi> thoſe at <hi>Geneva</hi> followed the <hi>Order of that Church,</hi> ſo did thoſe at <hi>Francfort,</hi> uſing the order at <hi>Geneva</hi> from <hi>June</hi> 27, 1554, to <hi>Mar.</hi> 13. 1555, when Dr. <hi>Cox</hi> (one of thoſe who had compiled our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Common Prayer Book, and was
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45468:7"/>
mightily in love with his own labours) came over with a new party from <hi>England,</hi> and by his arts got admiſſion into the Church at <hi>Francfort,</hi> and brought in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Book amongſt them; nor did this ſatisfie him, but he muſt alſo turn out their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor Mr. <hi>Knox,</hi> and that not from his <hi>charge</hi> only, <note place="margin">See the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles at Franc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, p. 44, 45.</note> but out of <hi>Francfort,</hi> procuring him (by ſome of his party) to be accuſed to the <hi>Senate</hi> for a <hi>Sermon</hi> he had two years before Preached in <hi>Bucking hamſhire</hi> here in <hi>England,</hi> in which he had ſome paſſages reflecting upon the <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> as an <hi>Idolater,</hi> &amp;c. which made ſome of the <hi>Senate</hi> adviſe him to leave the City, becauſe the <hi>Imperial</hi> Court was then at <hi>Ausburgh;</hi> and if this malicious party had carried an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation againſt him thither, and the <hi>Emperour</hi> ſhould require the City to deliver him as a <hi>Traytor</hi> to him, they could not refuſe him. Which made Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> and a conſiderable party of that Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to <hi>Geneva. This was the firſt fruits of the conformable mens kindneſs to poor Diſſenters, though at that time they were both parties voluntary Exiles in a ſtrange Land for the common Cauſe of Religion.</hi> So that Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi> who was afterward <hi>Biſhop of Ely;</hi> and <hi>Horne,</hi> who was afterwards made Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter;</hi> were left in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that Church, and there performed their Devotions by the <hi>Engliſh Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> which at that time had had but the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of one year before it was thrown out for the <hi>Maſs</hi> in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came to the Crown Three years after this, in the year 1558. Upon which, the <hi>baniſhed</hi> from all parts returned, both thoſe who had fled from King <hi>Hen</hi> 8. perſecution, for the <hi>Six Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles,</hi> who if any of them returned before, were driven back again; and thoſe who fled from <hi>Queen Maries</hi> perſecution, from 1553. to 1558. Theſe (if we may believe Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> and Dr. <hi>Fuller)</hi> having beyond Sea ſucked in the <hi>Proteſtant principles</hi> for <hi>Worſhip</hi> as well as <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> were the Fathers of <hi>Nonconformity</hi> in <hi>England.</hi> But theſe were either many more than I could ever find <hi>regiſtred,</hi> or elſe under both <hi>perſecutions</hi> multitudes muſt lye hid in <hi>England.</hi> And indeed ſome make the cauſe of the <hi>different apprehenſions</hi> in <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> at that time to lye here; That thoſe moſt favourable to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,</hi> and <hi>promoters</hi> of it, were ſuch as had never been abroad, but during both thoſe <hi>perſecutions,</hi> weathered the ſtorm in <hi>England;</hi> and the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> ſuch as had been abroad, and ſeen the <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, Order</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Churches in <hi>Suitzerland,</hi> and <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:45468:8"/>
and at <hi>Geneva.</hi> But this is not Univerſally true; for both Dr. <hi>Cox.</hi> and Mr. <hi>Horne</hi> were at <hi>Francfurt,</hi> yet high en ough for our <hi>Conformity,</hi> both during their abode there, and after their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the firſt year of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> paſſed, which revived the <hi>Reformation,</hi> Uniting the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction</hi> to the Crown, Repealing Queen <hi>Maries Act of Repeal,</hi> and reviving ſeveral <hi>Statutes</hi> for the <hi>Reformation</hi> made in the time of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. and <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. eſtabliſhing <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity</hi> of <hi>Prayers.</hi> And it is to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that theſe <hi>Acts</hi> paſſed without the <hi>aſſent</hi> of one <hi>Biſhop:</hi> there were at this time but Fourteen preſent, and they were all <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and notorious <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from all <hi>Acts</hi> of this nature. This by the way may let my <hi>Reader</hi> underſtand the <hi>Popiſh deſign</hi> of a <hi>party</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, for whom it is not enough that the <hi>Clergy</hi> be owned as one of the <hi>Three Eſtates of the Realm</hi> (of which the King is the Head) but they will alſo have them to be one of the <hi>Three States in Parliament;</hi> which if they be, no Law can be of force that wants the conſent of ſome of them. So that if that notion were yeilded, <hi>all our Acts for Reformation</hi> muſt be concluded <hi>Nullities.</hi>

            <p>The other Biſhopricks were either detained in the <hi>Queens</hi> hands, or held in <hi>Commendam.</hi> Theſe men were all of them <hi>Conformiſts,</hi> but ſome of them knew the heart of <hi>Sufferers for their conſciences towards God,</hi> for themſelves had been ſuch; indeed they generally had been ſo, though in different degrees. This temper of theſe <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops</hi> gave that party much quiet for ſeveral years, who could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to the <hi>Liturgy and Ceremonies.</hi> I find a very large Petition preſented by multitudes to the <hi>Queen, Anno.</hi> 1561. which was the Third year of her Reign, in Three or Four Sheets <hi>M. S.</hi> where they complain of <hi>inſufficient</hi> and <hi>ſcandalous Miniſters,</hi> of <hi>Pluraliſts,</hi> and <hi>Non-reſidents,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers</hi> being Miniſters, but I find not the leaſt complaint of any <hi>ſuſpended, deprived,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Yet even at the firſt I find Mr. <hi>Coverdale</hi> refuſing to be reſtored to his <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and <hi>Reverend Gilpen</hi> refuſing the <hi>Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of Carliſle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But no <hi>Subſcription</hi> was yet required to any thing, by any Legal Authority; nor was the uſe of all the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book,</hi> or an <hi>exact obſervance of the Ceremonies,</hi> generally urged. This kept all in quiet ſome years: the people enjoyed the labours of their godly Miniſters: the Miniſters at that time ſcrupled not to uſe ſome parts of the <hi>Common-Prayer:</hi> the <hi>Biſhops</hi> did not exact their uſe of the more offenſive parts of it, nor of the <hi>Ceremonies:</hi> ſome particular <hi>Officials</hi> were a little buſie; and ſome few, very few men were ſufferers by them: but the body of the Nonconforming Miniſters and people were much quiet, until not only Arch-Biſhop <hi>Parker</hi> was dead, but Biſhop <hi>Grindall</hi> alſo, who ſucceeded him in that, who died about 1583. about the <hi>25th</hi> of the <hi>Queen.</hi>

In the year 1583. Dr. <hi>John Whitgift</hi> came to be <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt I read of, as to Subſcriptions and Nonconformity, was when the <hi>Subſcription</hi> to the 39. Articles, which were made by the Convocation 1562. but not confirmed by <hi>Parliament</hi> until the year 1572. (which was the <hi>13th Eliz.)</hi> and then only required to be ſubſcribed by ſuch as were to be admitted to Livings: and; that no further than ſo far <hi>as concerned matters of Faith and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Sacraments,</hi> was exacted from all Miniſters.</p>
            <p>After the agreement in them by the <hi>Convocation,</hi> 1562. ſeveral <hi>Biſhops</hi> without any Authority from <hi>Parliament,</hi> impoſed a <hi>Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the whole number of them upon all Miniſters in their Dioceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the refuſal of which cauſed the ſufferings of ſeveaal particular men. <hi>John Fox</hi> being required to Subſcribe, pulled out his <hi>Greek Teſtament,</hi> and plainly told the <hi>Archbiſhop, he would Subſcribe to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that;</hi> but yet ſuch was the gravity of the man, ſuch his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency</hi> for his <hi>ſervice to the Church,</hi> that he was let alone.</p>
            <p>The famous <hi>Laurence Humfry,</hi> and <hi>Anthony Gilby,</hi> and ſome others appeared <hi>Nanconformiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Betwixt 1563. and 1583. alſo (eſpecially in the latter part of that time) the Biſhops began to preſs a <hi>Subſcription</hi> to Two <hi>Articles more,</hi> the one <hi>to acknowledg</hi> the <hi>Queens Supremacy:</hi> that none denied, or as good as none: the other was, <hi>that the Common-Prayer-Book, the Books of Homilies,</hi> and <hi>the Book of ordering Biſhops, Prieſts and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, contained in them nothing contrary to the Word of God.</hi> To this day there is no <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Canons</hi> confirmed by <hi>Parliament</hi> that requireth any ſuch thing: but I cannot find that there was any <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> about theſe things, that had King <hi>Edward</hi>'s, or Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beths</hi> aſſent notified under the <hi>Broad Seal,</hi> ſo as it could pretend to any Legal eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Biſhops</hi> of that Age were adventuring to eſtabliſh theſe things upon their own Authority, directly contrary to the Statute 25. <hi>Henry</hi> 8. which reſtrained them from putting any <hi>Canons in uſe, to be made after that time, unleſs they firſt had the Kings Aſſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Oath of Supremacy</hi> was indeed eſtabliſhed by Act <hi>1ſt. Eliz.</hi> but a <hi>Subſcription</hi> was not. The uſe of the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> was commanded by an Act <hi>1ſt Eliz.</hi> but a <hi>Subſcription, that that there was nothing in it, nor in the Homilies, nor in the Book of Ordering Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Prieſts and Deacons,</hi> contrary to the Word of God, under a penalty of <hi>ſuſpenſion</hi> or <hi>Deprivation,</hi> was not. And the queſtion ſo
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:45468:9"/>
often put to them by the <hi>Biſhops, Will you uſe that which you will not ſubſcribe to, that it contains nothing repugnant to Gods word?</hi> is eaſily anſwered: There was a great part of the Book <hi>(viz.</hi> the <hi>Rubricks)</hi> that were not to be uſed in God's Worſhip. Nor did they uſe it all, but ſome part of it, which was not offenſive to them and other good people.</p>
            <p>But altho' many ſuffered upon this <hi>new impoſition</hi> after <hi>Whitgift</hi> came to be a conſiderable figure in the Church; yet the great ſhock was after that he came (upon the death of <hi>Grindal)</hi> to be <hi>Arch-biſhop of Canterbury,</hi> which was about the year 1583. and the firſt conſiderable <hi>Nonconformity</hi> of <hi>Miniſters in England</hi> is to be dated from this time.</p>
            <p>Some ſeparation there was before this time: For <hi>Biſhop Bancroft</hi> in his <hi>Dangerous Poſitions</hi> tells us, <hi>That within the ten or eleven firſt years of the Queens reign, many of the people ſeparated, meeting in woods and fields.</hi> But their numbers were not valuable, nor their perſons much conſiderable; they were generally as ſheep without a Shepherd, few or no Miniſters being amongſt them, at leaſt of any note or authority, to give them any great name or repute.</p>
            <p>The Author of the Book entituled, <hi>The unlawful practices of the Prelates,</hi> which was wrote about that time, tells us, That as to <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Diſſenters, the Queen had a moſt peaceable Government for the firſt twenty four years of her reign. Towards ſome particular good men, ſome hard dealings were ſhewed here and there, by the inſtigation of ſome ignorant and half Popiſh perſons, for lack of judgment and knowledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That which poſſibly gave occaſion to this activity of the Biſhops, were two ſorts of Diſſenters which they obſerved amongſt the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
            <p>Some who only diſſented as to the <hi>Common-prayer-book</hi> and <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,</hi> of which number were Mr. <hi>Field,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wilcox,</hi> Mr. <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Mr. <hi>Boxham,</hi> Mr. <hi>Saintcloe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Clare,</hi> Mr. <hi>Edmonds.</hi> Others that were alſo for the <hi>Reformation of Diſcipline,</hi> amongſt whom were Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> Mr. <hi>Travers,</hi> Mr. <hi>Barber,</hi> Mr. <hi>Gardner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtou,</hi> Mr. <hi>Crook,</hi> Mr. <hi>Egerton,</hi> who were all betrayed by one Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> who was wont to meet with them, and many of them moſt miſerably treated in the High Commiſſion upon it.</p>
            <p>A great noiſe was made of the election of a <hi>Presbytery</hi> at <hi>Wandſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> the meaning of which was no more than this. The <hi>Queens</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Orders extending no further to the trial and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:45468:10"/>
fitneſs of Communicants, than if they could ſay the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Commandments</hi> (all which might be done by one ſo ignorant, that no Miniſter who regarded what he did, could adminiſter the Lords Supper unto) ſome Miniſters did agree of a ſtricter examination, and the people made choice of ten or eleven perſons to be preſent at that action. Poſſibly it had been leſs expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſcandal, if inſtead of them, two or three Miniſters had ſo join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the end as well obtained; but ſurely this was a far leſſer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, than the admitting of all to the Sacrament that could but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe the <hi>Creed, Lords Prayer,</hi> and <hi>Ten Commandments;</hi> there was nothing in this action, but any pious Miniſters who <hi>are the ſtewards of the myſteries of God,</hi> might anſwer with a ſafe conſcience; for of <hi>Stewards it is required that they ſhould be faithful,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and I believe any Biſhop would have judged his Steward unfaithful, if he had dealt out his Maſter's goods contrary to his Maſter's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The Miniſters Maſter's order is plain enough, that the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament belongs not either to <hi>ignorant</hi> or ſcandalous perſons. All the Churches of God in all Ages agree this, our own Church in her principles agreeth it; yet in practice, all Miniſters were tyed to give the Sacrament (as in times of <hi>Popery)</hi> to all ſuch as could but rehearſe the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Pater Noſter,</hi> and the Ten <hi>Commandments;</hi> and confeſſed in <hi>Lent;</hi> thoſe eminent perſons who were commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. to draw up a new body of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Laws</hi> (though that excellent <hi>Prince</hi> lived not long enough to ſet his Hand and Seal to it, ſo as what they had done had no legal force) had expreſly determined, <hi>Tit. de Sacramentis, Cap.</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We will have none admitted to the Table of the Lord, until in the Church he hath made profeſſion of his faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhould good Miniſters do in this caſe? they could act but <hi>precariouſly;</hi> it ſeems at <hi>Wandſworth</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> there was a people that voluntarily ſubmitted to this; what harm was this to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops?</p>
            <p>But the truth is, this buſineſs of <hi>diſcipline</hi> came into very little debate before 1584. after that Subſcription had been ſo fatally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>In ſeveral <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> I perceive there were ſome circumſtantial va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riations in the forms of <hi>Subſcriptions.</hi> To let my <hi>Reader</hi> therefore know what it was, I will give it him as it lieth in the <hi>36th Canon,</hi> 1603. when it firſt received any thing like a <hi>legal confirmation,</hi> which was at leaſt 25. or 26. years after it was firſt deviſed, and full 30. years after it was ſo rigorouſly preſſed.</p>

            </q>
            <p>This Engine was firſt formed by the <hi>Archbiſhop Whitgift,</hi> and was one of thoſe 16. <hi>Propoſals</hi> he offered to the <hi>Queen,</hi> for the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Church (a Copy of which in <hi>M. S.</hi> with two Anſwers to them, I have read,) ſome little difference there was in the <hi>Arch-biſhops</hi> form: His firſt Article was,</p>
            <p>1. Art. <hi>That the Authority which is given her Majeſty, in Cauſes Eccleſiaſtical, by the Laws of the Land, is lawful, and according to the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Second Article was his Third, andran thus:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Art. <hi>That he allowed the Book of Articles of Religion, agreed on by the Archbiſhops and Biſhops of both Provinces, and the whole Clergy in the Convocation holden at</hi> London 1562. <hi>and ſet forth by her Majeſties Authority, and that he agreeth the Articles therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, to be agreeable to the Word of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Art. (Which was the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> Second) was word for word the ſame.</p>
            <p>This Motion of the <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> put the <hi>Queen</hi> upon adding force to the <hi>Impoſition,</hi> which indeed had been by ſome <hi>Biſhops</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan before, but now in moſt Dioceſſes it was rigorouſly preſſed. The iſſue of this is told us by the <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>unlawful practices of Prelates in theſe words:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:45468:11"/>
               <hi>Whatſoever was required in Civil Cauſes, either that concerned her Majeſty; or the State, was by the Miniſters embraced wholly and freely In Eccleſiaſtical Cauſes alſo, whatſoever concerned Doctrine, or otherwiſe, was expreſly required by Statute for Subſcription. Thus far at the firſt all men with proteſtation offered, but to yeild to this thing, ſo ſtrange and new,</hi> without any Law <hi>in ſtreighter ſort than ever was required.</hi> That all things were agreeable to Gods Word, and not againſt it; not only tollerable but allowable, both in the Book of Common Prayer, and in the Book of ordering Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons. <hi>This was refuſed, divers of the Miniſters were</hi> ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, <hi>multitudes were thruſt out</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many <hi>godly,</hi> able, painful Miniſters were outed all over <hi>England,</hi> I cannot tell, but <hi>ex ungue Leonem,</hi> I have ſeen a <hi>M.

Miniſters that never <hi>Preach'd,</hi> only <hi>read Prayers and Homilies,</hi> and 85. more, <hi>Pluraliſts, Non reſidents,</hi> or perſons moſt <hi>notoriouſly debaucht.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the firſt fruit of that <hi>Archbiſhops</hi> preferment, and a fair offer at the rooting out of the <hi>reformed Religion</hi> as ſoon as planted, which never did, nor ever will live and flouriſh in any place, under the conduct of an <hi>ignorant, debauched, unpreaching Miniſtry;</hi> ſuch a Miniſtry, much better ſerving <hi>Popiſh</hi> than <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> purpoſes.</p>
            <p>What the Miniſters that were ſuſpended, or deprived did, to prevent their miſery; or to get this ſeverity a little mitigated and allayed at this time, in the years 1583, 1584, 1585. I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the world from the worthy Author of the Book aforementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, wrote at that very time, and often quoted by Biſhop <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croft.</hi>

            <p>His words are theſe:</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Cauſe was general, means were made, Miniſters preſented<hi> Doubts, Proteſtations, Supplications; </hi>they were repulſed, reviled, threatned; the Miniſters did indure, ſuſtained with a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but their miſerable flocks were ſubject to all diſorders, ſpoils, havock: Good men mourned, evil men prevailed, Licenſe poſſeſſed all places, nothing was reſerved whole to civil and modeſt life. Theſe things Gentlemen of all ſorts took to heart, they lamented their own
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45468:11"/>
eſtate, and the estate of the people, they pitied their Ministers, their Wives and Children; Gods Cauſe moved them, the honour of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel drew them, yea the ſafety of her Majeſty in theſe dangerous times compelled them, their own Offices of Juſtice, which by the word was ſo well aided, and which without it they could not ſteer in a ſtorm of ſo great confuſion, drew them to ſue in all humble ſort to the<hi> Archbiſhop, </hi>teſtifying the wholeſome Doctrine, together with the honeſt life of their Paſtors, declaring the breaches, waſte and wrecks of their Country, the preſent evil, the dangers to come; finally craving, that in regard of the ſouls of the people, and their own, he would accept ſuch a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription as the Law expreſly appointed<hi> [13. Eliz. c. 12.] </hi>and reſtore the poor men both to their Preaching and Livings. This ſecond means prevail'd with him [Archbiſhbp<hi> Whitgift] </hi>no more than the firſt. The third was attempted.</p>
               <p>This refuge was to the Honourable Senate of her Majeſties Privy-Council.

Six or Eight months were thus ſpent, the Country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void of Preaching, the calamities of ſome Shires increaſed, testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, informations, multiplied.

againſt us for not ſubſcribing to ſome things we know not, and others that we greatly doubt of: We having received good hope upon our own knowledg of your Lordſhips wonted hatred of ſin, and love of true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and godlineſs, are bold to offer our humble ſupplication unto you, as well to ſhew our obedience to all ſuperiority over us in the Lord, as alſo to crave your Lordſhips lawful favour for larger ſpace of time to be granted to us, conſidering how carefully we have uſed our Miniſtry to the building of the Church, endeavouring with all our hearts to keep the good peace thereof, which we daily pray for: Wherefore if it ſhall pleaſe your Lordſhip to deal ſo graciouſly with us, as either to free us from all ſubſcriptions, ſaving to her Majeſties authority, and the Articles of the Chriſtian Religion, which the Law requireth; or to give us ſo long time, as divers Treatiſes may be peruſed by us, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we may be ſatisfied in our perſuaſions to ſubſcribe, or (if there be no remedy) quietly to give place to the peace of the Church. In the mean time we judg them not that have ſubſcribed, as we deſire not to be judged in this our ſtaying. Thus if it ſhall pleaſe Almighty God to move your Lordſhip to take compaſſion on our troubled conſciences, that we may feel our burden lighter by your good favour, we ſhall praiſe God for the ſame, and ſhew our thank fulneſs to your Lordſhip, which we pray God to preſerve and keep to the good and benefit of his Church, and to your own comfort.</p>

Theſe are enough for ſpecimens of ſeveral ſorts of Supplications. There were others more particularly directed to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and to ſome great perſons, all much to the ſame ſenſe.</p>
            <p>This laſt means had ſome little effect: of which the Author of the Book called <hi>The unlawful practices of Prelates,</hi> giveth us this account, <hi>c.</hi> 4.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Hence became the ſubſcription to be ſomewhat more tolerable, and further time was granted unto divers in divers Countreys, and retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that which pertained to the Civil State, and in the Eccleſiaſtical that which concerned doctrine, with proteſtation to uſe the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer, the Archbiſhop ſuffered himſelf to be entreated to require no more of many. To this many were drawn: the peace of the Church, the compaſſion of their flocks, the wearineſs of turmoils, brought many to it, that yet did it, ſome with tears, ſome with ſo great heavineſs of conſcience long after, as they were never quiet till their dying day. So great a deſire of unity was in ſundry men that ſtood herein. Others ſatisfying themſelves with a proteſtation of an holy and godly reſolution by the<hi> Archbiſhop, </hi>and other of the Biſhops, in certain points (as they ſuppoſed) by the example of certain learned men in the like caſe, did not refuſe to ſubſcribe, as the Miniſters of<hi> Suſſex, </hi>and ſuch like. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ſome other ſpecial men were admitted in divers places with more favour, as the Miniſters of<hi> Leiceſterſhire, Buckinghamſhire, </hi>and ſomt other places, and ſome ſuch others (chiefly ſuch whoſe authority would have brought diſcredit to their too too ſevere proceedings) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſubſcription at all.</p>
               <p>Hence, of the multitude that held out, at firſt ſeemed not ſo great (tho in truth in reſpect of the men, and the times, they were too too many)<hi> and their ſubſcription </hi>laid with their<hi> ſundry exceptions in a manner no ſubſcription at all. </hi>But with the credit of theſe, ſhewing only the ſubſcriptions in one paper, and retaining their<hi> Proteſtation </hi>in another, many were drawn alſo as unawares birds into the net, by the chirping of birds firſt taken. From the colour of theſe laſt<hi> forms of ſubſcriptions, </hi>ſprang bruits, as tho all things were well in the<hi> Orders and Liturgy of the Church of England; </hi>all things ſubſcribed unto; that all had yielded; that whoſoever mouths were open, had ſubſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. But how far theſe differ frow that which was at firſt tendered, I ſuppoſe no man is ignorant. As again, how little difference there is between the latter, and that which all men did freely and frankly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:45468:14"/>
at the firſt. Nothing that did pertain to her<hi> Excellent Majeſty </hi>was ſtruck at; nothing that concerned doctrine, or the ſubſtance of our faith. Nothing that in the Statutes was ſet down touching<hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>The moſt that was excepted againſt at firſt, and that generally, were the <hi>Ceremonies, The reading the Apocryphal Books, The ill tranſlation of the Scriptures uſed, The Rubricks, Very many things in the Book of ordaining Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>paſſages in the prayers.</hi> The number was not many, who refuſed to uſe a <hi>ſet-form of prayer</hi> to be conſtantly uſed in their Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>It was but twenty five years ſince the whole Nation came out of <hi>Popery,</hi> where they knew nothing elſe; and it could not be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in that time ſhould be a diſcovery of all that was truly blameable in <hi>Worſhip,</hi> or <hi>Government of the Church.</hi> Yet there were ſome that in thoſe days refuſed this. Biſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> in his <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Poſitions,</hi> p. 84 tells us, that Mr. <hi>Field</hi> in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Asker, 14. Ap.</hi> 1585. tells him:</p>
            <q>I preach every Sabbath-day, (if no other that cometh by chance doth ſupply the place) having nothing to do at all with the former Book of Common-prayer,<hi> &amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>This was the firſt diviſion of godly Miniſters into ſuch as were <hi>purely Nonconformiſts. 2. Conforming Nonconformiſts.</hi> The latter were the greater number, who had ſubſcribed to <hi>uſe the Common-prayer,</hi> but not to <hi>read it fully and in all parts;</hi> and this with <hi>proteſtations,</hi> that their <hi>ſubſcriptions</hi> ſhould not oblige them to do any thing contrary to the word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there were ſeveral forms of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twenty Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Dioceſs of Chicheſter</hi> thus ſubſcribed, with <hi>exception</hi> to all the <hi>Rubricks,</hi> the <hi>Book of Ordination,</hi> and I know not how many limitations.</p>
            <p>Here the great and infinite wiſdom of God was ſeen, governing the failers of his ſervants to his own <hi>wiſe ends and glory.</hi> By this means a <hi>preaching Miniſtry</hi> was preſerved in <hi>England,</hi> which had the <hi>Biſhop</hi> kept to his firſt ſeverity, and all the Miniſters that at firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, abſolutely perſiſted in their refuſal, had before the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was 28. years old, been deſtroyed throughout <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt the greateſt part of it.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:45468:15"/>
But (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>He that will ſave his life ſhall loſe it.</hi> Very many of theſe good men were afterwards <hi>ſuſpended, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, indited, impriſoned, wearied</hi> out of their lives by troubles in the <hi>High Commiſſion;</hi> though not for <hi>not ſubſcribing</hi> (for which was no Law) yet for <hi>not wearing the Surplice,</hi> not <hi>uſing the Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> not <hi>keeping Holydays,</hi> not <hi>reading all the Prayers,</hi> or ſome ſuch like things. Thus was our ſtate from 1583. till 1603. when King <hi>James</hi> came to the Crown.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have ſhewed my <hi>Reader</hi> the firſt <hi>Impoſitions</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and the woful miſchief wrought by them, not only to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of particular Families, but to the intereſt of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> and <hi>Reformation</hi> in general.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to a ſecond period, which will take up the whole time of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign, from 1603. to 1625. <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gift</hi> was in the beginning <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> and <hi>Bancroft Biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> Their Writings ſufficiently teſtifie how zealous both of them were againſt <hi>Nonconformiſts.</hi> The <hi>Convocation</hi> this year eſtabliſhed the three Articles (which 20 years before had made ſuch a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) by a <hi>Canon;</hi> it is their 36 <hi>Canon:</hi> which <hi>Canons</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by King <hi>James,</hi> but never ſince brought to a <hi>Parliament,</hi> or confirmed by them. I am not concerned to enquire how valid they are as Laws obligatory to the ſubject, till confirmed by <hi>Parliament</hi> (that belongeth to Lawyers to argue, and dependeth upon the <hi>Kings Prerogative,</hi> and the terms uſed in the Act of 25 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.) I am only concerned to note how Conformity improved upon theſe <hi>Canons,</hi> and alſo what the effect of theſe new Impoſitions was.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, let the <hi>Canons</hi> themſelves ſpeak. <hi>Subſcription</hi> to the three <hi>Articles</hi> was now enjoined by <hi>Canon 36. Bowing at the name of Jeſus</hi> was enjoined <hi>Can 18.

            <note place="margin">This makes it evident, that the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at <hi>Hampton-</hi>Court, this year, was not in the name of all <hi>Nonconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts,</hi> but only the perſonal Act of 3 or 4 men Noncon.</note>
            <p>The firſt fruit of this was a Petition with a thouſand Miniſters hands, preſentad to the King 1603, 4. ſaith Dr. <hi>Fuller.</hi> Indeed Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaith, the hands were but 750. I believe he taketh his intelligence from the <hi>abridgment of that Book, which the Miniſters of</hi> Lincoln <hi>Dioceſs, delivered to his Majeſty,</hi> 5. December, 1604. I find them there mentioned to be 752. out of 23. Counties. Dr. <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaith, 25. which are but half the Counties of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> hardly ſo much. Their numbers are thus countd.</p>

How his Majeſty reſented this Petition, is variouſly reported. <hi>But ſure it is</hi> (ſaith <hi>Fuller) it ran the Gantlop through all the</hi> Prelatical party, <hi>every one giving it a laſh, ſome with their Pens, more with their tongues, and the dumb Miniſters as they term it found their ſpeech moſt vocal againſt it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many the number of thoſe was who joined in this, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Petitions at the ſame time, and were <hi>ſuſpended, deprived, impriſoned,</hi> &amp;c. I cannot tell; but a great diviſion aroſe, which held during the Archbiſhop <hi>Bancrofts</hi> time. Biſhop <hi>Abbot</hi> who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in the <hi>Archbiſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was much calmer. Several Books were wrote at this time againſt the <hi>Nonconformiſt,</hi> by Mr. <hi>Hutton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Rogers,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lovel,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Spark,</hi> (who had himſelf been a Diſſenter); but in the year 1607, <hi>&amp;</hi> 1608, they were learnedly anſwered by a Book of three parts, call'd, <hi>A De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Miniſters Reaſons for refuſal of Subſcription.</hi> The firſt part was <hi>concerning the holy Scriptures;</hi> the ill Tranſlation of ſeveral Texts. The ſecond <hi>concerning the Holy Scriptures and Apocrypha.</hi> The third was <hi>about kneeling at the Sacrament.</hi> Several able Miniſters left the Nation, many others with their Families were undone in it.</p>
            <p>Thus Conformity ſtood till the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt; ſome <hi>Biſhops</hi> being more, ſome leſs rigid in preſſing the <hi>Canons.</hi> But when Archbiſhop <hi>Laud</hi> came to be Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> (who ſucceeded <hi>Abbot)</hi> he made a new Edition of <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> to which he required Conformity, ſaying <hi>ſecond Service</hi> at the <hi>Table, ſetting that at the Eaſt end of the Church Altarwiſe, commanding the Communion. Table to be railed in, and all people to come up thither to receive the Communion kneeling;</hi> enforcing the <hi>bowing at the Name of Jeſus. Forbidding Lectures, and Afternoon-Sermons. Preſſing the Book of Sports on the Lords day. Not injoining but commending bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward the East-end,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and twenty more things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What havock heſe things made, is yet within the memory of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and what diſturbance Biſhop <hi>Wren</hi> made in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> and other places, as ſeveral other Biſhops that were his Creatures did in other Dioceſſes, many alive know; multitudes of Miniſters were again <hi>deprived</hi> and <hi>ſuſpended.</hi> Many undone in the <hi>High Commiſſion.</hi> At laſt in the Convocation 1640, an <hi>Oath</hi> with <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was deviſed, which had perfected the buſineſs in rooting out all Puritan Preachers, had not a <hi>Parliament</hi> came and ſpoil'd that deſign.</p>
            <p>Scarce any is ignorant what numbers of Godly Miniſters and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45468:17"/>
people left the Nation upon this account, betwixt 1630. and 1640. ſo many as to make one of the nobleſt <hi>Colonies</hi> at this day in the world (that, I mean, of <hi>New-England)</hi> beſides thoſe who fled into <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> Many ſtaid at home, and were miſerably treated by <hi>Courts.</hi> Some lived privately, others in ſome quiet parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion kept their Station.</p>
            <p>How little the Conformable Intereſt gained by this (though that Party ruined multitudes of godly people and their Families) quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared in the year 1641. when the <hi>Parliament</hi> began to eſpouſe their Cauſe, and give them liberty. The number of Miniſters, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring <hi>Nonconformity,</hi> preſently appeared far greater than ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo as their adverſaries had a little ſatisfied their luſts, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, but not in the leaſt promoved their Cauſe. The people were more imbitter'd againſt them, and more enamoured upon painful godly Miniſters. And the <hi>Biſhops</hi> reſtraint of Preaching, did but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame people with the deſire of it. Several Noblemen and Worthy <hi>Gentlemen</hi> in all parts of <hi>England</hi> began to be awakened, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by many of their excellent Speeches in the beginning of the <hi>Parliament</hi> 1641. They plainly ſaw, that through theſe extravagant actings, We loſt many of our Eminent Miniſters, multitudes of our moſt ſober people were removed into other Countries. The Trade of the Nation was altered, much of it carried elſewhere; the people in many places turned ignorant brutes for want of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; many turned <hi>Papiſts,</hi> many <hi>Doctrines of Popery</hi> were Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Colledges</hi> were fixed for <hi>Romiſh Prieſts,</hi> and <hi>Nuns</hi> fixed, &amp;c. a Plot laid by them againſt the King and Nation; they judged it high time to put an end to thoſe practices, which had cauſed thoſe diſorders; and had this advantage to do it, becauſe their Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, whether old or new, had no further Statutable Authority, than was given it by the <hi>Act of Conformity, 1 Eliz.</hi> and the Stat. 13 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 12. about the Articles of Faith.</p>
            <p>Upon his <hi>Majeſties</hi> happy <hi>Reſtauration, Anno</hi> 1660. all promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves a freedom from theſe evils which had troubled the Church very near 70. years, from the 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> to the year 1640. though indeed in no great degree from the <hi>13th</hi> to the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> but for about 19. years of Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> Reign, and the whole time of King <hi>James</hi> his Reign (which was 21. years), and 16. years of King <hi>Charles</hi> his Reign, theſe <hi>Impoſitions</hi> were the cauſe almoſt of all the evils under which this Nation groaned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:45468:18"/>
We had reaſon to promiſe our ſelves this immunity from his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Declaration</hi> at <hi>Bredah,</hi> and his firſt <hi>Declaration about Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical affairs,</hi> in the year 1660. Whether the wiſdom of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> or that party of the <hi>Houſe of Commons,</hi> who then oppoſed the paſſing of it into an <hi>Act,</hi> were greater, let the experience now of <hi>Twenty years</hi> more determine, which for the moſt part have been years of <hi>confuſion</hi> and <hi>diſorder;</hi> as to matters of Religion.

            <p>Upon this laſt attempt for ſettlement, <hi>Miniſters</hi> were not only left to the Biſhops power to have exacted upon them, 1. <hi>A Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription to the 3. Articles in the</hi> 36th <hi>Canon. 2. The Oath of Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical obedience,</hi> which though ancient, as eſtabliſhed by Canons in times of Popery, yet we read not of, all the time of <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> But 3. <hi>They muſt be ordained by Biſhops,</hi> though before ordained ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Ordination</hi> of all other <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> (which in <hi>Queen Eliz.</hi> time, the Statute 13 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 12. diſpenſed with, and made needleſs. 4. They muſt <hi>aſſent</hi> and <hi>conſent to all and every thing in the Common-Prayer,</hi> as <hi>now Printed. 5. They muſt declare, renounce, and abjure:</hi> all this over and above, being tyed to the perſonal reading of the <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi> and <hi>uſe of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The effect was, the laying aſide of more than 2000. Miniſters. Beſides the Congregations which depended on theſe good mens Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; the number of <hi>Quakers,</hi> who had no Miniſters, and of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of Congregational Churches,</hi> who had no Livings, but were maintained by their people, together with the people that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on them, and the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts,</hi> were not ſmall, who all had an equal, if, not a greater prejudice to the <hi>Common-Prayer-Book</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>What could by any wiſe men be expected, but what we have ſeen, that in all places people ſhould gather into <hi>ſeparate Congregations?</hi> Could it be expected, that ſuch a vaſt number of Miniſters, not half of which had any thing to live on but their labours to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain themſelves, Wives and Families, ſhould quietly have ſate ſtill and never Preached (if they could have imagined, that this <hi>humane Law</hi> could have diſcharged them from any previous obligation to God), eſpecially being importuned by the people whom God had committed to them? If any had ſuch fancies, they were very wild ones.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:45468:18"/>
In <hi>publick Temples</hi> they muſt not Preach; what remained, but their own or others <hi>hired</hi> houſes. What would be the event of this, was quickly ſeen, and an <hi>Act</hi> provided againſt <hi>Conventicles,</hi> making the puniſhment, <hi>Fines, Impriſonment, Baniſhment,</hi> &amp;c. What a ſtir this made, is ſufficiently known. This commenced 1664. and being a temporary Act, determined 1667, or 1668. Soon after this, 1665. paſſed the <hi>Act prohibiting Noncon. Miniſters to inhabit in Corporations.</hi> And the <hi>Act about Conventicles</hi> being expired, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Act</hi> was made, which took place, <hi>Anno</hi> 1670. How many ſober Miniſters and people in Eight years time had been undone, by proceedings againſt them in the <hi>Eccleſiastical Courts, Indictments</hi> at <hi>Seſſions</hi> and <hi>Aſſizes,</hi> and by putting the firſt <hi>Act</hi> againſt <hi>Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> in <hi>Execution,</hi> is ſufficiently known, and too large, and ſad a ſtory to relate. The new Act againſt <hi>Conventicles</hi> (and ſuch a one as never before paſſed a Parliament of <hi>England</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and the fundamental liberties of the ſubject) paſſed about 1670. Miniſters and people were again proſecuted to incredible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, almoſt in all places, until his <hi>Majesty</hi> gave a <hi>Writ of eaſe</hi> by his <hi>Declaration of Indulgence,</hi> 1672. that laſted but two years; and in 1674. the ſtorm began again, as fierce as ever, but gradually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated till the year 1677. about which time the <hi>Parliament</hi> began to have a <hi>ſcent</hi> of a Plot to bring in <hi>Popery;</hi> indeed they <hi>ſcented</hi> it firſt in 1673. Our worthy <hi>Patriots</hi> from that time ſtood upon their watch, ſomething they diſcerned to be in hand, and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was deeply laid, but on what perſons to charge it they knew not, and were wholly in the dark as to the <hi>methods</hi> and <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi> of it, till God, in the year 1678. inclined Dr. <hi>Oates</hi> to do that (never to be forgotten) ſervice to his Country, at one time ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>the Life of his Soveraign, the Government of the Nation,</hi> and the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> from a total <hi>extirpation,</hi> and all good <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> from a <hi>Maſſacre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The eyes of all Sober perſons are at length opened to ſee, that an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of Proteſtants</hi> is neceſſary. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, which way it ſhall be effected? for my own part, I ſhould ſay, <hi>any way,</hi> by which it is practicable. There are but Two that can fall within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of any man of ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt is by <hi>continuance</hi> of the <hi>Impoſitions</hi> on <hi>Miniſters and people,</hi> rooting out all <hi>private Meetings, enforcing people to come to hear the Common-Prayer, and to conform to the Ceremonies, and hear their Pariſh-Miniſters, and receive the Sacrament with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:45468:19"/>
2. The Second is by <hi>taking off theſe Impoſitione,</hi> which all agree to be of things not in their own nature <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but ſuch as the Magiſtrate may if he pleaſeth relax.</p>
            <p>For the firſt <hi>method</hi> to unite us, it is a ſtrange one, it aims only at <hi>uniting</hi> by <hi>deſtroying;</hi> and purchaſes ſuch a <hi>Church-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> boaſt of, who by deſtroying of <hi>hundred thouſands</hi> of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, at laſt made all of one mind in appearance. The experience of more then 100 years hath taught us, that multitudes are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be <hi>argued,</hi> nor <hi>cudgelled</hi> into their <hi>conformity.</hi> The multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Nonconformiſts</hi> hath increaſed all a long, in ſtead of abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, even from the firſt beginning of the difference at <hi>Francfurt,</hi> to this day; and he is very ignorant that knoweth not, that ſince the <hi>fire</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> they have been almoſt doubled to what they were before. Nor hath the warmth of many <hi>Clergymen</hi> of late, in decrying the Plot, or leſſening it, and indeavouring to make people believe it was a <hi>Nonconformiſt Plot,</hi> a little contributed to let the world know what they are, and would be at. Would any have theſe impoſitions ſtill inforced? what can they purſue, but the old deſign of <hi>Reconciling</hi> us and the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> in which the <hi>Papiſts</hi> will liſten to them, till they have ripen'd a deſign to cut their throats, as well as other mens; but thoſe are mightily ignorant of <hi>Popiſh princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> that can ſo much as fancy a poſſibility of reconciliation with them, ſo long as we maintain the <hi>Kings Supremacy,</hi> or a <hi>married Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;</hi> ſo that in truth a reconciliation to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> is a thing not to be thought on by a <hi>married Clergyman,</hi> (unleſs he be weary of his wife and children) nor by a <hi>Loyal Subject</hi> that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands ſenſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> muſt therefore be effected by taking off theſe <hi>impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which now for an hundred years have produced ſo ill effects in this Nation. It is eaſy to ſee how great the good of this would be. We ſhould all then be known by the ſingle name of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and be hearty as one man in oppoſition to all <hi>Popiſh deſigns.</hi> Our <hi>Civil,</hi> and <hi>Ecoleſiaſtical Courts</hi> might poſſibly then be at leiſure to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the power with which they are betruſted, againſt <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>profane perſons.</hi> Sober and induſtrious men would be encouraged to <hi>puſh out in trading</hi> to their utmoſt. There would be no <hi>complaining in our ſtreets</hi> for want of the <hi>Ordinances of God</hi> ſo adminiſtred, as that concientious people might freely partake of them, without ſo much as a <hi>fancy</hi> that might make them call out, <hi>Death is in the pot,</hi> and ſit at the <hi>Lords feaſts</hi> without ſo much as a jealouſy of a <hi>Divine
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45468:19"/>
Sword</hi> hanging over their heads, ſpoiling their Spiritual appetite. In ſhort, it would reſtore us to one of the greateſt pieces of Chriſtian liberty, <hi>To ſerve the Lord without fear,</hi> either of offending God whom they know in matters of Worſhip to be a <hi>jealous God,</hi> or of being undone in their temporal concerns for the exerciſe of a <hi>tender conſcience towards God.</hi> All good men ſhould rejoice under the ſhadow of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament,</hi> and unite their <hi>Prayers</hi> with chearfulneſs for both.</p>
            <p>What would be the Evil of it? The foundations of <hi>Archbiſhop Whitgift,</hi> and <hi>Archbiſhop Laud,</hi> and my Lord <hi>Chancellor Hide</hi> (the buildings upon which, hath hitherto been kept up with no leſs guard than the trouble of all the Courts of <hi>Judicature</hi> in <hi>England)</hi> would be ſomething ſhaken, and our foundations laid upon the word of God, which ſurely is far better; the credit of ſome men, who have laid all the ſtreſs of <hi>Religion</hi> upon a <hi>Common-prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book</hi> and ſome <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> would be thought a little impaired; the Magiſtrate ſhould do nothing diſpleaſing to God, who never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the impoſition of theſe things at his hands: and doubtleſs hath been highly diſpleaſed at a great deal of force uſed, which hath not been good for the enforcing of them.</p>
            <p>It is, as I have ſaid before, more than an hundred years ſince theſe <hi>impoſitions</hi> have been the cauſe of ſo much evil in theſe Nations, and that not only to particular families and perſons, but even to the <hi>whole Nation.</hi> Though our Civil Wars were bottomed upon <hi>Queſtions</hi> and Grievances of a <hi>Civil Nature:</hi> yet it is hardly imaginable the common people ſhould have been ſo inflamed, had they not before been wounded in ſo tender a part as that of their <hi>Conſciences</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
            <p>By reaſon of theſe conteſts, <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been connived at, and gained a great deal of Reputation, ſo much (that till within theſe 2 years) it was dangerous for <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to vie with them, for <hi>Loyalty</hi> or <hi>Religion.</hi> We ſee the iſſue, while they have been thus neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, yea credited, they have been hatching the moſt helliſh Plot that was ever heard of, hardly to be parallel'd by any ſtory. The Plot hath in the bowels of it been diſcovered ſo full of <hi>Blood,</hi> and <hi>Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> and <hi>Ingratude,</hi> to his moſt Sacred Majeſty; and in the defence of themſelves from the imputation of it, they have been found guilty of ſo many <hi>Lies,</hi> ſo much <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Subornation,</hi> ſo much <hi>ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> and <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> that they cannot but ſee their <hi>Catholick Cauſe</hi> is wounded under the <hi>fifth rib,</hi> and their <hi>pretended Religion</hi> not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45468:20"/>
like to recover its <hi>reputation,</hi> until there be none left of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. They have nothing to do, but to wait a time when they may fight out their way with ſome probable hope of prevailing.</p>
            <p>It is certainly now high time to reſtore all <hi>Proteſtants</hi> (be their perſuaſions what they will) to a juſt liberty in the things of God, than the want of which nothing can more diſpirit good men in their duty as to a common watchfulneſs and defence; for what ſpirit can be in them who know they ſhall be ruin'd by one hand or another? I ſurther offer it to the conſideration of our grave <hi>Senators,</hi> who come up from the ſeveral parts of the <hi>Nation,</hi> and muſt beſt know the complexion of it, Whether thoſe who are moſt againſt the taking of theſe <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> be not (I do not ſay all, but forty for one) the perſons whom ſeveral <hi>Proclamations of his Majeſty,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>votes of two Parliaments</hi> declaring it, and the <hi>ſeveral judgments</hi> upon ſome of the <hi>Traytors</hi> given by our <hi>Courts of Juſtice,</hi> have not been able to convince, <hi>That there is any Popiſh Plot;</hi> but in all their converſe they have made it their buſineſs to <hi>deny,</hi> or <hi>leſſen</hi> the Plot, to <hi>defame</hi> and <hi>vilify</hi> the <hi>Kings Evidence,</hi> to impoſe upon people that it was a <hi>Plot</hi> of the <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> to make the <hi>dying words of the Jeſuits</hi> creditable. In ſhort, by all manner of ways to turn the whole <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Plot</hi> into <hi>Ridicule.</hi> I do know ſome few (very few others) zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for theſe Impoſitions, have born a <hi>Teſtimony</hi> againſt the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and freely declare their <hi>Judgments</hi> about the Plot, to the ſenſe of the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Parliament</hi> and the <hi>Judges;</hi> but as to the generality, let obſervation be made, and judgment accordingly given. If it be found to be that party, they are fit only to be regarded by thoſe who pray for the good ſucceſs of that <hi>Execrable deſign,</hi> to which the continuance of theſe things, and a vigorous proceeding accordingly againſt <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> will as potently conduce, as it is poſſible any thing ſhould.</p>
            <p>From this ſhort, and true account of the <hi>riſe,</hi> and <hi>growth,</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> of theſe <hi>Impoſitions,</hi> a good account may be given of a late Authors <hi>Hiſtory of Separation,</hi> the ſmalneſs of it at firſt, and the further increaſe and improvements of it, which indeed did much vary, according as <hi>Impoſitions</hi> varied, and multiplyed. Thoſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which he calls <hi>Separate Congregations,</hi> were from the firſt of Reformation; but the numbers of them, and of the perſons in them, was much increaſed after 1583. when <hi>Whitgift</hi> firſt brought in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions</hi> to <hi>Articles,</hi> and impoſed them univerſally; and increaſed yet more in 1603. and further in <hi>Biſhop Lauds</hi> time, and were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:45468:20"/>
greateſt in 1662: when the greateſt number of Miniſters was thrown out and forbidden to preach in any publick Temples. Till that time <hi>Nonconformiſt Miniſters</hi> might preach publickly, and moſt of them did ſo in the years 1634, 1635. to 1640: which is the true reaſon that in thoſe years there were ſo few <hi>Private meetings,</hi> the people could in publick Temples hear their Miniſters as <hi>Lecturers,</hi> yet in thoſe times there were <hi>private meetings;</hi> and notwithſtanding all the fury ſome <hi>Biſhops</hi> uſed, I remember Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> in a ſpeech made to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> 1641 or 1642. complain'd of an hundred ſuch meetings to be in <hi>London</hi> alone.</p>
            <p>Nor is it any wonder if in near forty years time, good people have gained a little more light in matters of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and diſcerned the unlawfulneſs of ſome things in both, which were not at that time diſcerned. The <hi>Queſtions</hi> relating to both, have been more ventilated ſince the year 1640. than ever they were before, ſince the Reformation. So as a telling of the world, how few <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> were at firſt, and in how few things they diſſented, is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant to any purpoſe but the loading of preſent <hi>Diſſenters</hi> with an <hi>Odium</hi> from thoſe ignorant and paſſionate perſons who do not underſtand, <hi>That they had not half ſo much reaſon to diſſent then,</hi> as they have had ſince, and now have; and that the preſent <hi>Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> required of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> is twice more than was formerly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And for the people, their <hi>Nonconformity</hi> in a greater degree muſt alſo be attributed to the further light they have gained as to matters of <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> the true <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> together with the outing of their Paſtors, they being no ſuch notions as all can ſwallow, <hi>That the forbidding godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to preach by an humane law, diſſolves the paſtoral relation of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors to their Churches.</hi> Or, that <hi>all within the bounds of a pariſh, are obliged to be members of the Church in that place; or are therefore ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they dwell within the bounds of ſuch places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some obſerve, that moſt men have ſome opportunities in their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time offered them by the Providence of God, which if they lay hold of, they make them happy in the good things of this life. The like fate poſſibly attends Nations.</p>
            <p>We had one opportunity offered us in <hi>Q Elizabeths time,</hi> when Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation might have been ſettled without theſe ingrateful impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This was loſt through the fiery zeal of the then <hi>Archbiſhp,</hi> and brought us into near 20 years troubles. We had a ſecond in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of <hi>King James</hi> his time; but the ſame man, and his ſucceſſor
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:45468:21"/>
Archbiſhop <hi>Bancroft</hi> &amp;c. again hindred our ſeeing what concerned our peace. We had a third opportunity upon his Majeſties Reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; by whoſe means it was then hindred, all know. We have ſince met with 20 years trouble more, or very nigh.</p>
            <p>We have a fourth before us at this time, upon the diſcovery of this <hi>Execrable Popiſh Plot.</hi> When God calleth us under the penalty of all that is dear unto us, to ſeek peace amongſt our ſelves, (for our Saviour hath told us, A <hi>Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand).</hi> All other propoſals for Union, but the abating thoſe <hi>Impoſitions</hi> which divide us, are meer idle <hi>toys</hi> and <hi>vanities.</hi> Good men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love peace ſo well, as to purchaſe it by ſubmiſſion to things which they judge ſinful. If we ſhould loſe this alſo, I ſhall only ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Interpretation be to thoſe that hate us, and to the Enemies of our God.</hi> We may look for good, but no good will come.</p>
