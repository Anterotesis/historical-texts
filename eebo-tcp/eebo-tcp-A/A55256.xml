            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>VVHat elevating Notes are theſe I hear!</l>
               <l>A Voice! or is't the Muſick of the Sphere?</l>
               <l>A Charm unuſual the rapt Thought does bind;</l>
               <l>Thought ever till this Moment unconfind;</l>
               <l>Yet happier now in the Reſtraint is found:</l>
               <l>So wiſely knows this Charmer how to wound.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Sleep All ye Inſtruments, the trembling Lute,</l>
               <l>The chearful Hoboy, and ſoft-ſounding Flute:</l>
               <l>The Trumpet too and Viol now be ſtill,</l>
               <l>Tho' both ſo well betray their Maſter's Skill,</l>
               <l>That This can ſpeak, and That's no longer ſhrill,</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Something Sublimer now, and more refin'd</l>
               <l>Than theſe, ſtrikes the glad Senſe, and wings the Mind;</l>
               <l>Pleaſures unknown before it does impart,</l>
               <l>That warm the Spirits and diſſolve the Heart.</l>
               <l>Methink's the Air's Perfum'd, while all around</l>
               <l>The little Atoms fly to catch the ſound.</l>
               <l>Sure the charm'd Soul anticipates her Bliſs,</l>
               <l>For ne'er was heard below a Strain like this.</l>
               <l>'Tis then the Language of ſome pitying Saint,</l>
               <l>Who with the Joys of Heav'n does Earth acquaint.</l>
               <l>(How bleſt are we! Alive to taſte of Heav'n,</l>
               <l>Which is not before Death to others giv'n!)</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The raviſh'd World lends an Attentive Ear,</l>
               <l>Wou'd never ſpeak, ſo it might always hear.</l>
               <l>Not ſofteſt Whiſpers interrupt their Bliſs;</l>
               <l>All talk is out of tune and time but This.</l>
               <l>Applauſe it ſelf's ſuſpended; for 'twou'd wrong</l>
               <l>The liſtning Ear, and dies upon the Tongue:</l>
               <l>And that minuteſt Noiſe may have no part,</l>
               <l>Time is not beaten with the Hand but Heart.</l>
               <l>Thus without mixture to the Senſe it flies;</l>
               <l>And every Note's a ſtab before it dies.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>See, ſee th' Effect 't has wrought, how All appear</l>
               <l>So much like that (alas) which once they were,</l>
               <l>All Tender, Innocent, Serene, and Mild</l>
               <l>As ſleeping Seas, or the rock'd happy Child.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>How gentle are the Thoughts which it inſpires?</l>
               <l>What inward Bleedings, languiſhing Deſires?</l>
               <l>The cruel Nymph who never yet did give</l>
               <l>Her dying Swain one Look to bid him live;</l>
               <l>All ſoftn'd now by the prevailing Sound,</l>
               <l>She ſighs, and pants, inſenſibly grows kind,</l>
               <l>And meeting his fond Eye, ſhe looks it blind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But hold: A gentle Pauſe; the Sacred Hymn</l>
               <l>Is done; and ſee where ſtands the ſweet-tongu'd SERAPHIN.</l>
            </lg>
