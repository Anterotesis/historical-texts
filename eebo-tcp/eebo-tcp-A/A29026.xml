            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Advertiſement OF THE PUBLISHER.</head>
            <p>I Find by ſome diſcourſe I lately had with the Author, that his deſign in drawing up his Memoirs, being to ſet down what had occurr'd to him of his own Obſervation and Experiments, he purpoſely forbore to conſult the Authors that have profeſſedly written upon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Waters, he would by no means have it thought, that he undervalued thoſe Learned Writers that he forb<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e to cite, becauſe he had them not at hand, as well as becauſe his deſign did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire he ſhould tranſcribe from them. And therefore he deſires, that his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhould not be kept, by any thing he has written, from conſulting other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that have treated of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:48332:3"/>
eſpecially the late Ingenious Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, of the Learned Doctor <hi>Liſter De Fontibus Medicatis Angliae</hi> (after men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by our Author,) and the curious little Tract of the <hi>French</hi> Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that was brought our Author in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> after his Memoirs were come to him from the Preſs, publiſh'd by the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi of the famous Royal Academy, of Sciences at <hi>Paris,</hi> eſpecially where they curioſly examine the Saline and earthly. Reſidences of Waters, which our Author has not done to the remains of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Acidulae,</hi> of which Liquors he had for the moſt part ſuch incompetent quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities as concurr'd with another reaſon to diſcourag'd him from publiſhing his Tryals on them. Yet I may ſafely ſay what he offers here to the Reader is far beyond any thing that has been publiſh'd in this kind; for the Virtuoſi as well as the Water-drinkers may reap no ſmall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by the peruſal of this learned Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, as containing a great number both of uſeful Obſervations, and unuſual Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments.</p>

            <head>Advertiſement.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THe Author of the following Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had thoughts of reviewing and inlarging them before he parted with them; and at leaſt, of an annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Notes to ſeveral of thoſe Titles of the hiſtorical Platform, that are yet left untouch'd. But, beſides his want of health and leiſure, he was, by the ſupervening of ſome urgent occaſions, oblig'd abruptly enough to lay aſide this work he was about, and apply himſelf to others, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd him more than the Scrutiny of Mineral Waters could. Wherefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that he had already made Annotations, though but ſhort ones, upon moſt of the conſiderableſt Titles or Topicks of inquiry, enumerated in the Second and Principal Part of his
<pb facs="tcp:48332:4"/>
Schemes above them, he was content to give the enſuing writing unfiniſhed as it was, to the Solicitations of ſome</hi> Vertuoſi, <hi>who rather than tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till he ſhould have an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which he knows not how long he ſhall want, were deſirous to take what they ſound ready, with all its imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. Which preſſingneſs of theirs he could not deny to be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable, on this occaſion, becauſe the communicated writing is not pretended to be a full and methodical Hiſtory of Mineral Waters, but only a bundle of</hi> Short Memoirs, <hi>contributed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the compiling of ſuch a Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe, that they may be the more conveniently cited or referr'd to, I thought ſit to divide into ſix Sections; where of the Firſt is introductory, and and contains ſome General Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the Occaſion, the Subject, and ſome other things relating to thoſe Memoirs. The Second contains only a ſet of Titles for the Firſt Part of the propoſed Work, becauſe urgent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions kept me from making, as I
<pb facs="tcp:48332:4"/>
intended, ſome Marginal Notes, upon ſeveral of the particular Articles. The third exhibits a Scheme of Titles for the Second Part of the propos'd work,</hi> viz. <hi>The way of experimentally exploring portions of a Mineral Water ſever'd from the Spring or Receptacle. And becauſe the Second Part is that which I mainly deſign'd, I have referr'd to it two other Sections, one, which is the Fourth, containing a Collection of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and Obſervations relating to the uſual way of examining Mineral Waters by Galls, as a</hi> Specimen <hi>given on the 13th Title of larger Annotations on the Titles of the Second Part; and the</hi> other <hi>conſiſting of leſs copious Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and ſometimes much ſhorter Notes on divers other Articles of the ſame Second Part. To which Laſtly is ſubjoyn'd the ſixth Section, conſiſting only of a Set of Articles, referrable to the Medicinal uſe of Mineral Waters; together with a Concluſion addreſs'd to the ingenious Dr. that ſet me upon this Task. In proſecuting of which I deſire
<pb facs="tcp:48332:5"/>
it may not be thought ſtrange, that I have not cited Authors that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of</hi> Thermae <hi>or of</hi> Acidulae. <hi>For in the diſadvantageous Circumſtances wherein I wrote, I ſhould have been kept from conſulting them, if I had had them at hand. And I thought it enough for for me at that time, to impart to my Friends, what my own Experiments and Thoughts had furniſh'd me with, how little or mean ſoever that was. Which Advertiſement is therefore the more fit to be here given, that I may not divert any from ſtudying thoſe more elaborate Pieces, that have within no long time been publiſh'd by skilful Men, and eſpecially by the very learned, Dr.</hi> Liſter.</p>

               <p>SO many years, Sir, have paſt, ſince I had occaſion to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider Mineral Waters, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to make Tryals on them with any Application of Mind;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48332:11"/>
that, <hi>tho'</hi> ſince that time ſome <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſi</hi> have been pleas'd publickly to declare, that they found ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections they received from me not unuſeful to the <hi>Examen</hi> of ſuch Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; <hi>yet</hi> having ſorgotten many of my paſt thoughts, and loſt on miſlaid moſt of my Memorials about matters of fact relating to thoſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, I fear I ſhall not be able to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy either you, or my ſelf, by what I now write about them. But how ever, <hi>ſince</hi> you will needs have me ſay ſomething upon this Subject <hi>ſince</hi> it is a noble one, as that where in the health of thouſands is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd; <hi>ſince</hi> 'tis of late grown to be more priz'd and diſcours'd of, than ever; and <hi>ſince</hi> I have obſerved mens curioſity about it to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to very narrow Limits, moſt men contenting themſelves with the diſcoveries they can make by the Infuſion of Galls (or their Body,) and perhaps a ſlightly improv'd evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: <hi>Since,</hi> I ſay, I have theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations to obey you, I am content
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48332:11"/>
to offer you my Advices, ſuch as they are, for the drawing up of ſuch a natural Hiſtory of a Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter propos'd as, being comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of many Inquiries and Wayes of Indagation that even Phyſicians have either not known or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look'd, may probably afford a more reaching notice, and inlarg'd know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Subject treated of. Upon which account I have, I confeſs, a deſire and an aim, tho' no great hope, that this rude Eſſay may, by your Improvements and thoſe of your Learned Friends, be made of ſome ſervice to the Publick.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But here I muſt ingenuouſly own to you, that notwithſtanding the many wayes I propoſe, of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the natures or Qualities of Mineral Waters, yet I think the ſureſt way of knowing them, is a long and ſufficient Experience of their good and bad effects. For I ſtrongly ſuſpect, and it may be partly know, that there are, beneath the ſurface of the Earth, divers Mineral Subſtances,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48332:12"/>
                  <hi>ſome</hi> fix'd, and <hi>ſome</hi> volatile, <hi>ſome</hi> in the form of hard Bodies, <hi>ſome</hi> of ſoft ones, <hi>ſome</hi> of Liquors, and <hi>ſome</hi> of Fumes, divers of which the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, even of Learned men, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſtrangers to; beſides thoſe that, tho' ſome men may chance to have ſeen, have their natures ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle known, that they have not ſo much as names aſſign'd to them. So that when I conſider, that of the Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents we are unacquainted with (to paſs by all the reſt that the Earth may conceal) the proportions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are mingled may be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs, and the Qualities reſulting from theſe Commixtures may be very differing from thoſe of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Ingredients, I am apt too look upon the difficulty, of <hi>Securely</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining the Effects of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>à priori,</hi> as little, if at all, leſs than inſuperable to Humane Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this difficulty is not ſuch, as ought to make us think it uſeleſs, to have a good Project of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48332:12"/>
Hiſtory of a Mineral Water. For 'tis no ſmall advantage, to know what particulars are fit for our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, to be furniſh'd with a Sett of heads, to which one may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently refer whatever he tries, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, about the Subject propos'd. And (which is yet more conſiderable) <hi>to</hi> be furniſh'd with variety of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods or ways, to make Tryals fit for inveſtigating the Nature, or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Qualities, of the propos'd Water; ſince by the number and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of purpoſely and fitly devis'd Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, he that makes them may, as it were, view his ſubject on all ſides, and be much aſſiſted to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, what Saline, or other Minerals known to us, and what quantities of them, do impregnate the Water he examines, and conſequently what effects they are like to produce in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though there be three ſorts of things, fit to be taken notice of by him that would give an Hiſtorical account of a Mineral Water, whether
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48332:13"/>
cold or hot, yet contenting my ſelf to treat but very curſorily of thoſe that belong to the firſt, and to the third of the three ſorts, I have made a more full and particular Enumeration of the Titles that peculiarly belong to the ſecond ſort of obſervables, namely thoſe that mention the various Tryals, Chymical and Mechanical, that are to be made with the Water after 'tis taken out of the Spring. This I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely did, chiefly becauſe 'twas only of this ſort of particulars that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd my thoughts, and partly alſo becauſe they are moſt wanted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd by Naturaliſts and Phyſicians, and are like to prove the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to them; having alſo this to recommend them, that, to make the greateſt part of them by far, it is not neceſſary that a man repair to the place where the Spring riſes, but he may at leiſure examine the Water at home, where he may be accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with Furnaces, veſſels, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conveniences, to make his Tryals upon it.</p>

5. A much leſs diſcerning Reader, than you, may perceive that in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the inſuing Project of a Natural Hiſtory, I aim'd much more to aſſiſt practical Phyſicians to find the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and effects of Mineral Waters, than to inſorm Speculative Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts of their cauſes and manner of being generated. But yet a heedful peruſer may find, that I have ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to gratify Phyſicians that I have not been altogether <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>anting [eſpecially in the Firſt Part, which is almoſt wholly Mineralogical,] to the curioſity of Philoſophers, as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to all ſorts of Mineral Waters: Tho' you may eaſily enough diſcern, and readily confeſs it, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paper does much more regard thoſe cold ones, that from the Acid Taſt that is found in moſt of them are call'd <hi>Acidulae,</hi> than thoſe other Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that from their heat are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſtyl'd <hi>Thermae,</hi> becauſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſort of Mineral Waters is that, which I have had the opportunity to be the more converſant in, as well as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48332:14"/>
that, about which alone you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd my Obſervations.</p>
               <p n="6">6. I had once thoughts of illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating the following Setts of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles with a kind of <hi>Rationale,</hi> briefly declaring the reaſon of their order and their number (ſor both theſe were conſiderately pitch'd upon, not lighted on by chance.) But I was obliged to omit it, when I ſound (as I quickly did) that I had too little leiſure and health, to imploy much of either upon a troubleſom work of no grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter importance. And therefore, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your Perſpicacity to be more than ſufficient to make you diſcern ſome reaſon for the order wherein I have marſhall'd the Articles of the <hi>laſt</hi> Sett of Titles which fall under the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of your own Profeſſion, I have not been ſolicitous to aſſign that Reaſon. And I preſume 'twill be no great harm, if my haſt have made me alſo omit to perform at preſent the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention I had to make here and there ſome Brief Marginal Notes upon ſome of the Articles of the firſt Part. And
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48332:14"/>
I thought it ſufficient (if not alſo ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of making ſome amends for the newly mentioned Omiſſions) to make them ſomewhat numerous, and ſome of them large Annotations upon the Titles or Articles of the II Part: This being indeed the chief that I deſign'd to inſiſt on, and preſent you.</p>
               <p n="7">7. I expect it will be wonder'd at, that ſo many Inquiries ſhould be propos'd, and ſo many things direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be taken notice of, about a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that hath been thought ſo barren, that men are wont to think their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity great enough, if they inquire what colours the Mineral Water will ſtrike with Galls, or Oaken leaves; and do obſerve what kind and quantity of Salt will remain after the evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Liquor: And I much fear, that ſome, even of your profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will think I cut them out a great deal too much work, by ſo many troubleſome Queries and Tryals. But I confeſs that nature or long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience having made me, tho'not a Sceptical, yet a ſuſpicious and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48332:15"/>
Philoſophiſer, I think my ſelf obliged, on difficult occaſions, to ask more than ten Queſtions before I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to anſwer one. Nor do I think that the ſlightneſs of anothers curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity diſpenſes me from induſtriouſly exerciſing mine. I might on this occaſion repreſent, that tho' the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Naturaliſts, and Phyſicians among the Ancients, did not only mention, but admire and diſcourſe of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; yet our <hi>Gilbert</hi> thought fit to examine it further, and was thereby able to diſcover far more numerous <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> than all them put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had taken notice of. And I might add other inſtances to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; but to anſwer more cloſely, and directly, I ſay, that, to diſcover the nature of Mineral Waters, being a thing far more difficult than thoſe, that have not try'd, do imagine, I think we ought to view the Subject in as many differing lights as we can expoſe it to, and take in as many helps to diſcovery as we can; ſince a great many particulars, that ſingly, or at
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48332:15"/>
the firſt view, ſeem not very perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, if they be ſurvey'd in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and be skilfully apply'd, may much conduce to the deſir'd end. And perhaps hereafter it will be found uſeful, if not neceſſary, to make large additions to the Topicks, whoſe number is now thought redun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: For the more qualities and other particulars, we are acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in any Subject, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounded, and the more enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed knowledge we have of it. As for the trouble it may coſt, to make the propoſed Enquiries and Tryals, it may be ſaid, 1. That they are not all neceſſary (though uſeful) nor yet of equal moment, and therefore the omiſſion of ſome, that are leſs important, may not diſappoint the main Searches. 2. I have purpoſely made moſt of the Tryals as eaſy and ſhort, as the matter and Scope will permit; and thoſe, that will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ſome trouble in ſeeking an uſeful truth, do not deſerve to find it, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince, in the chaſe of noble diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48332:16"/>
as in hunting the nobler game, the toyl oftentimes makes a part of the pleaſure. And I have made the leſs ſcruple, to be ſomewhat ample in the enquiries I propound, becauſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers obſervations have perſwaded me, that Phyſicians ought to conſider ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well both the nature of the Waters they ordain, and to what perſons, for what Diſeaſes, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, they preſcribe the uſe of them: For tho' many look upon them as ſuch innocent Medicines, as, if they do no good, can at leaſt do no harm, yet the effects, that have too often inſu'd the unskilful uſe of them, eſpecially when it was long continued, allow me not to look upon the drinking of Mineral Waters as a ſlight thing, that may ſafely be plaid with, but as that whereby we have ſeen, as very much good, ſo a great deal of miſchief, done, eſpecially ſome time after the operation is thought to be quite over, and perhaps almoſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
               <p n="8">8. I look upon the examen of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48332:16"/>
Properties, and other Qualities, of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waters, as a thing that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the greater importance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am apt to think, upon proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble grounds that, by a diligent inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, there may be diſcover'd in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> (and in divers other Countries too) a far greater number than is yet imagin'd of Mineral Waters, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ferruginous ones; which I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gueſs will be found very nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, becauſe, by ſome uncommon wayes of Tryal that I have imploy'd, I have found that divers Minerals that either men knew not what to make of, or by reaſon of their paſſing under other names did not ſuſpect to be Martial, did yet partake of, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps abound with, parts of a Martial Nature. And I ſhew in another Paper <hi>[about the Magnetiſm of the Earth]</hi> that kindly provident Nature, or rather its Divine Author has, under various diſguiſes, furniſh'd our Globe with a far greater plenty and variety of Iron Ores and Minerals, that partake of that Metal, the moſt uſeful by far
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48332:17"/>
to mankind, than of any other Metal. And as Martial Minerals do thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in the Earth, ſo they are more diſpoſ'd, than one would ſuſpect ſuch hard Bodies could be, to impregnate even ſuch Liquors as are not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly acid, and ſeem unlikely to be able to work upon Minerals far leſs hard than they. To make this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, we took not <hi>Iron Ore,</hi> or <hi>Embryo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Mars,</hi> but pure Steel it ſelf, the ſame as Needles were made of; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the minute Filings of it, we put ſome Tincture of Galls made with common Water, and filtred through Cap-paper, that the preſent colour of the Liquor, and the change we expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be made in it, might the better appear: And by this Tryal we found that, in leſs than an hour, the tranſparent infuſion of Galls was ſo alter'd, as to be grown not only opa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous, but of a dark and almoſt inky co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which it retain'd even after Filtration; and this tho' the Vial, that contain'd it, was very ſlender. A not unlike effect was produc'd by ſmall
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48332:17"/>
Filings of ſteel, but ſomewhat ſlow: lier in the red Tincture of Brazil, and in that of Logwood, made with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I know not whether it may not be fit to be repreſented, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that, in Countries manifeſtly abounding with Metalline and other Minerals, it may perhaps be worth while, that mens Curioſity deſcend much lower than the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> or Turf of the ground, and make ſearch both after Subterraneal Springs, and Wells, and their operations upon Humane Bodies. For I have upon Inquiry been aſſur'd, by thoſe that in ſeveral places have viſited Mines, that they have met with in them, and ſometimes at very great Depths, running, as well as Stagnant, Waters, of differing Taſts, and ſometimes other Qualitie; and that the Diggers, venturing to make uſe of them to quench their Thirſt, <hi>as</hi> they found ſome of them miſchievous (as Corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, Petrific,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo they met with others that were not only innocently.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48332:18"/>
Potable, but Medicinal. Of both theſe ſorts we have Inſtances in our Tin-Mines of <hi>Cornwal</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire.</hi> And of the latter ſort I receiv'd from an ingenious Gentleman, that has the overſight of ſome <hi>Corniſh</hi> Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works, this memorable Anſwer to an Inquiry I ſent him. The ſtrangeſt Account, ſaies he, of Mineral Waters that I have yet had, was of that in the bottom of a Tin-work call'd <hi>Karn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> wrought above 60 fathom [that is 360 foot deep;] the Mineral being a mixture of Tin and Iron, and the Water Red and Puddle, yet drunk was cool and not nauſeous, and would paſs by Urine, near as Red as it was drunk, as I have been inform'd by thoſe that drunk of it whilſt it [the Mine] was working, being now ſtruck out, [that is, the vein of Ore being degenerated, or loſt.] However I believe Experiments might yet be made with Water much of the ſame nature. Thus far he, from whom notwithſtanding the remoteneſs of the place he lives in, I hope to get

                  <p>Experimental Remarks upon the (uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al) way of examining Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by the help of Galls: Deliver'd by way of Larger Annotations upon the <hi>XIII.</hi> Article of the <hi>II.</hi> Part.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SInce the change of colour that Mineral Waters produce in the Infuſion or Tincture of Galls, is the moſt uſual way that many Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and the almoſt only that ſome of them, endeavour to diſcover or examine Mineral Waters by; it may be worth while, in this place, to ſet down ſome remarks, that I have made about this way of probation; &amp; the rather becauſe it may, <hi>mutatis mutandis,</hi> be not unuſefully apply'd to the exploring the Quality's of Mineral Waters by Colorations, tho' made with other Materials than Galls. Firſt then it may be obſerv'd, that one need not make an Infuſion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48332:27"/>
or Tncture of Galls in common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to try if by their means a new colour will be produc'd. For I am wont to beat them to Powder, and keep them in a Glaſs (not too big) exactly ſtop'd, by which means I have them alwaies in readineſs to mingle with the Mineral Water, and alter the colour of it, if Galls be able to do it, almoſt in atrice: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as to draw the Tincture of Galls with Simple Water, often takes up ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours, and the tinging parts are much weakn'd by being diluted by the <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> If you would have a Tincture, the Powder of Galls, ty'd up cloſe in a Ragg, and with it hung in the Liquor, makes the Infuſion leſs muddy. If you be in haſt, and have none of the Powder at hand, you may ſcrape as much of a Gall-Apple, as you need into the Mineral Water.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have obſerv'd thoſe Parts of the Infuſion of Galls (eſpecially it made by heat) that produce the new Colour with Ferruginous Waters,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48332:27"/>
to be more apt to fly away than one would think, the Infuſion becoming often unfit to alter the Colour of the Martial Waters, whilſt yet it ſelf appears ſufficiently high colour'd. Upon which account, I chooſe to make a Tincture of Galls not long before I mind to uſe it; And if I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy dry Galls, to take Powder that is not ſtale.</p>
               <p n="3">3. 'Tis no ſafe way, and may be very erroneous, that is uſually taken in mixing Galls or their Infuſion with the Water to be explor'd ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly, as is wont to be done. For thoſe that are curious to make good Ink, will eaſily believe, that much of the deepneſs of the Colour depends upon the Proportion of Galls to the other Ingredient; and accordingly that by putting a much greater, or a much leſſer, quantity of Galls, into ſuch a quantity of the Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the reſulting Colour may be more or leſs intenſe. To obviate which inconvenience, I take this courſe when the occaſion deſerves it; I make
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48332:28"/>
my Infuſion of Galls with a certain weight of the Powder in a determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate weight of Water. As for inſtance I put about five <hi>gr.</hi> of powder'd Galls, to ſleep for ſo many hours in an Ounce of Water. But if I make uſe of the dry Powder, then I am wont to put three or four grains into an Ounce of the Liquor to be examin'd; which is a way far more certain than the Common, wherein the Ingredients are aeſtimated but by Gueſs. I have have mention'd various proportions of powder'd Galls to the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Liquor, becauſe I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd that there is really a great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality among the Mineral VVaters in which it may be put; and I have found by Tryal, that in an Ounce of the <hi>German Spaw,</hi> a ſingle grain of Powder would immediately produce a ſufficiently deep purple colour.</p>
               <p>'Tis an inconvenience, that not only Galls, but the other Drugs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after to be mention'd, impart a high Tincture of their own to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon VVater they are infus'd in; and
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48332:28"/>
therefore it were to be wiſh'd, and is fit to be endeavour'd, that we had ſome Drugg, that without imparting a colour to the common VVater it impregnates, would afford an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion fit to ſtrike a blackiſh or a purple colour with Martial VVaters.</p>
               <p>Though it be uſeful, yet 'tis not neceſſary, to imploy Galls to produce a colour in the Mineral VVater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. For beſides that 'tis known that uſually, (tho' not alwayes, as I have try'd,) the ſame thing may be done, but ſomewhat more faintly, with Oaken Leaves, we may ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully enough ſubſtitute, for the ſame purpoſe, ſome other aſtringent vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, as dry'd Red-Roſe Leaves, the Peel, and, (as we have try'd) the Juice of Pomegranates; and (what I find to be a notable ſtiptick) the bloſſoms of the ſame plant, (which are vulgarly call'd in the Shops <hi>Ballauſtium.)</hi> To which may be added Myrobolans, Logwood, and ſome others that need not now be mention'd, whoſe ſtrong Infuſions
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48332:29"/>
have yielded me a Tincture very dark and blackiſh with ſome Martial Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</p>
               <p n="6">6. In regard that the Galls, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Drugs, to be infus'd in common VVater, are not alwayes of the ſame goodneſs or ſtrength, 'tis adviſeable not ſo to truſt to any determinate proportion of the Pigment to the VVater, as not to take in the help of the Eye, to judge by the Colour of the Tincture, whether the Liquor be duely (and not too much or too little) impregnated.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Whereas there is an intimation in the Cloſe of this thirteenth Article of the preſent Sett of Titles, that Animal Liquors may be imploy'd to produce new colours with Mineral VVaters, I gave that hint, not only becauſe 'tis uſually obſerv'd in Martial VVaters, ſuch as thoſe of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> the <hi>Spaw, &amp;c.</hi> that the groſs excrements of the lower belly are blacken'd by a commixture of their Metalline Parts; but in <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> VVaters particularly I have obſerv'd, that after the drinking of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48332:29"/>
larger doſes of them, the root of the tongue, and perhaps ſome neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts, would alſo acquire a dark colour, by the operation of the tranſient Liquor.</p>
               <p>Though the way of trying Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral VVaters, by the change of colours that Galls produce in them, be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and recommended by being eaſy, cheap, and expeditious, yet I do not take it to be either of that extent, or of that certainty, that 'tis vulgarly preſum'd to be of: For its main, if not only conſiderable, uſe is, to diſcover by ſtriking, or not affording, a black or blackiſh, or at leaſt a purple or a purpliſh, colour with a Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to manifeſt the Liquor to be, or not to be, either of a vitriolate, or a ferruginous nature. But there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Metalline Ores, and other Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Bodies, which not participating of Iron, will not by this way be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verable and yet may ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate the VVater propos'd: As for example, to try whether if Arſenic were mingl'd with VVater, Galls
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48332:30"/>
would diſcover it by producing with it a dark colour, I put ſome of the Powder of them into a Decoction of arſenic, but did not perceive that it gave the Liquor any deeper colour, than it would have done to common VVater. And as the extent of this explorer of VVaters is not very great, ſo neither do I find the informations it gives us to be ſo certain, as they are preſum'd. For, if I much miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not, I long ſince found upon tryal purpoſely made that another Body of a Metalline nature, and that did not partake of Iron, would with infuſion of Galls afford a very dark colour, that might eaſily, among or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Beholders, paſs for the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour produc'd by a Martial VVater; and I do ſomewhat doubt, whether ſo much as all Liquors impregnated with Iron, will de diſcover'd to be ſo, by the colour they afford with Galls; for I have ſometimes made ſuch a Liquor with no Mineral Subſtance in it, ſave ſteel or Iron but I did not find it would turn the Infuſion of Galls either
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48332:30"/>
blackiſh or purple, which made me ſuſpect, that theſe colours are afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by ſuch Martial VVaters, as have been wrought upon more or leſs by ſome Acid Salts or Fumes.</p>
               <p n="9">9. Unto theſe things I ſhall add, that I found that to be a miſtake, which is generally taken for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz.</hi> That the infuſion of Galls will certainly diſcover, by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing black, (or purple,) if a Mineral Water, that is mix'd with it, be vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olate; for, <hi>tho'</hi> it be true that if, in the vitriolated VVater, Iron be the only or predominant Mineral, or be at leaſt conſiderably participated by the Liquor, <hi>yet</hi> if the diſſolv'd vit riol be altogether copperiſh, I found by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Tryals purpoſely made with a ſtrong ſolution of Roman vitriol, (wherein Copper is affirm'd to be the only, or to be very much the predominant, Metal,) that it would not with inſuſion or Tincture of Galls, afford either a black or a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh colour, but only a thick and muddy one, that was not ſo much purpliſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48332:31"/>
It comes into my mind upon this occaſion that from one of the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Countreys of <hi>England,</hi> where there are divers Mineral VVaters, there was brought me by a <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> a good quantity of very whitiſh Earth, which he ſuſpected to be of a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar nature, but could not tell of what. This odd earth being examin'd, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it to contain a conſiderable proportion of Lead Ore, corroded by ſome Mineral Salts, and imbody'd with the Soyl; ſo that if it had been in a place where people had ſought for Mineral VVaters, 'tis probable that, finding ſome peculiarity in the taſt of thoſe that paſs'd through this Earth, they would have taken it for a Mineral Water, but had been at a great loſs to determine what Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralit did partake of; and perhaps, in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to reſolve the doubt by drinking it, they would have found very bad effects of it. But probably the Sulphureous Spirit to be ere long deſcrib'd in this Paper would have inform'd them, that the Water was
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48332:31"/>
impregnated with a Body of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of vitriol, but not of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon vitriol. For tho' <hi>Galls</hi> do not give a black, or very blackiſh, colour with a ſolution of <hi>Saecharum Saturni,</hi> (which is indeed the vitriol of Lead) reſolv'd in diſtill'd or rain Water. <hi>Yet</hi> I found by Tryal, that this volatile Sulphur did manifeſtly and preſently do it; which Tryal I was fain to take up with, becauſe when I had occaſion to conſider this matter I had not at hand the ores of Lead, Copper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore was fain to content my ſelf with the ſolutions of the Metals themſelves in their proper <hi>Menſtruums;</hi> it being probable, that the Metalline parts of the Ores would have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either the ſame ſolutions, or ſome very like them, in the ſame <hi>Menſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums;</hi> which conſiſting of Niter, Sea-Salt, &amp; Vitriol, Bodies that abound in diverſe places of the Earth through which Springs flow, the impregnated Water would afford <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of the ſame kind. I made tryals alſo upon a ſomewhat fine ſolution of refin'd
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48332:32"/>
Gold made in an <hi>Aqua Regalis,</hi> and upon a ſolution of common running Mercury, made with <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> and in a clear ſolution of Tin, made, not with either of the foregoing <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums</hi> (for I have not found them to diſſolve it genuinely) but in a peculiar Solvent, (which I have communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in another Paper,) that does not only diſſolve it readily, but keep it permanently diſſolv'd, as <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> do's Silver, but not Tin. To theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions I put Galls, without obtaining any blackiſh colour except from that which contain'd Gold. But with our Sulphureous Liquor we produc'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table changes of colour, and thoſe in all the ſolutions but one a dark one or tending to blackneſs, and tho' for that reaſon a careleſs eye might judge them indiſcriminately to be blackiſh; yet ſince I well remember that the degrees, or ſome other modification, of the ſame dark colour ſeem'd plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough not to be the ſame in all of them, I do not think it impoſſible but that a <hi>very heedful</hi> Beholder
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48332:32"/>
(which when I made thoſe Tryals I had no great motive to be) may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern between thoſe obſcure colours ſome little differences, that may much aſſiſt him to gueſs, what metalline ſubſtance is contain'd in the Liquor, or at leaſt is predominant in it, if it be a compounded one. And I particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly remember, that the colour that ſprang from our Sulphureous Liquor and ſolution of Tin, was manifeſtly diſtinguiſhable from thoſe produc'd in that of any of the other ſolutions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not black or blackiſh, nor ſo much as purple, but of a kind of browniſh yellow.</p>
               <p>Though I am content that the things, I come from mentioning, ſhould make men cautious and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet not only I do not deſpiſe or ſlight the uſe of Galls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> even as it it is vulgarly practis'd, but I am apt to think that the way of exploring Mineral Waters by the changes of colour, that may be produc'd in them or by them, when they are mingled with convenient Drugs or Addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48332:33"/>
may be made of greater extent and uſe than he, that has read what I have written in the foregoing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, will perhaps be forward to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. But to make the way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring Mineral Waters by colorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of ſomewhat more general uſe and leſs uncertainty, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend theſe things to the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menter,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It ſeems very fit, if not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that he look upon the change of colours, both while 'tis producing, and when 'tis produce in a good light and with a heedful Eye. For by this means he may diſcover ſeveral ſhades or varietys of the more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal colours, and ſome other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he could not elſe take notice of; and which yet may afford good hints (in reference to other Minerals, as well as Martial ones,) to a ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſerver. And I have ſometimes fancy'd, that there may be a kind of Phyſio gnomy of many, if not moſt, other natural Bodies as well as of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane faces, whereby an attentive
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48332:33"/>
and experienc'd conſiderer may him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſcern in them many inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive things, that he cannot ſo declare to another man, as to make him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern them too.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The Attention here encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd may perhaps be made more inſtructive, by a way that I have ſometimes practis'd to vary the Shades, and other <hi>Phaenomena</hi> of Colours produc'd with Mineral Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors. This way conſiſts chieflly in preparing Sheets of White Paper by drenching them in a ſtrong Infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Braſil, Log-wood, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther convenient dying ſtuff, and then letting them dry leaſurely in the Air, which may give ſome of them, as I have obſerv'd, a colour differing enough from that of the Liquor look'd upon in a Vial or drinking Glaſs. Upon this dry'd Paper ye may let fall, but not all on the ſame place, ſome drops of the Mineral Liquor to be examin'd, eſpecially if it be of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line nature, and by the Changes of Colour, effected by theſe Drops on the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48332:34"/>
Parts of the Paper, they fell and ſpread themſelves upon, a heedful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver may be aſſiſted to gueſs, what kind of Mineral impregnates the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and how much it does ſo; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially if on the ſame Sheet of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſome other fit Mineral Water or idoneous Liquor be likewiſe dropt, that the changes of colour produc'd by the two Fluids, may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd and compar'd together. I alſo practis'd another way ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what differing from this; as the main part of which we prepar'd white Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, by rubbing well upon it, with a hares foot or ſome ſuch thing, ſome idoneous Powders, eſpecially that of vitriol (whereof for this purpoſe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſeem'd the beſt) lightly calcin'd in a gentle heat till it became of a grayiſh colour and friable between the Fingers. By this means 'twas eaſy to make the <hi>Paper</hi> fit for our turn. For the finer parts having lodg'd themſelves in its Pores, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much diſcolouring it when the ſuperſluous duſt was ſtruck off, it
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48332:34"/>
became capable of affording a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Colours, or rather ſhades, ſome deeper and ſome fainter, when I let fall on it ſome drops of differing Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Liquors. But of the <hi>Examen</hi> of the <hi>Materia medica,</hi> by the changes of colour produc'd in it or by it, more is ſaid in another Paper; and therefore, inſtead of transferring that hither, I ſhall here briefly intimate, that divers variations of colour may be made, <hi>either</hi> by infuſing or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mixing, as I have ſometimes done ſomething in the Mineral Water before the tinging ſtuff be put to it: <hi>or</hi> by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſomewhat in the Infuſion or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Galls, before it be mix'd with the Mineral Water, <hi>or elſe</hi> by dropping fit Liquors (ſuch as Spirit of Salt ſirſt; and then Spirit of Urine, or Oyl of Tartar) into the Blackiſh or Purple Mixture of Galls and the Medicinal Water to be examin'd. For by theſe means diverſe variations of colours may be obſerv'd; which, together with ſome other wayes that I have
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48332:35"/>
made uſe of to multiply them, I have not now leiſure to ſet down.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It is not convenient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ones ſelf to the uſe either of Galls or Oaken Leaves, but to make uſe alſo of Red Roſes, <hi>Balauſtium,</hi> Log-wood, Braſil, and other aſtringent vegetable Pigments. For, though ſome of theſe give a deeper Tincture than Galls yet, by the diverſity of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours produc'd by them in Mineral Waters, an attentive Beholder may, as was lately intimated where I mention'd diverſity of Lights and Shades, diſcover ſome things that he would not be informed of, or receive any hints of, by the help of Galls of Oaken Leaves alone. Nay I would not have our experimenter imploy none but vegetable ſubſtances about his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorations, but ſometimes make uſe of Animal ones, and (more often) of Minerals: Since by this means he may much diverſify his Tryals, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the number of <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> ſome of which he may probably find inſtructive. Beſides aſtringent Plants
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48332:35"/>
I have found, and ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd, other ſubſtances that will turn black as well as Galls, with vitriolated Water; and that not only with thoſe that are richly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Iron, but alſo with thoſe wherein Copper alone abounds, as in Roman vitriol. And tho', for certain reaſons, I muſt not now ſet down a way I have, to diſcover in a trice both theſe vitriols, without any Liquor or Tangible Body, yet I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join, as a kind of <hi>Succedaneum</hi> that may ſuffice for the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the way of making a Liquor that will preſently turn black with a ſolution either of Martial or Cupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous vitriol.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Take equal parts of pure Salt of Tartar, and either Flowers of Sulphur, or at leaſt Sulphur finely powder'd, and good Sal-armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac, reduce the firſt and the laſt to powder ſeparately, melt the Sulphur over a gentle fire, and by degrees put to it the Salt of Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, ſtirring them well, to make
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48332:36"/>
them incorporate and grow red (or reddiſh.) Then put this mixture pulveriz'd into a Glaſs Retort, or a cucurbite, and pour on it the Sal-Armoniac diſſolv'd in fair Water, and cloſing well the Junctures, diſtill all in ſand by degrees of a moderate fire, ſhifting the receiver once or twice, becauſe the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors will be differingly ting'd and ſtrong; and that which aſcends laſt, may bring over but very little of the Sulphur, whoſe volatile Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture is yet the main thing we aim at in this operation.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) I do not deſpair but that he, who were able to make a skilful uſe of the ſeveral Drugs and other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's, Vegetable, Animal and Mineral, that may produce new colours in or with Mineral Waters, (or in ſome caſes with the ſubſtances that impregnate them,) may by their means be alſo inabled to diſcover the preſence or inexiſtence of divers other Minerals, ſome of them ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious, or at leaſt ſafe, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48332:36"/>
either hurtfull, or at leaſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, that are not taken notice of by thoſe that content themſelves to imploy Galls and Oaken Leaves, in the exploration of the Waters they examine. For ſome of theſe Liquors contain Salts, that having not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded either Martial or Cupreous Ores or Marcaſites, do not betray themſelves by producing either an Inky or a fainter degree of Blackneſs, or elſe a Purple, with the Drugs made uſe of to change their Colours. Oftheſe Salts I have met with more than one ſort, which may be more properly take notice of, when we conſider the Mineral Water and its contents.</p>
               <p n="12">12. I think it likewiſe very poſſible, that induſtrious men ſhould find wayes to diſcover, by the help of the change of colours, whether Orpiment or native Arſenick, or the like poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Minerals, do ſo impregnate the Water propos'd, as to make it very hurtful or dangerous, thô not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely pernicious. And as for Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48332:37"/>
there may be ſeveral Waters that partake of it, without being taken notice of to do ſo. For I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that I have ſometimes purpoſely made a Liquor, that was limpid and colourleſs like Spring Water, and which would totally fly up, even with a gentle heat; and yet this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor was richly impregnated with a Mineral Sulphur, as I convinc'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>virtuoſi</hi> by manifeſt and ocular proofs. So that if Sulphur chanc'd to be combin'd with any Salt or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, of thoſe many ſubterraneal ones that nature hath hid from us, that can ſuppreſs or diſguiſe its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar odour, the Water may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably, and yet unobſervedly, impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with it. And yet 'tis like this may eaſily be diſcover'd by the change of colour, producible in ſuch a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Liquor by vitriolate Bodies, and, other appropriate additaments: Which may be thought the more <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,</hi> becauſe, thô the Spirit lately deſcrib'd be very tranſparent and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally volatile in the form of a Liquor
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48332:37"/>
ſometimes pale enough, yet common Engliſh Vitriol, as alſo that of <hi>Danzick</hi> which is Venereal, will preſently turn it of a black or very dark colour. And to add here ſomething more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to be perform'd, I have devis'd a way, which <note place="margin">A Paper re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, about the Salubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Inſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrity of the Air, under whoſe 4th Propoſition this Proceſs is rang'd.</note> I elſewhere deliver, whereby it may appear that even Copper, that hath been melted into a Body, may be ſo ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd and diſguiſ'd, as to have a multitude of its metalline Parts made to aſcend, with others, in the form of a Tranſparent Liquor like common Water: And yet by putting to it a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of another ſubſtance, as volatile and colourleſs as it ſelf, it would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcloſe the Copper it contain'd by turning blew as a Saphire.</p>
               <p n="13">13. Becauſe <hi>Arſenic</hi> is a very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Drug, and yet has been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be clandeſtinely mingled with ſome Mineral Waters, which I thought the leſs improbable, becauſe
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48332:38"/>
ſome of the Marcaſitical Bodies by which ſome Mineral Waters paſs, are judg'd not to be devoid of <hi>Arſenic,</hi> for theſe reaſons, I ſay, and for this other which makes the mention of it pertinent in this place, that Galls did not (as I elſewhere note,) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover at all the inexiſtence of this poyſonous Drug in Water, thô the Liquor were copiouſly impregnated with it, I thought fit to make ſome Trials, that ſeem'd to me likely to diſcover at once the in exiſtence of Arſenic in Water, and ſomewhat of the nature of that dangerous Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>Happening ſome years ago to taſt <hi>Arſenic,</hi> not without ſome little dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and inconvenience, the Taſt of it did not ſeem to me to favour the vulgar ſuppoſition, that its poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous nature conſiſts in a highly Acid Salt; whereas its Taſt agrees well with my Conjecture, who ſuſpect it to be of an exceeding corroding or fretting nature, but whoſe corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiveneſs is <hi>ſui generis,</hi> that is, of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48332:38"/>
kind. Having then made a ſtrong ſolution of Arſenic in common Water, [which does not without ſome skill eaſily diſſolve it,] we mix'd a ſmall proportion of it with the <hi>German-Spaw</hi> Water, and then dropping into this mixture ſome high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dephlegm'd Spirit of Urine, we perceiv'd a light Lacteſcence to be produc'd, and a whitiſh Precipitate very ſlowly to ſubſide.</p>
               <p>We found alſo that a little (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent) Oyl of Tartar <hi>per deliquium,</hi> being drop'd into ſome of the lately mention'd ſolution of Arſenic, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd a heavy whitiſh cloud, which preſently ſettled at the lower part of the Glaſs. We alſo put Oyl of vitriol, as one of the ſtrongeſt Acids we know, into the ſolution of Arſenic, but did not perceive, that the Oyl made a Precipitation, or wrought much otherwiſe on it than it would have done upon common Water. And by theſe three Tryals one would ſuſpect, that Arſenic is, at leaſt <hi>ex prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominio,</hi> an Acid Body.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48332:39"/>
But not content with theſe, we put ſome of the Arſenical Liquor upon ſome Syrup of Violets, and found it to change the Syrup, thô but ſlowly, rather to a Green than a Red or Purple Colour.</p>
               <p>We put, to another portion of the ſame Liquor, ſome of our volatile ſulphureous Spirit, but took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of no Precipitation that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued.</p>
               <p>For a ſeverer <hi>Examen</hi> we imploy'd a Tryal that we ſucceſsfully make uſe of (and have deliver'd in another Paper) to diſcover ſuch ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Acidity in Liquors, as by ordinary Tryals are not diſcoverable; but we could not by this way diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the leaſt Acidity in our Arſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Solution, but rather a manifeſt token of an Urinous or Lixiviate Quality.</p>
               <p>With the former Experiment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed very well that which we afte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards made, by putting ſome of the Arſenical Liquor into a ſtrong ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of common Sublimate made in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48332:39"/>
fair Water. For by this means we had a copious Precipitate, ſuch as might have been expected from an Alkaline Precipitant. And this was not brick-colour'd, as fix'd Alcali's produce with diſſolv'd Sublimate, but white, ſuch as Urinous or Volatile Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calies, (as they call them,) are wont to make with the ſame Liquor.</p>
               <p>The forgoing Tryals having been made at one time, when I was in haſt, and not at all fond of having to do with Arſenic (for which reaſon I caus'd the ſolution to be preſently thrown away to prevent dangerous miſtakes;) thô what I have hitherto try'd ſeems very favourable to our propos'd conjecture; <q>That thô Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenic be a very corroſive Body, and perhaps upon that ſcore poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, yet its deleterious nature does not conſiſt only or mainly in a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendently Acid, nor in a lixiviate cauſtick Quality, but in a corroſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>ſui generis,</hi> I mean peculiar and diſtinct:</q> Yet I ſhall forbear to be poſitive in this conjecture till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48332:40"/>
Tryal, pretending only, by what has been ſaid, <hi>to</hi> ſhew the need of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the vulgar ſuppoſition by fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inquiries, and <hi>to</hi> give ſome hints towards the finding of Antidotes againſt this cruel Poyſon.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now add that, for the ſake of Water-drinkers, I caſt about in my Thoughts for ſome way that might be of <hi>ſome uſe,</hi> thô of <hi>no certainty,</hi> in examining a Mineral Water ſuſpected to contain Arſenic. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for Reaſons which haſt forbids me to mention, I pitch'd upon vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Bodies and found that if a little ſolution of <hi>Dantzick</hi> Vitriol were put to a convenient quantity of Arſeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Liquor, there would preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue a great change of colour, and a dark Subſtance would by degrees pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate it ſelf and ſettle in the lower part of the Glaſs. The like effect we found, when we put <hi>Engliſh</hi> vitriol, which (having no Copper added in the making, as that of <hi>Dantzick</hi> has,) is either altogether or almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally Martial, into a conſiderable
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:48332:40"/>
proportion of the Arſenical Solution.</p>
               <p>I fear I ſhall be thought to have dwelt by far too long upon this one (13) Article of our Sett of Titles: But I was tempted to do it, <hi>Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> becauſe I thought the Subject ſeem'd both to merit and to need it, <hi>Partly,</hi> becauſe I thought fit to give an Inſtance that may ſhew that even that part of the Exploration of Mineral Waters, that is judg'd to be the moſt cultivated, hath been but ſuperficially enough conſider'd. And <hi>Partly,</hi> too, becauſe my want of health, and my preingagement to ſome Subjects that I am more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for then I am for that I now treat of, permitting me to make few other than <hi>ſhorter Notes</hi> upon the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Articles and clauſes of this Scheme of Titles; I thought it not amiſs, by referring all the foregoing Obſervations and Tryals to the ſame Topick, to give <hi>one Specimen</hi> (thô but an imperfect one) of thoſe that, for diſtinctions ſake, I ſtyle <hi>Large Annotations.</hi> And though

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48332:42"/>
the propos'd Water from others, but becauſe it may afford him a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and double information. For, by comparing the weight of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Liquor with that of common Water, he may be, in caſe the former be heavier (as it uſually happens to be) aſſiſted to eſtimate what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of Salt, or Martial, or other Mineral Subſtance, it is impregnated with. And if it be very light, and much more if it be lighter than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Water, he may probably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that the Subſtance, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnates it, is either very ſmall in quantity or proportion, or is not near ſo groſs as is to be found in other Mineral Waters, but of a Spirituous and Volatile nature which is a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of no ſmall moment in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. And <hi>thó</hi> that may ſeem a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox which I here ſuppoſe, that a Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter impregnated with a Metalline or Mineral Subſtance ſhould be as light or even lighter than common Water. <hi>Yet</hi> upon Tryal carefully made I have found ſome Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48332:43"/>
as particularly that of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> well taken up, and (thô they be ſomewhat leſs light) that of the <hi>German Spaw,</hi> and of ſome of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington</hi> Springs, to be manifeſtly ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than common Water, and ſome taken up at <hi>Tun bridge</hi> I found to be lighter than common Water, even pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by Diſtillation.</p>
               <p>And thô it be very hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, yet I think it not impoſſible, that a Subterreneal Subſtance, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnates Water, ſhould be lighter <hi>in Specie</hi> than it: but yet I would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this ſurprizing Levity, in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, nor all of it in moſt caſes, to the admixture of lighter Corpuſcles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome Tryals juſtify'd the ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion I had, that much of the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Lightneſs proceeded from this, That the Mineral Water was imbued with a ſmaller quantity of vulgar or culinary Salt, than common Water uſes to contain. But yet theſe Tryals did not ſatisfy me, that this paucity of common Salt was the ſole or ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate cauſe of the lightneſs of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Waters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:48332:43"/>
But, to diſcover ſuch minute diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, one muſt have good Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and indeed, to ſpeak freely, there are few, upon whoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports I durſt confidently relye, for the Specific Gravity of Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For to weigh Liquors any thing exactly there is requiſite more Heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and more Skill, and better In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, than are eaſy to be met with together, and than we uſually imagine. And, when Phyſicians and others weigh Mineral Waters, they are wont to do it in ſome Apothecary or other Trades<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>mans Shop, where, if the Ballances be ſmall, the Veſſels and the Water are commonly too heavy for them, and oftentimes wrong them. And if, as is uſual, the Bottles or other veſſels be great, they require far better Ballances than are uſually imploy'd in the Shops of Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or Grocers, whoſe Ballances a Critical Examiner will too often find to be far from being accurate, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that uſually, without at all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the weights, thô perhaps not
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48332:44"/>
great ones, he may eaſily make which Scale he pleaſes manifeſtly prepon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, and continue in that poſition, and may as eaſily afterwards give the other Scale the ſame advantage: The diligent and experienced Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matician <hi>Merſennus</hi> much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the difficulty he found to weigh Liquors exactly, even by the help of his Nicer Inſtruments. The accurateſt way, I know, is by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the differing weights that the ſame ſinking Body has in common Water, and in the Liquor propos'd. But this way (which I elſewhere circumſtantially deliver) requiring, beſides good Inſtruments, skill in Hydroſtaticks, is practicable but by few. And the way of comparing Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by the greater or leſſer ſinking of the ſame Cylinder or other ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Body into them, is ſcarce accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate enough. Wherefore I choſe to make a very skilfull Artiſt blow, at the flame of a great Lamp, a thin round vial with a flattiſh bottom, that it might ſtand upright, and be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48332:44"/>
very light, and this was furniſh'd with a neck as large as a Gooſe quil drawn very even into a hollow Cylinder of above 3 Inches long, and fitted at the top with a little Gap, that hinder'd the Water from aſcending above the due height.</p>
               <p>This Glaſs contain'd ℥iiiſs and 43 grains of common Water, and yet when empty, weigh'd but <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>vi+ 42 grains: So that I could uſe it, when full of Liquor, in ſuch a Ballance, that the addition or detraction of half a Grain, or leſs, would make either Scale preponderate. The length and evenneſs of the ſtem was deſign'd for uſes not needful to be mention'd here; where it may ſuffice for my purpoſe to ſay, that this Glaſs was judged capable of holding Water enough for not uncurious Tryals, and yet not to be, thô well fill'd, too heavy for a tender Ballance. In this Veſſel herefore we carefully weighed ſeveral Liquors (whoſe Gravity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs not to this place) and among them diverſe Mineral Waters, ſome
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48332:45"/>
of which, at leaſt known here at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> were found to be of the annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed weights.</p>
               <p>The Glaſs being fill'd with ſeveral Liquors to the ſame height, and weighed in the ſame Ballances.</p>

An accidental weakneſs I had, in my eyes, when I had the beſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to endeavour ſatisfying my ſelf about this Inquiry, forc'd me to leave the proſecution of it to others. Only two things I ſhall take notice of on this occaſion: <hi>One</hi> is that, having caus'd one that had young Eyes, and was accuſtom'd to make uſe of ſuch Microſcopes as are mention'd in the Article, to look upon ſome Mineral Waters through them, he ſaid he could diſcern no difference between them and common Water.

which the Tryal ought to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by various perſons, on ſeveral Waters, with differing Engyſcopes, and in differing Lights, and other circumſtances. The <hi>other</hi> is, that whereas it is by divers learned men objected, againſt the goodneſs of theſe magnifying Glaſſes we now make uſe of to look on Liquors, that the little Bodies that the ingenious, Mr. <hi>Lewenhoeck,</hi> and ſince him di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> have obſerv'd in Water wherein Pepper has been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd, are not, as he pretends, living creatures, but little inanimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretions, that are caſually form'd, and carry'd to and fro in the Liquor: To convince theſe Doubters, of whoſe number I was my ſelf at firſt inclin'd to be, I deviſ'd the following expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment: Having laid, upon the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Glaſs, a part of a drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherein I could ſee ſtore of theſe little Animals frisking up and down, we put to the Liquor, with a briſtle or ſome ſuch very ſlender thing, part of a drop of Spirit of Salt, which, as
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48332:47"/>
was expected, preſently kill'd theſe little tender creatures, and depriving them of their Animal Motion, left them to be carry'd ſo ſlowly to and fro in the Liquor, as to make it viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they were then dead and had been before alive.</p>

               <p n="9">IX. 1. This is an almoſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Article becauſe many Perſons, that drink Mineral Waters, cannot well, either for want of ſtrength or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, repair immediately to the Spring head, but are oblig'd to drink them in their Beds or their Lodgings, and perhaps to have them tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a great diſtance, or even to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country. 2. Many Purging Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are found to retain their Laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive vertue, and that perhaps for a conſiderable time, thô they be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported to places diſtant from thoſe they riſe in. 3. In ſuch Ferruginous Waters, as are lighter than common Water, I found a manifeſt difference in reference to tranſportation: For moſt of them, even ſuch as will bear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, have ſomething of freſhneſs and quickneſs at the Spring head, (perhaps from ſome Spirituous and Fugitive Exhalations, that there ariſe with them, but preſently vaniſh,) that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48332:48"/>
they have not any where elſe. And ſome do not only loſe this briskneſs by being remov'd, thô in veſſels well ſtop'd, but they loſe alſo the power of producing, with the powder of Galls, a Purple colour, as I found by Tryal purpoſely made in more than one of theſe Mineral Waters, which, to prevent fraud, I ſent for to the Springs themſelves by ſervants of my own: For thô theſe carryed their Glaſs Bottles along with them, and had no other Errand there but to fill and ſtop them carefully yet, by being tranſported leſs than one league, I found them ſo alter'd, that they would no longer make a Purpliſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour with powder'd Galls, but a deep reddiſh one; whereas the <hi>German Spaw</hi> Waters did almoſt alwayes here in <hi>London</hi> afford me, with the ſame Powder of Galls, a rich Purple Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. And <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Waters afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me the like, but not ſo deep a one. when I receiv'd them at <hi>London</hi> very well ſtopt. 4. This laſt clauſe was not to be omitted, becauſe the exact
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48332:49"/>
or negligent cloſing of the veſſels, wherein ſuch Waters are tranſported, is a circumſtance of great moment. For more than once I receiv'd at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> Waters ſent me from <hi>Tunbridge</hi> by Phyſicians themſelves, (who us'd at leaſt a moderate care in putting them up,) which yet would by no means afford with Galls a purpliſh Colour. And I found that even the <hi>German Spaw-Water</hi> would almoſt preſently loſe its capacity of being made Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by Galls, if it were conſiderably heated. 5. But the ſame Spaw-Water being, in Summer time, kept all night in an open Veſſel, did the next morning till it was late, if not till Noon, retain a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to be made Purple by the admixture of Galls; but that diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it loſt before the next day.</p>

Becauſe it often happens, that men have not the leiſure and the conveniency totally to evaporate the propoſed Mineral Water, it may be an uſeful thing, to be able without e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaporation to diſcover, whether it contain any common Salt and, if it do, to make ſome eſtimate, how copiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or ſparingly the Liquor is impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with it. This might eaſily be done, with nicety enough, if I were not by very juſt Reaſons reſtrain'd, for a while, from communicating that way of examining the ſaltneſs and freſhneſs of Waters, of which I did, by the Kings command, ſhow his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſome proofs, whereof mention was preſently after made in the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gazets. But till it be free for me to impart that way to the publick, I ſhall only intimate, that ſome gueſs may be made at the Saltneſs of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by obſerving, whether they will lather with waſh-balls or Soap,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48332:50"/>
and, if they will not, what quantity of curdled matter they will produce; as alſo, whether the Waters will ſerve for waſhing of Linnen, and will boil Peas tender? Which two are the moſt uſual wayes that many Sea men take to examine the goodneſs of unknown Waters by. In divers Purging Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters this way may be difficult to be practis'd with certainty, becauſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Salts that may be predominant in them; but in the Examen of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ferruginous Springs it may be more rely'd upon. 2. It may not be unworthy obſervation that, when I made uſe of my own way of exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Saltneſs of Mineral Springs, I did not find even the lighteſt ſort of them devoid of common Salt; which I found, but not in equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions, to be contain'd, not only in the ſeveral Waters of <hi>Iſlington, Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead</hi> VVater, and, if I miſremember not, in ſome others, but alſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in <hi>Tunbridge</hi> VVaters, and thoſe of the <hi>German-Spaw,</hi> which I did not much wonder at, becauſe I had long

Thô <hi>Acidity</hi> be ſo uſually a manifeſt Quality of Mineral Waters, that Authors are wont to divide them into <hi>Acidulae</hi> and <hi>Thermae,</hi> yet I have found, by ſeveral Tryals, that 'tis not near ſo eaſy as men preſume, to find a manifeſt Acidity in all Mineral Waters, that are not Sulphureous or Hot. For ſeveral Ferruginous Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, having probably ſpent the Aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity they had upon the Iron Ore, which they diſſolv'd in their paſſage, retain ſo little Acidity, that 'tis hard to diſcover they have any, either by their working upon Coral, or by any conflict with Spirit of Urine, or the like, or by mixing them with Syrup of Violets, to change the colour of it;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48332:51"/>
inſomuch that ſometimes I ſhould have concluded ſome ſuch Waters to have no Acidity at all, if I had not had a way of diſcovering a far leſs degree of it, than I could diſcern it to have by other Tryals. The circumſtances, that made this way of examining ſo critical, will coſt me too many words to ſet down here, and I have done it in another Paper expreſly written, of the way of diſcovering the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of divers Bodies, by changes of colour made in or with them: And therefore I ſhall here but briefly tell you, that I diſcover the Acidity of Liquors by their operation upon the colours of an Infuſion of <hi>Lignum Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phriticum</hi> made in Lympid Water, (and order'd after a certain manner.) By this means I found the <hi>German Spaw</hi> Water to retain a little Acidity, even here at <hi>London;</hi> but more than one of our own Ferruginous Springs did not, even upon this Tryal, appear to have any. And (which ſome may think ſtrange) I did not find even ſome of the Purging Springs, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

The Scope of this Inquiry was twofold: The <hi>firſt,</hi> to diſcover whether a change of Texture would notably alter the Qualities of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, when the Hermetical Seal hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Avolation of any Saline, Ferruginous, or Spirituous parts: And the <hi>other</hi> was, to ſee whether ſuch an Agitation, by heat, as in the open Air would, as I had found, deprive the <hi>Spaw</hi> Water of the vertue of making a Purple colour with Galls, would cauſe any manifeſt ſeparation of parts in the Liquor, and make any groſſer ſubſtance to precipitate or ſubſide. But thô we did twice (not without difficulty) make the experiment with <hi>Spaw</hi> Water, yet we made it without ſucceſs. For the firſt time the Glaſs broke at the bottom, before the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we immers'd it in was near boyling hot. And thô the other Glaſs reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

longer, and indur'd a greater heat, yet in not very many Minutes that alſo broke at the bottom.

And I chuſe to leave this 20th Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Inquiry in its place, among the reſt of the Titles, becauſe poſſibly ſome other may be more happy, than I was, in endeavouring to anſwer it.

               <p n="26">XXVI. 1. Divers wayes may be propounded to diſcover which of the Qualities, mention'd in this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, is predominant in the Salt to be examin'd; but I confeſs I ſomewhat doubt, whether theſe waies of Tryal be ſo certain, as many will be forward to think them. 2. If Acidity be gueſs'd to be predominant in the Salt propos'd it will probably appear by ſuch waies as theſe. <hi>By</hi> the Taſt, odour, or both: <hi>By</hi> working upon Coral or Crabs eyes finely powder'd: <hi>By</hi> curdling of Milk; <hi>By</hi> making Syrup of violets reddiſh: <hi>By</hi> the power of deſtroying the blew colour of the Infuſion of <hi>Lignum Nephriticum: By</hi> not being Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by Potent Acid Liquors as Oyl of Vitriol, Spirit of Salt; and <hi>by</hi> being Precipitable by Oyl of Tartar <hi>per de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquium,</hi> as alſo by ſtrong Spirit of Urine, and other volatile Alcaly's, as they are call'd. But, as I was noting above, I doubt whether theſe proofs be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48332:53"/>
abſolutely certain; for, if I miſtake not, I found ſome Purging Mineral Waters that would not give even ſo ſlight a proof of acidity, as to deſtroy the blewneſs of the <hi>Nephritic</hi> Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture: Which yet would curdle Milk, and turn it to a kind of Poſſet; and, on the contrary, I found that ſome <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Spaw</hi> Water would not curdle Milk, &amp; yet would readily deprive the newly mention'd Tincture of its ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleous colour; which yet I did not find that ſome of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruginous Waters were, at leaſt when brought me to <hi>London,</hi> able to do. 3. The predominancy of an Alcaly, in the Salt of a Mineral Water, may be probably diſcover'd by ſuch waies as theſe. <hi>By</hi> the Lixiviate Taſt, Smell, or both; the former of which may be obſerv'd in the true Niter of the Ancients, (which I have had brought me from <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and a neighbouring Country, whoſe name I do not now remember:) <hi>By</hi> the turning of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup of violets green: <hi>By</hi> the Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48332:53"/>
of ſolution of ſublimate made in Spring-Water: <hi>By</hi> an efferveſcence or conflict with ſome potent Acid, as <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> or well dephlegm'd Sp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Salt: <hi>By</hi> heightning the red Tincture of Logwood or Brazil, drawn with common Water, to which, may be added a Nicer way or two that I have elſewhere mention'd. But I propoſe theſe waies but as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing rational, upon the ſcore of my having ſucceſsfully try'd them with other Saline Bodies that were Alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſate. For as to thoſe Mineral Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I have had occaſion to examine, I do not remember I have yet met with any, wherein an Alcaly was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant. 4. But perhaps farther Inquiry will diſcover to others here in <hi>England,</hi> what I have not yet met with: And I doubt not but that there are, in divers places of the Earth, Salts of an Alcaliſate nature. And I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume that, if the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were any thing curious of ſuch things, they would find, among their Springs or Wells, divers Waters impregnated
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48332:54"/>
with them. For I found by Tryals, purpoſely made upon <hi>Latron,</hi> as ſome knowing men call the true Egyptian Niter, preſented me by an inquiſitive Ambaſſador who came out of the Eaſt, that the native Salt exhibited di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the ſame <hi>Phaenomena</hi> that other factitious Alcali's do. And ſome Salt, afforded by the famous Waters of <hi>Bourbon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> being brought me thence, with a deſire that I would examine it, I found it to be evidently Alcaliſate; inſomuch that it would make a conflict with Acids, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently turn Syrup of violets green. 5. If we ſuſpect Vitriol to be much predominant in the Saline part of a Mineral Water, we may endeavour to diſcover it by ſuch wayes as theſe. <hi>By</hi> its blackning a Solution of Galls: <hi>By</hi> its vomitive operation upon the Drinkers, thô this may ſometimes be an uncertain way eſpecially becauſe an inviſible permixture of Arſenic, or or perhaps Arſenical Fumes, may give the Water they impregnate an Emetic Quality: <hi>By</hi> putting Alcali's
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48332:54"/>
to a ſtrong ſolution of the ſuppos'd Vitriol, and obſerving whether it will afford a yellow or yellowiſh Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, if Salt of Tartar or Spirit of Urine be dropt into it. By taking notice, whether a Sulphureous Spirit, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch an one as I formerly told I had made thô not here deſcrib'd, will make a blackiſh or a very dark colour with it, as I firſt gueſs'd, and then found it would do with ſeveral vitriolate Liquors, and even with one, to make which we had diſſolv'd but one grain of a Natural Vitriolate ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in above four or five thouſand times its weight of Syrup or Water. But in the parts about <hi>London</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member not that, in any of the Waters I have made Tryals on, I have found Vitriol to be predominant, or to be ſo much as a manifeſt Ingredient: Which ſeem'd to me the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, becauſe ſeveral parts about this City are not deſtitute of Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, the Parents or Wombs of Vitriol. Since the writing of theſe Papers, being caſually viſited by a diſcerning
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48332:55"/>
Stranger, who had a particular occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to take notice of the Reſidences of many of the Mineral Waters of <hi>France,</hi> his native Country; he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd me that he never met with any that was manifeſtly Vitriolate; and he ſeem'd to be of opinion, that no Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolate Spring had yet been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd, among the many Mineral ones that are known to be in that Country. 7. Since we ſo rarely meet with either manifeſtly Acid, or evidently Alcaliſate, Salts in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters, it may deſerve a ſerious Inquiry, what other Salts they may be impregnated with; and eſpecially from what Salts, the Purgative ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, that is found to belong to many of them, as <hi>Epſom, Barnet, Acton, &amp;c.</hi> do's proceed? Common Salt indeed, as is already noted, I have found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of in the <hi>German Spaw</hi> Water; and in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mineral Waters, I had occaſion to try, not one that I remember excepted. But I did not find that common Salt was ſo copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in any of them, as to diſcloſe it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48332:55"/>
ſelf by Chryſtallizing in Cubical grains. And the way, I made uſe of, to examine the Saltneſs of the Water without Cryſtallization, is not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain in all ſorts of them. And becauſe I had not ſtore enough of theſe Liquors, to evaporate them in large quantities, thô I could not diſcern, in the clear Salts they afforded, either Vitriol, or Salt Peter, or Allom, or even common Salt, by their peculiar and genuine Figures; yet I dare not confidently ſay, that none of our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Mineral Springs abounds with any of thoſe Salts. But as far as I can gueſs, by the Tryals that I have hitherto had opportunity to make, I am apt to think that the Salt, that is found in our Purgative Waters, and and in ſome of them copiouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, dos not belong to any one known ſort of Salts, but is either of a ſort, for which as for many other Minerals, we have yet no name: or, which ſeems more probable, is a Salt of a compounded Nature, made up by the coalitions of ſome or all of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48332:56"/>
the Salts above mention'd, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of ſome other, as yet nameleſs, Subterraneal Salt that the Spring inſſolves in its paſſage, That two Bodies, which are neither of them Cathartic, may, by a change of Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wrought in one another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a third Body, that is briskly purgative, I have ſhewn in another Paper. Beſides having formerly had occaſion, in order to the reſolution of a certain doubt I had entertain'd, to burn Salt of Tartar with about a double weight of common Sulphur, I thence obtain'd, as I expected, a Neutral Salt, that had peculiar Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities differing from thoſe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies imploy'd to make it up: And talking of this Salt with an ingenious Empyrick, he told me it had a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity I had not mention'd, and that a very uſeful one, ſince in the doſe of half a dram, or in ſome Bodies, being taken in Wine or Broth, it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably, and yet gently and without gripings, purge. And without the help of Salt of Tartar have ſometimes
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48332:56"/>
made out of common Sulphur, a Chryſtalline Salt of a ſomewhat Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolate Taſt, the like to which might poſſibly be made under ground, where there are Subterraneal fires, tho per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not obſerved nor ſuſpected, ſince we made this Salt without adding any thing to the Sulphur, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the help of Fire and common Water. And I remember that a great <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> ſeveral years ago, brought me, in order to an <hi>Examen</hi> he deſir'd I ſhould make of it, a certain Salt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded by a Spring in or near his land, which I remember was in the Weſt of <hi>England,</hi> tho I have forgot the name of the County: Which Salt no Body knew what to make of, but I quickly told him, I took it to be of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Sal mirabile Glauberi,</hi> and predicted that in ſuch Tryals it would afford ſuch and ſuch <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> which accordingly came to paſs. And I thought that, if opportunity had not been wanting this Salt would have appear'd Purgative, as ſome factitious Salts that reſemble it in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48332:57"/>
tranſparency, colourleſneſs, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure have been obſerv'd to be.</p>

               <p>1. 'Tis ſurprizing to obſerve, how great an inequality one may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times meet with in the proportion that the ſame quantity, of two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mineral Waters, bear to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put Mortuum</hi> they reſpectively afford: For a pound, for inſtance, of one may, after evaporation, leave behind it perhaps more drams of dry ſubſtance, than a pound of the other will leave behind it grains. But becauſe I have no notes of the conſiderableſt Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind, that came to my knowledge, I ſhall add only by and by the Product of a more recent Tryal. 2. As far as I have hitherto obſerv'd, thoſe <hi>Ferruginous Waters,</hi> that are not heavier than common Water, and in moſt Drinkers prove but diuretick, afford but very little <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> or dry Subſtance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the total Evaporation of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48332:57"/>
whereas Mineral Waters, that are purging and manifeſtly more ponderous <hi>in Specie</hi> than common Water, leave, upon Evaporation, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantity of reſidence, thô ſome far leſs than others. 3. At once to explain, and partly prove, what I have been ſaying, I ſhall here recite that, from a pound of <hi>Barnet</hi> VVater (which is known to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative) ſlowly evaporated, we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Dram of VVhite Powder. But from the like quantity of <hi>Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> VVater, we obtain'd but about one grain of <hi>Caput Mortuum:</hi> And, if I miſremember not, we had but about a grain and a half from 25. Ounces of the <hi>German Spaw</hi> Water. 4. It may ſeem ſcarce credible to many, that ſo ſmall a quantity of matter, of which perhaps not one half is Saline, or Metalline, (the reſt being tereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial,) ſhould impart a manifeſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to ſo great a proportion of VVa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But this difficulty did not much trouble me, who have purpoſely made divers Experiments, to diſcover how
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48332:58"/>
ſmall a proportion of Mineral matter may ſuffice, when diſſolv'd, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate common VVater. I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber I took one grain of Iron ſtone, caſually found near the Springs at <hi>Iſlington,</hi> (from which Mineral 'tis probable thoſe VVaters derive their vertue,) this being open'd by the fire, and diſſolv'd as far as it would be in a little Spirit of Salt, we let fall a drop or two of the yellowiſh ſolution into a great proportion of Infuſion of Galls, to which it preſently gave a deeper colour than <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Water, or even the <hi>German Spaw</hi> VVater, was wont to give here at <hi>London,</hi> with the Powder of Galls: So that we gueſs'd that, if we had then had at hand a competent quantity of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, the remaining part of the Martial Solution would have been able to colour ten times a greater quantity of the Infuſion, than our Tryal was made upon. This will be eaſily believ'd by him, that ſhall conſider an Experiment, we afterwards made to the ſame purpoſe,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48332:58"/>
which was this, VVe diſſolv'd a half grain of a good Marcaſite, taken up not far from <hi>London,</hi> in a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Spirit of Niter, (which for a certain Reaſon I made choice of, thô other Acid <hi>Menſtruums,</hi> as <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortis,</hi> and Spirit of Salt would have diſſolved the Mineral.) This ſmall ſolution we put into a pound of pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty high Tincture of Galls, made by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them in common Water, and finding, as we expected, that this mixture, grew very dark, we fill'd a Vial with it, and emptying that Vial into a larger Glaſs, we fill'd the ſame Vial three times with common Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to dilute it; notwithſtanding which this new mixture, being put into one of our uſual Glaſſes, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a colour much deeper than that which the Water of <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> or the <hi>German Spaw,</hi> had formerly given with the Powder of Galls: So that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, if another Vial of common Water had been added, it would yet have afforded a purple colour, if not a dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; ſo that one part of diſſolv'd Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſite
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48332:59"/>
communicated a Tincture to (61440) ſixty one thouſand four hundred and forty parts of Infuſion of Galls. And that which makes this Experiment more conſiderable is, that this ſmall quantity of Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite was not it ſelf all Martial or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline: For from our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Marca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites, as well as others, I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a pretty quantity of Sulphur like common Sulphur; beſides that they afford a not deſpicable quantity of Terreſtrial Subſtance, about whoſe nature I have not yet ſatisfy'd my ſelf. 5. I ſhall now add this reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that, ſince the Marcaſite impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſo much Water with its corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Parts, if I may ſo call them, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by bare diſſolution, it ſeems highly probable, <hi>that</hi> the ſame quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Liquor may be impregnated by a far leſs quantity of Mineral mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, attenuated into a kind of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſlate, by being rais'd in the form of Fumes or exhalations; and <hi>that</hi> imperfect or embryonated Iron may be ſo, will ſcarce be deny'd by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48332:59"/>
them that conſider the way that I have, in another Paper, deliver'd to make Iron manifeſtly emit copious Fumes, without the help of external Fire. And if it be with ſome ſuch Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous and volatile Exhalations, that a Mineral Water, as that of <hi>Tunbridge</hi> or of <hi>Iſlington,</hi> is impregnated, 'tis not hard to conceive that they may eaſily loſe their chief vertue, by the avolation of moſt or many of their fugitive Parts, upon their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to a diſtance from the Spring head. And to make it probable, that vitriolate Corpuſcles may be made to aſcend, without loſing their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I ſhall here mention an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I devis'd to give ſome light in this matter. I had often found by Tryal, that a Spirit, richly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with volatiliz'd Sulphur, would with vitriol, whether in the form of a powder or a ſolution, produce in a trice a very dark or blackiſh colour; And gueſſing that, in Mercury turn'd by the addition of Salt and Vitriol into corroſive ſublimate, many of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolate
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48332:60"/>
Corpuſcles might aſcend with the Mercurial ones, I took ſuch a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Sulphureous Tincture as I have been mentioning, (which for this purpoſe ought to be deep,) and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dropt it upon good Sublimate, I found it turn preſently of a very o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacous colour. To ſhow alſo that, to make a great dilatation or diſperſion of the Martial Corpuſcles of an Ore or Mineral, there needs no Spirit of Salt, or the like diſtill'd <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> I procur'd from a copperas-work, (or place where vitriol is made by art,) ſome of the Liquor they imploy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they caſt in Iron, that being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded by it, it may increaſe the weight, and give ſolidity and ſome other Qualities to the deſigned Vitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ol. Now <hi>thó</hi> this Liquor be made, without any Chymical <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> barely by Rain or Snow-Water, that impregnates it ſelf with Saline or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talline Particles in its paſſage through Beds of Marcaſites, that lye expos'd to the Sun and Air; <hi>yet</hi> in this Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch numbers of Martial Corpuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48332:60"/>
are diſpers'd that, having ſhaken four drops of it into 12 Ounces and a half of common Water, this Liquor, as I expected, was thereby ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnated, that with powder of Galls it preſently produc'd as deep a colour as good <hi>Tunbridge</hi> Water would have done. So that, ſuppoſing a drop of this Liquor to weigh about a grain, (as by ſome Tryals purpoſely made we found it to do,) it appears that one part of the vitriolate Water was able manifeſtly to impregnate 1500 Parts of common water. And yet of theſe 4 drops or Grains of Vitriolate Liquor, a conſiderable part may very probably be concluded, from the way of its production, to have been Rain Water, as will eaſily be granted when I ſhall have added, that, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this ſuppoſition or conjecture, we ſlowly evaporated ſome Ounces of the Vitriolate Liquor, and found that the remaining dry Subſtance did not fully amount to the 4th part of the weight of the whole. At which rate 'twas eaſy to conclude, that one
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48332:61"/>
grain of Vitriolate ſubſtance would have been ſound capable of ſo impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating ſix thouſand times its weight of common Water, as to make it ſit to produce with Galls a purple tincture. We afterwards found, upon Tryal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely and warily made, that the experiment will hold, thô the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Water, to the grain of tinging ſubſtance, ſhould exceed that lately mention'd, by the weight of ſome hundreds of grains.</p>

               <p>'TIs known, that the drinking of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruginous Waters, ſuch as thoſe of the <hi>German-Spaw</hi> and our <hi>Tunbridge,</hi> is uſually preſcrib'd for many Weeks, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time it often enough happens, that the Fall of Rains makes men doubt whether the Mineral Water be not ſo much diluted, as to be ſpoil'd in its Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Capacity. And indeed I have more than once obſerv'd, that ſome ſuch Martial Waters, after conſiderable Rains loſt their Power of producing the wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Colour with Galls. And therefore it may in ſome caſes be of good uſe, to be aſſiſted to Conjecture, whether or no the Rain have made the Mineral Water un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for Drinking. In order to this I ſhall take notice, that uſually a ſmall Rain does little or no harm to the Medicinal Spring. And ſometimes even a moderate Rain, eſpecially after a long Drought, may, inſtead of weakning it, increaſe its vertue, by waſhing down into its Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel ſome Salts, that during the dry wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were concreted in the Pores of the Ground, and perhaps alſo by heightning the Water in the Channel, ſo as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb facs="tcp:48332:67"/>
ſome Salts concreted there, which it could not reach before. But if the Rain have long continu'd, the Eſtimate may beſt be made, partly by the greater or leſſer depth of the Spring beneath the ſurface of the Ground, and partly and indeed chiefly, by the peculiar nature or ſtrength of the Mineral Water. For ſome Springs are much more copiouſly impregnated than others, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will bear a greater dilution by Rain-Water, of which I ſhall give you this notable Inſtance. That, whereas I found (as I lately noted) that more than one of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Martial Springs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe near <hi>London,</hi> were too much weakned by the Water that Rained into them; I had the Curioſity to try, how much of that kind of Liquor, ſome <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Spaw-Water,</hi> that came to me to <hi>London</hi> very well conditioned, would bear. In purſuit of which deſign I warily made ſome Tryals, which ſhowed, (what probably will be thought ſtrange, that when the Mineral Water was diluted with no leſs than thrice its Weight of Rain-Water, it yet retained ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to produce with newly powdered Galls, a Purpliſh colour.</p>
