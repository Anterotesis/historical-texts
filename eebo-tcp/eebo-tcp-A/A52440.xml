            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THo I have not profeſſedly undertaken in the Two following Treatiſes to give an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and full Account of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, but only ſo far as I have occaſion to do it in dealing with my Adverſary, yet (if my Judgment may be taken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my own Work,) I think that even this <hi>Occaſional Account</hi> that occurs up and down in theſe Papers, may be ſo conſiderable as to give them a fair Right to the Title of <hi>Treatiſes concerning
<pb facs="tcp:62599:3"/>
the Divine Light.</hi> And tho the direct and profeſſed buſineſs of the former of theſe Treatiſes be only a Private and Perſonal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement between me and my Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, yet that it has been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of my delivering many great and conſiderable things, as well Abſolutely as Relatively conſider'd, and ſuch as if read carefully and judiciouſly, and with a thoroughly <hi>Awaken'd</hi> Attention, may contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute very much to the clearing of many uſeful Truths, and to the Improvement of the Reader in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral curious Points of Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>An</hi> Anſwer <hi>to a Letter of a Learned Quaker, which he calls,</hi> A juſt Reprehenſion to <hi>John Norris</hi> of <hi>Newton St. Loe,</hi> for his unjuſt Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the Quakers, in his Book Entituled, <hi>Reflections upon the Conduct of Human Life,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <byline>By the Author of thoſe Reflections.</byline>
            <p>THO I do not think it any great piece of Ignorance or Defect of Learning, not to be rightly acquainted with the Quaker's Principles, which if I knew them never ſo well, would add but little either to my Knowledge, or to my Opinion of it; yet I am withal ſo ſenſible of that Right, which even the meaneſt Perſons
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62599:4"/>
and Parties have to Juſtice and Fair Dealing, that I think I ſhould not be able to juſtifie my <hi>miſrepreſenting</hi> thoſe Principles, of which I might be very excuſably <hi>Ignorant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſince this is the thing laid to my Charge, and that with a great deal of Paſſion and angry Reſentment, not to ſay Rudeneſs and Incivility, I think I may be allow'd to be ſo far concerned at the <hi>Indictment,</hi> as to endeavour to acquit my ſelf of it; not ſo much for the Honour of my <hi>Judgment</hi> (which I do not conceive at preſent to lie much at ſtake) as for the Juſtification of my <hi>Sincerity:</hi> Which tho I ſo peculiarly value, that I might be allowed to be a little warm in the Vindication of it, eſpecially coming after ſuch a provoking and affrouting Adverſary, yet I hope I ſhall be able ſo to temper my Spirit and govern my Pen, that the <hi>Defence</hi> ſhall not be near ſo paſſionate as the <hi>Charge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confeſs indeed, I did not expect any great Civility of Addreſs from a Man of this ſullen Tribe, whoſe viſible Mark and Character is <hi>Ruſticity,</hi> and who are generally at as great Defiance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62599:4"/>
with all Courtlineſs of <hi>Style,</hi> as of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</hi> But yet I thought that the <hi>Gentleman</hi> and the <hi>Scholar</hi> (for ſuch it ſeems is the Quality of my Adverſary) might ſo far ballance and over-rule the <hi>Quaker,</hi> as to contain him within the Limits of Ordinary Decency, and keep him on this ſide Rudeneſs and Scurrili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To be blunt and down-right is one thing, but to be rude and abuſive is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. And however I might expect the former from him, and excuſe in him as a <hi>Quaker,</hi> yet of the latter I thought he would not be guilty as a <hi>Gentleman.</hi> Indeed the leaſt that I could expect from a Perſon of Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> his Education and Quality, was, that he would not be <hi>uncivil,</hi> eſpecially in his firſt Onſet, and writing to a Perſon that was a Stranger to him; and who, tho he does not look upon himſelf to be ſo great as to be above Contradiction, may yet juſtly think himſelf conſiderable enough to expect and deſerve fair and civil Language. But in ſtead of this he falls foul upon me, after ſuch a rude, violent and paſſionate manner, as is below the Breeding even of a <hi>Water-man,</hi> and ſuch as a Man of any Temper would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to be guilty of, even in the ſudden Heats of common Diſcourſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62599:5"/>
Which may tempt ſome unlucky Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to imagin, that he has exchang'd his <hi>Gold</hi> quaking Fit for an <hi>Hot</hi> one, and that the <hi>Light</hi> within is turn'd into a <hi>Flame.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot in Juſtice deny, but that for a Man of his Way, my Adverſary is pretty conſiderable for his Senſe and Learning, (notwithſtanding that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to repreſent me as a Dunce and Blockhead as well as a Knave) and I believe he would have ſhewn more of each, and with better Advantage, if the Violence of his Paſſion had not diſturb'd the Clearneſs and Order of his Thoughts, and put him often out of his Guard. For Paſſion is the great Contrariety to Reaſon, and will draw a Cloud over the brighteſt Mind. The quiet and ſedate Soul is moſt fit for the Contemplation of Truth, as the calmeſt Weather is commonly the moſt ſerene. If <hi>Love</hi> be blind, <hi>Anger</hi> I'm ſure is much more ſo; and there is this remarkable difference between the Wars of the <hi>Pen</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Sword,</hi> that tho the Soldier may fight to moſt Advantage in <hi>Hot</hi> Blood, the Diſputant will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beſt in <hi>Cold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62599:5"/>
But leſt I ſhould appear guilty of a falſe Charge in this reſpect, as he ſays I am in ſome others, and be thought to miſrepreſent the <hi>Temper</hi> and Behaviour of my Adverſary, as he ſays I do his <hi>Principles,</hi> I think it neceſſary for my own Security, to give the Reader ſome Account of the Paſſion, Rudeneſs and Abuſiveneſs of this Aggreſſor, before I proceed to conſider the Argument of his Paper.</p>
            <p>And here (to paſs by the Roughneſs and the Magiſterial Ayre of the Title Page, where at firſt Daſh he aſſumes the Office of a Cenſor, and undertakes to <hi>Reprehend,</hi> taxing me with no leſs than Falſe <hi>Repreſentation, Confuſion</hi> and <hi>Self-Contradiction,</hi> which I think might be more properly left to the Judgment of the Reader, or bring up the Arrear, than be placed in the Front of the Book) I appeal for the Truth of this Charge to the following Paſſages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When firſt</hi> (ſays he, <hi>pag. 3.) I peruſed thy Reflections upon the Conduct of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Life, &amp;c. I was, and ſtill am pleaſed with all that tends to the Propagation of Original and Neceſſary Truth, but rejoyce
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62599:6"/>
where I find it ſpring from an upright Mind, pure Intention,</hi> and <hi>clean Veſſel.</hi> What Reaſon has he to queſtion or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge the Uprightneſs of my Mind, or the Purity of my Intention, or the Cleanneſs of my Veſſel? Either this is very impertinently, or very uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuggeſted. Either he means no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by it, or he means ill. And that he does ſo, he has taken Care to ſatisfie the Reader, by explaining himſelf more fully in the very next Words, <hi>For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> (ſays he) <hi>undertakes to reprehend the Intelligible Conduct of Human Life, ought firſt to purge himſelf from the Irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his Moral Conduct, which does Cloud and darken his Underſtanding.</hi> What a ſcurvy malicious Inſinuation is this! For tho the Words abſtractly conſider'd be a Propoſition of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Truth, and may bear an innocent and inoffenſive Senſe, yet conſider'd with their <hi>Occaſion,</hi> and with their <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication</hi> to me, if they ſignifie any thing they muſt ſignifie ill; there muſt be either an intolerable Impertinence in them, or a great deal of Malice and Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. For does he not by this plainly inſinuate to the World that I am an ill Man, and that there are ſuch Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities in my <hi>Moral</hi> Conduct as make
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62599:6"/>
me unfit to reflect upon the <hi>Intellectual</hi> Conduct of Human Life? And would not any one that knew nothing of me any otherwiſe than by this Paper of his, and were to take his Meaſure of me from hence, be tempted to conclude, that I was a Man of a looſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch'd Converſation? Now if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Character, I have nothing to complain of; but if I do not, (and I appeal even to Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> himſelf, nay, even to the World, whether I do or no) then this is a very uncharitable and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unchriſtian Inſinuation.</p>
            <p>And yet as bad as it is, he has more of the ſame; and that notwithſtanding what he ſays of himſelf in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph immediately following, that he is <hi>far from a Spirit of Detraction.</hi> Which Paſſage I think ſhould either have been left out, or ſet at a greater diſtance from the foregoing one, wherein, there ſeems to be ſo ſtrong a Savour of that Spirit. As there does in what follows, when <hi>(p.</hi> 4.) He charges me with deſpiſing the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God through the Meanneſs of the Inſtruments: Applying to me that of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> chap. 4. <hi>v. 8. He therefore that deſpiſeth, deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not Man but God, who hath alſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62599:7"/>
given unto us his Holy Spirit.</hi> Which Allegation I ſhall allow to be pertinent, when he has proved thoſe <hi>Inſtruments</hi> he talks of to be equally inſpired with the Apoſtles: But till then he muſt give me leave to think and call it a Blaſphemous piece of Arrogance. For it can be no leſs to make Deſpiſing the Quakers the ſame with deſpiſing God, unleſs it be proved that the Quakers are Divinely inſpired. When I ſee this done, I ſhall allow of the Expreſſion: In the mean while I muſt beg Mr. <hi>Vick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> not to be angry, if I tell him that it puts me in mind of a Story I have heard of a Quaker in <hi>Oxford,</hi> who when ſome of the young Scholars for ſome Rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and Diſturbances he had been guilty of in the College, had brought him to the Pump to pump him, while he was doing his Penance, impudently cried out, <hi>Pump on, Pump on, you Pump not me, but the Lord.</hi> I will not ſay Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> his Expreſſion is exactly of a piece with this, but there is ſo much Reſemblance between them, that aſſoon as I read one, I could not chuſe but think of t'other.</p>
            <p>But he goes on in his Cenſorious and Uncharitable Reflections; for after he
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62599:7"/>
had quoted <hi>(Page 6.)</hi> that Paſſage out of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> chap. 1. v. 4. <hi>Into a malicious Soul Wiſdom will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, nor dwell in the Body that is ſubject to Sin. For the Holy Spirit of Diſcipline will fly Deceit, and remove from Thoughts that are without Underſtanding, and will not abide when Unrighteouſneſs cometh in. For Wiſdom is a loving Spirit, and will not acquit a Blaſphemer of his Words; for God is the Witneſs of his Reins, and a true Beholder of his Heart, and an Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Tongue. Therefore he that ſpeaketh unrighteous things can't be hid, neither ſhall Vengeance when it puniſhes paſs by him.</hi> All which in the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of his Civility and Charity he has thought fit to apply to me: He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to add, <hi>Now ſeeing theſe Sayings are true and righteous, and that 'tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to profeſs this Doctrin of the Divine Word, Light, Grace, Spirit of Wiſdom and Truth, and the teachings of it, and yet not poſſeſs it, nor be learn'd of it, nor led by it, but whilſt preaching of it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to be a Caſt-a-way: I adviſe thee to conſider in what Ground and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thou yet ſtandeſt and liveſt in, and what Spirit lives and rules in thee.</hi> I thank him for his Advice, but not for that ſpiteful and ſtrangely cenſorious
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62599:8"/>
Inſinuation that goes along with it, which amounts to no leſs, than that I am one of thoſe malicious Souls into which Wiſdom will not enter; that I am deceitful, without Underſtanding, unrighteous, and a Blaſphemer: That tho I profeſs the Doctrin of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, yet I do not poſſeſs it, nor am led by it, but while I preach it to others, am my ſelf a Caſt-away; which I think is as bad as one Man can well ſay of another, and yet 'tis what he plainly inſinuates, if there be any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection or Pertinence in what he ſays.</p>
            <p>But fearing he had not been yet plain enough, and leſt the too candid Reader ſhould miſs his Meaning, he proceeds, <hi>Hath not Unrighteouſneſs entred in through Self-love and Eſteem, which blinds the Eye, and cauſes the Tongue to ſpeak Unrighteous things?</hi> Here he charges me with Unrighteouſneſs, Ambition and Self-love; which laſt he is pleaſed to beighten to ſuch an extravagant pitch, as to make me an Idolater, and that of the worſt ſort, as making my ſelf to be my God. For ſays he, <hi>Is not Self exalted to ſit in the Temple of God, as God in thee?</hi> What a Flight of Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoriouſneſs
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62599:8"/>
and Uncharity is this! For beſides the Heinouſneſs of the Charge, (it being as bad as can be ſaid of the Devil himſelf, that he makes Self his God, there being nothing ſo oppoſite to Charity which refers all to God, as Self-love, which refers all to its ſelf) I ſay, beſides the Heinouſneſs of the Charge, 'tis alſo of ſuch a particular Nature, as were I indeed guilty of it, it would be impoſſible for any Man, much more for Mr. <hi>Vickris,</hi> who is a meer Stranger to me, without a Divine Revelation ever to know. For Self-love is a Vice of the Heart, and one of the moſt latent and retired of all the Vices that are lodged there, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently obnoxious to his Judgment only who is a Diſcerner of the Heart, to whom all Hearts be open, all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires known, and from whom no Secret is hid. God alone can tell how far <hi>Self</hi> is exalted either in me, or in any Man elſe: And therefore Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> had much better have left me to His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than to ſit in Judgment upon me himſelf, and paſs ſo ſevere a Sentence in a Cauſe that does not, cannot fall within his Cognizance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:62599:9"/>
Nor is he ſatisfy'd with repreſenting me as an ill <hi>Man,</hi> but he muſt alſo find fault with me for being a <hi>Scholar. Art thou not decking thy ſelf with thy cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Wiſdom,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>which is the forbidden Fruit, and will prove Folly in the end?</hi> By which I ſuppoſe he muſt mean Philoſophy, and the Study of Arts and Sciences, which he will needs have to be corrupt Wiſdom, and the Forbidden Fruit. Now tho I not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grant, but in a Treatiſe purpoſely written upon this Subject, have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly contended, and if I miſtake not, fully demonſtrated, that conſidering the preſent State of Man, the Study of Learning and Knowledg is no farther allowable, than as 'tis conducive to the moralizing of his Life, and that all Proſecution of it beyond or beſide this End, is an immoderate and blameable Curioſity; yet I hope as far as it is apt to ſerve the Intereſt of a good Life, there is no reaſon to diſallow or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it. Tho it be not to be allow'd any farther, yet I think it may and muſt be allow'd ſo far. And herein I think I ſtate the meaſure of proſecuting Learning and Knowledge in a due <hi>mean,</hi> between the Extremes of thoſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inquiſitive
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62599:9"/>
Spirits on the one hand, who ſet no Limits to their Curioſity, and thoſe narrow and contracted ones on the other who confine it too ſtraitly, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning all Human Learning in groſs, under the reproachful Appellations of <hi>Carnal Reaſon, Corrupt Wiſdom, Vain Philoſophy,</hi> and the like; under which Characters I think it ought not to be repreſented, as far as it is apt to ſerve and miniſter to the Intereſt of Religion and a good Life. And that it may be ſerviceable to that purpoſe, I might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to ſhew, but that the excellent Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> has ſaved me the trouble in a late Treatiſe upon this very Subject, call'd, <hi>The Chriſtian Virtuoſo.</hi> I cannot therefore but wonder what ſhould make Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> (who is himſelf a Scholar) thus condemn all Human Learning in groſs, under the Name of <hi>Corrupt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and blame me for <hi>decking</hi> my ſelf with it, eſpecially conſidering that a little after <hi>(Page</hi> 10) he ſuppoſes the Divine Light to aſſiſt the Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the Soul in the Attainment of Arts and Sciences: Why then does he tell me of decking my ſelf with my Corrupt Wiſdom? What, does the Divine Light aſſiſt the Natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Soul in the Attainment of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62599:10"/>
Corrupt Wiſdom, and ſuch as will prove Folly in the end? Can that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be corrupt, which is taught us by the Aſſiſtance of the Divine Light? Or is that Light to be eſteem'd Divine, whoſe Inſtructions are ſo corrupt? How are theſe things conſiſtent, unleſs Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> will be underſtood not of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning Human Learning in general as Corrupt, but only that which is the Object of my particular Study; as if my Studies were not directed to the ends of a good Life, which would be as great a <hi>Genſure,</hi> as the other is a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> So that in ſhort, he is neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> Either he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns Human Learning in groſs, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, and then he <hi>contradicts himſelf,</hi> in making the Divine Light aſſiſtant to it; or he condemns the particular matter of my Study as corrupt, and then he <hi>Cenſures me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As he does again moſt unpardonably, <hi>(Page</hi> 7.) telling me, that I <hi>wilfully blaſt the Fame of God's Name and Work in the Earth, in and by his People, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they agree not with Man's Ways and Conceited wiſe Notions.</hi> Which is a Charge next to that of committing the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. For does
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62599:10"/>
Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> conſider what it is wilfully to blaſt the Fame of God's Name and Work? Or does he conſider how inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted a Man had need be with another Man's <hi>Interiour,</hi> to be able to pronounce what degrees of <hi>Wilfulneſs</hi> there are in his <hi>Overt Acts?</hi> Does he well conſider this? The beſt Apology I can make for him, is to ſay, that he does not. And yet as if he had ſaid nothing amiſs, but were ſecure of the Truth of his Charge, he wipes his Mouth, and very gravely applies to me two of the moſt ſevere Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he could pick out in all the Bible, namely, the 12th <hi>Verſe</hi> of the 2d of <hi>Peter</hi> the 2d, and the 10th <hi>Verſe</hi> of the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Jude,</hi> which tho through a guilty Modeſty he would not ſpeak out, I ſhall. The Words are, <hi>But theſe, as natural Brute Beaſts, made to be taken and deſtroy'd, ſpeak evil of the things that they underſtand not, and ſhall utterly periſh in their own Corruption.</hi> And again, <hi>But theſe ſpeak evil of thoſe things which they know not; but what they know naturally as Brute Beaſts, in thoſe things they corrupt themſelves.</hi> Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Word very civilly, and very charitably applied: But there are ſome Men, who tho they revile thoſe they
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62599:11"/>
diſaffect never ſo bitterly, ſo it be done with the Solemnity of a Text, and in Scripture Phraſe, think they charge in <hi>Armour,</hi> and have a Warrant for their moſt abuſive Scurrility. And ſo having pour'd out the Dregs of his Venom, he concludes this Reprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-Part, having (as he words it) <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged</hi> himſelf to me on the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd occaſion. I think he might very properly ſay, <hi>He has diſcharged himſelf,</hi> having thrown up ſuch a deal of Choler and other Filth. Indeed (Poor Man) his Stomach was very Foul, and 'twas high time to have it clear'd. And yet 'tis not all up yet; he has not yet ſo fully <hi>diſcharg'd</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that we find him <hi>Reaching</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain toward the End of the Book. For after he had paſs'd a diſingenuos Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon my Reaſon and Conſcience, <note place="margin">Page 13.</note> in wiſhing they were both reform'd, (which implies, that at preſent they are both very corrupt) and after he had charg'd me with no leſs than <hi>Evil Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption</hi> and <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> againſt ſome that <note place="margin">Page 15.</note> dwell in Heaven, and <hi>Prophaneneſs</hi> into the Bargain, in the Extravagance of his Zeal and Paſſion he cries out, <hi>What art thou, O Man, that boaſteſt thy ſelf? Art thou wiſer than thy Maker?</hi> Threatning
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62599:11"/>
me withal in the Style, and with the Authority of a Prophet, that God ſhall confound my Wiſdom, and bring to naught my Underſtanding wherein it is exalted; for he hath determin'd to ſtain the Pride of all Fleſh, the Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it: Taking for granted that my Underſtanding is exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond its due Limits, and that I abound with Pride. Which indeed are all of them fine Cenſures, conſidering the illneſs of the things ſuggeſted, and the little Knowledg Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> has of me; upon whom he is pleaſed to beſtow one ſtroke of Civility more at parting, telling me, <hi>This is written for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Truth's Teſtimony from the Rubbiſh thou haſt caſt thereon.</hi> What a rude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>educated Pen does this Gentleman write with! Whether it be his Anger, or his ill Nature, or his Perſwaſion, that ſo uncivilizes him, I will not ſtay to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; but upon the whole matter, I think he has given me no ſmall occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuſpect that this was written, not ſo much for the <hi>Clearing of Truth,</hi> as for the clearing, that is, the <hi>diſcharging</hi> himſelf, and the ridding his Stomach of an uneaſie Load, which now he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd of, I hope he will ſleep in quiet.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62599:12"/>
And thus having given the World a View of ſome of the Rudeneſſes of this Author, (for in mercy to the Reader as well as to my Adverſary, I have not ſet down all) I now dare appeal to the ſame Judge, whether ſuch foul reflecting Expreſſions as theſe become either the Breeding of a Gentleman, or the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a Chriſtian, or the Pretenſions of a Quaker. I ſay, the Pretenſions of a <hi>Quaker;</hi> for tho the Quakers do not pretend to the External Civilities either of Language or of Behaviour, but rather ſeem to diſtinguiſh themſelves by an oppoſite Ruſticity in each; yet 'tis well known that they make high Pretenſions to <hi>Charity,</hi> particularly to that moſt Chriſtian part of it that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in <hi>Meekneſs</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi> in Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Long-ſuffering, in a quiet and paſſive temper of Spirit. To theſe (as 'tis well known) their Pretenſions run ſo high, as to offer to turn the other Cheek to the Smiter; nay, even to ſcruple the Lawfulneſs of <hi>War,</hi> which it ſeems is too rough a thing for ſuch calm inoffenſive Creatures as they, all made up of Love and Sweetneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:62599:12"/>
But now let any but a Quaker judg how well Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> has maintain'd this Character. Had I been never ſo groſs in miſrepreſenting the Quakers Principle, I could not have deſerv'd ſuch a Barbarous Treatment from him; or if I had, yet it would not have been conſiſtent with his ſo highly Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Pretenſions to give it me. No, he ſhould have ſuffer'd rather, and have return'd Good for Evil. At leaſt he ſhould have had ſo much regard to their ſo greatly pretended Principle of <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> as not to ſuffer himſelf to run into ſuch Intemperances of Paſſion and Language, as he appears now to be guilty of. Is this the Charity, is this the Meekneſs of a Quaker? If it be, then <hi>Sit Anima mea,</hi> Let my Soul be with the Philoſophers, ſhall I ſay? Or with the <hi>Men of the World;</hi> or indeed with any Men, rather than with ſuch a bitter foul-mouth'd Sect as this. What the Temper of this Gentleman is in his Converſation I know not, but if he governs his Tongue no better than he does his Pen, (and 'tis ſtrange if he ſhould) I think 'twould be a Bleſſing both to himſelf and others, if he were <hi>Speechleſs.</hi> For the Language of the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62599:13"/>
latter is ſo very foul, that I believe the Arch-Angel in his Diſpute with the Devil about the Body of <hi>Moſes,</hi> did not only uſe better to him, (which would be but a ſmall matter) but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd better from him. I'm ſure he could not well receive worſe. And now we are upon Scripture-Alluſion, I ſhall beg leave to offer one Text to Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> his Conſideration, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital to thoſe many ſevere ones he has ſet before mine. This Gentleman is both by his Principles and by his expreſs Declaration in this Paper, a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſer of that Wiſdom which is from below (otherwiſe by him call'd cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Wiſdom) and a great Pretender to that Wiſdom which is from above; let him hear then and conſider what St. <hi>James</hi> ſays, <hi>The Wiſdom that is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 3. 17.</note> 
               <hi>is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle,</hi> &amp;c. With which I conclude this part, and ſo paſs on from the <hi>Paſſion</hi> to the <hi>Argument</hi> that is contain'd in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>And here, if there be any Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon that Saying, that <hi>Strong Paſſions produce weak Arguments,</hi> I may hence take a Preſage of a Succeſsful Iſſue in the preſent Engagement. But
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62599:13"/>
however for fear of the worſt, I think it neceſſary here in the Entrance to adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize the Reader, that the Queſtion now in Debate beween us, is not concerning the Truth of the Quakers Principles, but concerning the Truth of my Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them; not whether their Principles are true in themſelves, but whether they are truly repreſented by me. So that if Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> ſhould have the Fortune to win the Stake, it would only be a private perſonal Victory, without any Advantage to the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Quakeriſm,</hi> which is not concern'd in the Iſſue of this Diſpute.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, I muſt further acquaint the Reader, that the Book which Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> excepts againſt, as guilty of miſreporting their Principles, is my <hi>Reflections upon the Conduct of Human Life,</hi> particularly in the Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript added to the Second Edition, where I undertake to give ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the difference between my Notion of the Divine Light, and the Quakers Light within. And this I do in ſeveral Articles diſtinctly, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the frequent recourſe that we ſhall have to them in the Sequel, it will be a Satisfaction to have here ſet
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62599:14"/>
down. They are therefore as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Quakers uſually talk of this Light within as of ſome Divine <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> or Manifeſtation only, whereas I make it to be the very <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> and <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the Deity, which I ſuppoſe vertually to contain all things in it, and to be intimately united to our Minds.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Quakers repreſent this Light within as a ſort of <hi>Extraordinary Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> (whence they have the Name of <hi>Enthyſiaſts)</hi> whereas I ſuppoſe it to be a Man's <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Ordinary</hi> way of Underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Quakers (if I miſtake not) confine their Light within to ſome certain Objects, namely, Moral and Spiritual Truths, in order only to the direction of Practice, and accordingly make it a Suppliment to <hi>Scripture,</hi> which they ſay is not ſufficient without it, nor indeed any more than a meer <hi>Dead Letter.</hi> But now I do not appropriate this Divine Light to Moral or Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al things, but extend it as far as all Truth; yea, as far as all that is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62599:14"/>
which I ſuppoſe to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd and underſtood in this Divine Light, as I have explain'd it.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Quakers make their Light within a ſpecial Privilege of a certain Order of Men, their own Party. Not inded as to the <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> becauſe they ſuppoſe all Men to be indifferently ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this Divine Illumination, as may appear from their contending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Predeſtination, and for Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Grace. But tho they do not make it a ſpecial Privilege as to the <hi>Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> yet they do as to the <hi>Act,</hi> making none but thoſe of their own Way to be actually enlighten'd by it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as according to my Principles this is no ſpecial Privilege, but the common and univerſal Benefit of all Men; yea, of all the Intelligent Creation, who all ſee and underſtand in this Light of God, without which there would be neither <hi>Truth</hi> nor <hi>Underſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">V. The Quakers by their Light within underſtand ſome determinate <hi>form'd</hi> Dictate or Propoſition, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and poſitively directing and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to do ſo or ſo. Whereas my Light is only the <hi>Eſſential</hi> Truth of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62599:15"/>
God, which indeed is always preſent to my Underſtanding, as being inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately united with it, but does not formally enlighten or inſtruct me, but when I attend to it, and conſult it, and read what is written in thoſe Divine Ideal Characters.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And Laſtly, The Quakers do not offer any rational or intelligible Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Light within, neither as to the thing, nor as to the mode of it, but only <hi>Gant</hi> in ſome looſe general Expreſſions about the <hi>Light,</hi> which they confirm with the Authority of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, tho they underſtand neither one nor t'other. Whereas I have offer'd a Natural, Diſtinct and Philoſophical way of explaining both, namely, by the Omniformity of the Ideal World, or the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, who has in himſelf the Eſſences and Idea's of all things, and in whom the ſame are perceiv'd by us and by all Creatures.</p>
            <p>Now this Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> is pleaſed to cenſure as a Miſrepreſentation of the Quaker's Principle concerning the Light within. But before I proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider whether it be or no, there are
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62599:15"/>
two intermedial Paſſages of his that expect to be taken notice of. I had ſaid in my Reflections, <hi>pag.</hi> 77. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Light within as untowardly repreſented by the Quakers, that the thing in it ſelf rightly underſtood is true, and if any ſuch ſhall yet call it Quakeriſm or Enthyſiaſm, that 'tis ſuch Quakeriſm as makes a good part of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, and of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Works. And ſo again to the like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in my Poſtſcript, that if the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers underſtood their own Notion, and knew how to explain it, and into what Principles to reſolve it, it would not much differ from mine: Of which two Paſſages Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> endeavours to make a notable Advantage, and fancies that they mightily befriend the Cauſe of Quakeriſm, as <hi>implying a ſort of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Page 7.</note> 
               <hi>to their Principle,</hi> and that the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between us would only be <hi>in Terminis.</hi> But is the Man in good earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt? Or does he think that he writes to one that underſtands not what belongs to Conſequence, and will be impoſed upon by any thing? Does it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that I confeſs the Truth of the Quakers Principle of the Light, becauſe I allow the Notion in its ſelf to be true when rightly underſtood,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62599:16"/>
that is, when taken in a right Senſe? What, does the General Truth of any Notion rightly ſtated infer the Truth of this or that particular way of explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it? May there not be a falſe and erroneous Explication of a true <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis?</hi> Suppoſe I ſhould ſay that the Doctrin of <hi>Juſtification by Faith only</hi> is a true Notion rightly underſtood, do I thereby confeſs the Truth of the <hi>Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidian</hi> way of underſtanding it, who ſo explain our being juſtifyed by Faith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to exclude the concurrence of Obedience? Or, Suppoſe I ſhould ſay that the Doctrin of <hi>Pleaſures being our ſupreme Good</hi> is a true Doctrin rightly underſtood, do I thereby acknowledge it to be true in that Senſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition uſually attributed to <hi>Epicurus?</hi> Or (to put theſe two Inſtances toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) can I juſtly be ſuppoſed to imply that the <hi>Solifidian</hi> and the <hi>Epicurean</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from their reſpective Adverſaries only <hi>in Terminis,</hi> becauſe I acknowledg that the Notions in themſelves rightly underſtood are true? If Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> had but been at the pains to <hi>deck</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a little more of that <hi>Corrupt Wiſdom,</hi> call'd <hi>Logic,</hi> he would never have impoſed upon himſelf, nor have offer'd to impoſe upon me with ſuch
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62599:16"/>
Womaniſh Conſequences as theſe.</p>
            <p>The other Paſſage that I muſt take <note place="margin">Page 8.</note> in my way, is his general Complaint againſt me, for not quoting the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers own Words and Authors in repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting their Principle. Now to this I anſwer, that having in my time read ſeveral of the moſt conſiderable of the Quakers Books, and (as I thought) well enough comprehended them as far as they were <hi>intelligible,</hi> I thought I might truſt my Memory ſo far, as to venture to repreſent their Senſe as to one (and that the moſt remarkable) of their Principles, without ranſacking their Books, and muſtering up Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which at that time I could not very well do neither, having but few of them by me. But neither ſhould I have thought it neceſſary if I had had never ſo many. For ſure a Man may venture to give an Account of one Notorious Principle belonging to a certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, and to ſhew the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and another, upon the Stock of his former Reading, without being obliged to bring an Author to atteſt to every thing he ſays. Thus were I to ſtate the general Difference between the <hi>Carteſian</hi> and the <hi>Ariſtotelean</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62599:17"/>
might I not ſecurely place it in this, that the one offers to explain <hi>Appearances</hi> of Nature by <hi>Forms</hi> and <hi>Qualities,</hi> and other ſuch abſtruſe Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which the other chuſes to reſolve into the more ſimple and intelligible Principles of <hi>Figure</hi> and <hi>Motion,</hi> &amp;c. without appealing preſently either to the Text of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or to the Principles of <hi>Deſcartes?</hi> Or ſuppoſe I were askt the Difference between a <hi>Socinian</hi> and a <hi>Mahumetan,</hi> might I not be allow'd to ſay, that tho the <hi>Socinian</hi> denies the Divinity of Chriſt as well as the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humetan,</hi> and the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> owns him as a true Prophet as well as the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> yet they differ in this, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Mahumetan</hi> allows him to have been only a Temporary Prophet, and that his Religion is now ſuperannuated, as having had it's Time; the <hi>Socinian</hi> acknowledges him to be a Prophet of a perpetual Authority, and that his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is ever obliging, as being the laſt and ſtanding Revelation of God: I ſay, might I not be allowed to ſtate the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thus between them <hi>without Book,</hi> but I muſt needs be put upon fetching Proofs, Chapter and Verſe, out of <hi>Socinus</hi> and the <hi>Alcoran?</hi> Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> might therefore well have ſpared
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62599:17"/>
this Objection, without any prejudice either to the Beauty, or to the Strength of his Diſcourſe; eſpecially conſidering, that he himſelf is not pleaſed to bring ſo much as one ſingle Citation out of any one Quakeriſh Writer, (for that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of <hi>Barclay</hi>'s <hi>(pag.</hi> 5.) is quoted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on another occaſion) to diſprove the Repreſentation of their Principle given by me. Now Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> was much more concerned to alledge Teſtimonies out of Authors than I, as undertaking to ſhew that Repreſentation of mine to be falſe, which I was then contented barely to <hi>propoſe,</hi> not to <hi>prove.</hi> For tho' it was poſſible for me to give an Account (and that a right one too) of the Quakers Principle, without producing any of their Teſtimonies, yet it was not poſſible for Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> to prove that Account of mine to be falſe, without referring to their Books. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis one thing barely to <hi>propoſe,</hi> which was my Undertaking, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to <hi>prove,</hi> which was his. Since therefore Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> thought fit to ſave himſelf the Trouble of appealing to Authors when more concerned to do ſo, he might well forgive it me, the only thing material in this buſineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not whether I quote their Books
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62599:18"/>
or no, but whether I have given a true Account of their Principle, which is the thing that now comes to be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>And here that Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> may not have the leaſt Ground to ſuſpect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that I contrive things to my own Advantage, by picking and chuſing what I can beſt Anſwer, or that I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent his Arguments, by reporting them in my own Words, or that I omit or conceal any part of their Strength, I will deal ſo fairly and ſquarely with him, as to ſet down at large his Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt every one of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Articles, applying to them their reſpective Anſwers diſtinctly.</p>

               <p>SUppoſe for the preſent, that the Senſe intended in the Aſſertion were what Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> apprehends it (tho the Antitheſis or counter-part of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle plainly implies the contrary) that the Quakers repreſent their Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in after the nature and manner of an <hi>Accident,</hi> and not as a <hi>Subſtantial</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. I ſay as a Subſtantial Principle;
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62599:19"/>
for as for a Subſtantial <hi>Inherent</hi> Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I know not what to make of it, it being the firſt time that I ever heard that <hi>Inherency</hi> was an Attribute belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Subſtance. Leaving out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> his Leave this ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuited Term, which I fancy happen'd to ſlip in while he was taking a Nod over his Paper; ſuppoſe, I ſay, my Meaning were, that the Quakers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Light not as a <hi>Subſtantial</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but rather as an <hi>Accident,</hi> how does he make out the contrary? Why, he tells me this is a great Miſtake. But may I not reply to him in his own Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>How does this appear to be true? Thou quoteſt no Author for it.</hi> But tho he produces no Authority, yet he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers at an Argument, the Sum of which is this, The Quakers building upon the Authority of St. <hi>John,</hi> make the Life of the Word to be the Light of Men, and therefore muſt be ſuppoſed to make it a Subſtance, the Life of the Word being confeſſedly ſo. But if this be all Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> has to ſay for his Point, he is very ſhort of proving what he undertakes, tho at the ſame time what he undertakes be nothing to the purpoſe. For tho it be true, that both the <hi>Word,</hi> and the <hi>Life</hi> of the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62599:19"/>
Word are real Subſtances, yet this Propoſition, <hi>The Life of the Word is the Light of Men,</hi> conſidered ſimply in its ſelf, without depending upon ſome proper and peculiar Hypotheſis that ſhall limit and determin its ſignification, does not at all infer, that the Light here is a Subſtance. For the Word may be ſaid to be the Light (unleſs a contrary Hypotheſis oblige us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand otherwiſe) <hi>Efficiently,</hi> as it cauſes our Illumination, as it enlightens and inſtructs by aſſiſting the Underſtanding, according to the common receiv'd No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as <hi>Formally,</hi> by being it ſelf the Formal and Immediate Object of our Conception. And ſo when Chriſt ſays of himſelf, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> there is no neceſſity, I mean from the Words themſelves, of underſtanding them in a <hi>Formal</hi> way of Predication; but the Senſe may very well be, what it is generally preſumed to be, that he is the Author, or <hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe of our Illumination. Which is allow'd to be ſometimes the certain and neceſſary Acceptation of the Particle <hi>(is),</hi> whereof we have a remarkable Example, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 14. He is our Peace,</hi> that is, the Author or Procurer of our Peace. And if theſe Propoſitions are
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62599:20"/>
not of themſelves determin'd to a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Senſe, but may aptly enough be taken <hi>Efficiently</hi> as well as <hi>Formally,</hi> then their grounding their Principle of the Light upon theſe or ſuch like Expreſſions does not infer that they hold it to be a Subſtantial Being.</p>
               <p>And it does not of neceſſity neither; tho we ſhould ſuppoſe them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Propoſition of St. <hi>John</hi> in a <hi>Formal</hi> Senſe. Indeed in caſe the Word be Formally the Light of Men, it will truly follow, that the Light is a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, becauſe the Word it ſelf is ſo. And if the Quakers do conſtrue the Propoſition in ſuch a Senſe, that is, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally,</hi> it will alſo follow that they ought (if they will be conſiſtent with themſelves) to make the Light to be a real Subſtance. But it will not follow that they actually and expreſly do ſo, unleſs it were neceſſary that Men ſhould always ſo ſtrictly attend to the Conſequences of what they lay down; as never to ſay any thing inconſiſtent with their Principles; which is an Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that Men of more Logical Heads than the Quakers are generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be, would give a great deal to be ſecure of. So that whether the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62599:20"/>
Propoſition be taken Efficiently or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, it does by no means follow from their bare quoting thoſe Words from St. <hi>John</hi> in the behalf of their Principle, (which yet is the only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> is pleaſed to inſiſt upon) that the Quakers do profeſs their Light to be a Subſtantial Being. I do not ſay they do not, but only that had that been the Senſe of my Aſſertion, Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> is far from proving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary by vertue of the Argument he has uſed.</p>
               <p>But why muſt that needs be the Senſe of my Aſſertion? Why, becauſe otherwiſe, as he conceits, there will not be much weight or matter in it. No? Suppoſe this ſhould be the Senſe of it, (as 'tis plain from the Antitheſis that it is) <hi>That the Quakers repreſent their Light not as God himſelf, but only as a Divine Communication,</hi> that is, <hi>as ſomething communicated or exhibited by God, whereas I make the Light to be the very Eſſence and Subſtance of the Deity,</hi> &amp;c. Will he ſay there is little Weight in this Aſſertion? Is not the Difference very material, if true? And that this is the natural, nay, the neceſſary Senſe of the Article is ſo evident from the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62599:21"/>
Antitheſis, that I wonder how a Man of Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> his Apprehenſion could miſs of it. For (as he will quickly ſee, if he review the place with the leaſt Attention) the Oppoſition between my Notion of the Divine Light, and that of the Quakers, is not made to conſiſt in this, that <hi>they</hi> make it to be an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and <hi>I</hi> a Subſtance; but in this, that they repreſent it as ſomething only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, exhibited or manifeſted by God, (whether as an Accident or a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I was not then concerned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider) whereas in my Account it is the very Eſſence and Subſtance of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, exhibitive of all Truth, and always preſential to our Mind. And therefore when 'tis ſaid, that the Quakers uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally talk of the Light within as of ſome Divine Communication or Manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on only; the Term <hi>(only)</hi> is not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of Subſtance in general, but of the Divine Subſtance, or Eſſence of God. I know very well, and have no tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to diſſemble it, that 'tis the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Doctrin of the Quakers, that the Divine Light is a Subſtance, not an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. For they make it the Principle of Regeneration, which they all ſay, (and Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> has taken a great deal <note place="margin">Way to the City of God, <hi>p.</hi> 62.</note> of Pains to prove it) is a <hi>Subſtantial</hi>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:62599:21"/>
Life, as much as the Life of Vegetation, Senſation, or Reaſon is; and as far as I can apprehend, the Notion may be ſound and true enough in its ſelf, and wants only to be fix'd upon a right Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. And I know that Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> in his Apology, lately Printed in Folio with the reſt of his Works, ſays ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, <hi>We underſtand not this Seed, Light</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 334.</note> 
                  <hi>or Grace to be an Accident, as moſt Men ignorantly do, but a Real, Spiritual Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which the Soul of Man is capable to Feel and Apprehend; from which that Real, Spiritual, Inward Birth in Believers ariſes, call'd the New Creature, the New Man in the Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho it be too plain to be denied, that the Quakers make the Light to be a real Subſtance, yet 'tis alſo as plain, that they do not make it the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God. <hi>By this Seed, Grace and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 133.</note> 
                  <hi>Word of God and Light,</hi> (ſays Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay) wherewith we ſay every Man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, and hath a meaſure of it, which ſtrives with them in order to ſave them, and which may by the Stubbornneſs and Wickedneſs of Man's Will be quench'd, bruiſed, wounded, preſſed down, ſlain and crucified, we underſtand not the proper Eſſence and Nature of God preciſely taken,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62599:22"/>
which is not Diviſible into Parts and Meaſures, as being a moſt pure ſimple Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, void of all Compoſition or Diviſion, and therefore can neither be reſiſted, hurt, wounded, crucified or ſlain by all the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and Strength of Men. But we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand a Spiritual, Heavenly and Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Principle, in which God as Father, Son and Spirit dwells; a meaſure of which Divine and glorious Life is in all men, as a Seed, which of its own Nature draws, invites and inclines to God. And this we call</hi> Vehiculum Dei, <hi>or the Spiritual Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Chriſt, the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt which came down from Heaven, of which all the Saints do feed, and are thereby nouriſh'd unto eternal Life.</hi> Whether there be any ſuch thing as this <hi>Vehiculum Dei,</hi> or Spiritual Body of Chriſt, (which is a Notion ſeveral Learned Men both before and ſince the appearance of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm have entertain'd upon the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>6th Chapter</hi> of St. <hi>John)</hi> I have neither Cauſe nor Mind at preſent to diſpute. But I think 'tis plain from this Account Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> gives of the Light, that tho it be a Subſtance, yet 'tis not the ſame with, but really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from the Subſtance or Eſſence of God. For it is not <hi>Deus,</hi> but <hi>Vehiculum Dei.</hi> And to the like purpoſe Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:62599:22"/>
another of their moſt conſiderable Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſpeaking of the Seed of God, (which is the ſame with the Light now in Queſtion) ſays, that <hi>it is not the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Way to the City of God, <hi>p.</hi> 130.</note> 
                  <hi>it ſelf, but a certain middle Nature, Subſtance or Being, betwixt the Godhead and Mankind,</hi> &amp;c. Again, ſays he, <hi>p. 131. This middle Nature I call a Divine Subſtance or Eſſence, not as if it were the Godhead it ſelf, or a Particle or Portion of it, but becauſe of its excellency above all other things next unto the Godhead, as on ſuch an Account Men do call other things Divine which are very excellent,</hi> &amp;c. Again ſays he in the next Paragraph, <hi>This excellent and intermediate Being may be call'd the Divine Being, becauſe the Godhead is moſt immediately manifeſt therein, and dwelleth in it, as in the moſt Holy Place, or Holy of Holies.</hi> More Teſtimonies I might, but I think need not add, it being ſufficiently clear from theſe cited out of Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> and Mr. <hi>Keith,</hi> that the Quakers do not hold their Light to be the very Subſtance and Eſſence of the Deity, though at the ſame time I think they ought, and that they are inconſiſtent with themſelves in that they do not. For that Text of St. <hi>John, In him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men,</hi> which they quote to
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62599:23"/>
prove the Light to be a Subſtantial Principle, does not prove ſo much as that, unleſs the Propoſition be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood <hi>Formally;</hi> and if it be, then it proves a great deal more, <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis not only a Subſtance, (which is all they infer from it) but alſo a Divine Subſtance ſtrictly ſpeaking, even the very Eſſence of the Deity. And indeed what leſs than that can be a Light to the Soul? How can any thing that is not God, or that is created, be ſo? But 'tis not my preſent Buſineſs to conſider what the Quakers ought to ſay, but what they do ſay. 'Tis plain, that they do not make the Divine Light to be the proper Subſtance of God, but a certain middle Nature; and 'tis as plain that I do, which lays a ſufficient ground of Difference between us; ſo that my firſt Diſtinction is ſo far from falling to the Ground, that it ſtands upon firmer Ground than ever; and if my Adverſary has but the Underſtanding and the Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of a Man, I dare appeal to him whether he be not fairly Anſwer'd and Confuted as far as concerns this firſt Particular. But whatever his Judgment be, I preſume the Judicious Reader will be of mine, and ſo give me leave to advance forward to the</p>

               <p>THY Second is as inſignificant, and like an Arrow ſhot at random, lights on thy own Head, being attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſome contradiction to thy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. Thou ſayeſt, the Quakers repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent this Light within as a ſort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Inſpiration. Where learn'ſt thou this? Before it was a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication and Manifeſtation only, and now an extraordinary Inſpiration. Thou wouldſt have done well to have let the Quakers Principle alone till thou hadſt learnt it better, and more honeſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it. Is not Extraordinary, more than Common, or Communication and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation <hi>only?</hi> Have not the Quakers declared the Light to be Univerſal, as well as Divine, in its Gift and Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation to the Sons of Men? It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true they have; and yet I deny not but ſuch who apply their Minds in Obedience to the teachings of this Light and Heavenly Gift, may be made Partakers of more, <hi>viz.</hi> Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gifts and Graces by the Inſpiration of the ſame Spirit. If for this they have the Name of <hi>Enthyſiaſts</hi> given them, as in this Section of thy Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, tho it be in Deriſion, they will
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62599:24"/>
rejoyce in it; for it ſhall be as an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of Grace to their Head, and Chains about their Neck. Again, in the ſame Section thou ſay'ſt I ſuppoſe it, <hi>viz.</hi> The Light within to be <hi>a Man's natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and ordinary way of Underſtanding.</hi> And juſt before thou madeſt it to be the very Eſſence and Subſtance of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, which are thy own expreſs Words: See thy Confuſion and Self-contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By theſe Words, a Man's Natural and Ordinary Way of Underſtanding I take thee to intend the ſame thing as in <hi>pag.</hi> 77. where thou call'ſt it Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Conſcience; and yet at the ſame time call'ſt it, The Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and Region of Truth, in which are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, the great and univerſal O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle lodg'd in every Man's Breaſt, whereof the ancient Urim and Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim was an expreſs Type or Emblem. Here thou debaſeſt and confoundeſt thy Principle, making it to be a part of Man's Nature, whereas the Principle of Divine Light as held by the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, is a diſtinct thing from Man's Soul, Reaſon, or Natural Conſcience, <hi>viz.</hi> a more excellent Spirit and Principle. And herein I confeſs is a material Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt thy Principle of Light
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62599:24"/>
and the Quakers, as thou haſt expreſs'd it. Sure I am, it is a great Error to render the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by which all things were made, and are upheld, to be no higher a Principle than Man's Reaſon and Conſcience, or natural and ordinary way of Underſtanding, which Reaſon is a Property Eſſential to him as Man. I confeſs to know the things of a Man, according to that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9, 10, 14. But as it is written, Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard,</hi> &amp;c. By which it manifeſtly appears, that the true Knowledge of God and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Things are attain'd by the Spirit, which is ſuperiour to Man's rational Principle or natural Conſcience, which may be defiled and corrupted, as 'tis ſaid expreſly of the impure, that even their Mind and Conſcience is defiled.</p>

               <p>THIS Second Exception, conſiſting of ſeveral things, muſt be ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſider'd. Firſt, He demands of me where I learnt, that the Quakers repreſent this Light within as a ſort of extraordinary Inſpiration? But before I anſwer his Queſtion, I muſt ſettle the Meaning of my own Words, which he is pleaſed to take in a Senſe quite
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62599:25"/>
different from what I intended, and what the ſcope and occaſion of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle requires. When therefore I ſay, that the Quakers repreſent this Light within as a ſort of <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, 'tis plain from the Antitheſis of the Article that my meaning is, that they repreſent it as a Supernatural Gift or Grace, meaning by <hi>Supernatural</hi> not only ſomething beſide, above or beyond the <hi>Nature</hi> of Man; (for ſo alſo upon my Principle 'tis acknowledged to be <hi>Supernatural,</hi> becauſe I expreſly make it to be the very Eſſence of God) but ſomething above or beyond the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Order, State</hi> or <hi>Condition</hi> of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature. Supernatural not only as to the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of it, (for that's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd on both Hands, only more exalted upon my Hypotheſis than upon theirs) but alſo as to its <hi>Diſpenſation</hi> and Order, being ſuch an extraordinary ſuperabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Addition to the Nature of Man, as is not neceſſary he ſhould always have, and without which he would ſtill continue a rational and intelligent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In oppoſition to which I ſaid, that 'tis a Man's Natural and Ordinary way of Underſtanding, that is, that 'tis ſo far from being ſuch an extraordinary Superaddition to Human Nature, as

Man might be without, and yet be a reaſonable Creature; that 'tis ſo much the Natural and Ordinary way of his Underſtanding, that he could not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to underſtand at all without it: That he would not only have leſs Light ſhould it be taken from him, but be quite in the Dark. In one Word, that 'tis not a thing of <hi>Advantage only,</hi> but of <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> neceſſary to the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as well as to the well or better Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a reaſonable underſtanding Spirit as ſuch, who without this Light would not only not ſee ſo well, but would be able to ſee nothing, or not at all. This is the plain obvious Senſe of my Words, only drawn out more at length, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that my Notion differs conſiderably from that of the Quakers in this particular alſo.</p>
               <p>And now if this be the Senſe of my Propoſition, (as 'tis plain that 'tis, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not capable of any other) I may eaſily anſwer Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> his Queſtion, that demands of me, Where I learnt that the Quakers repreſent this Light within as a ſort of extraordinary Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? For 'tis very plain that they make this Internal Light to be <hi>Grace,</hi> that ſpecial and peculiar Grace of Chriſt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62599:26"/>
whereby he reſtores laps'd Man from the Corruption of his Natural State. <hi>For this end,</hi> ſays Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> (that is, <note place="margin">Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 330.</note> for the Reſtoration of Man) <hi>God hath communicated and given unto every man a meaſure of the Light of his Son, a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Grace, or a meaſure of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. And again he calls it expreſly a <hi>Supernatural Gift and Grace of Chriſt.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 346.</note> Not that I would be thought to deny the Divine Light to be <hi>Grace</hi> as to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Degrees</hi> of it. So far from that, that I think it to be the greateſt Grace of God, that is, with reſpect to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it, many of which I allow to be ſuch extraordinary Superadditions to the common Order or State of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, as Man might ſimply be without, and yet continue in the Rank and Form of a reaſonable and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Creature. But not content with this, the Quakers make the Divine Light to be Grace ſimply and abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as to its whole Nature and Kind, ſo as to be all over <hi>extraordinary.</hi> And if ſo, then they are ſo far from making it (as I do) neceſſary to a Man's Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Ordinary way of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they muſt make it ſuch a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundant Acceſſion to the common Condition of Man's Nature, as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62599:26"/>
which he would ſtill underſtand e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to denominate him a Rational Being. For certainly a Man may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand without <hi>Grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But that my Adverſary may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that I lay the whole ſtreſs of this matter upon a <hi>Conſequence,</hi> (tho it be a very plain one) I will prove the ſame by expreſs Teſtimony, namely, That the Quakers do make their Light to be according to the before-ſtated Senſe of the Word, ſomething extraordinary, ſomething added to the common way of Underſtanding, ſo as not to be ſimply neceſſary to Underſtanding in general, but only to the greater Advantage of it. For ſays Mr. <hi>Barclay, That Man,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apology, <hi>p,</hi> 337.</note> 
                  <hi>as he is a Rational Creature, hath Reaſon, as a Natural Faculty of his Soul, by which he can diſcern things that are rational, we deny not. For this is a Property Natural and Eſſential to him, by which he can know and learn many Arts and Sciences, beyond what any other Animal can do by the meer Animal Principle.</hi> So that here the Light is not ſimply and ordinarily neceſſary to the underſtanding of things, which it ſeems may be done by Reaſon alone without the Light. To the ſame purpoſe again, ſays the ſame Author,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62599:27"/>
                  <hi>Man in his Natural State</hi> (that is, in the <note place="margin">Page 346.</note> ſtate devoid of this Light, which he had juſt before call'd the ſtate of Darkneſs) <hi>can eaſily comprehend, and doth comprehend, thoſe things that are peculiar and common to him, as ſuch.</hi> And tho they commonly call the natural ſtate of Man (when without the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of this Light) a ſtate of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet 'tis not becauſe they ſuppoſe him to be abſolutely dark, and to know nothing but only dark as to Spiritual and Saving Truths. So that according to them there may be Knowledge and Underſtanding without the Divine Light, which therefore they muſt be ſuppoſed to look upon as an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Acceſſion, and not as an ordinary Requiſite to Human Underſtanding. Which again ſets their Principle at a ſufficient Diſtance from mine. Tho I muſt needs do them ſo much Juſtice as to confeſs, that herein they ſpeak as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to their Principle as I do to mine: For conceiving their Light not as the very Object of Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, not as that Truth it ſelf which we perceive, (as is plain, becauſe they do not make it the Eſſence of God, as was noted above) but as ſomething that ſerves for the clearer Revelation or
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62599:27"/>
Diſcovery of that Object, that is in one Word, conceiving it rather as a more advantagious <hi>Medium,</hi> than as an <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> they might well be excuſed from making it ſimply and abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Underſtanding: Whereas I conceiving the Divine Light to be the Omniform Eſſence of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly making it to be the very immediate Object of my Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that very Truth <hi>which</hi> (not that Medium <hi>by which)</hi> I contemplate, was obliged to ſuppoſe it ſo neceſſary to the common and natural way of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that there could be no ſuch thing as Underſtanding without it; which I am ſure a Quaker will not, or at leaſt upon his Principles, can never ſay.</p>
               <p>And thus far the Difference between us is very clear and plain, and would indeed be on all ſides unexceptionable, but that Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> has here ſpied out ſomething, (for which I very much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the Quickneſs of his Eye-ſight) and that is a <hi>Contradiction. Before</hi> (ſays he) <hi>it was a Divine Communication and Manifeſtation only, and now an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Inſpiration. Is not Extraordinary more than Common, or Communication
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62599:28"/>
and Manifeſtation only?</hi> And this he takes for a Contradiction of what was laid down in the Firſt Article. But methinks Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> ſhould not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to write <hi>Controverſie,</hi> unleſs he had known better how to judge of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For does it follow, that becauſe I firſt ſay, that the Quakers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent their Light as a Divine Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication or Manifeſtation only, in oppoſition to its being the very Eſſence or Subſtance of God, and afterwards add (as another Step or Degree of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference) that they repreſent it as an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> one, in oppoſition to the Natural and Ordinary way of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; I ſay, Does it hence appear that I contradict my ſelf? What if Extraordinary be more than Common, or Communication or Manifeſtation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, does it therefore <hi>Contradict</hi> it? What, is every Addition a Contradiction? It may indeed be ſo, in caſe the Degree added in the Second Propoſition were denied or excluded in the firſt. But is this the preſent Caſe? Tho Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Communication be more than bare Communication ſimply conſider'd, is it therefore denied by it? Is it not plain that this is only an Abſtraction, and not any Negation? For if he ſhould take
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62599:28"/>
hold of the Term <hi>(only),</hi> where I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Miſtake lay, is it not very plain that the Term <hi>(only)</hi> in the Firſt Article is not excluſive of <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> which is added in the Second, but only of the Divine Eſſence or Subſtance; this being the Senſe of the Propoſition, that they repreſent their Light not as the very Eſſence of God, but only as ſomething communicated by God? And where then is there any appearance of a Contradiction? But leſt Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> ſhould not take this, (for he has now given me juſt occaſion to queſtion his Capacity) I will illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate it by an Inſtance: Suppoſe a <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian</hi> ſhould ſay firſt, That Light is <hi>only</hi> the <hi>Endeavour</hi> of the Globules of the Second Element to Motion, not the Motion its ſelf; and then afterwards ſhould further ſay, that 'tis the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of thoſe Globules to recede from the Center of the Luminous Body in a Right Line, would one of theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions contradict the other? 'Tis more than I can find if they do. But he continues his Exception upon this part, asking me, <hi>Have not the Quakers declared the Light to be Univerſal, as well as Divine, in its Gift and Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation to the Sons of Men?</hi> Well, what
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:62599:29"/>
if they have, may they not alſo not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that hold it to be an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary</hi> Gift, according to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-ſtated Senſe of the Word Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as it ſignifies ſomething ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded to the Natural way of Man's Underſtanding? Does Extraordinary in this Senſe import any thing inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with <hi>Univerſal?</hi> Suppoſe <hi>Adam</hi> had perſevered in his Original State, and his whole Poſterity had inherited that extraordinary Grace, that <hi>Fraenum Juſtitiae,</hi> which (according to ſome) was ſuperadded to the Eſſential Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of his Human Nature, would it have been the leſs Extraordinary, that is, the leſs a Superaddition to the Nature of Man, becauſe Univerſal? Sure Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> muſt be but little acquainted with the Nature of <hi>Oppoſition,</hi> if he thinks there is any between theſe two things. But ſuppoſe there were, he himſelf is accountable for it, and not I. For I have brought Evidence enough to prove, that they do make their Light to be (as I have explained it) <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary,</hi> and if that be inconſiſtent with their other Notion of its Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſality, the Inconſiſtency lights upon themſelves, and I can't help that.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:62599:29"/>
And thus the Former Part of this Section is ſufficiently vindicated; but it ſeems there is a Flaw in the Latter, which Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> endeavours to make great Advantage of, tho it be ſuch as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly owing to the Captiouſneſs and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candidneſs of his own Conſtruction. <hi>Again,</hi> (ſays he) <hi>in the ſame Section thou ſayeſt, I ſuppoſe it,</hi> viz. <hi>The Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be a Man's Natural and Ordinary way of Underſtanding. And juſt before thou madeſt it to be the very Eſſence and Subſtance of the Deity,</hi> &amp;c. Did I ſo? Then this one would think ſhould have been a Key to my Meaning to any one that was not reſolv'd to miſunderſtand and pervert it, that he might have ſomething to expoſe and harangue upon. For is it in the leaſt to be imagin'd, or does Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> in his Conſcience ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think that I, who in this very Book, and in theſe very Articles he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon, as well as in the whole Courſe of my other Writings upon this occaſion, do all along earneſtly contend, that this Internal Light is no other than the very Eſſence and Subſtance of God, whoſe Omniformity is exhibitive of all things, and is the immediate Object of our Conception, that very Truth which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62599:30"/>
we conceive: And that I who make this the ground of Difference between my Principle of the Light and that of the Quakers, that they do not make it the Subſtance of God, but only ſomething communicated by or from him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I expreſly do: I ſay, can it be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd that after all this, I ſhould ſo far forget my ſelf, as to make this Divine Light to be the very ſame thing with Human Underſtanding, and ſo confound (as he pretends) the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with Man's Reaſon and Conſcience? Sure I ſhould be fitter to pick Straws in <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam,</hi> than to write Books, ſhould I be ſo ſenſeleſs as to make Truth and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, Object and Faculty, God and Creature all one. But as this is too groſs to be my real Meaning, ſo the Scope and Antitheſis of the Article do plainly ſhew that it was not. 'Tis plain from thence (and no candid Reader would have underſtood me otherwiſe) that my Meaning, tho for Brevity's ſake not ſo explicitly worded, was no other than what has been already ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, <hi>viz.</hi> That whereas the Quakers repreſent their Light as ſomething ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily ſuperadded to the natural way of Underſtanding, (as ſuppoſing two diſtinct Lights in the Soul) and ſo
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62599:30"/>
not abſolutely neceſſary to Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as ſuch, which according to them may be without it: I on the contrary making but one way of Underſtanding in all, ſuppoſe this Light to be ſo far from being ſuch an Extraordinary Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peraddition, that 'tis ſo requiſite to the Natural and Ordinary way of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that there is no Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without it. And ſo when I ſay, <hi>pag. 77. This is Reaſon, this is Conſcience,</hi> 'tis plain enough that I mean no more than that this (namely the Light) is that whereby I perform Acts of Reaſon and Acts of Conſcience; not that it is my very reaſoning Faculty, but that whereby I reaſon and diſcourſe, as fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing me with Idea's for my Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. And if this be the Natural and Neceſſary Senſe of my Words (as I believe Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> muſt needs be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that it is) then his whole follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Harangue about my confounding the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> with Man's Natural Reaſon and Conſcience is quite ſpoil'd, and from a piece of Rhetoric becomes a moſt trifling Impertinence, (or to borrow a Stroke of Oratory from him) <hi>Inſignificant, and like an Arrow ſhot at Random.</hi>

               <p>IN thy Third Section thou com'ſt in with a <hi>Salvo Errore.</hi> If I miſtake not, the Quakers confine their Light within to ſome certain Objects, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Moral and Spiritual Truths in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der only to the Direction of Practice. How ſhouldſt thou do otherwiſe but miſtake the Principles of others, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou art ſo confuſed about thine own? However, I muſt tell thee it is no ſmall Fault at ſuch an Uncertainty to expoſe Peoples Principles; and 'tis an Abuſe to ſay, that the Quakers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine the Light within. It is Divine, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, and Uncircumſcribable; in it are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledg. Where have the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers taught otherwiſe? Have they not teſtified and declared the Light and the Spirit of Truth are one and the ſame in being, which will guide <hi>into all Truth,</hi> John 16. 13. The Quakers believe this Divine Light to be the Quickner of their Underſtandings to Know, and of their Wills to Love and Practiſe all Truth, and that it aſſiſts the Natural Faculties of the Soul in the Attainment of neceſſary Arts and Sciences, as well
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62599:31"/>
as capacitates it to Know and Practiſe Moral and Spiritual Truths. Thou may'ſt read what the Author to the Book of Wiſdom ſays on this Subject, in the <hi>9th</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> Chapters.</p>
               <p>And whereas thou ſayſt, the Quakers make the Light within a Supplement to Scripture, which they ſay is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient without it, nor indeed any more than a meer dead Letter. I anſwer, Theſe Words <hi>Supplement to Scripture</hi> are thy own, not ours; and this ſeems to be a Compoſition of thy own Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Quakers Faith concerning the Holy Scripture, without any Quotation of their Words or Writings; and as 'tis an Objection is built upon thy miſtake in thy former Section, <hi>viz. The Quakers repreſent this Light within as a ſort of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Inſpiration.</hi> Which hath been already Anſwer'd, proving the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſality of the Divine Light in Man; which conſider'd, there is no juſt Cauſe for this as an Objection againſt the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers aſſigning the Scriptures to be inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without the Light, becauſe the Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not occur to the Underſtanding with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, and the Formal Reaſon thereof is its Preſence and Manifeſtation. The
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62599:32"/>
Quakers believe that Chriſt Jeſus by his Divine Light within, doth in theſe Days, as in the Days of his Fleſh, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound, fulfil, and open to the True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers the Holy Scriptures, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtles Exhortation to <hi>Timothy, Chap.</hi> 2. 3, 15. are able to make wiſe unto Salvation, (Note) <hi>through Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> The Word <hi>Supplement</hi> in this Senſe, I hope, will be found no Error, but according to thy Conſtruction of the Quakers repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light within as a ſort of Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Inſpiration, <hi>Sect.</hi> 2. or ſpecial Priviledg of a certain Order of Men, their own Party, as in <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. And then making them to ſay the Scriptures with relation only to the Direction of Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, (as thy Lines import, <hi>Sect.</hi> 3.) are not ſufficient without it, nor indeed any more than a meer dead Letter, is to render the Quakers not only ſingular and erroneous in their Principle of the Light (which ſhall be more duly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in its place) but alſo contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous of the Holy Scriptures as uſeleſs and inſufficient to all but themſelves, which is a great and hainous Abuſe of a Society of People, without Cauſe and Provocation, and contrary to their Public and Known Aſſertions both by

But I find upon fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Examination that I needed not to proceed with ſuch Suſpenſe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matter, being ſo fully aſſured of my being in the right here, as well as in the other parts of my Account, that had I the Liberty to <hi>New-Caſt</hi> this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle again, it ſhould be in the very ſame <hi>Mould.</hi> Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> indeed tells me that <hi>'tis an Abuſe to ſay the Quakers confine the Light within.</hi> And I tell him again, that 'tis an abuſe in him to ſay, that this is my Charge.

the Light within, (which would imply a Confinement to Perſons) but that they confine it to ſome certain Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, namely, Moral and Spiritual Truths, in order only to the Direction of Practice. And that they do thus <hi>confine</hi> the Light is as plain and certain as that they <hi>hold</hi> it, if Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> may be allow'd to underſtand their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. For ſays he, <hi>As God gave two</hi>

                  <hi>great Lights to rule the outward World, the Sun and Moon, the greater Light to Rule the Day, and the leſſer Light to rule the Night; So hath he given Man the Light of his Son, a Spiritual Divine Light to rule him in the things Spiritaal, and the Light of Reaſon to rule him in things Natural.</hi> Here it is very plain, Firſt, That he ſuppoſes two diſtinct Lights in the Soul, the Divine Light, and the Light of Reaſon, or the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light, which by the way ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirms what was ſaid in the laſt Section concerning their making the Divine Light an <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, that is, <hi>Superacceſſory</hi> to the Natural Light, or Man's Natural and Ordinary way of Underſtanding, which might remain intire and unextinguiſht, tho ſeparated from the Divine Light, as being a Principle wholly diſtinct
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62599:33"/>
from it, and that ſtands upon another Bottom. Contrary to what I contend for, namely, That there is but one Light in the Soul of Man, which is the Divine Light, wherein we ſee and perceive all things, and by which we naturally and ordinarily underſtand. 'Tis alſo very plain in the 2d place, That as he ſuppoſes two diſtinct Lights in the Soul, the Divine and the Natural, ſo he aſſigns them two diſtinct Offices, no leſs diſtinct than Day and Night, the Divine Light being to direct in things Spiritual as the Sun rules the Day; and the Natural Light being to direct in things Natural, as the Moon governs the Night. Each it ſeems has its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Orb and Province; and they can no more interfere with one another's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, than the Sun can uſurp the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Night, or the Moon aſſume to her ſelf the Conduct of the Day. And if this be not to confine the Divine Light to ſome certain Objects, namely, to Moral and Spiritual Truths, I know not what is. 'Tis confined as much to ſuch Objects as the Sun is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the Day, and I deſire no more, thinking that to be Confinement e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enough. If Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> had been but half ſo much <hi>confin'd</hi> to Civility and
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62599:34"/>
Good Behaviour, he would have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with more Humanity and Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie than he has done in ſome parts of his Book.</p>
               <p>I might be more liberal of Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon this occaſion, if I thought there were any need; but ſince that already produc'd is ſo expreſs to the purpoſe, I ſhall only take notice of a remarkable Paſſage in the Preface to Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Works, lately Printed in Folio, where the Ingenious Author giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Account of his Apology for the true Chriſtian Divinity, makes one himſelf for the Scholaſtic manner and way of its Compoſition, which it ſeems was in Tenderneſs to Scholars, and in Condeſcenſion to their Education. His Words are, <hi>The Method and Style of the Book may be ſomewhat Singular, and like</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 21.</note> 
                  <hi>a Scholar; for we make that ſort of Learning no part of our Divine Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> &amp;c. Where 'tis plain, that by <hi>that ſort of Learning,</hi> he means Human Learning, thoſe Arts and Sciences which are the common Objects of our Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Studies. And that by <hi>our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Science</hi> he means that Knowledg which is ſupernaturally communicated to them by the ſaving Light of Chriſt,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62599:34"/>
whereof he had diſcours'd before. So that when he ſays we make that ſort of Learning no part of our Divine Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it comes to as much as if he had ſaid, <hi>We make Human Learning, or thoſe Arts and Sciences which are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Objects of Academical Study, to be no part of that Knowledg which is ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally communicated to us by the Light of Chriſt.</hi> And if Human Learning be no part of that Knowledg which comes by the Divine Light, then the Divine Light is not extended to Human Learning, and conſequently muſt be confined to Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Truths, the very Province which Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> had aſſign'd it before.</p>
               <p>And to this Suppoſition the Thread of their former Principle naturally leads them. For ſuppoſing the Divine Light to be an Extraordinary Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God, that is, ſomething ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the Natural and Ordinary way of Underſtanding, there is all the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the World that they ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to it Divine and Spiritual Objects as its proper Sphere and Province, ſince Natural things were before ſufficiently diſcernible by a Natural Light and Principle. Eſpecially conſidering that this Divine Light is alſo conceiv'd and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62599:35"/>
repreſented by them as that very <hi>Grace</hi> of Chriſt whereby Men are Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Saved, and which was given to them by God for that very purpoſe. For ſo Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> in his 5th and 6th Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, <note place="margin">Page 317.</note> reckoning up the Ends and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes for which the ſaving and ſpiritual Light (as he calls it) was given by God, makes them to conſiſt in making manifeſt all things that are reprovable, in teaching all Temperance, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Godlineſs, and (in general) in Lightning the Hearts of all in order to Salvation. So then it ſeems this Light is purely <hi>in order to Salvation,</hi> and conſequently ought to be confined to the things that concern it, that is, to Divine and Spiritual Truths in order to the Direction of Life and Manners. Herein therefore they are conſonant to their Principles: As they <hi>do</hi> thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine their Light to Spiritual things, ſo they <hi>ought</hi> thus to confine it. For what has <hi>Grace</hi> to do with the things of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> And as <hi>they</hi> follow <hi>their</hi> Principle, ſo <hi>I</hi> follow <hi>mine.</hi> For not conceiving this Internal Light as any thing ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the ordinary way of Man's Underſtanding, but as that whereby he naturally and ordinarily Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands, and not conceiving it after the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62599:35"/>
manner of Grace neither (I mean as to its ſimple Kind, tho I allow it may have that Eſtimation in ſome of its Degrees) but rather as according to the Natural Order of Human Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: I had no reaſon to confine it (as the Quakers do) to Divine and Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Truths, but to extend it to all Truth without Exception, which I ſuppoſe to be equally perceivable in this Divine Light, which, as being the very Eſſence of God, muſt be equally exhibitive of all.</p>
               <p>But Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> will ſtill have it an <hi>Abuſe</hi> to ſay, that the Quakers confine the Light within. For, ſays he, <hi>It is Divine, Supernatural, and Uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribable, and in it are hid all the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge.</hi> Allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, I ſuppoſe, to that of the Apoſtle concerning Chriſt, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. But tho they do make it to be Divine and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, yet I do not ſee how they can make it, or he can call it, <hi>Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribable,</hi> ſince (as has been obſerv'd in the preceeding Pages) they do not make it to be the proper Eſſence or Subſtance of God, but a certain mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. Nature between God and Man: And for the ſame reaſon he cuts himſelf
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62599:36"/>
off from all Pretence to that Text con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Divine Word,</hi> that in him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, which indeed is very applicable, and carries a very appoſite and emphatic Senſe upon my Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, who make the Divine Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be the very Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> himſelf, the Subſtantial and Eſſential Wiſdom of God; but muſt be altogether <hi>uſurp't</hi> upon his, who either does, or by the Principles of Quakeriſm is obliged to make it not the very Eſſence of the Deity, but ſomething of a middle Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>But ſays he, <hi>Have they not teſtified and declared the Light and the Spirit of Truth are all one and the ſame Being, which will guide into all Truth?</hi> Joh. 16. 13. And I do not at preſent well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber whether they have or no, hor ſhall I give my ſelf the Trouble to enquire, thinking it altogether impertihent. But ſure I am, that they have often, <hi>teſtify'd</hi> and <hi>declar'd</hi> that the Light is not the proper Eſſence of God, but a certain middle Being between God and Man; and if they will afterwards teſtify and declare that 'tis the very ſame with the Spirit of Truth (which is really and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62599:36"/>
truly God) I think they will evidently teſtifie againſt themſelves, and declare Contradictions, and then 'tis no great matter what thy <hi>teſtifie</hi> or <hi>declare.</hi> But beſides, ſuppoſe they did make the Light to be one and the ſame with the Spirit of Truth, which according to that of St. <hi>John,</hi> will guide into all Truth; yet 'tis plain from the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Meaſures that they <hi>muſt,</hi> and from the Context of the place, that they <hi>ought</hi> to mean it only of Spiritual, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and neceſſary Truths, which may very well confiſt with their ſuppoſed Confinement of the Light.</p>
               <p>But how can this be ſo confined, when Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> teſtifies again, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that <hi>the Divine Light does aſſiſt the Natural Faculties of the Soul in the Attainment of Arts and Sciences?</hi> But <note place="margin">Page 6, 7.</note> how is this conſiſtent with what he ſays in the Beginning of his Book, where he calls this Corrupt Wiſdom, and the Forbidden Fruit, and what will prove Folly in the End, and the Wiſdom that is Below, and that which God's Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from Above ever did and will confound? See the Inconſiſtency and Unſincerity of this Writer! When it would ſerve his turn to diſparage and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62599:37"/>
down Human Learning, then 'tis Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Wiſdom, Forbidden Fruit, and I know not what. And when he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other turn to ſerve, (that is, to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict me) then this Wiſdom, as corrupt as it is, is taught us by the Inſtruction of the Divine Light. But ſtay, Sir, tho this Divine Light be not as you ſay the very Eſſence of God, yet is it ſo far divided againſt him, as to teach what is contrary to him, and what his Wiſdom ever did and will confound? Are the <hi>Divine Light</hi> and the <hi>Divine Wiſdom</hi> at ſuch Defiance with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? But 'tis Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> that is at De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance with himſelf, and I am afraid will not eaſily be reconciled. For if the Divine Light teaches this ſort of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, then 'tis not Corrupt, which contradicts what he ſaid in the <hi>other</hi> place; and if this ſort of Wiſdom be Corrupt, then the Divine Light does not teach it, (as being a Pure and Clean Principle, and ſuch as <hi>cannot conſent to</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 338.</note> 
                  <hi>any Evil or Wickedneſs)</hi> which contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts what he ſays <hi>here.</hi> So that either way Contradiction is his Doom.</p>
               <p>As to what I ſaid concerning the Quakers making the Light within a <hi>Supplement to Scripture,</hi> &amp;c. it was not
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62599:37"/>
intended as a direct and particular Ob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jection againſt them, of it ſelf, but only to confirm the other, wherein they are charged with confining it to Moral and Spiritual Truths in order to the Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Practice. For that being the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged End and Uſe of Scripture, it ſeems an high Preſumption, that what is made a Supplement to the Scripture, is alſo intended for the very ſame End and Uſe. And therefore Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> need not have oppoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt this as a direct and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Objection, it being not by me either intended or uſed as ſuch. For whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my Thoughts may be concerning the Sufficiency or Inſufficiency of the Scripture without the inward Light, I had no occaſion then, nor have any Mind at preſent to engage in a Diſpute about that matter. Only I would deſire Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> and his Brethren by the way to conſider, whether they can anſwer that Argument of <hi>Epiſcopius,</hi> whereby he proves the Vanity and Abſurdity of the <hi>Spiritualiſts,</hi> (as he calls them) in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Inward Word</hi> the Interpreter of Scripture. <hi>Either</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they will</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Inſtitut. Theolog. Pag. 253.</note> 
                  <hi>have that inward Word, as they call it, to have an intelligible Senſe in it, or not to have an intelligible Senſe. If they will
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62599:38"/>
have it to contain an intelligible Senſe, then they muſt grant that that Senſe being perceiv'd by the Underſtanding may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd and expreſs'd by outward Speech. And if ſo, then it follows that this Senſe may alſo be written, ſince whatever is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd by the Mouth, may alſo be expreſs'd in writing. But then this written Senſe will again be nothing elſe than an external Word, which being expreſt in Letters will according to them be nothing elſe but an inky Letter or Scripture, which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to be ſufficient. But if they will have this inward Word to have in it no intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Senſe, or that may be pronounc'd, or written, then it will neceſſarily follow, that this their Word is no Word, or only a vain and fooliſh Word. For ſuch muſt that Word be which has no Intelligible Senſe. If they ſay, that this Word is not perceiv'd but by him upon whom it is immediately impreſs'd by God. Then I ſay again, Either it is impreſs'd without any intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Senſe, or with it. If without any, then the ſame Difficulty will return,</hi> viz. <hi>That 'tis a vain and fooliſh Word. But if it be imprinted with intelligible Senſe, then what hinders but that it may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed and written? And then how will it differ from that written Word we have hitherto treated of?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62599:38"/>
But he tells me that theſe Words, <hi>Supplement to Scripture,</hi> are my own, not theirs. It may be ſo, I will not ſtand with Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> for a Word, ſince he is ſo kind to me as to acknowledg all that I intended by it, namely, That the Light is the Interpreter of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that the Scripture is not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient without it; without denying that 'tis not any thing more than a meer dead Letter, a Phraſe uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the Quakers to the Scripture conſider'd in its ſelf, as unaccompany'd with the Teſtimony of the Internal Light. For the further clearing of which Notion, when any of them write next, I would deſire them to take the Argument of the before-mention'd <hi>Learned Objector</hi> in their way.</p>
               <p>He tells me again that this, as 'tis an Objection, is built upon my Miſtake in my former Section, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers repreſent this Light within as a ſort of Extraordinary Inſpiration, which he ſays has been anſwer'd already in proving the <hi>Univerſality</hi> of the Divine Light. But I anſwer, Firſt, That this was not intended as a particular Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its ſelf, but only to ſecond and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62599:39"/>
inforce another. Secondly, That if it be an Objection, it is not built upon what he ſuppoſes, which is only a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake of his own concerning my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Word <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> which becauſe by me not oppoſed to Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, cannot be ſaid to be any way an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd by his proving the Univerſality of the Divine Light. Then as to what he ſays afterwards concerning my ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Quakers contemptuous of Holy Scripture, as uſeleſs to all but themſelves, in regard that 'tis held as a dead Letter without the Light, which Light according to my Conſtruction of their Principle, is an Extraordinary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, and a ſpecial Priviledg of a certain Order of Men, their own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I anſwer, That indeed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would be made uſeleſs to all but themſelves upon this double Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1. That 'tis a dead Letter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Light. And, 2. That this Light is their own peculiar Priviledg; but then this latter (upon which the Strength of the Objection turns) was not abſolutely charged upon them by me. For as for the Term <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,</hi> it has been more than once no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it was not uſed in a Senſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to <hi>Univerſal.</hi> And as for their
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62599:39"/>
making the Light a ſpecial Priviledg of a certain Order of Men, that this is not to be underſtood in ſuch a Senſe as will lay any Ground for my Adverſary's Complaint, will ſufficiently appear, when I come to conſider his Exception againſt the Fourth Article, to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of which I now proceed.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Exception againſt the Fourth Article.</head>
               <p>THE Fourth is a down-right Falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>viz.</hi> The Quakers make their Light within a Special Priviledg of a certain Order of Men, their own Party. Not indeed as to the Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, yet they do as to the Act, making none but thoſe of their own way to be actually enlightned by it. This is ſo abundantly confuted by the Writings in general of thoſe People, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the afore-recited Book of <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Barclay</hi>'s, which conſidering thou haſt read, I am the more amazed at thy Aſſertion. They ſay all are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enlightned by it, all are call'd, but all have not obeyed, according to thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Micah 6. 8. He hath ſhewed thee, O Man, what is good,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>John 9. 3, 19. 1 Cor. 13. 17. Tit.</hi> 2. 11. &amp;c. Thy Diſtinction of a Poſſibility, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62599:40"/>
not actually with reſpect to the Divine Illumination of this Principle is trivial, tho not with reſpect to Salvation by it. The Capacity or Poſſibility is not, nor can be in Man abſtract from the actual illuminating Power and Spirit, no more than ſeeing, if the Light be not ſeparate from the Eye. The Quakers have, and ſtill do declare, that Chriſt Jeſus, the Light of the World, is the Univerſal Eree Gift of God, for the Benefit of all Men, in order to their Salvation. And is not this Common, yet Special Priviledg, becauſe dearly purchas'd and freely beſtow'd on loſt Man? That thou may'ſt not want occaſion to traduce the Quakers, thou haſt ſo much over-done it in this Section, as to contradict thy ſelf in the Fifth. As for Inſtance, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. to be actually enlightned according to thy-Principle is no ſpecial Priviledg, but the common and univerſal Benefit of all Men, yea, of all the Intelligent Creation, who all ſee and underſtand in this Light of God, without which there would be neither Truth nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. On the contrary, Sect. 5. thou ſay'ſt, thy Light does not Formally enlighten or inſtruct thee, but when thou carefully attends to and conſults it, and read what is written in thoſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62599:40"/>
Divine Ideal Characters. The like Doctrin thou haſt, <hi>Pag.</hi> 71. of thy Book, Sect. 5. and 6. where, treating of thy double Illumination of the Divine <gap reason="foreign">

See what Contradiction thy ſtrain'd Notions run thee into? One while to be actually enlightned, is the Common and Univerſal Benefit of all Men; another while only of thoſe who conſult it and attend to it, and all to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void being thought to Symbolize with the Quakers in thy Notion of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light. Thy Diſtinction of Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially and Actually can have no more in it than the Difference in the Subject, the one Univerſal Act of the Word or Light enlightning every Man, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends both. Theſe are but new in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Terms to expreſs the moſt anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and more Divinely, and better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal'd Truths of the Goſpel.</p>

               <head>The Anſwer.</head>
               <p>THIS Exception ſeems to have in it the moſt of Subtilty and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice, and to be the moſt fair and plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of any: But I make no great Queſtion but that it will have as fair and clear an Anſwer as any of the reſt. And becauſe a Queſtion well ſtated, and put in a good Light, is half reſolv'd, I ſhall firſt of all define the Senſe and Meaning of my own Words in this Fourth Article, that ſo it may appear what it is that I there affirm, and what he does or ſhould deny, and wherein the Point of the Queſtion between us lies. Now when I ſay that the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers make their Light within a ſpecial Priviledg of a certain Order of Men, 'tis plain, Firſt, in general, from the Article its ſelf, that I do not mean as to the <hi>Capacity</hi> or <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> but as to the <hi>Act.</hi> For I grant as to the <hi>Poſſibility,</hi> that they ſuppoſe all Men to be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently capable of the Divine Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as appears from their contending againſt the Doctrin of Abſolute Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and for Univerſal Grace. I do not therefore make them to confine the Light as to the Poſſibility, but only
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62599:41"/>
as to the Act. And then as to the Act (in which reſpect alone I ſay they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine it) it is alſo very plain, that I mean not the Act of <hi>Having</hi> or <hi>Poſſeſſing</hi> the Light (for I know very well that 'tis one of their Fundamental Tenets, that God has Communicated and given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every Man a Meaſure of the Light of his Son, a Meaſure of Grace, or a Meaſvre of the Spirit, as Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apology, <hi>P.</hi> 330.</note> expreſſes it) but the Act of being <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned</hi> by it. And that this is my Meaning, the Tenor of my Words do ſufficiently ſhew, becauſe I there ſay, <hi>Tho they do not make it a ſpecial Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege as to the Poſſibility, yet they do as to the Act, making none but thoſe of their own way to be actually enlightned by it.</hi> Where by Act it is plain that I mean not the Act of <hi>Poſſeſſion,</hi> but the Act of <hi>Illumination.</hi> For Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> is to conſider, that 'tis one thing to have or to poſſeſs the Light, and another thing to be actually enlightned by it. And they who very zealouſly contend for the Univerſality of the former, may at the ſame time, and that without any Inconſiſtency, confine the Latter. Which is the thing that I affirm the Quakers do, <hi>viz.</hi> That tho they do not confine the Light either as to the Poſſibility
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62599:42"/>
of being enlightned by it, or as to the Act of having or poſſeſſing it, yet they do confine it as to the Act of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. That they do thus confine it, I will firſt ſhew, and then conſider what he alledges to the contrary, which I think is a fair and diſtinct way of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
               <p>That the Quakers do confine the Light as to the Act of Illumination to certain Men, or to Men of a certain Order, I think will be readily granted me, if I can ſhew that they do thus confine it to the <hi>Regenerate.</hi> And that they do ſo, I believe I can not only render exceeding Probable, but even <hi>Demonſtrate;</hi> which I undertake to do in this Form of Argument:</p>
               <p>They that do exclude all Men that are in their Natural and Corrupt Eſtate from the actual Illumination of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, do confine the Divine Light as to the Act of Illumination to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate.</p>
               <p>But the Quakers do exclude all Men that are in their Natural and Corrupt Eſtate from the Actual Illumination of the Divine Light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:62599:42"/>
Therefore the Quakers do confine the Divine Light as to the Act of Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination to the Regenerate.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Propoſitions is moſt evident. The Second I prove thus:</p>
               <p>They that do exclude all Men that are in their Natural and Corrupt Eſtate from any <hi>Senſation</hi> or Feeling of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, they do exclude all Men that are in their Natural Corrupt Eſtate from the Actual Illumination of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light.</p>
               <p>But the Quakers do exclude all Men that are in their Natural and Corrupt Eſtate from any Senſation or Feeling of the Divine Light.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Quakers do exclude all Men that are in their Natural Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Eſtate from the Actual Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine Light.</p>
               <p>The Firſt of theſe Propoſitions is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain moſt evident. And for the Proof of the Second, which alone requires it, I appeal to the Teſtimony of their moſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62599:43"/>
Authentic Writer Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> who in his Fourth Propoſition ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Natural Condition of Man, gives this expreſs Account of it, that he is not only fall'n, degenerated and dead, but <hi>deprived of the Senſation or Feeling of this Inward Teſtimony, or Seed</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 310.</note> 
                  <hi>of God; And is ſubject to the Power, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Seed of the Serpent, which he ſows in Men's Hearts, while they abide in this Natural and Corrupted Eſtate. From whence it comes, that not only their Words and Deeds, but all their Imaginations are Evil perpetually in the fight of God, as proceeding from this depraved and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Seed. Man therefore as he is in this ſtate can know nothing aright; yea, his Thoughts and Conceptions concerning God and Things Spiritual (until he be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd from this evil. Seed, and united to the Divine Light) are unprofitable both to himſelf and others.</hi> Thus Mr. <hi>Barclay.</hi> Now how far Man in his Natural and Corrupt Eſtate may be capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving rightly, either of God, or of Divine things, 'tis not my preſent Buſineſs to enquire or diſpute. But what I obſerve from theſe Words of Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> is this, That Natural Men, or Men in their Natural and Corrupt Eſtate, however they may have the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62599:43"/>
Divine Light in them Seminally or Radically, yet they have not (while in that ſtate) any Senſation or any Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it. They are his own expreſs Words. And if they have not any Senſation or Feeling of the Light, then they are not actually enlightned by it, which agrees with the Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore laid down, that tho they have the Light as to the Act of Poſſeſſion, yet they have it not as to the Act of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. And if all Natural Men are excluded from the actual Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine Light, then 'tis plain that the Divine Light as to the Act of Illumination, (tho not as to the Act of Poſſeſſion) is confined to the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Which was the Propoſition I undertook to prove.</p>
               <p>And that all Natural and Unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Men, tho they have the Divine Light lodg'd in them, are yet ſuppoſed to be deprived of all actual Illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by it, may be fairly collected from another remarkable place in Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi> where he uſes this as an Argument to prove, that the Light is a Subſtance not an Accident, becauſe it may be in the Heart of wicked Men without denominating them, that is, as appears
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62599:44"/>
by the Tenor of his Diſconrſe, without affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, or deriving any Influence or Vertue upon them. His Words are theſe, <hi>We know</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 334.</note> 
                  <hi>it to be a Subſtance, becauſe it ſubſiſts in the Hearts of Wicked Men, even while they are in their Wickedneſs. Now no Accident can be in a Subject, without it gives the Subject its own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination; as where Whiteneſs is in a Subject, there the Subject is call'd White. So we diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh betwixt Holineſs, as 'tis an Accident, which denominates Man ſo, as the Seed receives a place in him; and betwixt this Holy Subſtantial Seed, which many times lies in Man's Heart as a naked Grain in a Stony Ground. So alſo, as we may diſtinguiſh betwixt Health and Medicine. Health cannot be in the Body, without the Body be called Healthful. Becauſe Health is an Accident. But Medicine may be in a Body that is moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>healthful, for that it is a Subſtance.</hi> In which Words Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> does, as far as I can judg, plainly imply, that wicked Men, tho they have the Light really and truly in them, as well as thoſe that are good, yet they are not actually enlightned by it. It is indeed in their Hearts, but it lies dormant there like hot Embers cover'd up under the Aſhes, without affecting, or denominating, or enlightning them. For it ſeems, it lies in them as a naked Grain in a Stony Ground, and as Phyſic in a Body that is not at all wrought upon by it; that is, it lies there, and that's all. Which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to as much as if he had ſaid in the Words of the before-mention'd Diſtinction, that they have it indeed as to the Act of Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, but not as to the Act of Illumination.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62599:44"/>
Which muſt therefore be confined to good Men only, or to the Regenerate.</p>
               <p>To this purpoſe I might cite many other Paſſages which occur up and down in the Writings of Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> as when he ſays (as he does frequently) that the Divine Light or Seed lies in wicked Men, <hi>hurt, bruiſed, wounded, ſlain,</hi> yea, and <hi>buried.</hi> And when <note place="margin">Apology, <hi>p.</hi> 354.</note> he ſays that in <hi>this Seed in the Hearts of all Men is the Kingdom of God, as in Capacity to be produced, or rather exhibited, according as it receives Depth, is nouriſh'd and not choaked.</hi> And when he ſays that this Seed was in the <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Phariſees, as a Seed lying in a Barren Ground, which ſprings not forth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I forbear more Quotations, having I think already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced enough to make it plain and out of Queſtion that they do exclude all wicked Men from the actual Illumination, tho not from the actual Poſſeſſion of the Divine Light, or which is all one, that they confine the Divine Light to good Men, to the Regenerate, as to the Act of Illumination, tho not as to the Act of Poſſeſſion. In ſhort, All have it, but the regenerate only are actually enlightned by it.</p>
               <p>I may urge this alſo as another Argument to prove that they do confine the Light as to the Act of Illumination to a certain number of Men, becauſe (as every body knows that has had the leaſt Converſation either with them or their Writings) they do confine it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thoſe that turn their Soul and Mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inwards
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62599:45"/>
unto it, (for till then, as the Prefacer to Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Works ſays, <hi>Man is Darkneſs)</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 3.</note> at the ſame time ſuppoſing that not all, but a very few do ſo convert themſelves unto it. Upon which double Suppoſition are grounded their ſo often repeated Admonitions and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to thoſe they addreſs their Writings or Diſcourſes to, that they would turn their Souls inwards unto the Light, that they would mind, heed, follow it, and wait upon it in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and ſilence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which would be extremely ridiculous and impertinent, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Men might be enlightned without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting themſelves to the Light, or if it were certain and neceſſary that all Men ſhould ſo convert themſelves to it. Since therefore they do confine the Light as to the Act of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to thoſe that convert or introvert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to it, and at the ſame time do not make all Men to do ſo, it appears plainly that they do confine it to a certain number of Men.</p>
               <p>And ſince again (as is well known) they look upon themſelves as the only Profeſſors and Embracers of the Truth of God, and the only Followers of the Light, and the only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verters of themſelves to it, (which it ſeems is ſo much the proper Characteriſtic of a Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, that when any one is Proſelyted to their way, 'tis ordinary for them, to ſay, <hi>Such an one is turn'd to the Light)</hi> I think I had very good reaſon to ſay that they confined the Light to their own Party, meaning, (as plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and as I have often ſuggeſted) not as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62599:45"/>
to the Capacity or Poſſibility, nor as to the Act of Poſſeſſion, but only as to the Act of Illumination. That tho other Men as well as themſelves, yea, all Men have the ſame Light in them, yet <hi>they</hi> only ſee by it, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Illumination from it, becauſe they only turn themſelves unto it, and (to expreſs it in their more peculiar Phraſe) are <hi>Inward with it.</hi> Wherein I think they differ again ſufficiently from me, who am ſo far from confining the Divine Light in the leaſt reſpect or degree, that I extend it as a common Benefit to all Men without Exception, yea, to all the Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent part of the Creation (which by the way I do not find they do, nor do I ſee how upon their Principle they can, ſince making it the Grace of Chriſt they muſt confine it to <hi>Man)</hi> and that not only as to the Act of Poſſeſſion, but as to the Act of Illumination too, becauſe I expreſly ſay, that <hi>they all ſee and underſtand in this Light of God, without which there would be neither Truth nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to conſider what Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> alledges to the contrary: He ſays Firſt of all, that it is a down-right Falſity that the Quakers do thus confine the Light. But let him prove this to be a Falſity as well as ſay it. He ſays again, that 'tis abundantly confuted by the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Quakers in general, particularly thoſe of <hi>Robert Barclay.</hi> But I have made the contrary appear from thoſe very Writings. But he ſays again, that they ſay all are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enlightned by it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I return, That then they ſay Contradictions, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62599:46"/>
with themſelves. But he ſays again, that the Quakers have, and ſtill do declare, that Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World is the Univerſal Free Gift of God, for the Benefit of all Men, in order to their Salvation. But by Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> his leave this does not reach the Point in queſtion, as proving the Univerſality of the Light only as to the <hi>Capacity</hi> of being enlightned by it, or as to the Act of <hi>Poſſeſſion</hi> only, which I never ſuppoſed them to deny. But the Queſtion is concerning the Univerſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Light as to the Act of <hi>Illumination,</hi> which is not at all proved by ſaying, that Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World is the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal Free Gift of God, for the Benefit of all Men in order to their Salvation. But he further ſays, that my Diſtinction of a Poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and not Actually with reſpect to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Illumination of this Principle, is trivial. But why ſo? May there not be a Capacity of being enlightned where there is no actual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination? Are not theſe diſtinct <hi>Idea's?</hi> And may not therefore one be without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? But he ſays, the Capacity or Poſſibility is not, nor can be in Man abſtract from the actual illuminating Power and Spirit, no more than ſeeing, if Light be not ſeparate from the Eye. No? Why then do they ſo often di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the one from the other, in making all to be capable of Illumination by the Divine Light, when yet according to them all are not actually enlightned by it, nor any at all times? Of the Former, That all are not actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by it, I have already given an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count out of Mr. <hi>Barclay:</hi> And as to the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62599:46"/>
That none are actually enlightned by it at all times, the ſame Author is ſo kind as to furniſh me with an Account in another place, where he gives this as a Reaſon why the Light is no Power or Natural Faculty of a Man's Mind, becauſe he cannot be actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned by it at pleaſure, but muſt wait for the Irradiations of it. For, ſays he, <hi>This Light, Seed, &amp;c. appears to be no Power or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 338.</note> 
                  <hi>Faculty of Man's Mind, becauſe a Man that is in Health can, when he pleaſes, ſtir up, move and exerciſe the Faculties of his Soul. He is abſolute Maſter of them. But this Light and Seed of God in Man he cannot move and ſtir up when he pleaſes, but it moves, blows and ſtrives with Man as the Lord ſeeth meet. For tho there be a Poſſibility of Salvation to every man during the Day of his Viſitation, yet cannot a man at any time when he pleaſes ſtir up that Light and Grace, but he muſt wait for it,</hi> &amp;c. Bringing in the Compariſon the Lake of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel at certain times moving upon the Waters. From which Words of Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> it plainly appears, that no Man, tho never ſo cloſe a Follower of the Light, is under the actual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of it at all times; and yet the ſame Author does not deny, but every where earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly contend, that the Light is always in Man as well as in every Man; and if this be not to abſtract the Capacity or Poſſibility from the Act of Illumination by the Light, I deſpair ever to know what is. And why may not the Capacity of Illumination be abſtracted from the Act, ſince they are not only in themſelves diſtinct, but proceed from different Cauſes,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62599:47"/>
and between which there is (according to them) no neceſſary Connection. The former depending upon the <hi>in-being</hi> only of the Divine Light, and the latter upon the Soul's <hi>Introver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of it ſelf to it, without which ſhe will not be enlightned by that Light which ſhe bears. According to what Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> ſays upon that Text, <hi>Rom. 3. 11. There is none that</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Truth clear'd of Columnies, <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> 
                  <hi>underſtandeth:</hi> Why underſtand they not, but becauſe they are not turn'd to the Light that can give them Underſtanding?</p>
               <p>As to his Compariſon taken from ſeeing, which he will not have poſſible to be abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if Light be not ſeparated from the Eye. I anſwer, Firſt, That if there be any Force in it, 'tis againſt themſelves, as convincing them of Abſurdity in Abſtracting or Dividing what is not to be divided. For the Signification of it muſt be this, That as the Act of Seeing is not to be abſtracted from the Capacity when Light is not ſeparated from the <hi>Eye,</hi> ſo the Act of Illumination is not to be abſtracted from the Capacity of it, when the Divine Light is not ſeparated from the <hi>Soul.</hi> And why then do they abſtract the Act of Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation from the Poſſibility, when they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Divine Light to be preſent in the Soul; as 'tis plain they do when they reach, that 'tis not in the power of Man to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned when he pleaſe, tho the Light be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in him? If the actual Illumination of the Soul muſt neceſſarily follow upon the Preſence or Being of the Divine Light in it, then why do they abſtract it from it, by ſuppoſing that
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62599:47"/>
Man has it not always in his Power to move and ſtir up the Light, as was before noted? But indeed, whatever Connexion there may be between the Preſence of the Divine Light and the actual Illumination of the Soul, it does not follow that there is any from the Simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude he here uſes, in which there is no Force at all, the ground of it rightly conceived not being true. For <hi>Seeing</hi> may be either taken in a <hi>Material</hi> Senſe, for that Phyſical <hi>Impreſſion</hi> made upon the <hi>Retina</hi> by the Rays of Light that paſs in various Refractions through the ſeveral Humours of the Eye; or elſe in a <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> Senſe, for that <hi>Senſation</hi> of the Soul which ordinarily accompanies that Impreſſion, and whereby ſhe is conſcious of it. If Seeing be taken in the former Senſe, then indeed it will hardly be poſſible to abſtract the Act of See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Capacity of it, if the Light be not ſeparated from the Eye. But if Seeing be taken in the latter way, for the Senſation of the Soul, whereby ſhe is conſcious of that Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Impreſſion made upon the Organs of Sight, (which is the moſt proper acceptation of the Word Seeing) then the Act of Seeing may very well, and is often abſtracted from the Capacity of it; and that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Light be not ſeparated from the Eye: There being nothing more common than for Men, whoſe Minds are deeply fix'd upon ſome engaging Objects that call off and divert their Attention another way, not to obſerve what ſtands juſt before their Eyes, and what Phyſically and Materially ſpeaking they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not chuſe but ſee. So that this Compariſon
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62599:48"/>
as prettily as it looks, will not ſerve the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for which it is uſed. But I forget my ſelf; 'tis pity a good Similitude ſhould be ſpoil'd by being too nicely examin'd.</p>
               <p>And now as to the Contradiction which he pretends to find between the Fourth Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, where all Men are ſuppoſed to be actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlightned, and the Fifth, where the Light is ſuppoſed not Formally to enlighten me, but when I attend to it and conſult it: Tho he has ſo lately ſpoil'd his Credit with me in this point, that I ſhall not be very forward to take his Word for a <hi>Contradiction</hi> again, yet I ſhall not ſcruple to confeſs, that there is at firſt View ſome Appearance of Oppoſition between theſe two, but I think no more than what any Fair and Candid Reader may eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate, only by conſidering and collating together the two different occaſions upon which theſe two ſeemingly oppoſite Paſſages were deliver'd. For in the Fourth Section, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppoſe my Notion againſt the Quakers as to the Confinement of the Light to certain Men, as to the Act of Illumination, there I lay down this Aſſertion, That <hi>all Men are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enlightned.</hi> And in the Fifth Section, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to oppoſe my ſelf againſt another Notion of the Quakers, in making the Light to be ſome determinate form'd Dictate or Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expreſly and poſitively directive and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive; there I ſay, that it does not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally enlighten me but when I attend to it and conſult it, as being no Form'd Propoſition, but only the Eſſential Truth of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62599:48"/>
'tis plain that I do not deny the actual Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of all, (the thing aſſerted in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Section) but only determin the manner of it, that it is not done by any Propoſition rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy form'd and held forth to the Soul, but by the Soul's conſulting the Divine Idea's, or Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Truth of God. For when I ſay it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens Men only when they attend to it and conſult it, I do not ſuppoſe that there are any that are not actually enlightned, but that thoſe who are enlightned are enlightned <hi>by attending,</hi> ſuppoſing at the ſame time that all Men do in ſome meaſure attend to, and conſult the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Light, ſo far at leaſt, as is neceſſary to their common and ordinary way of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and to render them rational and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Beings. 'Tis true indeed, the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers do alſo make the Light to enlighten none but thoſe that convert themſelves to it: But then there is this material Difference between us, that they repreſenting the Light as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Acceſſion to the Order of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Underſtanding, and as a Saving Grace in the whole Kind of it, do not ſuppoſe it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that all ſhould turn themſelves to it: Whereas I not looking upon it as an Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Grace as to the whole kind, but as an ordinary Requiſite to Human Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, do ſuppoſe it neceſſary for all to turn to it, or conſult it ſo far, as to render them thinking and underſtanding Beings. And ſo long as I make all Men in ſome meaſure to conſult it, tho I do withal ſay, that they are enlightned by it only when they conſult it, I do not thereby deny that all are actually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlightned
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62599:49"/>
by it. For this does not deny the Univerſality of Actual Illumination, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determins and ſpecifies the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it. So that here is no Contradiction, but all things are Uniform and Confiſtent.</p>

               <head>Exception againſt the Fifth Article.</head>
               <p>THE Fifth I take in the Firſt Part of it to be the ſame in Subſtance with thy Firſt, differing in Form of Expreſſions, <hi>viz. The Quakers by their Light within underſtand ſome Determinate Formed Dictate or Propoſition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly or poſitively directing or inſtructing them to do ſo or ſo,</hi> as in thy firſt thou calledſt it <hi>ſome Divine Communication or Manifeſtation only.</hi> Where didſt thou learn this Definition of the Quakers Faith and Doctrin of the Light within? The Quakers believe the Light of Chriſt within to be God's Divine Oracle of Wiſdom in the Soul, the Former, Dictator and Determiner of Heavenly Propoſitions, them directing and inſtructing what to chuſe, and what to refuſe, as the Original Cauſe of the Knowledg and Love of Truth, which are its proper Effects. Now wherein is the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers Light, as thou term'ſt it, inferiour to that of thine, except in the differing Character thou giveſt it? They own the Real and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Truth of God, the Life of the Word, the Light of Men, as Chriſt ſaid of himſelf, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi> That this Divine Light, which is the Light of Men, is always in ſome Degree and Meaſure preſent
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62599:49"/>
in the Soul, by which it is upheld either in God's Love or Anger, the Quakers believe; and that in him we live, move, and have our Being, tho with reſpect to Operation after a different manner and meaſure, and paſſing the Underſtanding of Man. And whereas thou ſay'ſt, Thy Light is only the Eſſential Truth of God; This is an high Preſumption, about which I have already ſhew'd thy Confuſion in other places, calling it Reaſon and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a Man's Natural and Ordinary way of Underſtanding. Conſider <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 22, 23. The Light of the Body, &amp;c. <hi>If therefore the Light that is in thee be Darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. So may I ſay, if that Doctrin and Principle thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendeſt to the World for Truth and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency be erroneous and faulty, how great is that Error and Fault? Again, thou ſay'ſt, Thy Light is always preſent to thy Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and intimately united with it ſtill, <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. which in thy Senſe of the Light is to ſay, thy Soul is never without thy Reaſon and Conſcience. I wiſh they were both reform'd, that thou may'ſt be no more guilty of theſe and ſuch like falſe Aſperſions; That the Light, ſuppoſing it to be what really it is, a diſtinct Principle from the Soul, is always preſent to the Undeſtanding, which implies its Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the Natural Capacity or Organ, the ordinary means of knowing, I conceive is more than can be ſafely or experimentally ſaid, becauſe the Organ may be hurt, and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in that Senſe interrupted, and conſequently no fit Medium or Receptacle either for the Soul or its Light. Beſides, the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:62599:50"/>
Soul may be abſent from the Natural Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding by the Interpoſition of Spiritual, as well as Natural Cauſes, and yet preſent with the Light in its Spiritual way of Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But to ſay as thou doſt, that Thy Light is only the Eſſential Truth of God, and that it is always preſent to thy Underſtanding, and intimately united with it, and yet that it does not formally enlighten or inſtruct it, but when carefully attended to and conſulted, ſeems to diſcover a Contradiction in its ſelf, and to the Formal Reaſon of its Being, and Preſence, and Sufficiency in the one Act of the ſame Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as to the State and Nature of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Union. For how can any thing be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately united to its Principle, and not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of its Nature and Influences, which is the Reaſon and Manner of its Union? And how can this be, and not carefully attended to and conſulted? Is not this manifeſt Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? That the Preſence of the Light does en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and inſtruct all in ſome Senſe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, is ſufficiently proved by Scripture. By thy Word Formally Enlighten I apprehend thou intendeſt the Operative Exerciſe, as in <hi>Pag.</hi> 17. and as here applied to Light, ſignifies no more than actually to enlighten, <hi>ex parte Objecti.</hi> I grant ſuch as do not carefully attend to and conſult this Divine Light, do not wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Increaſes of it unto the Redemption and Salvation of their Souls.</p>
               <p>It is the Path of the Juſt that is as the ſhining Light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect Day. If the Light, as thou aſſerteſt,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62599:50"/>
doth not formally enlighten or inſtruct, but when carefully attended to and conſulted, how then ſhould it quicken and raiſe the Soul from Death to Life, according to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied experience of Holy <hi>David?</hi> And how doth God ſpeak once, yea twice, yet Man perceiveth it not, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 14, 15, 16, 17. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. How frequently doth the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain by his Prophets of his calling to his People to return and repent, but they would not anſwer? Note, the Call of God is not without Inſtruction, read <hi>Mic.</hi> 6. 8, and <hi>Prov.</hi> 1, from 20, to the end. And ſee what Wiſdom does alſo in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> how they rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, notwithſtanding he gave his good Spirit to inſtruct them. The Teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, the <hi>5th</hi> and <hi>21th, Epheſ 2. 1, 4, 5. 2 Cor.</hi> 4. 6, 7.

               <p>I Have given my ſelf the trouble to ſet down this Exception at large, not becauſe I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to anſwer it all, but that it may appear to the Diſcerning Reader, that there is a great deal of it which I need not anſwer, as being either anſwer'd already, or ſo very imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and remote from the buſineſs, that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no conſideration. But in the firſt place, I cannot but admire at the ſingular Happineſs of his Fancy, in imagining the former part of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62599:51"/>
the Fifth Article to be the ſame in ſubſtance with the Firſt, and to differ only in form of Expreſſion. In the Firſt it is ſaid, that the Quakers uſually talk of the Light within, as of ſome Divine Communication or Manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only; that is, as it has been explain'd, that they repreſent their Light, not as God himſelf, but only as a divine Communication, or as ſomething communicated or exhibited by God. In the Fifth, it is ſaid, That the Quakers by their Light within (that is as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective,) underſtand ſome determinate formed Dictate or Propoſition, expreſly and poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly directing and inſtructing them to do ſo or ſo: That is, that they make the Direction of the Light, or the Light as Directive, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in Dictates or Propoſitions ready form'd and preſented to the view of the Soul, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhe is formally taught and inſtructed. Now are theſe Two the ſame? If they are, ſo are a Square and a Circle, Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> and my Self, Quakeriſm and Primitive Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. But he demands of me where I learnt this Account of the Quakers Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Light within, <hi>viz.</hi> That they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent its direction by a determinate form'd Dictate or Propoſition? I anſwer, from one that may be preſumed to have dived into the bottom of Quakeriſm, and to have compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the whole Myſtery of it, as well as any Man of that Profeſſion, and that is Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> who ſpeaking of that Letter of our Maſter that is writ in our Hearts, ſays, <hi>Our</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Truth clear'd of Calumnies. <hi>p.</hi> 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Maſter is always with us, and he requires us to do all our Works by his immediate Counſel, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi>
                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:62599:51"/>
&amp;c. And again to the ſame effect, ſpeaking of the Jews rejecting Chriſt, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that they had the Scriptures, he reſolves it into this, <hi>becauſe they hearkned not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 16. P. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>unto the inward Voice and Teſtimony of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning him.</hi> Again, he ſpeaks of a Word in the Heart, and of the inward Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Spirit. Again, <hi>He writes them a living Copy in their Hearts.</hi> Again, he talks <note place="margin">P. 18.</note> of <hi>immediate Teaching</hi> of the Spirit, and of <hi>Preaching</hi> that comes immediately from the Spirit. He ſays further, that this ſaving Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <note place="margin">P. 28.</note> Light, is the Goſpel Preach'd in every Creature under Heaven. And that tho the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apology,</hi> p. 349.</note> outward Declaration of the Goſpel be taken ſometimes for the Goſpel, yet it is but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, and by a Metonymy. For to ſpeak properly, (ſays he,) the Goſpel is this inward Power and Life, which Preaches glad Tidings in the Hearts of all Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> More expreſly <note place="margin">Poſſibility and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>p.</hi> 896. Way to the City of God, <hi>p. 163. P.</hi> 170.</note> yet, Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> calls the Revelation of the Light, the Voice of God inwardly ſpeaking to the Mind of Man; and in this he makes the very form of Revelation to conſiſt. And Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> makes the Divine Light to be all one with the Divine Voice and Call; and to this he applies that of the Twenty Ninth Pſalm, <hi>The Voice of the Lord is a Glorious Voice.</hi> And to this purpoſe 'tis uſual with them to apply that of the Prophet <hi>Habakkuk, I will ſtand upon my Watch, and ſet me upon the Tower, and will watch to ſee what he will ſay unto me,</hi> Hab. 2. 1. And that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will hear what God the Lord will Speak,</hi> Pſal. 85. 8. All which Paſſages do plainly enough
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62599:52"/>
imply, that they repreſent the Direction of the Light after the manner of a determinate form'd Dictate or Propoſition formally and expreſly tutouring and inſtructing them. And Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> himſelf acknowledges as much in the Words immediately following his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, when he ſays that the Quakers believe the Light of Chriſt within to be God's Divine Oracle of Wiſdom in the Soul, the Former, Dictator and Determiner of Heavenly Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, them directing and inſtructing what to chooſe, and what to refuſe. Which how it differs from my Account, that they make it a determinate form'd Dictate or Propoſition expreſly directing and inſtructing them to do ſo or ſo, I confeſs my Eye-ſight too weak to diſtinguiſh. But if Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> be as good at finding out <hi>Differences,</hi> as he is at finding out <hi>Likeneſſes,</hi> perhaps he may be able to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them.</p>
               <p>As to what he ſays concerning the Light's not always actually operating upon the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, becauſe the Organ of Perception may be ſometimes indiſpoſed, he does not therein at all contradict me, who tho I make the Light to be common to all Men, even as to the act of Illumination in ſome degree or other, (enough to render and denominate them Rational Creatures,) yet am far enough from ſuppoſing with <hi>Deſcartes,</hi> that the Soul does at all times actually <hi>think.</hi> His Principle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obliges him ſo to ſuppoſe, becauſe he makes actual Cogitation to be of the very Eſſence of the Soul, as much as Extenſion is
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62599:52"/>
of the Eſſence of Matter. But my Principle does not any way oblige me to the like ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; nor do I ſuppoſe that the Soul is in every inſtant actually inllghten'd, or (in other words) that ſhe does always actually <hi>think.</hi> 'Tis plain ſhe does not, as in the caſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the Womb, and of Maturer Perſons when in a deep Sleep. Herein therefore Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> does not at all contradict me, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him as to this Point, that the Soul is not always in actual Illumination. But tho in this he does not contradict <hi>me,</hi> yet he very foully and groſly contradicts <hi>himſelf,</hi> in making at the ſame time the Preſence of the Light to the Underſtanding, to <hi>imply</hi> its <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> upon it, when according to his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he muſt acknowledge the Light to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſent with the Soul. And if always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, then according to him it muſt always operate, ſince the Preſence implies the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein he plainly contradicts himſelf. As he does again afterwards, when he taxes me of Contradiction and Inconſiſtency, in ſuppoſing the Light always preſent to my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and intimately united with it; and yet that it does not formally enlighten it, but when attended to and conſulted. This he ſays, diſcovers a Contradiction in it ſelf, and to the formal reaſon of its Being and Preſence, and Sufficiency in the one act of the ſame Principle, as well as to the ſtate and nature of Intimate Union. For how can any thing, ſays he, be intimately united to its Principle, and not partake of its Nature and Influences, which is the reaſon and manner of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62599:53"/>
its Union? In all which, he ſtill proceeds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his former Suppoſition, that the Preſence and Union of the Divine Light with the Soul, does neceſſarily imply and infer its operation upon it. And ſince upon the Principles of Quakeriſm 'tis acknowledg'd, and by Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> himſelf in this very exception openly confeſs'd, that the Light is always preſent; (for ſays he expreſly, <hi>that this Divine Light is always in ſome degree and meaſure preſent in the Soul, the Quakers believe;)</hi> this plainly contradicts what he had laid down before, that the Light does not always operate upon the Underſtanding, and that to ſay that it does, is more than can ſafely be ſaid. Why more than can ſafely be ſaid, if the Divine Light be always preſent to the Soul; and if the Preſence of the Light does neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer its actual Operation? I may ask here of him in his own Words, <hi>Is not this manifeſt Confuſion?</hi> Nay, is it not withal manifeſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and downright Inconſiſtency? If not, I will never pretend to judge of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction again.</p>
               <p>As to the Contradiction, he would ſain faſten upon me, becauſe I ſuppoſe the Light always preſent, and yet not actually to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten but when attended, 'tis evident that it is of no force, unleſs I had held the ſame Principle with him, that the bare Preſence of the Light does infer its actual Operation on the Soul; and then indeed I had been guilty of Contradiction, as he plainly is. But I do not acknowledge the truth of that Principle,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62599:53"/>
that the bare Preſence of the Light does of it ſelf infer its actual Operation, and that for the ſame reaſon he himſelf has provided ready to my Hands, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the <hi>Organ</hi> of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception may be <hi>indiſpoſed.</hi> There muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the Diſpoſition of the Organ as well as the Prefence of the Light. Among which Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, the moſt immediate is <hi>Attention,</hi> which I therefore make neceſſary to actual Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, not intending thereby to deny the Univerſality of actual Illumination but only to ſpecifie and determine the manner of it, ſuppoſing at the ſame time, that all Men do attend in ſome meaſure or other, tho not at all times, or in every inſtant of their Lives.</p>
               <p>Now as to thoſe Texts of Scripture he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts upon to prove that our Illumination is not by Attention, becauſe the Grace of God prevents Man's turning to him; which I think is the ſhort of what he deduces in many Words. To this I return this double Anſwer, 1. That if there be any force in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it falls as heavy upon themſelves as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, becauſe (as 'tis well known) they alſo make turning to the Light, which is the very ſame with my Attention, to be a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary requiſite to actual Illumination. 2. That there is no force in the Argument; for the word <hi>Turning</hi> here is Equivocal, and may ſignify either the Moral Converſion of the Will to Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, which is the fruit of true Illumination, or that Simple Converſion of the Underſtanding to the Light
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62599:54"/>
of God, which is the cauſe of it. If the former, then I grant that the grace of God does In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten Man, before Man can turn to him; that is, a Man is firſt Inlightned before he is Converted. But if the latter, I deny that God does Inlighted Man, before Man turns to him; nor do the Texts cited by him prove it. Man muſt firſt Convert himſelf to the Divine Light, and attend it, before he can be inlightned by it: For 'tis by Man's Attention to the Light, that the Light has any actual Influence upon his Mind. Nor is this any derogation to the Grace of God, to ſay that Attention is on Man's part a prerequiſite Condition to Illumination, becauſe 'tis by the Grace of God that he is firſt moved and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to attend. For the work of Divine Grace does not (as Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> ſeems to fancy) conſiſt in this, in Inlightning Man without his Attending, but in ingaging and inciting him to Attend, which ſince I acknowledge, I may without any derogation to the Grace of God ſay, that Man muſt Attend, before he can be Inlightned; or that without Attention, there is no Illumination. As ſuppoſe I ſhould ſay, (what is commonly preſumed as true in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſcourſes,) that <hi>Conſideration is the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Repentance,</hi> I do not thereby either exclude or prejudice the Grace of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis by the Motions of that, that the Man is brought to conſider. And now I think I have anſwered all that is Material in this Fifth Exception.</p>

               <p>THy Sixth and laſt Section, I take to be an extravagant Noiſe and Bluſter againſt the Quakers, to ſupply the want of real matter of Objection. What means elſe ſo great and general Reflections, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any proof, or reducing it to a particular Charge? To ſay the Quakers do not offer any rational or intelligible account of their Light within, proves nothing. To tell the World as thou doſt, they Cant in ſome looſe and general Expreſſions about the Light, does little elſe but impoſe upon truſt, which is to beg Credit, whilſt thou mentioneſt not what thoſe looſe and general Expreſſions are. But to ſay they confirm them by the Authority of St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel, is in ſome ſort to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict thy Aſſertion; for ſo to confirm them, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues they agree to what is there taught, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>IN the Sixth and Laſt Article againſt which he now excepts, I had charged the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers with not offering any rational or intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible account of their Light within, neither as to the <hi>Thing,</hi> nor as to the <hi>Mode,</hi> which I then thought, and do ſtill, to be altogether unprincipled and unphiloſophical. Now this he is pleaſed to call Noiſe and Bluſter, and complains of it as a general Charge without
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62599:55"/>
any Proof. 'Tis true, I did not prove it then, not becauſe I diſtruſted my ability to do ſo, but becauſe it would have ingaged me upon a Subject too large for my undertaking at that time, which was only to point out in ſhort thoſe principal Heads of Difference which diſtinguiſh'd my notion of the Divine Light within, from that of the Quakers. But ſince he is pleaſed to call upon me for a Proof of this now, I will be ſo civil as to give it him, tho I believe he will find occaſion by that time I have done, to wiſh he had never put me upon this Undertaking. For I doubt not but that I am able to make my Words good, by ſhewing the Quakers Notion of the Light to be indeed unprincipled and unphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical. But becauſe this is a general Charge, and ſuch as concerns the intire Body of their <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> concerning the Light, I ſhall not do it here, but ſhall rather refer it to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Treatiſe by it ſelf, which I intend as an Appendix to this, under the Title of <hi>The Groſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſ of the Quakers Notion of the Light within, with their Confuſion and Inconſiſtency in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it;</hi> which I ſuppoſe will be a full Anſwer to this laſt Exception. In which therefore I ſhall only further take notice for the preſent, of a pleaſant fancy of our Author, in ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that I make their Expreſſions about the Light, agreeable to what is taught in St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel, becauſe I ſay that they <hi>confirm</hi> them by that Authority. Whereas it is plain that I mean no more than that they alledge the authority of St. <hi>John's</hi> Goſpel for their Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

which is the common ſenſe of the Word <hi>Confirm,</hi> as it is uſed by the beſt <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Authors. If Mr. <hi>Vickris</hi> does not know this, he is very Ignorant; if he does, he is very light and trifling.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>WHAT you obſerve to me con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the general Exultation and Triumph that is among the <hi>Quakers</hi> upon the late Publication of Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Works in Folio, is what I can eaſily <hi>believe,</hi> and know not well how to <hi>blame.</hi> For I know of no Church or Society of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that is already ſo rich in Reputation for Great Men, but might well be proud of the Acceſſion of ſo conſiderable a Writer, much more they who have hitherto been ſo barren in Productions of this kind, that in ſtead of having many <hi>Intelligent</hi> Writers, they have had but few that are ſo much as <hi>Intelligible.</hi> We may therefore well allow the Quakers to ſwell and plume a little, when they have at once ſo <hi>Rare</hi> and ſo <hi>Great</hi> an Occaſion for it. For really, <hi>Sir,</hi> Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> is a very great Man, and were it not for that common Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice that lies againſt him, as being a <hi>Quaker,</hi> would be as ſure not to fail of that Character in the World, as any of the fineſt Wits this Age has produced.</p>
               <p>But to qualify and allay their Joy, that they may not be overſet with it, you ſuggeſt to me that it would be convenient if they were now a little taken down and humbled, to which I aſſent as a very proper and ſeaſonable
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62599:58"/>
Undertaking, and withal as now worthy of the greateſt of our Learned Pens. For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forbear thinking <hi>Quakeriſm</hi> to be now conſiderable enough to deſerve an Oppoſition, and that if any of the Learned would with Credit and Reputation attempt the Confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it, now is their Time, now their looſe and ſcatter'd Notions are reduced to Order and Method, and appear under the Form of a Regular and Artificial Syſtem, with all the Advantages that can be given them from a Scholaſtical Head, and a well-order'd Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now therefore there would be ſome Adventure in the Engagement, and Honour in the Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>And thus far, Sir, I agree with you, thinking an Undertaking of this kind to be as proper and ſeaſonable as any that the Juncture of the preſent Age can afford; I only diſſent from you in the Choice of the <hi>Undertaker,</hi> who I doubt is not ſo well qualify'd for ſuch a Work as you who are not ſo well acquainted with him as I, ſeem to imagin. However, ſince you are pleas'd to impoſe your Commands upon him, he is loath wholly to decline them even while he knows himſelf unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form them, but does ſo far prefer his Duty to his Reputation as to be willing to lead the way, and to flouriſh a little upon the Strings, in hopes that his aukward and inartificial touching of them may provoke ſome more <hi>Maſterly</hi> Hand to take up the Inſtrument.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62599:58"/>
By this, Sir, you may perceive that 'tis nor my Deſign to examin the whole Body of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm, which indeed would require more leiſure and opportunity than the ordinary Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeſs and particular Engagements of my Life will conveniently allow. I ſhall chuſe rather to ſingle out one of their moſt Capital and Fundamental Principles, and to expoſe the Groſſneſs and Abſurdity of it, and that is, their Famous Doctrin of the <hi>Light within,</hi> which you know, Sir, to be the very Heart of their Cauſe, that Cardinal Point upon which the whole Weight of their Syſtem turns, the very Life and Soul of Quakeriſm.</p>
               <p>I know very well, nor can you, I ſuppoſe, be ignorant, that this Principle of theirs, ſince its firſt appearance in the World, has been all along entertain'd with Laughter and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and tho by themſelves the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded of any, (for there is no Point of theirs upon which they lay ſo much Streſs as upon this) has yet by others been moſt of all Vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ridiculed, and has contributed the moſt of any one thing to that great and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Contempt they lie under, next to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Oddneſs of their Habit and Ayr, and the Uncourtlineſs of their Language and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
               <p>Nor is there any thing either ſtrange or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs thus far. For certainly this Notion of the Light within, according as the Quakers explain and repreſent it, is really ridiculous enough to make the Patrons of it ſo, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62599:59"/>
well deſerves all the Scorn and Contempt that is caſt upon it. But that which I particularly obſerve as blamable in this matter, is this, that me generality of thoſe who deride the Doctrin of the Light within, know not upon what Grounds they do it; nay, for the moſt part, they do it upon no other Grounds, than bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to indulge the humerſom Inclinations of a certain light and wanton Spirit that loves to diſparage and run down all novel and ſingular Opinions, eſpecially if they carry in them an Ayr of Seriouſneſs or Religion. And of thoſe few that proceed by more certain Grounds and Meaſures of Judgment, the greateſt part proceed by falſe and undue ones, condemning the Doctrin of the Light within not as 'tis held and repreſented by the <hi>Quakers,</hi> (for to my Knowledg very few even of the Learned have given themſelves the Curioſity to know how they hold it) but in <hi>Groſs,</hi> and in <hi>General.</hi> They condemn the Doctrin not as ſo or ſo ſtated, but in common, and as ſuch, in its moſt direct and immediate Senſe, thinking it abſurd to ſuppoſe that there is any other Principle of Light in Man beſides his Rational Soul, which they will have to be a Light to it ſelf, at leaſt as far as concerns Natural and Moral Truths.</p>
               <p>Now herein I confeſs I am ſo far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing with theſe Gentlemen of the Second Order (for the former are of no account) that I think they do very ill in deriding and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling this Doctrin of the Light within in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and as ſuch, and are guilty of more Impiety
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62599:59"/>
and Profaneneſs than they are aware of. For upon the deepeſt Conſideration of all the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ways of Human Underſtanding I am thoroughly perſwaded, (and have partly ſhewn the Grounds of this my Perſwaſion elſewhere) that Man cannot be his own Light, or a Light to himſelf in the acquirement of Knowledg, and therefore that there muſt of neceſſity be ſome other Principle of Light in him diſtinct from his own Rational Nature; which you know I make to be the <hi>Divine Ideas,</hi> the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the Subſtantial Word and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, in whom I ſuppoſe Man to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all that he perceives. I am therefore ſo far from diſallowing or condemning the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin of the Light within, that I very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand and contend for it, as for a very true, ſolid and neceſſary Notion, without which there can be no intelligible Account given of the Mode of Underſtanding. I am therefore ſo far from taxing the Quakers for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Suppoſition they go upon, that I heartily joyn with them in it, ſuppoſing, as they do, that <hi>Man cannot be a Light to himſelf;</hi> only I adhere more cloſely to this Suppoſition than they do. For when they make Man uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being a Light to himſelf, they mean, not as to <hi>Natural</hi> things, (which according to them may be diſcern'd by a Natural Light) but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to <hi>Spiritual</hi> things, which cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd but by an Higher Principle. Whereas I acknowledg the Suppoſition in a greater Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſuppoſing Man uncapable of being a Light to himſelf, not only with reſpect to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Truths, but even as to Natural things,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62599:60"/>
all which are diſcern'd by that one common Light of Man, the <hi>Divine Light,</hi> which I make to be neceſſary not only to the Diſcernment of Divine and Spiritual Truths, but even to the Natural and Ordinary Acts of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>I do not therefore find Fault with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers for holding ſuch a thing as the <hi>Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in;</hi> ſo far from that, that I very much out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do them in the Latitude of the Principle, as making it more neceſſary, and more extenſive than they. I do not (as ſome do) diſapprove of the Doctrin in general, but have a very convincing Aſſurance of it, and a very awful Regard and Veneration for it, as a very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and Sacred Theory. But that which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn in the Quakers as to this Point, is their particular manner of ſtating and explaining the general Notion of the <hi>Light within,</hi> which I think to be as Groſs and Abſurd, as the Notion it ſelf in general is fine and rational. And that upon this double Account.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. Becauſe they make it to be a Creature.</item>
                  <item>II. Becauſe they make it a Material Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Upon which two Grounds I queſtion not but that I ſhall be able ſo to demonſtrate the Falſehood and Abſurdity of this grand Article of Quakeriſm, as to render it utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Defence, even tho Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> himſelf were now alive to be my Oppoſer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:62599:60"/>
But becauſe this is to be the Ground and Bottom of the following Diſcourſe, and that I may not be thought to contend againſt a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſititious Notion, or Imaginary Abſurdity, I muſt take care in the firſt place, that this which is to be the Foundation of all, be well laid, by proving plainly and undeniably that the Quakers do repreſent their Light within after the manner already intimated, <hi>viz.</hi> As a <hi>Creature,</hi> and as a <hi>Material Creature,</hi> before I undertake to expoſe their Abſurdity in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. In order to which I muſt give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Light within, and ſhew what it is according to the Quakers. Wherein I believe (ſo little have the Principles of Quakeriſm been enquired into, even by thoſe that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs take the liberty to laugh at them) I ſhall tell a great many even of the Learned World a conſiderable piece of News.</p>
               <p>And here to reduce the matter to as narrow a Compaſs as may be, (there being nothing wherein I admire Brevity more than in <hi>Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions)</hi> I ſhall be content to take my Account from two of their moſt eminent and approved Writers, Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> and Mr. <hi>Keith;</hi> and to prevent all ſuſpicion of Miſrepreſentation, ſhall deliver it in their own expreſs Words. Thus then Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> ſpeaking of the Univerſal and Saving-Light of Chriſt, <hi>By this Seed,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apology, <hi>P.</hi> 333.</note> 
                  <hi>Grace and Word of God, and Light wherewith we ſay every Man is enlightned, and hath a meaſure of it, which ſtrives with them in Order to ſave them, and which may by the Stubbornneſs and

Wickedneſs of Man's Will be quenched, bruiſed wounded, preſſed down, ſlain and crucified, we underſtand not the proper Eſſence and Nature of God preciſely taken; which is not diviſible into Parts and Meaſures, as being a moſt pure ſimple Being, void of all Compoſition or Diviſion, and therefore can neither be reſiſted, hurt, wounded, crucified or ſlain by all the Efforts and Strength of Men. But we underſtand a Spiritual, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and Inviſible Principle, in which God, as Father, Son and Spirit dwells: A meaſure of which Divine and Glorious Life is in all Men as a Seed, which of its own Nature draws, invites and inclines to God. And this we call</hi> Vehicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Dei, <hi>or the Spiritual Body of Chriſt, the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, which came down from Heaven, of which all the Saints do feed, and are thereby nouriſh'd unto Eternal Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From which Account of Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> it is plain, 1. That they do not make their Light within to be <hi>God,</hi> (for he ſays they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not by it the proper Eſſence and Nature of God) and conſequently muſt make it to be a <hi>Creature,</hi> there being no Medium between God and the Creature. 2. That they do al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo make it to be a <hi>Material</hi> Creature, ſince he ſuppoſes it diviſible into Meaſures and Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, calls it <hi>Vehiculum Dei,</hi> and the Spiritual Body of Chriſt, and that Fleſh and Blood of his which came down from Heaven, and which is both Food and Nouriſhment to the Saints. None of which Affections can with any tolerable Congruity agree to a Spiritual Subſtance, ſtrictly ſo call'd. Again, ſays Mr.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62599:61"/>
                  <hi>Barclay,</hi> diſcourſing of the Communion or Participation of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, <hi>The Body then of Chriſt which Believers partake</hi>

                  <hi>of, is Spiritual, and not Carnal, and his Blood which they drink of is pure and Heavenly, and not Human or Elementary. If it be asked, what that Body, what that Fleſh and Blood is? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, it is that Heavenly Seed, that Divine, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, Celeſtial Subſtance of which we ſpake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the 5th and 6th Propoſitions;</hi> (the place juſt before quoted) <hi>This is that</hi> Vehiculum Dei, <hi>or Spiritual Body of Chriſt, whereby and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>through he communicateth Life to Men, and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to as many as believe in him, and receive him, and whereby alſo Man comes to have Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Communion with God.</hi> Again, ſays he, <note place="margin">Page 495.</note> 
                  <hi>That this Body and Spiritual Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt is to be underſtood of that Divine and Heavenly Seed before ſpoken of by us, appears both by the Nature and Fruits of it.</hi> And again, <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>That Chriſt underſtands the ſame thing here by his Body, Fleſh and Blood which is underſtood,</hi> John 1. <hi>By the Light enlightning every Man, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>As Jeſus Chriſt did by the Eternal Spirit offer up that Body,</hi> (meaning his Carnal Body) <hi>for a Propitiation for the Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, ſo hath he likewiſe poured forth into the Hearts of all Men a meaſure of that Divine Light and Seed wherewith he is cloathed,</hi> &amp;c. I ſhall quote but one Paſſage more from Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> to this purpoſe, and 'tis in his laſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning the Poſſibility and Neceſſity of inward Immediate Revelation, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſtinguiſh'd between Natural and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Ideas, he ſays, <hi>As the Natural Ideas
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62599:62"/>
are ſtir'd up in us by outward and natural Bodies, ſo thoſe Divine and Supernatural Ideas are ſtirr'd up in us by a certain Principle, which is a Body in Naturals, in relation to the Spiritual World, and therefore may be call'd a Divine Body. Not as if it were a part of God, who is a moſt pure Spirit; but the Organ or Inſtrument of God, by which he worketh in us, and ſtirreth up in us theſe Ideas of Divine things. This is that Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, by which the Saints are nouriſh'd, which is a Myſtery to all unregenerated and meer natural men,</hi> &amp;c. <note place="margin">Page 901.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Here we meet with a Continuation of the ſame Notion. For as in the former Inſtances he made the Light to be all one with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Body of Chriſt, and again reciprocally the Spiritual Body of Chriſt to be the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame thing with the Light, ſo now ſuppoſing our Spiritual Ideas to be raiſed by a Divine Body, he makes this Divine Body to be no other than that Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt by which the Saints are nouriſh'd, and which he had before made all one with the Light, and conſequently he makes the Light to be a Divine Body. For if the Light be the ſame with that Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt by which the Saints are nouriſh'd; and if that Fleſh and Blood be a Divine Body, then 'tis plain that the Light is alſo a Divine Body.</p>
               <p>So much at preſent for Mr. <hi>Barclay.</hi> Now let Mr. <hi>Kieth</hi> take his turn, who in his Way <note place="margin">Page 64.</note> to the City of God, ſpeaking of the Divine Seed (which they always make one and the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62599:62"/>
ſame with the Light) ſays, That <hi>it is call'd oft in Scripture the Body of Chriſt, and his Fleſh and Blood, which the Soul feeding upon becomes cloath'd therewith, as with a Body, and thereby dwelleth in Chriſt, and liveth in him, as the Branch in the Vine.</hi> Again, <hi>The Saints feel it</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> (namely the Divine Seed or Light) <hi>in them as really to be a Part or Particle of the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Heaven,</hi> viz. <hi>Of that Spiritual and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible Heaven where the Saints live, as they do feel the Body of their outward Man to be a Part or Particle of the Subſtance of this outward World.</hi> Again he ſays, that this Divine Seed <note place="margin">Page 130.</note> (or Light) <hi>is not the Godhead it ſelf, but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain middle Nature, Subſtance or Being, betwixt the Godhead and Mankind,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This will be thought the more ſtrange</hi> (ſays he) <hi>by many, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been commonly taught, and have commonly received it, that there is no middle Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance betwixt the Godhead and us, at leaſt as to the inward: For they have ſuppoſed that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Mind of a Man or an Angel is next unto the Godhead, which I deny; for the Heavenly or Divine Subſtance or Eſſence of which the Divine Birth was both conceiv'd in</hi> Mary, <hi>and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly conceiv'd in the Saints, is of a middle Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leſt by their Calling (as they often do) this Subſtance a Divine Subſtance, they ſhould be thought to imply that it was the very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of God, he takes care to lay in a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt any ſuch Conſtruction in the next Paragraph. <hi>This middle Nature</hi> (ſays he) <hi>I call</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                  <hi>a Divine Subſtance or Eſſence, not as if it were
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62599:63"/>
the Godhead it ſelf, or a Particle or Portion of it, but becauſe of its Excellency above all other things next unto the Godhead; as on ſuch an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Men do call other things Divine which are very excellent; yea, ſome call Holy Men Divine, and ſome call theſe who teach the things of God, Divines, as</hi> John, <hi>who wrote the Revelations, is call'd</hi> John the Divine. <hi>Alſo this excellent and intermediate Being may be call'd the Divine Being, becauſe the Godhead is moſt immediately manifeſt therein, and dwelleth in it as in the moſt Holy Place, or Holy of Holies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He further tells us, ſpeaking of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that God did <hi>really ſow a moſt Divine and Heavenly Seed in</hi>

                  <hi>that Subſtantial, above all other Men.</hi> Again, he ſays, that <hi>his Body hath not only the Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Page 133.</note> 
                  <hi>of our Body, but alſo much more, becauſe of its being generate not only of the Seed of</hi> Mary, <hi>but of a Divine Seed, and that this Divine Seed is that <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Balſom or Medicin to cure and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

                  <hi>of Nature either in Man, or in other things, but
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62599:63"/>
his incorruptible Body?</hi> &amp;c. All which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions do plainly intimate, that this Divine Seed whereof Chriſt was generated, and we are regenerated, (for according to them, that which was the Principle of Chriſt's Natural Birth, is the Principle of our Spiritual Birth) was really, a material corporeal Subſtance; and ſince the Light is by them ſuppoſed to be all one with this Divine Seed, it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they make the Light to be alſo a material corporeal Principle. The ſhort of this matter lies in this Form of Argument.</p>
               <p>The Divine Seed whereof Chriſt was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally generated, and whereby we are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated is a Body.</p>
               <p>But the Light within is one and the ſame thing with this Divine Seed.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Light within is a Body.</p>
               <p>And thus do theſe two great Pillars of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keriſm Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> and Mr. <hi>Keith</hi> agree with each other, and both of them in this, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Light within not to be God or a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance properly Divine, but to be a Creature, and more than that, to be a Material and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal Creature.</p>
               <p>But that the Reader may have yet a more full Account, and more clear and exact Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of this matter, I will take their Hypotheſis from the very Ground and Bottom of it, and reſolve it into certain diſtinct Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:62599:64"/>
or Suppoſitions, which (as far as I am able to gather from the forecited and other like Paſſages that occur up and down in their Writings) are ſuch as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſuppoſe that the Spiritual Life, or the Life of Holineſs and Grace, is a Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Life, even as the Life of Vegetation, the Life of Senſation, and the Life of Reaſon are all Subſtantial.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſuppoſe that this Subſtantial Life is by the Vital Union of the Soul with ſome Body or other.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They ſuppoſe that this Body in the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Union of the Soul with which Spiritual Life does conſiſt, is a certain <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial</hi> Body, even as the Natural Life does conſiſt in the Vital Union of the Soul, with a <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Terreſtrial</hi> Body of the common E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary conſiſtence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They ſuppoſe that Chriſt had Two Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of a diſtinct Original, and of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent contexture, a Carnal Body, and a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body, a Body which he took from the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and a Body in which his Soul exiſted long before he took Fleſh of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. They are the very Words of Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apology Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>p.</hi> 861.</note> which becauſe they are of particular concernment, I will ſet down at large. To the Queſtion of his Adverſary, Had Chriſt Two Bodies? He anſwers, <hi>Yes; and let him deny it if he dare, without contradicting the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62599:64"/>
Scripture,</hi> Joh. 6. 58. <hi>Chriſt ſpeaks of his Fleſh which came down from Heaven; but this was not the Fleſh he took from the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>for that came not down from Heaven; but he had a Spiritual Body, in which his Soul exiſted long before he took Fleſh of the Virgin.</hi> Which I think is an expreſs Declaration for a Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Body of Chriſt, the Body wherein he was Incarnate, and a Body antecedent to his Incarnation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They ſuppoſe that this latter, the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Body of Chriſt, is that Divine or Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial Body in the Vital Union of the Soul, with which our Spiritual Life, or our Life of Grace does conſiſt; that this is properly that Seed of God mention'd by St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>John,</hi> which was ſown in the Womb of the Virgin, and in the Hearts of Mankind, that whereby Chriſt was naturally generated, and whereby the Saints are regenerated, that this is that Heavenly Manna, that Living Bread diſcours'd of in the Sixth of St. <hi>John,</hi> that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aliment upon which the Saints do feed, and whereby they are nouriſh'd unto everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Life.</p>
               <p n="6">6. And Laſtly, they do alſo ſuppoſe that this Spiritual Body of Chriſt wherein his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Soul exiſted before his Incarnation, a meaſure whereof is given as a Divine Seed to every Man to Leven, Seaſon and Sanctifie his Nature, and by cloſing and uniting with which our Nature becomes actually Sanctified, that this I ſay is that very <hi>Divine Light</hi> which
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62599:65"/>
God has ſet up as a Monitor, Inſtructer and Teacher in the Hearts of Men, to guide and direct them in the way of Salvation: That this Spiritual Body of Chriſt, is what they ſuppoſe to be the Light of Mankind, I need appeal to no other Evidence than the latter part of the firſt Quotation out of Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay,</hi> where he ſays that they underſtand by the Light, <hi>a Spiritual, Heavenly and Invincible Principle, in which God as Father Son and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit dwells, a meaſure of which Divine and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Life is in all Men as a Seed, which of its own nature draws, invites and inclines to God. And this we call</hi> (obſerve) Vehiculum Dei, <hi>or the Spiritual Body of Chriſt, the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt which came down from Heaven, of which all the Saints do Feed, and are thereby nouriſhed unto Eternal Life.</hi> By which I think it is plain as far as Mens meanings may be gather'd from their Words, that they make the Light within to be the Spiritual Body of Chriſt, or a certain meaſure or Portion of that Body.</p>
               <p>And thus having according to the beſt of my Underſtanding and Obſervation given an Extract of the Quakers Principle concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Light within, (which I have ſo well conſider'd both before and after the framing it, that I can with good aſſurance ſtand by it, and dare appeal to all the Learned of that way, whether I have not given a true and juſt account of their Principle.) I now haſten to the Second part of my Undertaking, to expoſe the Groſſneſs and Abſurdity of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62599:65"/>
And here in the firſt place, I ſhall be ſo free and ingenuous, as to declare that I ſhall not ſtand with them concerning any of the Five Firſt Propoſitions, which may be all true for ought I know to the contrary. Particularly I ſhall not ſtand with them concerning the <hi>Spiritual Body</hi> of Chriſt, as diſtinct from that Natural Body, wherein he was incarnate of the Virgin <hi>Mary:</hi> There may be ſuch a thing for ought I know, or am able to ſhew to the contrary, and I know that ſeveral among the <hi>Antients</hi> have been of this Opinion, alledging for its Foundation the Sixth Chapter of St. <hi>John,</hi> which to confeſs the truth, ſeems to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it not a little. And this Hypotheſis has been of late to the great ſurprize and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtiffer and ſeverer ſort of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, readvanc'd by a Perſon of ſingular note and eminence in our Church, who makes uſe of it to ſalve and maintain the Doctrin of the <hi>Real Preſence,</hi> ſuppoſing that while the Bodies of the Communicants feed upon the groſſer Elements of Bread and Wine, their Souls (as many of them as are fitly diſpoſed) do take in and feed upon this Divine and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Body of Chriſt, which ſtrengthens and nouriſhes their <hi>Inner Man,</hi> and becomes to them a Principle of Regeneration and Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life, as you may ſee more fully deduc'd in his Diſcourſe of the Real Preſence, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Firſt and Sixth Chapters of that Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62599:66"/>
I ſhall not therefore, I ſay, contend with them concerning the Spiritual Body of Chriſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as to its Exiſtence, or as to this its uſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſuch a thing, or whether it be the Principle of Regeneration and Spiritual Life to the Saints: They may be both true for ought I know, I ſee nothing abſurd or ſo much as improbable in them; and as I do not ſurrender up my full Aſſent to what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not demonſtrate to be <hi>True,</hi> ſo neither do I care to run down and condemn ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which I cannot prove to be <hi>falſe.</hi> But that which I diſlike and condemn here, is their making this Spiritual Body of Chriſt to be the <hi>Light within,</hi> that Light which is to teach Man Wiſdom and Knowledge, and to be his conſtant Tutor, Monitor and Director; which notion of the Light within (notwithſtanding that I highly approve of the thing it ſelf) I take to be extreamly groſs and abſurd, and that upon thoſe Two Accounts before touch'd upon.</p>

But this 'tis to have a dull Invention, and a ſtraitneſs of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is not open enough to let in a full view of things. We now meet with a ſort of Philoſophers of a freer Proſpect, and more inlarged Survey, that have found out another mode of furniſhing the Mind with Ideas, and that is, by its being united to ſome <hi>Created Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and that too a <hi>Material</hi> one. Strange, that ſo inquiſitive and ſo working a Head as that of M. <hi>Malebranche</hi> ſhould be ſo defective in his Enumeration, as not to hit upon this moſt wonderful Expedient of uniting the Soul to a <hi>Creature,</hi> in order to its Illumination! But ſure he could not overlook it, but rather thought it too inconſiderable to be mention'd. 'Twas no doubt very eaſie and obvious for him
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62599:67"/>
to have conſider'd, that the laſt Member of his Diſtribution might have been divided into Two, only by making his Suppoſition run firſt in general, <hi>that the Mind be united to ſome Being or other,</hi> and then by diſtinguiſhing that general into <hi>Created</hi> or <hi>Increated.</hi> This I ſay he might eaſily have done, and in point of exact order and Method, perhaps ſhould have done; but not dreaming that any would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſo extravagantly groſs, as to reſolve the Illumination of the Mind into its union with any <hi>Creature,</hi> and not in the leaſt queſtioning but that if Men were once come ſo far into the right path, as to make the Illumination of the Mind to depend upon its Union with ſome Being or other, they would have no further ſcruple upon them whether this Being were God or no, he choſe rather to paſs over all union with the Creature in Silence, and to make this his laſt and only further ſuppoſable way of inlightning the Mind, <hi>that it be united to ſome abſolutely perfect Being that includes in himſelf all the Perfections of Created Beings.</hi> Which no doubt is the only Baſis upon which an Intelligible Hypotheſis of Human Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding can ever be raiſed. And I cannot but greatly wonder that thoſe who come up ſo very near it, ſhould yet upon a ſuddain turn off, and paſs it by.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Quakers</hi> ſeem with M. <hi>Malebranche</hi> to diſclaim and renounce the Four Firſt of the ways propoſed, and they agree with him ſo far in the Fifth and laſt, as to reſolve the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination of the Soul into its Union with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62599:67"/>
ſome Being or other. But herein they divide and take ſeveral ways, in that M. <hi>Malebranche,</hi> makes this Being to be <hi>God,</hi> who is abſolutely Perfect and all-comprehenſive, eminently and vertually all, and the <hi>Quakers</hi> will needs have it to be a <hi>Created</hi> Being. Which Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis I think to be very Abſurd.</p>

               </list>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a needleſs Hypotheſis:</hi> For if the Soul of Man be not ſufficient to be a Light to it ſelf, but its Illumination muſt be reſolv'd into its union with ſome other Being (which theſe Men implicitly grant when they reſolve it into its Union with a <hi>Created</hi> Being,) then what Being ſo fit and proper for this purpoſe as God, who by reaſon of the Immenſity and Spirituality of his Nature, muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately preſent to all Minds, and by reaſon of the Infinity of his Eſſential Perfection, muſt needs have in himſelf after an eminent and intelligible manner, all the Degrees of Being, and conſequently the Ideas of all things? If there be a Being ſo qualined, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly our Illumination muſt be reſolv'd into our Union with that Being: And if there be a God, then there muſt be a Being ſo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. And therefore it muſt be from our U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him that all our Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is derived, who would of himſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inlighten Man, not only without
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62599:68"/>
the <hi>Conjunction,</hi> but even without the <hi>Coexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence</hi> of any other Creature.</p>
               <p>For I would demand of theſe Men that contend for a Created Light, an Anſwer to this one Queſtion: Suppoſe God ſhould anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate all the whole Creation except one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Spirit, ſo that there ſhould be nothing in being but that ſingle Spirit and Himſelf, would this Spirit upon the removal of all his Fellow Creatures out of being, ceaſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand or no? I know upon their Principle they muſt ſay that he would, as ſuppoſing his capacity of Knowledge to depend upon his Union with a certain Created Being, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Body of Chriſt:</hi> But ſetting aſide their Principle, (which is the thing under Queſtion, and therefore muſt not be uſed as a Medium to prove another thing by,) I ſee no reaſon in the nature of the thing it ſelf, why they ſhould ſay that ſuch a Spirit would in ſuch a Suppoſition ceaſe to underſtand; and I think there is all the reaſon in the World to ſuppoſe he would not, as being ſtill notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this great and Univerſal Emptineſs, united moſt intimately to a Being of Abſolute and Infinite Perfection, and that contains in himſelf the Ideas of all things. Certainly this great and Univerſal <hi>Repreſentative</hi> would be a ſufficient Light to that <hi>Solitary</hi> Spirit, who would not want Thoughts or Ideas, tho he might want a Companion to Communicate them to. And therefore tho the Notion were otherwiſe never ſo poſſible and conſiſtent, yet it is altogether needleſs to ſeek out for Union
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62599:68"/>
with any Creature, in order to that Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which conſidering the Omnipreſence and All-perfection of God, muſt needs be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, tho there were no other Creature beſides one Intelligent Spirit in being. But as this is needleſs, ſo</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is alſo an impoſſible Hypotheſis:</hi> It is abſolutely impoſſible, that a Creature ſhould be a Light to Man, or that one Creature ſhould be a Light to another. God is the great <hi>Luminary</hi> of the whole Intellectual World, and 'tis he only that can be a Light either to the Soul of Man, or to any other Intelligent Being. No Creature, tho never ſo glorious and excellent, not even the Human Soul of Jeſus Chriſt, (much leſs his Spiritual Body,) can ever be a Light to the Mind of Man. For to be a Light to the Mind, is to be to it the Principle of Underſtanding, to furniſh it with <hi>Ideas,</hi> and to be the formal and immediate Object of its Conception. And for this there are Two Conditions neceſſarily required, Firſt, That it be intimately preſent and united to the Mind. Secondly, That it have the whole Perfection of Being, ſo as to have the Ideas of all things, and to be an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Repreſentative. Which Conditions, (eſpecially the laſt,) no Creature either has, or can poſſibly have: And therefore no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is able to be a Light to the Soul of Man.</p>
               <p>Were a Creature never ſo excellent, yet it would be of a finite Perfection, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62599:69"/>
of ſuch a certain determinate order, rank, kind or ſpecies; that is, it would be ſuch a particular <hi>degree</hi> of Being. It would not be all Being, or Being at large, (for then it would be God,) but only ſuch a definite and determinate degree of it. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently were it never ſo intimately united to my Mind, it could be able to repreſent only it ſelf, and ſuch degrees of being as were in it ſelf. That is, it might repreſent it ſelf and all that is of the ſame kind with it ſelf, but it could not repreſent any thing elſe, for it could not repreſent more degrees of Being than it had. It could not therefore repreſent any Creature of another Order from it ſelf, as a <hi>Sun</hi> ſuppoſe could not repreſent a <hi>Tree,</hi> nor a <hi>Triangle</hi> a <hi>Circle,</hi> ſince each of theſe have degrees of Being that are not in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and conſequently cannot be repreſented by the other. For this is a moſt undoubted Principle, that nothing can repreſent any more degrees of Being than it has. Suppoſe your Creature therefore of never ſo raiſed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent an Order, it would be able to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only it ſelf, and thoſe of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. And what a poor account would this turn to! What a dim <hi>Wooing</hi> Light would this be for a Rational Soul to ſee by!</p>
               <p>And as ſuch a Created Light would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but little of the Creation, ſo it would not be able to repreſent God at all, whom we are chiefly concern'd to know, if 'twere on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we might be aſcertain'd of the Truth of other things, the certainty of which (as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62599:69"/>
                  <hi>Deſcartes</hi> has well obſerv'd and proved, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon our knowledge of God. But now it is impoſſible that God ſhould be repreſented to our Minds by a Created Light; for as there muſt be at leaſt as much Reality in the Object, either formally or eminently, as there is of Objective Reality in the Idea, (which is one of the Principles upon which M. <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi> grounds the exiſtence of God,) So 'tis as true on the other Hand, that there muſt be as much Reality in the Idea, as there is formally or eminently in the Object, or elſe that Idea will never be able to repreſent that Object, and that by vertue of the Principle before laid down, That nothing can repreſent any more degrees of Being than it has. But now God does infinitely ſurpaſs the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Creatures, exceeding the higheſt degrees of them by a whole Infinity, and therefore cannot poſſibly be repreſented by any or all of them. God indeed may repreſent a Creature to my Mind, as having all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Being in that Creature, and infinitely more, but a Creature can never repreſent God, as having no manner of Proportion to his Excellency. For if (as it has been ſhewn,) one Creature cannot repreſent another, that has but one degree of Being beyond it, or which the other has not, as a Triangle can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repreſent a Quadrangle, as having one Angle more than it ſelf, much leſs can a Creature be a Repreſentative of God, of whom it falls ſhort by no leſs a meaſure than a whole Infinity. Take an Extract of all Created Perfection, and you will never be
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62599:70"/>
able to raiſe an Idea of God out of it; for to add Creature to Creature, is but to add finite to finite; and as that will never <hi>make,</hi> ſo neither will it be ever able to <hi>repreſent</hi> an Infinite. So much impoſſibility is there in the notion of a <hi>Created Light,</hi> which can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but little of the Creature, and God not at all. And ſo very Abſurd are thoſe that ſtand for it, ſince the end for which they main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign it, and ſuppoſe it to be afforded to Man, is to conduct him to God, of whom it ſeems it cannot give him ſo much as an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea.</p>
               <p>And now if it be ſo Abſurd to make the Light within to be a Creature, then how much more Abſurd is it to ſuppoſe it a <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> Creature? <hi>Aquinas</hi> I remember propoſes <note place="margin">Prim. Part. Quaeſt. 106. Art. 1.</note> it as a Queſtion, Whether one Angel may not Illuminate another: But among the many trifling and frivolous Queſtions which he puts, I think he never thought it worth his while to inquire, whether a Clod of Earth, or a Sun-Beam (if you pleaſe) could illuminate an Angel? He that thought an Inferior Angel <note place="margin">Ibid. Art. 3.</note> could not illuminate an Angel of a Superior Order, to be ſure did not imagin that it could ever enter into any conſidering Head, that Matter ſhould be able to illuminate Spirit. And I cannot but ſtand amazed at the Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy of their Imagination who think it can. Sure the wild diſorders of a Fever, can hardly produce a more odd phantaſtical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit than this. It has been thought a ſtrange adventure in Speculation, to ſuppoſe, that
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62599:70"/>
Matter by the advantage of a finer Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, ſhould be made capable of <hi>Thought,</hi> and be able to reaſon and underſtand; and the truth is, I would give a great deal to ſee the <hi>Mould</hi> in which thoſe Mens Heads were caſt, who could entertain ſuch a Notion. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, what is this in compariſon of making Matter the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Illumination!</hi> 'Tis groſs enough of any ſenſe to ſuppoſe Matter capable of thinking it ſelf, but to ſuppoſe it to be an Intellectual Light, to be a Principle of thinking, to make it a Maſter and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor, a Furniſher of Thoughts and Ideas, what an Extravagance muſt this be! What, Matter illuminate Spirit! How harſhly it ſounds! How it grates upon a Philoſophical Ear! For beſides that ſuch a Suppoſition as this would invert and confound the whole Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of things, by exalting Matter above Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit (which according to this muſt depend upon Matter for the nobleſt of its Operations, that very Operation whereby it is diſtinguiſh'd from <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſuppoſed to be placed above it,) I ſay beſides this, how is it poſſible that Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould be a Principle of Illumination to the Soul? For in the firſt place, how ſhall we ſuppoſe it capable of being intimately u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited and preſent to it? Or if we could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this to be poſſible, yet what would it be able to repreſent? It would be able to repreſent nothing but what is Material, and but a little of that neither, even no more than thoſe few degrees of Material Perfection it ſelf is ſuppoſed to have; it could repreſent nothing Immaterial or Intellectual. For its
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62599:71"/>
Ideas could be no other than certain Material Images or Figurations; and a Material Idea can never repreſent an Immaterial Object. A Principle ſo very clear and certain, that even thoſe who derive our Ideas from Senſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſuppoſing them to be Corporeal Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, do yet find it neceſſary to look out for an Expedient, whereby they may be refined and Spiritualized after their admiſſion into the <hi>common Senſory,</hi> namely by the help of what they call <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> whoſe Office they ſay is to purifie and refine theſe Material Phantaſms, and to render them Immaterial, that ſo they may become Intelligible. A very hard Task task for poor <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> and were he not a Creature of their own Brain, it would move any ones Pity to think what a piece of Drudgery he is Condemn'd to. But that puts an end to our concern; for ſo he that reads the many ſevere toils and hardſhips of a poor Romantick Adventurer, feels a ſecret warmth about his Heart, and is apt ever now and then out of a tenderneſs of Spirit, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve into a paſſion for the Noble Sufferer, till as he is juſt about to drop a Tear, he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that 'tis but a <hi>Romance,</hi> and then all is well again. But by the way, this is a moſt miſerable Device, and ſuch as ſufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trays the abſurdity and nullity of their <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis.</hi> For hereby they plainly acknowledge the truth of this Principle, that a Material I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea cannot repreſent an Immaterial Object, (for otherwiſe, what neceſſity of having it Spiritualized,) and if ſo, then ſince their Ideas are Material, the whole weight of their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62599:71"/>
reſts upon this ſingle Bottom, <hi>The Tranſmutability of Material into Immaterial I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,</hi> which if found to be impoſſible, their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis can no longer ſtand. Now I muſt needs confeſs it does as much ſurpaſs my Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, how a Material Idea can be transform'd into an Immaterial one, as how a Material Idea can repreſent an Immaterial Object. They are alike Myſteries to me, and I doubt not but that they are both alike Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in themſelves.</p>
               <p>Well then, the Sum of the matter in hand will come to this: If the Ideas of a Material Principle muſt be alſo Material, and if a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Idea cannot repreſent an Immaterial Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, then 'twill follow, that a Material Light will not be able to give the Soul a Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any thing that is Immaterial or Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual. And if ſo, what little ſtead will it ſerve us in! The greateſt part of our Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are Intellectual. We cannot ſpeak or write three or four Words, but ſome of them will ſtand for Ideas that repreſent Intellectual Objects. There is no thinking nor converſing, tho never ſo little, without this. And what ſhall we do then with a Light that is not able to furniſh us with Ideas for a quarter of the things we are concerned both to think and to diſcourſe of? So utterly unſerviceable and inſufficient is a Material Light for the purpoſes of Human Underſtanding, and ſo ſenſeleſs and abſurd is the Notion that Aſſerts it. The Sum of what has been hitherto diſcours'd
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62599:72"/>
turns all within the Compaſs of this Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſm.</p>
               <p>That Notion which makes the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to be a Creature, and a material Creature, is Abſurd.</p>
               <p>But the Notion of the Quakers concerning the Light within makes it to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Notion of the Quakers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Light within is Abſurd.</p>
               <p>The Firſt of theſe Propoſitions is what we have been proving now laſt of all. The Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond was proved in the Account given of the Quakers Principle of the Light. The Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion therefore follows, That the Quakers Principle of the Light within is Abſurd. Which was the Propoſition I undertook to prove, and I am very much miſtaken in my Accounts if it be not well proved.</p>
               <p>And thus having repreſented the Groſſneſs of the Quakers Principle of the Light, I will now in the Concluſion add a Word or two concerning their Inconſiſtency in explaining it. That Perſon may well be eſteemed Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with himſelf, who ſo explains his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis in the Particulars of it, as to contradict that general Ground upon which it is built. But now this I take to be the Fault of the Quakers in relation to the Point in Hand. The general Ground upon which they build their Hypotheſis of the Light within is this,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62599:72"/>
That Man cannot be a Light to himſelf, (for if he could, what need there be another Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Light within him) and does therefore require ſome other Principle of Illumination for his Conduct and Direction. This is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they go upon, and ſo far I think they are right enough. But now when they come to give a particular Account of their Hypotheſis, they ſo order the matter as to contradict and give up again that General Principle. For if that Light within, which is to be the Principle of Human Underſtanding be a <hi>Creature,</hi> then Man might as well have been his own Light, or a Light to himſelf, that is, he might arrive to the knowledg of things, by conſulting the Perfections of his own Nature, the only Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why Man cannot be a Light to himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, becauſe no Creature can be ſo. But if a Creature may be a Light, and the Light within be a Creature, then why may not Man himſelf be that Creature; and then what need of any ſuch thing as a Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in diſtinct from the Rational Nature of Man, which would be to renounce their general Principle, and to fall in with the Vulgar Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of Human Underſtanding. So that this is a Notion altogether inconſiſtent with it ſelf, as well as diſagreeable to Truth.</p>
               <p>I have now finiſh'd what I undertook, and, if I miſtake not, fully anſwer'd the Title of this Treatiſe. If any ſhould think it ſtrange that I would be ſo far diverted from better Studies, as to ſpend time and pains in diſprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Principles of ſo inconſiderable a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62599:73"/>
ſwaſion as that of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I muſt in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this take the Liberty to tell them,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>(as to better Studies)</hi> I know nothing that does better deſerve the Conſideration of a Rational Creature, than the Mode and Way of Human Underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That (as to the Inconſiderableneſs of the Perſwaſion) I cannot think Quakeriſm to be ſo, as the Principles of it are laid down and managed by Mr. <hi>Barclay.</hi> That Great and General Contempt they lie under, does not hinder me from thinking the Sect of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to be by far the moſt conſiderable of any that divide from us, in caſe the Quakeriſm that is generally held be the ſame with that which Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> has deliver'd to the World for ſuch; whom I take to be ſo great a Man, that I profeſs to you freely, I had rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage againſt an Hundred <hi>Bellarmins, Hardings,</hi> or <hi>Stapyltons,</hi> than with one <hi>Barclay.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, as great a Man as he is, I think I have given his Principle of the Light a clear and thorough Confutation, and have likewiſe therein ſufficiently anſwer'd my <hi>particular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary,</hi> who perhaps by this time may have reaſon to repent that ever he ſet me to work. I know, Sir, very well, that 'tis one thing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the <hi>Book,</hi> and another thing to anſwer the <hi>Man:</hi> For ſome Men will never be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, tho their Books are.

               <p>THERE is one very material Conſideration relating to the Impoſſibility of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of a Created Light, which happen'd to eſcape my Thoughts till I was paſt the place where it ought naturally to have come in, and therefore I muſt ſet it down here by itſelf. You know, Sir, a very great Part of our Study and Thinking, as well as of our Familiar Diſcourſe and Converſation, is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd about <hi>Neceſſary</hi> and <hi>Eternal Truths.</hi> And moſt of our Arts and Sciences are Converſant about them, as being indeed the Principal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Human Knowledg. And therefore it is neceſſary, that that which is to ſerve us as an Intellectual Light ſhould be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent theſe things to our Minds, whatever elſe be left unrepreſented. But now this is what a Created Light will never be able to do, there being nothing in a Created Light that is able to anſwer or bear any Correſpondence to that which is Neceſſary and Eternal. For a Creature is a <hi>Contingent</hi> Being, all the Reality that is in it is wholly Contingent; and as Contingency can never repreſent Neceſſity or Eternity, ſo neither can that which is Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent repreſent what is Neceſſary or Eternal.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62599:74"/>
This I confeſs is a very Metaphyſical Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſuch as will require a great deal of Abſtraction and Attention in him that will be Maſter of it. But if attentively weigh'd and conſider'd, I believe it will be found to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to no leſs than a <hi>Demonſtration.</hi>
