            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Yet, I hope, I shall never be a <hi>Sepulchre</hi> to bury by unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful forgetfulness the extraordinary and unexpected Kindenesses (I must speak in the plural number) with which you were pleased to <hi>surprize</hi> me, when you were Lord Major: Herein you acted like the <hi>primus Motor,</hi> who does great things where there is no praevious preparation in the subject, I being a meer stranger to you.</p>
            <p>And now I have a more deep <hi>Obligation</hi> to make publike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement, and to provoke the <hi>whole University of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> together with my self (whose advantage is wrapt up in theirs) to study how to make <hi>suitable expressions</hi> of our real thanksgiving.</p>
            <p>Your most <hi>seasonable intention and execution,</hi> of enriching us with a <hi>Mathematique Lecture</hi> (a rich Treasure indeed, to us who had but a Four pound stipend <hi>per annum</hi> for our Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matique Lecturer) which is the more noble in you, and welcom to us, because one little <hi>intimation</hi> by me to you, did but <hi>meet,</hi> and give a vent to your full <hi>inclination,</hi> which was ready to <hi>overflow.</hi> Something to purpose you would do for <hi>Cambridge, to advance Learning,</hi> onely you waited for a fit occasion, to have it determined to a <hi>proper Channel.</hi> How greatly indebted is the <hi>Universty of</hi> Cambridge <hi>to the City of</hi> London, That two of their Alderman should contribute so liberally to maintain such necessary Lectures? Alderman <hi>Adams</hi> (to whom the University is much obliged for publike, and I for personal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors) hath bestowed means to support a <hi>Reader</hi> of the <hi>Arabick</hi>

               <hi>Confusion of Languages</hi> was a curse, whereby one could not <note place="margin">Gen. 11. 7.</note> understand another how to build their <hi>Babel:</hi> But such a <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying of Languages,</hi> that the Apostles might communicate <hi>Gospel-secrets</hi> to various Nations, was a great Blessing, and <note place="margin">Act. 2. 3, 4, 8.</note> much advanced the <hi>building of Jerusalem, and pulling down of Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And without doubt there is much of God in it, that now there should be a more then ordinary <hi>instinct,</hi> both in yong <hi>Students</hi> to minde such Studies, and <hi>Benefactors</hi> to encourage them; and especially when both meet with <hi>staggerings</hi> amongst some of the learned <hi>Doctors</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who begin to publish their doubts and fears, that all this while they have been <hi>deluded,</hi> and used their wits and learning to cloud those Scriptures, whose light now begins to shine into their mindes, and I trust in Gods time <hi>will into their hearts.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I have it related from very good hands, That a Citizen of <hi>London</hi> being in <hi>Aleppo,</hi> heard a very learned Jewish Rabbi, being sick, call his people together, who wished them very se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously to consider the divers former Captivities they had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone for the hardness of their hearts, and now one for above One thousand six hundred years, the cause of which is doubtless our unbelief and hardness of heart. We have long looked for <note place="margin">Note.</note> the Messiah, and the Christians have believed in one <hi>JESUS</hi> of our Nation, who was of the seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and (for ought we know) may be the true Messiah; and that we have suffered this long Captivity, because we have not believed, but rejected him: Therefore my advice is, as my last words, That if the Messiah which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, do not come at or about the year <hi>1650.</hi> accompting from the birth of their Christ, then you may know and believe, That this <hi>Jesus</hi> is the Christ, and you shall have no other: And within a little time after this old Doctor dyed.</p>
            <p>And now, much honored Sir, that the Lord should <hi>ennoble your Spirit</hi> to settle a <hi>Mathematique Lecture</hi> here, is the more <hi>welcom</hi> to us, because as Alderman <hi>Adams</hi> his <hi>worthy Donation</hi> will help to polish our <hi>Tongues,</hi> enable us to receive and communicate the choycest secrets, Your bounty will help to <hi>enlarge our mindes,</hi> to <hi>consolidate our judgements.</hi> Hence
<pb facs="tcp:62145:4"/>
it may be it was the Ancient Philosophers taught their <hi>Pupils Mathematiques very soon</hi> (as appears by <hi>Aristotle</hi> and others) <hi>they confirming their Propositions by Mathematical Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations,</hi> the knowledge whereof must be presupposed. And hence the witty and learned Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> would have <hi>feather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed</hi> yong men study the <hi>Mathematiques,</hi> there being the most clear and certain Demonstration to <hi>compose and settle yong heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I hope your new <hi>Mathematical Lecturer</hi> will read the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity such a Lecture, wherein he may like a good <hi>Arithmetician, number</hi> the many favers comprised in this <hi>one</hi> of yours, and like a skilful <hi>Geometrician</hi> and <hi>Astronomer,</hi> take the <hi>Dimensions</hi> and <hi>Altitude</hi> of your Intentions herein, to your perpetual Honor.</p>
            <p>And shall likewise expect, That many (by the blessing of the Lord) will <hi>inherite</hi> the fruit of this Donation. The wise God hath denied you Children, How can you do better, then make so <hi>publike</hi> a good at least <hi>part of your Heir?</hi>

            <p>You will please (Honored Sir) to accept this, together <hi>with a plain Sermon,</hi> which you would have had made <hi>publike</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the preaching of it.

            <p>And were reconciling Sermons ever more seasonable then now, when there are so many Incendiaries in City and Countrey, yea, such as would blow the coal, and put both the Kingdoms into a new flame? He who is great in counsel, and mighty in work, go on still (as he hath most graciously) to discover and curse such Plots, and blast such Machinations, according to his gracious promise, <hi>Isa. 54.</hi>

            <p>What ever others say or think, I am convinced, we ought to be so far from quarrelling with our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that we should rather provoke one another to bless God for them who first appeared with much zeal in the cause of <hi>Reformation,</hi> which awakened us who were in a deep sleep of security, and, I doubt, should have swallowed that Service-Book which they so resolutely opposed.</p>
            <p>Again, they came in most seasonably to help us, when we were very low upon the loss of <hi>Bristol.</hi>

And shall we suffer our selves, by the policies of selfish men, to be ingaged actively to joyn with such who would destroy both us and them, and hazard the ruine of that Cause, the maintaining whereof hath cost so dear.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He words themselves are an excellent Sermon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further enlargement, and especially upon such a day as this is, <hi>A praying,</hi> and <hi>An uniting day;</hi> And as Father <hi>Latimer</hi> began before King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, and his Honorable Councel <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1550. if I should say nothing for three or four hours together, but, <hi>Take heed, and beware of covetousness,</hi> it <hi>would</hi> be thought a strange Sermon to a King, yet <hi>might prove seasonable:</hi> So if
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62145:6"/>
I should onely take the <hi>Apostle Johns Sermon,</hi> as story relates of him, That when he was grown old, and not able to preach largely, he was carried into the Assemblies, and he would one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repeat these words, <hi>Little children, love one another.</hi> Had you no other Sermon this day, but those words repeated over and over, if God would bless it, that it might make impression upon your spirits, I hope, though a short and unexpected one, yet it would prove a sweet, at least <hi>a very useful Sermon:</hi> Thus the <hi>Apostle</hi> begins here, <hi>My little children, let us not love in word,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaks many things negatively which are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood onely comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 
               <hi>neither in tongue, but in deed and in truth. Not in word onely,</hi> there is a great deal of <hi>Lip-love: Not in tongue onely,</hi> there is a great deal of <hi>Complemental-love,</hi> where there is no hearty, no <hi>Real-love:</hi> But how should we love? <hi>In deed and in truth,</hi> that men might speak their hearts, and act their hearts, and express their hearts, in the love they do pretend; this is Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an love indeed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three Arguments the Apostle now here uses, to engage this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of their affection one to another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hereby we know that we are of the truth:</hi> All Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are such children as do indeed love one another, they have an <hi>instinct</hi> that carries them to it, and this will be a clear disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very that you are of the truth; <hi>true children</hi> indeed, no <hi>hastards, truly begotten</hi> again by the <hi>Spirit of God: Hereby we know that we are passed from death to life, because we love the brethren</hi> (saith <hi>John) Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 14. yea <hi>Christ</hi> goes higher, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. 35. <hi>Hereby shall all men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye</hi> have <hi>love one to another;</hi> that is one very strong argument that might bespeak your mutual affection: To have a <hi>clear evidence</hi> that you are Gods children, whatsoever <hi>sad news</hi> you should hear upon <hi>earth,</hi> if you had but a <hi>demonstration from heaven</hi> of that this day, it would be worth more <hi>prayers</hi> and <hi>tears,</hi> then I doubt you or I shall <hi>pour out before the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A second Argument is this, <hi>And shall assure our hearts before him:</hi> Have a sweet confidence, a stability of Spirit, though there be a sea of trouble without, yet here will be a <hi>bosom-ark,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing within that will fix and settle the soul; there thou mayest cast anchor, and lie safe, having a perswasion, having an <hi>assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance before God,</hi> however unsettled <hi>before men,</hi> and <hi>ebbing</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62145:6"/>
and <hi>flowing,</hi> and <hi>rising</hi> and <hi>falling,</hi> now good news, and then bad news, that damps, that dashes all; yet do but love one another in deed and in truth, as you ought to do, and you shall have assurance before God.</p>
            <p>A third Argument he uses in the 22. Verse, <hi>And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever we ask, we receive of him:</hi> This would be an admirable hint this day, if you and I could gather such an <hi>evidence</hi> out of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> that we may be assured, <hi>That whatsoever we ask, we shall receive:</hi> We come to ask great matters, and to <hi>beg great things of God this day,</hi> and now to have an <hi>earnest-peny from Heaven,</hi> that as sure as you make prayers, so sure your prayers shall be answered; would not this be an <hi>excellent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?</hi> He tells you upon what terms, If you do but love one another in deed and in truth. <hi>These are the three Arguments</hi> to demonstrate this truth, and quicken to this duty.</p>
            <p>But now for the 2. Argument, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> amplifies it, and indeed those are the words that I shall insist upon. What a very great advantage now is it to have this assurance before God (saith he) in the 21. Verse, <hi>Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God:</hi> If you have clear hearts before God, if you have not a self-condemning heart, but upon the examination of your selves, and weighing your own spiritual condition in the ballance of the Sanctuary, you can finde your love is weight, it is not counterfeit, copper love, when you bring it to the touchstone; but you are indeed <hi>taught of God to love one another, you may have confidence towards God;</hi> But on the other side, <hi>if our heart condemn us, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things:</hi> But when you come to examine your hearts, your hearts cry guilty, and have a self-condemning heart, Oh! woful is your condition! If your heart that is dark and ignorant, and knows but a little of your selves, if it condemn you and fly in your face; you must know you have to deal with the <hi>great God of heaven and earth,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Amos 4. 13.</note> 
               <hi>he knows all things;</hi> and if your own heart condemn you, you will be <hi>condemned with a witness,</hi> with a <hi>vengeance indeed,</hi> if not <hi>onely</hi> your own <hi>hearts,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> himself should <hi>condemn</hi> you.</p>
            <p>And so you have some short and general resolution of the words, out of these two Verses.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:62145:7"/>
I have four short Propositions, and I will name them, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every one of them very briefly speak something, as near as I can (as God shall direct) suitable to this day.</p>
            <p>The first Proposition is this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the heart of man hath a self-condemning, and a self-ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That God knows our own very hearts, yea, and more by us, then we know by our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>If our own heart do condemn us, it is an evidence of greater condemnation from the All-searching God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>If our own heart do absolve us, it is an evidence of acceptation before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These four Points lie obviously above ground in the words:</p>
            <p>And we will begin with the first. I have but a very little to say on that, onely to use it as a <hi>Key to open the door to what follows:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The heart or conscience of man hath a self-condemning, and</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. <hi>Obser.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>self-absolving Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If our heart condemn us not, that is, excuse us, absolve us; the heart of man or conscience, for they are doubtless the same <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Conscientia est judicium hominis de semet ipso pro ut subjicitur judicio Dei.</hi> Isa 5. 3. 3 Cor. 11. 31 Ames. cas. Consc l. c. 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>conscientia.</hi>
               </note> here: <hi>Conscience</hi> (that is) <hi>a practical power of the soul, bearing witness of our selves and actions, according to the knowledge of Gods Law:</hi> God hath given to man, not onely a power of <hi>knowing,</hi> but likewise a <hi>conscience;</hi> a power of knowing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>with God,</hi> a recoyling and reflecting upon our own actions, and upon our estates; the judgement of man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon himself, as he is under, and subject to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God; this is that conscience here, the heart! The Lord gives us a practical understanding, a practical knowledge, and principles; does enable us to make an application of those practical principles, to our own particular case: And hereupon it is, that <hi>every man,</hi> though never bred up to be a <hi>Logician in the Schools,</hi> yet knows how to make <hi>Syllogisms,</hi> either <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con,</hi> for or against himself: Every body will be able to say this, <hi>He that walks uprightly, he that lives the life of faith, he shall be saved;</hi> there's a general principle laid down in the word of God; then the heart does assume, <hi>but I through the grace</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:62145:7"/>
               <hi>of God desire to walk uprightly, I am taught to believe on</hi> Christ.</p>
            <p>In the first proposition, there the heart is (as it were) <hi>a book a volumn full of Principles;</hi> Here in the second proposition, there <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 15.</note> it is a <hi>witness,</hi> it bears witness together with God, <hi>knows with him,</hi> what its own <hi>condition</hi> is, or what its <hi>actions</hi> are; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the conclusion it is a <hi>Judge,</hi> I shall be saved, and I shall be accepted by him: Every one that is unrighteous, and so lives, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3. 20.</note> and so dyes, against him God is thus provok'd; but I am so and so, therefore against me: <hi>No unrighteous person shall inherit the Kingdom of God;</hi> but I am unrighteous, therefore I cannot come there: <hi>Every man or woman,</hi> be they never so <hi>ignorant</hi> (in this or in any other Assembly) <hi>hath such a power within them,</hi> God hath implanted in their mindes such a power, set up such a light in thy soul, as that thus far thou mayest be <hi>Judge of thy self,</hi> and thy <hi>own actions,</hi> that thou canst either condemn or absolve thy self.</p>
            <p>If your heart, if your <hi>Consciences have a power of self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Applic.</note> 
               <hi>and self-absolving;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then it is good to observe your Consciences, and be sure <note place="margin">1. <hi>Use</hi> of Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. <hi>Conscientia est naturals judicatorium.</hi> Ambr.</note> to make your Conscience <hi>your friend,</hi> and minde (likewise) as carefully, what conscience says to you: As you in your <hi>City Transactions,</hi> I make no question, but you preserve <hi>Records,</hi> and what <hi>Acts</hi> pass, or <hi>Orders,</hi> or <hi>Decrees</hi> (or whatsoever you call them) at your meetings, at your <hi>Common-Councel</hi> with the Court of <hi>Aldermen,</hi> because you would be able to read over the <hi>Story,</hi> to know how justly things were done, and what may be <hi>a Rule for the time to come,</hi> &amp;c. Let us be as careful to keep <note place="margin">Fraenum ante, flagellum post percatum.</note> the <hi>Records of Conscience,</hi> and to observe upon every occasion what your hearts say, what conscience says: For be you sure of this, that Conscience hath a self-absolving, and a self-condemning power; and though it may be now thou little mindest it, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after when thou comest to dye, <hi>then Conscience will rub up thy Memory;</hi> surely, you lived under such a Minister, and such <hi>Items</hi> you had given you, and thus Conscience did work; and sometimes you were <hi>almost perswaded,</hi> with <hi>Agrippa,</hi> and <note place="margin">Acts 26. 28.</note> looked Heaven-ward, and saw your errors, and were <hi>almost perswaded</hi> to turn over a new leaf; but still thou <hi>smotherest</hi>

               <note place="margin">Conscientia mille tests mille exercitus</note> look to it now, how you approve your selves, even to your own Conscience: And let me here by the way suggest but this to you, Suppose you make a few <hi>Quaeries</hi> to Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence now, and allow Conscience likewise to make some <hi>Quaeries</hi> to you.</p>

The Lord knows that very great Obligations lie upon many of you: How many <hi>Publike Fasting-days</hi> have you had? not a day but you did, or should <hi>renew your Covenant with God:</hi> How many <hi>Communion-days</hi> have you had? not a Communion day but you either did, or should <hi>renew your Covenant with your God:</hi> Some of you are under some Obligation or other, and under the Obligation of the <hi>Solemn League and Covenant:</hi> How have you answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all these in advancing the <hi>glory of God,</hi> and the <hi>Publike good,</hi> and the carrying on the <hi>work of a Scripture-Reformation, what says conscience?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Quaere. Further, if this Quaere should be proposed, <hi>How can you wash your hands of the guilt of other mens sins?</hi> What would you that are the <hi>Representative City</hi> say to that now? Suppose that all the <hi>Drunkenness,</hi> and all the <hi>Sabbath-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and the <hi>uncleanness,</hi> and the <hi>prodigious wickedness</hi> that hath been committed in the City, and in the Suburbs up and down upon the Sabbath-day, and in other places where <hi>the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the City</hi> hath had, or may have influence: Suppose this should all now be laid at your <hi>door</hi> this day. I say, the <hi>Lord Major,</hi> the <hi>Court of Aldermen,</hi> the <hi>Common-Councel-men,</hi> and they that had the <hi>Government of the City,</hi> they are <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to God,</hi> for all the Oathes, and Uncleannesses, and wickednesses that they have known of, and have <hi>not punished ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Acts, and Ordinances, and Statutes that are to this purpose.</hi> Give me leave to propound this in the Name of the <hi>great God to your Consciences:</hi> What can you say to this? Can you wash your hands in <hi>innocency?</hi> I doubt, besides all your <hi>by-Oathes</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:62145:9"/>
that you may be guilty of <hi>personally,</hi> and besides all your <hi>secret uncleanness,</hi> that others may be guilty of, and besides the <hi>Injustice and Prophaneness</hi> that your own <hi>hearts</hi> accuse you of: Do you not think that many of the <hi>City-abominations</hi> (I mean those common abominations that are committed by divers in the City) may be <hi>charged upon the remiss Government of the City, even in a great measure:</hi> It is good for you now to ask conscience, when you come to humble your souls <hi>before God,</hi> and to deal more seriously <hi>with him;</hi> and I hope you will now allow your <hi>Ministers</hi> to deal faithfully and plainly with you, as in the sight of the <hi>Lord,</hi> who will <hi>judge both Minister and people</hi> at the great Day; Had you not need pray with the good old Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Lord, forgive me my other mens sins?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Quae. Let me adde this Quaere, what says Conscience of this? Many of you, I think I may say (if I should be mistaken in the Affairs of the City, you will pardon one that lives at such a distance) are all <hi>Publike persons in some degree,</hi> that have any thing to do with the <hi>Government of the City:</hi> What will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science say to this now? <hi>What ends, what ayms have you had in all your publike undertakings?</hi> Whether hath <hi>Self</hi> or <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> been most advanced? What says Conscience to this plain Quaere? (remember your hearts, your consciences have a self-absolving, or a self-condemning power) You are most happy souls, if upon good grounds indeed, your consciences do now absolve you, and can say, O! Conscience tells me I have been a good Steward; and Conscience tells me I have observed my Vows and Covenants; and Conscience tells me that I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent I have no other mens sins to reckon for, or at least I have put them off my self, <hi>improving my power against them, or by my repentance for neglect thereof:</hi> And Conscience does not fly in <note place="margin">As <hi>Paul</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 12.</note> my face, I have had a <hi>Publike spirit in Publike Employment;</hi> happy are those souls <hi>(would we had more such:)</hi> I am afraid there are but few that can indeed wash their hands in innocency in this Assembly; but there is a great deal of work for repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Know, that one of these two things will certainly be, <hi>Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you must plead innocency at the day of Judgement, or plead repentance, otherwise you are utterly and everlastingly undone:</hi> Conscience will never absolve, unless there be an absolute inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62145:9"/>
or a sincere repentance and faith in Christ, whereby you have made his righteousness yours: How the case stands between God and you, <hi>Let God and Conscience be Judge.</hi> I propose but these things briefly to you, that I may a <hi>little awaken you to consider your selves:</hi> You expect I should come to the next Proposition.</p>
            <p>You have heard, that the heart of mans conscience hath a self-condemning, and a self-absolving power: The second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation follows;</p>
            <p>That even the great <hi>God knows all things;</hi> take the words <note place="margin">Observ.</note> (if you please) plainly as they lie: The great God hath an all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeing, and all-searching eye, <hi>He knows all things, even more then our hearts and consciences do know by our selves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If God hath given conscience such a self-condemning power. <note place="margin">2 <hi>Use.</hi> Caution.</note> Then</p>
            <p>Beware of <hi>Baffling your consciences,</hi> and of <hi>arming them against themselves.</hi> Remember, O remember often with fear and trembling, the sad condition of <hi>Judas,</hi> as set forth by <note place="margin">Mat. 27. 3, 4, 5.</note> 
               <hi>Matthew:</hi> His conscience was awakened when it was too late, then out of horror ran and <hi>confessed his sin,</hi> to them who had <note place="margin">Verse 3.</note> employed and involved him; <hi>He brought the thirty pieces to</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Verse 4.</note> 
               <hi>the chief priests and elders,</hi> crying, <hi>I have sinned in betraying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood,</hi> and they said, <hi>What is that to us, see thou to that;</hi> did they pity him, and endeavor to relieve him? no such matter. <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
               <hi>(Who would joyn with the Devils servants, who will leave us in the lurch, when they have engaged and entangled us! How much</hi>

               <hi>better to close with the servants of the most High, who will be found a present help in time of need,</hi> Psal. 46. 1.) They rather help to plunge him into deep despair <hi>(which with his own ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified conscience, coming in as a swift witness and impartial Judge against him) he hangs himself in a sullen discontent, and with the swing fell asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out,</hi> Acts 1. 18. (which the learned conceive the best Exposition to reconcile the seeming difference in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> about the maner of <hi>Judas</hi> his death <hi>(and so he went to his own place,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gualther Harmon,</hi> on Acts 1. 18. <hi>Damascen. cap.</hi> 13.</note> verse 25.)</p>
            <p>Let me close this Use with a <hi>pertinent story</hi> out of <hi>Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scene,</hi> of a man who had <hi>three Friends, one he courted much,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:62145:10"/>
               <hi>and sufficiently gratified the other, but the third he much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; and being afterward Arrested, he sent to his two friends, whom he had entertained with so much kindeness, to rescue him; they both refused: and then he was constrained to sly unto the third, his poor neglected despised friend, or else he must to Prison, and there rot in misery.</hi> Thou hast humored <hi>Appetite,</hi> and pleased <hi>Strife</hi> (two very deceitful friends) and abused poor <hi>Conscience</hi> wretchedly; and yet when <hi>God sends any Judge to seize on thee</hi> (unless that be thy <hi>friend to God,</hi> and speak a good <hi>word by way of testimony</hi> for thee) thou wilt eternally rot in <hi>Hellish torments.</hi> O be sure to deal tenderly and kindely with thy Conscience.</p>
            <p>This place will clear it, as to the heart, and the most secret turnings of it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13. <hi>The word of God is quick and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and sharper then any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joynts and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and is a discerner of the thoughts, and the intents of the heart:</hi> Heb. 4. 12, 13. <hi>Neither is there any thing that is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest in his sight; but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do,</hi> to give an account.</p>
            <p>There are many people wonder when they come to hear a Sermon, how the Minister comes to know their secrets; and sometimes you shall have a hearer, as he goes out of the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, say, This man, though a stranger to me, hath read over the <hi>story of my life,</hi> and as if he had been acquainted with my <hi>bosom secrets</hi> all my time, I had them discovered to me in this Sermon; how comes this to pass? it may be you will think <note place="margin">

            <p n="2">2. <hi>God knows more by us in our actions, then all the men in the world can know:</hi> For there are many closer-actions, many se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret actions in our retirements; and therefore well might the Apostle say here, <hi>God knows all things,</hi> more then all men and Angels: The <hi>Devil</hi> watches you, and he knows a great deal; and <hi>Angels</hi> may be <hi>Witnesses</hi> of many of your actions; and you may have <hi>Friends</hi> that may watch over you, and know much by you; but God knows more then all the men of the world, set them all together: and that will appear, it may be, when you come to dye, then you read over a Story of your own life and conversation, which you had forgotten, and your <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister</hi> or others could not put you in minde of, <hi>onely God stirs up Conscience, he that knows the heart,</hi> all the issues of it, and the Conscience; knows more by you at that time enlightned

            <p>And then when you come to the <hi>Administration of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and Service of God in your Congregations,</hi> God knows how patient divers of you have been at many pollutions a great <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 14, 15, 20.</note> while, that hath cost <hi>England</hi> very dear; now God knows how ready you were when the <hi>Prelates</hi> were in their <hi>ruff,</hi> to comply with them in their <hi>Altar-Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Trinckets,</hi> and the like; that <hi>The Prophets prophesie falsly, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and the People love to have it so:</hi>

            <p>Now therefore, wisely and seriously consider, what Spirit acts you in your <hi>City-meetings,</hi> what is the greatest <hi>Enginier</hi> that drives you on, whether it be the <hi>Publike good,</hi> the Lord knows it: And for the very <hi>Government of the City,</hi> whether sometimes you be not more zealous in your <hi>own things,</hi> and more remiss in the things of <hi>God;</hi> the Lord knows this: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sometimes you be not more indulgent <hi>to the rich,</hi> and pinch the <hi>poor most;</hi> how much care you may spend and exercise to maintain your own <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and keep up the <hi>Honor, and the reputation of the City,</hi> and it may be too exceeding <hi>faint,</hi> and <hi>flat,</hi> and <hi>dull,</hi> when it comes to the <hi>Sanctification of the Lords day,</hi> and <hi>purity of the Ordinances,</hi> and <hi>magnifying of Christ,</hi> there you moved (may be) as if your Chariot wheels were knockt off: If it be so, <hi>God knows it, and will reckon for it.</hi>

               <hi>(Right Honorable, Right Worshipful,</hi> and <hi>Welbeloved)</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you now lay your <hi>hands</hi> upon your own <hi>hearts,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously observe your selves, as in your more private Sphaere,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62145:14"/>
and in your several relations, so especially now, as you are <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens</hi> indeed, as you are part of the <hi>Representative City;</hi> what <hi>Oathes</hi> you took then, I know not, or whether any or no; but I am sure of this, the very thing it self carries with it an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if the <hi>City</hi> shall advance you to that <hi>Trust,</hi> you are bound to be <hi>faithful</hi> to it, and then to act and move so, as in all things you may discharge your trust. Now God forbid that ever People should say thus upon any good grounds, <hi>Ship-money was aheav burthen,</hi> but now indeed it is onely <hi>exchanged;</hi> there may be as much oppression in some Officers in raising the Taxes, as ever there was in the Officers in the gathering of <hi>Ship-money:</hi> God forbid this should concern any of you, look to it.

Oh! do you seriously and wisely consider, if there be any such di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers; God knows all these things: You have a Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that is a <hi>Witness against you,</hi> that will be a <hi>Judge;</hi> and as you would meet the <hi>great God</hi> with comfort at the <hi>great As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>size,</hi> keep a <hi>privy Sessions</hi> often in your own <hi>bosoms,</hi> and set all right and straight there.

Great complaints there were heretofore, Such a one he hath a <hi>Monopoly of Sope,</hi> or <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, Lace,</hi> and many things: And many <hi>complain now as fast,</hi> Such a one hath got a <hi>Monopoly of Offices and Places,</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosses all,</hi> &amp; they will thus and thus interest themselves in every thing, and when they have done all, it may be <hi>inrich themselves,</hi> and <hi>impoverish the Publike.</hi> How far these things are to be charged upon any one, I know not: But I so far <hi>love the City,</hi> and would have you prize the <hi>comforts</hi> of your own <hi>Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> as to take the advantage of this day, and reflect upon your selves, and sweep every man before his own door. <hi>People</hi> that are abroad in the <hi>Countrey</hi> have heard so much of the <hi>fame of London,</hi> since these things began, that they come here with

great expectation, hearing of the <hi>fidelity and courage of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and what you have done with your <hi>Purses,</hi> and how many have <hi>ventured</hi> their <hi>lives,</hi> they have <hi>great thoughts of London;</hi> but when they shall come up hither, and in some of your shops, and finde as bad dealing here, as in the <hi>Countrey;</hi> and it may be deal with some of their Officers, and finde as <hi>partial dealing</hi> here as in the <hi>Countrey;</hi> You know not what sad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports are cast upon the City by this means: and if you would have a lovely picture drawn of <hi>London,</hi> both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, I beseech you, Let it not be in vain that the Lord hath put it into your hearts to meet solemnly this day, but let there be some good fruit of it: And I hope every man will take some pains this Evening (or soon after) that he may take some time to view all the <hi>Pages</hi> of his whole course, and when he findes any <hi>Errata,</hi> or any thing amiss, as <hi>Lord Major,</hi> as <hi>Alderman,</hi> as <hi>Common-Councel-man,</hi> or <hi>Officer,</hi> that in the consideration of this, That God knows all things, you will fall down before him, and cry every one <hi>Peccavi,</hi> and say, Lord, I know such a thing hath been amiss, and I desire all may be reformed.</p>
            <p>And so I have done now with the second ground observe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the words. I hope I shall not oppress you.</p>
            <p>You have heard that our hearts have a power of self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, and self-absolving; You have heard likewise, That God knows, the great God hath an All-seeing, an All-searching eye, knows all things, sees how it fares with us: But then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The self-condemning of our hearts, is a certain pledge of greater condemnation from God.</hi>

               </note>
            </p>
            <p>And why so? Because <hi>Conscience is but Gods Agent,</hi> it is <hi>his Vicegerent in our breasts.</hi> That God might carry all things righteously at the Solemn and great day of <hi>Judgement,</hi> he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys this <hi>subordinate Officer</hi> here to <hi>Record all things;</hi> so then two Books will be open, the Book of <hi>Gods Judgement,</hi> and the Book of <hi>our Conscience;</hi> and they will agree like a pair of Tallies, there will be a <hi>concurrence</hi> betwixt them in all particulars: God, he does imploy Conscience, if that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn thee, and if that be not satisfied, but still accuses thee, thou mayest tremble at the thought of it; God himself will

               <hi>be satisfied, till God be satisfied in and through Christ; and when God is first satisfied in and through Christ, then God will satisfie Conscience.</hi> I confess, that many a mans conscience <hi>holds his peace,</hi> that is in a very ill condition; but conscience never <hi>speaks peace,</hi> but when thou art in a good estate <hi>before God through Christ.</hi> I doubt there may be many ignorant men here, that may be <hi>bold,</hi> Why, <hi>Conscience troubles me not,</hi> and <hi>accuses me not;</hi> possibly it may be so: but thy Conscience may be <hi>stupified,</hi> and <hi>tongue-tyed,</hi> and thou all this while in a most dangerous condition; thou art asleep in the Devils Cradle all this time: but when once Conscience comes, not onely to <hi>hold his peace,</hi> but to <hi>speak peace,</hi> that is a <hi>great advantage</hi> to thee: (that thou shalt hear of by and by) But if nothing can satisfie thy Conscience; thou wouldst appease thy Conscience; and quiet it, and goest to Prayer, and it may be comest to Sermons, and yet Conscience nibs thee, follows and dogs thee from place to place, and thou canst not rest: Certainly, if thou have such a mis-giving, self-condemning heart, it is a clear sign that yet God himself is not at peace with thee. Sometimes (indeed) a very honest heart may be troubled, and much perplexed (I would not have any abuse this, for there is a troubled Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, that is yet a good Conscience, <hi>because then troubled more for sinning against God, then for any thing else)</hi> But if thy heart do <note place="margin">Note.</note> condemn thee for a wilful living in such a sin, as being <hi>obstinately defective</hi> (for here the Apostle speaks principally in this, in wanting love to the Brethren) if your hearts condemn you in this, that you do not love <hi>truly one another,</hi> you can have no <hi>solid peace:</hi> For I dare boldly say, That there is never a man or woman in the world that hath a good Conscience (though a troubled Conscience, <hi>which may be good, when not comfortable)</hi> but <hi>they do love the Brethren, and love the Saints, and they do not live in any gross sin, and they do not allow themselves in any little sin.</hi> But now, if thy heart indeed do condemn thee, as not having that which is an undoubted evidence of grace, not <note place="margin">Character of a good conscience.</note> the <hi>lowest degree of grace,</hi> as, <hi>thy not wallowing in any sin, not allowing thy self in any the least wicked way, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the truth of grace thus explain'd,</hi> it is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

sign, that thou canst <hi>as yet expect nothing but condemnation from God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore (by way of use) <hi>Beware, O beware of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filing,</hi>

               <hi>corrupted,</hi> when once it hath received its <hi>Commission</hi> from him, is awakened by him: This is the very nature of Conscience (observe it) when other things <hi>wither and dye,</hi> then (it may be) <hi>Conscience lives:</hi> when a mans teeth falls out, his hair falls off, <note place="margin">Note.</note> and his hearing is gone, and his eye-sight lost, that he cannot see without Spectacles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to that elegant description of old age by <hi>Solomon;</hi> then his Conscience begins to live <note place="margin">Eccl. 12.</note> 
               <hi>more vigorously,</hi> when he comes to dye. It may be thou that hast been an Atheist and dull hearer twenty or thirty years to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and very little more edified by all the <hi>Sermons</hi> thou hast heard, then the <hi>seat</hi> upon which thou <hi>satest;</hi> for this, when thou comest to dye, thy Conscience will torment thee: Oh! it is a dangerous thing to <hi>out live</hi> your <hi>Consciences;</hi> you may out-live your <hi>Trading,</hi> and <hi>Honor,</hi> and yet overcome that (at <hi>least have comfort under it)</hi> but to lose your Conscience; to be <hi>Plundred of a good Conscience, it is the worst of all Plundrings:</hi> A man had better lose all the world ten thousand times over, then to lose God, and Conscience; no enemy like to Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (besides God himself, who does imploy and act it) a million of enemies are not so much as a terrifying Conscience. Divines have a great dispute (many of them) where <hi>Hell should be;</hi> truly, you need never make an enquiry, <hi>God can make a Hell in any one of your Consciences:</hi> and if God should <note place="margin">Hell in a wicked mans conscience.</note> open any of your eyes at this time, that have lived in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness all your days, and set Conscience on work to torment thee, thou wouldst soon <hi>know where Hell is:</hi> If God should but let one drop of his wrath fall upon thy Conscience at this time, and discover what a secret wanton such a one hath been, and what a private Drunkard such a one hath been; if he should in his holy Justice <hi>set this upon thy Conscience,</hi> thou wouldst <hi>have a very Hell in thy bosom:</hi> Before God advances the souls of the Saints to heaven, he can bring down heaven to their souls; <note place="margin">Note.</note> even so he often makes a hell in wicked mens Consciences, before he condemns them into hell.</p>

And therefore I beseech you, because that a bad Conscience is a pledge, an evidence of greater condemnation; Take heed how you baffle, abuse, break with your Consciences. Give me leave to propose this short <hi>Dilemma</hi> to you here; Instance in any sin, either you know it to be a sin, or not know it: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Drunkenness, or in Swearing, or in Lying, or in Unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, or in Sabbath-breaking, or <hi>in want of love,</hi> whoever you are, you know it either to be a sin, or you do not know it; if thou dost know it to be a sin, what a blinde <hi>Atheistical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science</hi> hast thou? if thou dost know it, and wilt still live in it, then what a <hi>festred Conscience</hi> hast thou? This is <hi>plain lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,</hi> but it is <hi>very wholesom;</hi> no danger to hear of it now, but if it be your doom to <hi>feel it at that left hand</hi> when you come to Judgement, there it will be too late, then you can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver make your peace with Conscience, but art eternally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Too many men do deal with Conscience (very unwisely) as men do with Bayliffs: Suppose an Officer should have order to Arrest such a man, it may be he will give the Officer, Bay lift or Sergeant, or what you call him, five shillings, or ten shillings, and he spares him; but alas, poor man, <hi>the debt runs on, and the Creditor will be at the charge of a new Writ:</hi> So, you come to a <hi>Sermon,</hi> and it may be a spark of <hi>Truth</hi> falls upon your mindes, and you go home a little convinced; and what <note place="margin">Never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound with consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, unless you first a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with God himself</note> will you do? you will go to some company to rub it out, this Sermon came close to me: but you have a <hi>jolly way in London,</hi> it may be get to a Tavern, and drink away with a pinte of Sack Twenty Sermons, and with a pipe of Tobacco blow them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, so you can wear out those strokes that the Word of God hath had upon you: Oh! what call you this? there is a sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bribing of the <hi>Sergeant,</hi> but <hi>the grand debt runs on still:</hi> And then it may be God will break thy Estate, and take away <note place="margin">Divers in London have a jolly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and too great a latitude therein.</note> they wife or children, or thou hast lost so much at sea, but thou dost comfort thy self, I have so much left yet, and though you be sad for the present, yet you may get up again; but then it may be a greater cross comes after this; and if all this <hi>break not thy Conscience, it will break thy neck in the conclusion, and send thee packing to Hell, out of whence there will be no Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption:</hi> Therefore, I beseech you consider it, if you have a self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemining
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62145:16"/>
Conscience, it argues there is a greater condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be expected: Conscience will joyn with God as a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Judge against thee.</p>
            <p>Let me adde this is the next place, and endeavor to set it a little more on: Conscience, as it will never be bribed, so it is (indeed) such a worm as never dyes: In <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 44. you hear there of <hi>a worm that dyeth not,</hi> and <hi>a fire that never will be extinguished.</hi> I believe some of you know what the head-ake, or the Tooth-ake, or the Gout, or a fit of the stone means; suppose <hi>Eternity</hi> should be added to one of these, if you should have an eternal Tooth-ake, or an everlasting fit of the Stone, would not this be a sad thing? <hi>Adde eternity to an evil, and it</hi>

               <hi>makes it infinitely evil:</hi> What will it be to have an everlasting <hi>stinging Conscience? a fire flaming in you that never will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished?</hi> Oh! this will be the woful fruit of such a bad Conscience; and therefore take heed of such a self-condemning heart.</p>

            <p>Too many <hi>Citizens</hi> (I doubt) herein do over much resemble <note place="margin">Some Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that there is much want of this sweet flower of brotherly love in the Garden of <hi>London.</hi>
               </note> their <hi>Gardens,</hi> which are full of <hi>goodly Tulyps,</hi> beautiful to the <hi>eye,</hi> but neither good for <hi>pot</hi> or <hi>smell;</hi> so they have a <hi>pompous love,</hi> a <hi>specious kindeness,</hi> in exchanging some <hi>Visits</hi> and <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,</hi> but little or no <hi>conference</hi> to the good of one anothers <hi>souls,</hi> little or no <hi>usefulness</hi> to one another in reference to the <hi>Publike.</hi> This appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Because there is so much <hi>Envy</hi> in the <hi>City:</hi> Now certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Envy proceeds from want of love; for if you did love one

another indeed, you would <hi>heartily rejoyce</hi> in one anothers <hi>good.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Discovering Arguments of want of love.</note> But, <hi>alas,</hi> that such a one should have a <hi>Place</hi> rather then I, and such a one should have more <hi>Power,</hi> and more <hi>Influence</hi> then I have, Oh! many men cannot bear it: What call you that, truly it is want of love; such a man wants love to his <hi>Neighbor</hi> that <note place="margin">1.

            <p>And then, that there is such a deal of <hi>censuring:</hi> Oh! that argues defect in love too. How do Brethren <hi>censure</hi> and <note place="margin">2. Censuring one another argues want of love.</note> 
               <hi>tear</hi> one another: The Lord knows it is too much amongst <hi>Ministers;</hi> I wish <hi>All</hi> whom it concerns may be humbled for it: And people censure their Minister, and one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do not all concur and comply; some are of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Judgements,</hi> some are of one <hi>minde,</hi> some of another; in things of lesser <hi>consequence,</hi> who condemn one another, I'le not say as much as <hi>Papists</hi> and <hi>Protestants,</hi> but truly it is in danger to grow to it: As it is abroad now, <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvinists</hi> both pretend to be for <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> but it is a cause among them, that <hi>Religion much suffers,</hi> and the progress of the Gospel is very much obstructed by it. Take heed of censuring; this is want of love.</p>
            <p>Further, here is another Argument, not onely from Envy, <note place="margin">3. Oppressing others argues want of love to them.</note> not only from Censuring, but indeed from your <hi>oppressing</hi> others in Taxes and Levies, and such kinde of ways, when things are carried on with <hi>extreme partiality,</hi> and with unjust <hi>indulgence</hi> to some, and <hi>severity</hi> unto others; what call you this now? it is want of love: Because, didst thou love thy Neighbor as thy self, thou wouldst do nothing to thy Neighbor, but what thou wouldst have thy Neighbor do to thee, in the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, in the same juncture and concurrence of circumstances, which our <hi>Savior</hi> makes the <hi>rule and expression of real love.</hi>

            <p>And then likewise, when you are so <hi>selfish in your designs and undertakings,</hi> and so far prefer your self-ends before the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique; this is still want of love. The Apostle was a Prophet,

of need to preach this Doctrine to <hi>London,</hi> you have had much said to you already concerning <hi>unsetledness in Opinion:</hi> truly, it <note place="margin">Vnity in Church mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters lovely.</note> is a sad condition, yet I would not have people <hi>discouraged</hi> at it, for it was always so in <hi>Reformation-</hi>time, in <hi>Luthers</hi> time and others: As when the Sun arises in its lustre, there are drawn up a great many fogs and vapours; so it is when the Sun of <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> arises, there is a great deal of liberty many take to themselves, and many wanton and wicked Opinions there are abroad; there are in Gods garden many unsavoury weeds <hi>(The Lord who knows it remove them)</hi> What should we do? Oh! let us improve our utmost, how we may bring things to a happy Union. And for the Church, I have but two things to say to compose all the Differences:</p>
            <p n="1">1. You have heard already many seasonable hints concerning Unity, and the commendation of it; it is <hi>a work like God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, to be a Reconciler: God was in Christ reconciling the world</hi> 
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> 
               <hi>to himself.</hi> And I desire heartily, that <hi>Ministers,</hi> and <hi>Citizens,</hi> and that all ranks and sorts of people now were Reconcilers: There are too many <hi>Incendiaries,</hi> and I fear, not any one plot of the Jesuits against the City more then this (and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, if you have Jesuits among you) you have their Plots and Designs, to raise up Divisions about Church-government. A great deal of talk there is about <hi>Differences between those you call Presbyterians, and Independents,</hi> and men use all their wits to heighten the Difference to the utmost; and if there were but half the pains to <hi>lessen,</hi> as there is to <hi>greaten</hi> them, I should hope we might joyn <hi>heads</hi> and <hi>hearts,</hi> and all without any such <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable breach,</hi> as some think. What do people think? Surely, one party must be absolutely broken, if God gives us the wisdom and sobriety that is from above, <hi>first pure, and then peaceable;</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 27.</note> I hope there may be a Reconciliation of both, without the Destruction of either: Certainly (though there are, I believe, extremities on both sides) yet both too good to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Now I would have this considered, many drive on this <hi>Design,</hi> and God knows there is a great deal of <hi>animosity</hi> in it; some Presbyterians, I doubt, would be willing to destroy the Independents, though they ruine the Publique in it; and, I fear, some Independents would do so for them: Doubtless,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62145:21"/>
               <hi>there is too much rigor at least in divers of both parties.</hi> There is no such difference, for ought I know, between the <hi>sober Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent,</hi> and <hi>moderate Presbyterian,</hi> but if things were wisely managed, both might be reconciled; and by the happy union of them both together, <hi>the Church of England might be a glorious Church, and that without persecuting, banishing, or any such thing, which some monthes are too full of.</hi> I confess, it is most desireable, that <hi>Confusion</hi> (that many people fear by <hi>Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency)</hi> might be prevented: And it is likewise desireable, that the <hi>Severity</hi> that some others fear, by their rigour of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,</hi> might be hindred; Therefore let us labor for a prudent <hi>Love,</hi> and study to advance an happy <hi>Accommodation.</hi> Give me leave to say two or three words to this purpose:</p>
            <p>Is it not a sad thing, that when learned and godly men (for so you will allow them to be on both sides) I say, First, <hi>When they shall agree in the Doctrinal part, in the Confession of Faith;</hi> I hope you will hear of little or no difference there.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they shall <hi>agree likewise in the Practical part of Worship;</hi> for that you see by the <hi>Directory,</hi> all have in a maner agreed there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When they shall <hi>agree likewise in the Destructive part;</hi> as, for the ruine of <hi>Episcopacy, and removing of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and all that trash.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here are <hi>Three wonderful steps:</hi> and I believe five years ago here is not a man in this Congregation, did expect so much as God hath already granted us: At the beginning of the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> 
               <note place="margin">God hath done much for us in Reformation</note> our hopes were but low, and modest in regard of what we have; and yet because all things come not upon a sudden, we wrangle, and quarrel with this man, and that man, yea and with Divine Providence; but let us look back and see what a Sea we have got over, Your Common Prayer book is gone, and your Ceremonies and <hi>Episcopacy</hi> hath its <hi>deadly blow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Nay further, Another step is taken, and if any thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile disputing Brethren, this is a very probable means, and it hath past the Assembly a long time since, and the House of Lords a great while ago, and now hath almost the House of Commons (the Vote of it, as I hear, is past) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>An Ordinance, taking care for removing of Offences in</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:62145:22"/>
               <hi>Congregations, of ignorant and scandalous persons, who sad the souls of the Saints by their Divisions, that do pollute the things of God; and that there shall be an intrinsecal power in every Congregation to keep away such:</hi> What would you have more? if this be granted, set aside the word <hi>Independency</hi> (for who will own it) it is a <hi>word neither fit for Creatures; nor for Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, we must be all dependent, an absolute Independency is no where to be allowed;</hi> but call it Classical and Congregational. Let us begin in the right method, <hi>Every Congregation shall have its power, there shall be a Pastor, and Elders with him; and they shall have a power put into their hands, to enquire who are Scandalous and Ignorant in every Congregation, and they shall</hi> 
               <note place="margin">An happy step.</note> 
               <hi>be kept from joyning with them at the Lords Table, till they have exprest Repentance, and got competent knowledge, and given satisfaction for their scandal:</hi> And this is the thing the <hi>Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents</hi> contest for, and the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> concur in; and if this be granted, is not this a good step towards our <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> But this is not all.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Here is somewhat more <hi>to gratifie the Presbyterians:</hi> When there are six Congregations, more or less, though every one hath an intrinsecal power within themselves, to order things that are proper and peculiar to them, yet they may at least <hi>advise with a Presbytery;</hi> and things <hi>of difficulty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, and common concernment; may be transacted with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Councel:</hi> As suppose <hi>a Congregation have Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated a person,</hi> it may be he findes himself agrieved, he will <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the Consociation of those neighbor Churches</hi> in that Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis: Those Ministers will require the <hi>Pastor and Elders of that Congregation,</hi> to give them an account why they did <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> such a man? they will hear it; and when they have heard it, they will finde they did well or ill; and if well, they will confirm it by an <hi>accumulative</hi> power, and say, <hi>You have done nothing but what we would have done, and according to the word of God;</hi> and here this confirmation comes to <hi>strengthen</hi> 
               <note place="margin">This accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation is much nearer then when this Sermon was preach<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> what the <hi>Congregation hath done:</hi> or if they finde they did in <hi>rashly</hi> and <hi>incogitantly,</hi> and out of a <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>Revenge,</hi> they will say, You are bound to reverse this, and you had no ground to <hi>Excommunicate</hi> him; <hi>you must recal the Sentence, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:62145:22"/>
               <hi>we cannot maintain fellowship with you:</hi> Will not here be a sweet communion together, and blessed conjunction, and (I hope in time) a mutual satisfaction; and certainly, it were the best complexion, and would shew a great deal of real love. <hi>I wish I had such a temper, as not to be so far obliged to an Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, as to close with him in any thing that is not good; or so far engaged to any Presbyterian, to close with him in any thing that is evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that we might with unprejudiced mindes and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere consciencces, go with them both, so far as is agreeable to the Word of God, and here is a blessed way to a firm and lasting Union.</hi> And now, that this is not my own notion and fancy onely, for I know nothing I have said, but is past the Assembly long since: For in the Paper, if I very much mistake not, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Accommodation, the power of Excommunication is so allowed to the Congregation, and that he may be <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the Eldership therein:</hi> What would you have more? Here <hi>you do harmoniously link Congregational and Clas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical power both together.</hi> And therefore away with all <hi>Jesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal plots, to dis-sever those that are in such a probable way of union.</hi> And indeed there were <hi>Two things that made the breach at first:</hi> Why did our Brethren go to <hi>New-England,</hi> or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad to other places? Either there was a form of Prayer im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, or Ceremonies they could not submit to (blessed be God that is turned out at the <hi>back door,</hi> and there is a <hi>Directory for that)</hi> or else <hi>mixt Communion:</hi> And the <hi>Parliament hath given evidence, That they will take order for such a power in every Congregation, that an honest heart may with much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort there sit down, and so purge and refine his own Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he may with much honor to Jesus Christ, and satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his own Spirit, enjoy the Ordinances of God in much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</hi> Therefore I beseech you, stir up your selves, and one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that we study how to <hi>lessen the differences,</hi> and <hi>do not give way to passionate dividing invectives.</hi> God forbid there should be any such in <hi>Pulpits,</hi> or in <hi>Corners,</hi> or at <hi>Tables:</hi> Let us all get reconciling Spirits, and speak uniting language in our <hi>Sermons,</hi> in our <hi>Books,</hi> and upon all <hi>occasions,</hi> that if it were possible, they that are <hi>like to dwell in one Heaven hereafter, might now dwell in one England, and might serve God together,</hi>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:62145:23"/>
               <hi>and joyntly advance Jesus Christ together in the purity of his Ordinances, and live in sweet peace and harmony together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As in <hi>Church matters,</hi> so I beseech you, shew your love likewise in all your <hi>Transacting Civil and City Affairs, manage all your meetings, your negotiations with love: Let all things be done in love</hi> (says the Apostle) walk in love, not onely now <note place="margin">2 Cor. 16. 14. Eph. 5. 2.</note> and then, and speak in commendation of love, you hear a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of love, with approbation, but do all things in love; give <hi>counsel</hi> in love, and <hi>reprove</hi> in love, and <hi>tax</hi> with love; and whatsoever affairs you are to transact, let all still be done in love: when you come abroad in the streets, there you will meet a <hi>company of poor people,</hi> a proper object for love of pity; it were worthy of this City to consider them: Your love is principally intended, I confess, to the Saints, to wit, a love of complacency; but love all, love your Enemies: Love should be of a <hi>diffusive overflowing disposition.</hi> Love poor <hi>fatherless Children,</hi> so as to bring them up at <hi>School</hi> (blessed be God that you have so many <hi>Schools</hi> here) and I hope the City will both wisely and conscionably still cherish those <hi>Nurseries,</hi> that yong <hi>Children</hi> may be bred to <hi>write</hi> and <hi>reade,</hi> and so after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bound Apprentices, that they may be set to good <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,</hi> or fitted for the <hi>University, those that have parts;</hi> and look to your poor. It would be a project worthy the wisdom of this renowned City, that is famous for many things: Many decayed Tradesmen there are, and many that were good house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers before, are fain to go a begging, which they do in the night, being ashamed to appear in such an habit in the day: What if you should choose some one relieving Committee, to <note place="margin">One Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for relief of the poor, very desireable.</note> give money to the poor, you have many ready enough to take it from them; to consider how you should finde out some way for the poor to get their living, men, women, and yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, men that live idlely; better give <hi>six pence</hi> to one that is working, then a <hi>peny</hi> to one that is idle; you nourish them up in a <hi>trade of temptation,</hi> as long as you <hi>nourish them up in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</hi> For maimed Soldiers, let your love be shown to them; but for those that are able to work, take care to keep them in employments, but rather relieve them working, then begging: This were like true love indeed, a Fasting-days fruit; as you

               <hi>to undo the heavy burthens.</hi> If the Lord would shew that mercy, to <hi>crown this Fast</hi> with success, that if you have been <hi>too rigid in your Taxes, too severe and partial in your Impositions,</hi> and put it into your hearts to loose burthens, and to let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed go free, and ease every yoke, <hi>though you have sown in tears, you would reap in joy.</hi>

            <p>And further, <hi>Then thou shalt call upon me, and the Lord will answer;</hi> Here is the very thing in my Text now, <hi>you have this</hi>

            <p>And then spring more <hi>fruitfully, all London all over green;</hi> go into the streets, you shall not see a <hi>beggar</hi> there; go into the Hospitals, in one there are <hi>poor fatherless-Children brought up for the Universities or Trades,</hi> and go to another, there are all <hi>maimed soldiers taken care for:</hi> This were worthy of such a City as you profess your selves to be, and after such an <hi>Extraordinary day</hi> as this is professed to be: We look not onely for a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and the like; but as the day is <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> so we pray, and hope (surely God expects it) that there should be some extraordinary fruit, some <hi>Monument erected</hi> after this.

            <p>There is one thing more, and that is the end of the Chapter, and so I have done: The Argument is so seasonable, that I hardly know how to break it off; but I must consider my self and you: <hi>And they that shall be of thee, shall build the old waste places, and thou shalt raise up the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
