            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Mr.</hi> WHALLIES The Famous <hi>Iriſh</hi> ASTROLOGER, HIS Wonderfull Propheſies, and general Obſervations upon the Year 1699.</head>
            <p>BUT to the Matter in hand. The laſt quarter, or the beginning of this will contribute Juſtly to a general peace between the Chriſtians and the Turks, and Friendſhip betweem ſeveral Nations, for carrying on ſome great ends, which I incline to Conjecture to ſhew themſelves before the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Quarter be juſtly expired, whatever they may be, they will be attended with blows and bloody Noſes before their effects are over. I expect that either this quarter or the beginning of the next, will give an inſight unto ſome of theſe Predictions in my laſt years Almanack. And among the reſt, I cannot but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade my ſelf, That there will be about that time ſomething more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary to do in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> but chiefly the former. And I verily believe, Notwithſtanding of the long Expectations had of his death, that the King of the Latter lives to ſee it.</p>
            <p>The Spring and Summer in general, will ſupplie us with vanity of odd News, and much of it ſurpriſing too. And among the reſt, ſtrange debates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout perſons, and things relating to Laws, Religion and Settlement, which for a time will unſettle things of the Nature, and beget uneaſie diſputes betwixt ſome Prince and his Clergy. HOWEVER HIS MAJESTY OF GREAT BRlTTAlN is Highly Courted, and Honourablie Addreſt both at home, and from ſome of the moſt roping Neighbouring States: Yet I wiſh this Summer do not produce ſome Roguery, even in the City of <hi>London</hi>: At leaſt I doubt they will give uneaſineſs in their moſt National Counſels, if not worſe trouble in <hi>Flanders.</hi> And I think the Empire or Emperour of <hi>Germany</hi> will not be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether free from ſome under hand dealings or Villanies, nor the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> form ſome diſturbance, either in Health Mind or Body, or altogether.</p>
            <p>
               <label>May</label>. The Configurations of the laſt Moneths Latter end, and beginning of this threatens Diſorders, Miſchiefs and Villanies of ſeveral kinds, and ſuch too as will prove of no ſmall Conſequences, to more places and People than one in <hi>Europe,</hi> and in particular, I doubt will more then a little concern even the City of <hi>London.</hi> Its twenty to one, but we ſhal about this time be made Senſible of ſome <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Jacobite</hi> Roguery, which for ſome Moneths paſt have been carried on in the dark, to undermine the Foundation of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This I believe will produce uneaſineſs, Diſturbance, Troubles, and Removals of ſeveral kinds, but in a more eminent manner in ſome of the Superior Station, if not Raptures alſo in the general Affairs of the World</p>
