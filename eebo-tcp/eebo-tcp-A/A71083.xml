         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Wonderfull Relation
Or what happened to
Dr. Moore
In the County of WICKLOW in
IRELAND.</head>
            <p>DR. <hi>Moore</hi> having lately purchaſed an Eſtate in
the County of <hi>Wicklow,</hi> did (together with
Mr. <hi>Richard <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack,</hi> and one Mr. <hi>Laughlin
Moore</hi>) about three weeks ſince, go down
to view his concerns there: And being come to their
Inne, at a place called <hi>Dromgreagh</hi> near <hi>Baltinglaſs,</hi>
where they intended to Lodge that Night; the Doctor
began a diſcourſe of ſeveral things that happened to
him in his Childhood near that place, and that it was
about 34 years ſince he had been in that Country:
That he had been often told by his Mother, and ſeveral
others of his Relations, of <hi>Spirits</hi> which they call'd
<hi>Fairies,</hi> who uſed frequently to carry him away, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57799:3"/>
continue him with them for ſome time, without doing
him the leaſt prejudice: But his Mother being very
much frighted and concern'd thereat, did as often as
he was miſſing, ſend to a certain Old Woman, her
Neighbour in the Country, who by repeating ſome
<hi>Spells</hi> or <hi>Exorciſms,</hi> would ſuddenly cauſe his return.
Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi> uſed ſeveral Arguments to diſſwade the
Doctor from the belief of ſo idle and improbable a
Story; But notwithſtanding what was ſaid to the
contrary, the Doctor did poſitively affirm the truth
thereof. And during the diſpute, the Doctor on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſtarting up, told them he muſt leave their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
for he was called away. Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi> perceiving
him to be raiſed off from the ground, catches faſt hold
of his arm with one hand, and intwined his arm within
the Doctor's arm, and with his other hand graſpt the
Doctor's ſhoulder; <hi>Laughlin Moore</hi> likewiſe held him
on the other ſide: But the Doctor (maugre their
ſtrength) was lifted off the ground. <hi>Laughlin Moore</hi>'s
fear cauſed him preſently to let go; but Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi>
continued his hold, and was carried above a yard from
the ground, and then by ſome extraordinary unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
force was compelled to quit. The Doctor was
hurried immediately out of the Room, but whether
conveyed through the window, or out at the door,
they being ſo affrighted none of them could declare.</p>
            <p>The two Gentlemen being greatly ſurprized at the
ſtrangeneſs of the accident, and troubled for the loſs
of their Friend, call'd for the Inn-keeper, to whom they
related what had befaln their Companion. He ſeem'd
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57799:3"/>
not to be much terrified thereat, as if ſuch diſaſters
were common thereabouts; but told them, That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a quarter of a mile there lived a Woman, who by
the Neighbourhood was call'd a <hi>Wiſe-woman,</hi> and who
did uſually give Intelligence of ſeveral things that had
been loſt, and of Cattel that were gone aſtray, and he
doubted not but if the Woman were ſent for, ſhe could
reſolve them where their Friend was, and by what
means conveyed away. They forthwith ſent a Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
for the Woman, who being come, Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
if ſhe could give them any account of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
one Dr. <hi>Moore,</hi> that had been Spirited out of
their Company about an hour before. The Woman
told him ſhe could, and that he was then in a Wood
about a mile diſtant, preparing to take Horſe; that in
one hand he had a Glaſs of Wine, in the other a piece
of Bread; that he was very much courted to eat and
drink, but if he did either, he ſhould never be free
from a Conſumption, and pine away to death.
Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi> gave the Woman a Cobb, and deſired her
to uſe ſome means for preventing his eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
She anſwered, He ſhould neither eat nor drink
with them: And then ſtruck down her hand, as if ſhe
were ſnatching at ſomething. When ſhe had thus done,
ſhe often repeated a Spell or Charm in <hi>Iriſh,</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
whereof was; Firſt ſhe runs his Pedigree back
four Generations, and calls his Anceſtors by their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Names; then ſummons him from the Eaſt, the Weſt,
the North, and the South, from Troops and Regiments,
eſpecially from the Governour mounted on the Sorrel
Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And after having repeated the Charm, ſhe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:57799:4"/>
gave them an account of the ſeveral places the Doctor
ſhould be carried unto that Night.</p>
            <p>As firſt, from the Wood to a <hi>Danes</hi> Fort about ſeven
miles diſtant, where there ſhould be great Revelling
and Dancing, together with variety of Meats and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors;
to the eating and drinking whereof he ſhould
be very much importuned, but promiſed ſhe would
prevent his doing either. And from that Fort he was
to be carried twenty miles farther, where there would
likewiſe be great Merriment, and then to the <hi>Seven
Churches;</hi> and towards Day-break ſhould be return'd
ſafe to the company of his Friends, without any dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
or miſchief whatſoever: and ſo took leave of
Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi> and Mr. <hi>Moore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>About ſix a clock the next morning, Dr. <hi>Moore</hi>
knocked at the door, and being let in, deſired Meat
and Drink might be provided for him, for that he was
both hungry and thirſty, having been hurried from
place to place all that Night: And after having refreſh'd
himſelf, diſcours'd of the manner of his being taken
away; That it ſeem'd to him there came into the
Room about twenty men, ſome mounted on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back,
others on foot, and laid hold on him; That he was
ſenſible of Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Moore</hi>'s endeavours to
have kept him, and of the force they uſed; but it was
all to no purpoſe, for had there been fourty more they
would have ſignified nothing; That from the Houſe
he was carried to a Wood, about a mile diſtant, where
was a fine Horſe prepared, and as he was about to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57799:4"/>
mount, a Glaſs of Wine was given him, and a cruſt of
Bread; but when he offer'd to eat and drink, they were
both ſtruck out of his hand; That from thence he went
in the ſame Company that had taken him away, to a
<hi>Danes</hi> Fort about ſeven miles from the Wood; That
he imagined himſelf to be mounted on a white Horſe,
whoſe motion was exceeding ſwift, and when they
came to the Fort, their Company multiplied to about
three hundred large and well-proportioned Men and
Women: He who ſeem'd to be Chief, was mounted on
a Sorrel Horſe; that they all diſmounted and fell to
dancing, and that it came to the Doctor's turn to
lead a Dance, which he did remember the Tune he
danced unto.</p>
            <p>That after the dancing, there appear'd a moſt ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
Banquet, and the Governour took him by the
hand and deſired him to eat; which he ſeveral times
attempted, but was prevented by ſomething that ſtill
ſtruck the Meat out of his hand: And ſo gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how from thence he was carried to the ſeveral
places the Old Woman had mentioned the Night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
and that about break of day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he found himſelf
alone within ſight of the Inne.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi> was ſo curious as to go ſeven miles out
of his way, to ſee the <hi>Danes</hi> Fort, and the Doctor was
his Guide; who traced the path he had travelled the
Night before ſo exactly, that if his Horſe went but a
yard out of the track, he would preſently turn him
into it again; and that upon view of the Fort, he
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:57799:5"/>
found the Graſs ſo trodden down, and the Ground
beaten, as if five hundred men had been there.</p>
            <p>This was related by Mr. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niack</hi> in the preſence of
one Dr. <hi>Murphey,</hi> a Civilian, Dr. <hi>Moore</hi> himſelf; and
Mr. <hi>Ludlow,</hi> one of the Six Clerks of the High Court
of Chancery, <hi>November</hi> 18. 1678.</p>
            <p>FOr ſatisfaction of the Licenſer, I certifie
this following Relation was ſent to me
from <hi>Dublin,</hi> by a perſon whom I credit, and
recommended in a Letter, bearing date the
23<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>November</hi> laſt, as True News much
ſpoken of there.</p>
