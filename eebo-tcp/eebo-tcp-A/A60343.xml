         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IF Sins and Troubles make times bad,
those have been so in which our lines have
been cast; as great and glorious light hath
shin'd in our Horizon, as in any since the
Apostle's Age, yet the works of darkness have
abounded among us, Superstition, Persecution and
Prophaneness. Great numbers among us hate the
light of Truth, and gladly would have it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished;
And who can count those who walk
as enemies to the Cross of Christ, whose God is
their belly, and whose glory is in their shame?
We have had fierce disputes, and hot contentions
(<hi>Veluti pro aris &amp; foc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi>) for lifeless Forms
and Ceremonies not worth a button, which have
been bones of Contention in the Church of God ever
since the Reformation, and will continue so to be,
till Men are grown wise enough to cast them out;
but at the same time, the Vitals of Christianity,
and Power of Godliness have been forgotten and
neglected, nay, by the generality, (such <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians</hi>
there are in our days) ridicul'd and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<pb facs="tcp:42459:3"/>
so that many live direct contradictions to the
Profession they make, and throw dirt upon that
Name in which they would be thought to Glory.
The grand design, indeed, driven on among us,
hath been to reduce these Nations to the See of
<hi>Rome<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
               </hi> and to bring in Popery among us; in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
whereunto; Men taught by the Devil, and
wise to do evil, have by their Hellish and Cursed
Examples introduc'd prophandenss; for none so
fit to make a Doctrinal Papist, as one that is a
Practical Atheist. How far these persons have
prevailed, and this Nation hath been by them
immoralized and debauched, and all ranks of
Men among us, Clergy as well as Laity, Nobility
and Commons, Gentlemen and Peasants, vitiated
both in Principles and Life, is, alas! too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
and visible to any one that hath an eye in bit
head. And if ever God hath a purpose to do this
Nation good, and to deliver us form implacable
enemies, and menacing dangers, and after all ou
fears, and convulsions, and shakings, to settle <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon sure and lasting foundations, he will reform
us. I wish that every one would reform himself
and save cur Rules a labour; if they will not
I wish that our Governours would imploy then

requires) against a potent Adversary abroad,
they would, by the vigorous execution of wholeso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

most expose us to ruin, because to Divine wrath

and thereby (if I may so speak) save God a
labour: But if they will not do their work,
God will do his. It is my hope, that he will not

great an interest; but mend it, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light

letting out the corrupt Blood by tremendous Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or more gently by the Word, it is not for
me to determine, that we must leave to him whose
wisdom is unsearchable, and his ways past find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his gracious opening such a wide and effectual

free a passage, as blessed be his name, we see at
this day; and restoring a desired and welcome
liberty of Preaching to many of his faithful and
eminent Servants, who had by severe Laws been
driven, and kept out of the Vineyard; for which
many of them who had an hand in making those
Laws, have answered at the highest and most
dreadful Tribunal; and the rest shall in due
time, too soon for them. The good Lord grant,
that while the Gospel runs, it may be glorified, by
attaining is most excellent and noble end in the
hearts and lives of those who sit under the joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
sound thereof; that so Religion may recover
its pristine Lustre, yea, shine forth with a greater
glory than it did in the days of our most famous
Predecessors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:42459:4"/>Altogether unexpectedly to me, It pleased
the great God (whose right it is to dispose of
us according to his good pleasure) to call me
to Minister to you in the Gospel of his Son,
after he had taken home to an everlasting
Rest, and fulness of Ioy, in and with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
your former, Learned, and every-way
accomplished Pastor, whose death was as it
deserved to be, bitterly bewailed by you. In
the same Relation to you he hath continued
me for almost these Fifteen years during
which space of time, variety of Providences
have passed over our heads, we have met
with both Halcion and Tempestuous days; but
we must, we are obliged togive an honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
report of him, as having been to us a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
from the heat, and a shelter from the
storm; so that few of our Sabbaths have
been, in the fury of the times, Fasting-days
throughout, and very f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>w of our Meeting di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbed
and violently broken up: But as he
was pleased to give me an heart to Preach,
so you had from him an heart to hear; and
however some that went off from us have
tack'd about, and defiled their Garments, the
most of you have weathered the point, born
the burnt, kept your ground, and found mercy
to be faithful to the Cause you owned, not sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
complying with the Lusts of Men, nor
submitting to their impositions, and unscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb facs="tcp:42459:4"/>
mixtures with, and in things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Divine Worship; upon which account
among many others, I can look upon you as
those that have been, and yet are, and will,
I hope, go on to be my Ioy and Crown.</p>
            <p>I can call God to witness, that I love you
in truth, and have both sincerely and earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
desir'd your good, endeavouring to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
of my ability, to make known unto you
the whole Counsel of God; not putting you off
with Rhetorical flourishes, the enticing words
of Man's wisdom, new and empty notions,
Philosophical strains, and inventions of Men;
but with that Bread that came down from
Heaven, nourishing you up to Eternal Life;
determining to know nothing among you, but
Iesus, Christ, and him Crucified, who is the
admiration of Angels, and worthy to be the
desire of all Nations; but too little Preached
in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>London</hi> at this day; and
too little valued and believed in. He hath
been the great subject of my Discourses among
you, while, as you will bear me testimony, I
have not sought yours, but you. And as you
did chuse your Cook, so you have liked the
Provision be drest and set upon your Board, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
been, for the greatest part, as constant
in your attendance upon my Ministry, as any in
<hi>London;</hi> and not like many, given to change,
wandering up and down from place to place,
<pb facs="tcp:42459:5"/>
by means whereof their itching Ears have been
more tickled, that their precious Souls advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taged;
yed, some of them running from the
Flock to which they-belong, and not keeping the
place in which God by his Providence had<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> set
them, have fallen into the hands of Seducers,
who have led them out of the way Everlasting,
and then robbed them of their Light and Heat,
the precious Truths of God, and their Zeal for
him, leaving them wounded both in Head and
Heart, and wallowing in the Blood of their Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy.</p>
            <p>I was, in a prudent and very modest Letter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to preach upon that excellent Duty of <hi>Secret
Prayer,</hi> by one of your number, who had with
grief taken notice what strangers some Professors
are to the practice of it, yea, how some do live
in the total neglect of it, as if it were altogether
unnecessary and unprofitable. The motion being
made, did meet with a very ready and chearful
entertainment: I stood not debating, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
closed and buckled to the business, and the
very next Lord's Day begun it. A single Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
only was desired, and I intended no more:
but having once engaged my thoughts, they mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied,
and grew up into four. As soon as I
knew the person that sent me the Letter, and
made the Motion, I gave her my Thanks, and I
do here repeat them, because I find that many,
through the Blessing of God, have got good by it.
<pb facs="tcp:42459:5"/>
When I had finished the Discourses, a Letter,
subscribed by several, was presented me, desiring,
That what had been Preached, might be Printed;
which was granted as soon as asked; though the
Great Work which lieth upon me, doth render
Printing very tedious to me, and alloweth me not
that exactness which I delight in, and should
otherwise endeavour. But I am Yours, and
take pleasure in being so, and know not how to
deny you any thing. And now I wish, That
what is here sent abroad into the open World,
might find acceptance there, and meet with a
kind reception from Others, as it did from You;
and also, That it may bring forth much fruit,
and accomplish that for which it hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
even the good of precious Souls, the awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
to, and quickening in this great piece of
practical Godliness, those who have totally neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
it, or been exceeding remiss.</p>
            <p>Little do Men and Women think how greatly
they prejudice themselves by carelesness touching
matters of this nature: they had better act by
halves, and tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>le in the Affairs of this World,
than in those of Religion. How can any think to
be supplied fresh that Stock which is laid up in
the hand of Christ, or to be enriched by his inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haustible
fulness, if they do not seek him? How
can any expect the performance and making good of
the Promises to them<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> unless they put them in suit?
How can any rationally hope, that they shall with
<pb facs="tcp:42459:6"/>
Ioy draw Water out of the Well of Salvation,
when they will not take so much pains as to let
down their Bucket into it? Though great and
glorious things be in the heart and purposes of God
concerning his People, and he hath passed his Word
for them, which is better than Man's Bond, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
sufficient; yet he will be enquired of by
them to do them for them. Well, whoever they
be who undervalue God, making him the Object
neither of their Love nor of their Fear; whoever
they he that say unto God, <hi>Depart from us, we
desire not the knowledge of thy ways, nor to
maintain any fellowship with thy Majesty;</hi>
whoever they be that taste no sweetness in holy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
and see not that God is necessary, but
hope to pick up a satisfaction for themselves out of
inferior and transitory Goods: Let your wants
drive you to God, and your love draw you to
him; do you seek the Lord, and his strength,
yea, seek his face evermore; lay hold upon all
opportunities of meeting with him, bearing
from him, and pouring out your Souls before
him; go with <hi>Zacheus</hi> into the <hi>High-way,</hi>
that there you may get a sight of <hi>Christ;</hi> and
with the <hi>Spouse</hi> into the <hi>secret places of the
stairs,</hi> and there let him hear your voice.
Certainly, all those that are born of God, have
been made partakers of the Holy Ghost, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
to the Glory above, and Ioint-heirs with
Christ; have received and are acted by the
<pb facs="tcp:42459:6"/>
Spirit of Adoption, which is a Spirit of Grace
and Supplication, and puts them upon going
to him in all cases, as to their Father in
Christ, their God in Covenant. They are in
the Scripture called, <hi>The Generation of them
that seek him.</hi> And let men say what they
will, it will be found, That the most praying
Christians are the most thriving Christians;
<hi>They</hi> are the persons that now get most of
Heaven, and make the happiest progress in
the way thither. Do you therefore in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
direct your Prayer to God, and look up;
do you present Him with the First-fruits, so
will the whole be sanctified; by that means
you will secure to your selves his direction in
the difficulties of the day, his defence against
the temptations of it, his support under the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions
of it, his assistance in the work and

endeavours to succeed them, and upon your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments
to sweeten them to you. When the
evening comes, end your day with God, make
him the <hi>Omega</hi> as well as the <hi>Alpha;</hi> pay
him the tribute of Praise for the Mercies you
recieved, beg the continuance of his favour;
so may you lie down in peace, and comfortably
expect a being shadowed with his wing, and
having sleep given you as to his beloved Ones,
while the Hedge of his Protection is set about
your Persons, Families, and all that you
<pb facs="tcp:42459:7"/>
have. Upon the Lord's day, get alone, and
do all you can to pray your selves into an holy
and heavenly frame, fit for the Duties and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
of it; beg his Presence with you, and
in them, and a sight of his Power and Glory;
and that there he would give you of his Loves,
and <hi>Kiss you with the Kisses of his mouth.</hi>
Never dare to come to the publick Assemblies,
till you have been with the Great Master of
them, who alone can bless his Provisions to
your refreshing and nourishment, and fasten
his Truths in your Heads and Hearts, as a
Nail in a sure place. Pray that he who hath
the Key of <hi>David,</hi> would open the Minister's
mouth, and your hearts, giving him the
<hi>Tongue of the Learned,</hi> and you the <hi>Ear of
the Obedience;</hi> both prepare the Seed, and
likewise fit the Soil. And when you return
from the Congregation to your own Houses,
there set upon Prayer again, and so cover the
Seed that is sown, and earnestly desire of God,
That as he did enable you to mingle Faith with
the Word that was delivered, so he would grant
you to live and practice it. The Life in
Heaven will be a Life of Praise; O let our
Life on Earth be a Life of Prayer: There our
Souls will have an Eternal Repose in him;

Prayer for you all is, That you may be saved,
and that you may work out your Salvation with
fear and trembling. If you and I get to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
at last, it matters not what storms we meet
with here. It is but a little while, and all our
hard work<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and sharp conflicts, and sour affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
will have an end; and then we shall
see God, and manage Everlasting Triumphs;
sinning and sighing<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> wanting and weeping no

Enemies<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> 
               <hi>walk while you have the light,</hi>
and mind your work while you have any to do.
Husband your time, improve your seasons,
trade with your Talents, fill your Relations
with Duty, and in all things adorn the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of our God and Saviour. It is your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
desire to enjoy pure Ordinances and
an holy Communion: Oh that there may be
none among you that profane those Ordinances,
and pollute that Communion! First look to
your hearts, then to your ways, and make and
keep both as clean as you can. Be much in mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your selves, not in censuring others; their
infirmities do you pity, and labour to get your
own healed. Your stay and mine here is not
like to be long; and we mine here is not
like to be long; and we need not care how
short it is, so the great work for which we
were sent, be finished before we go. When we
<pb facs="tcp:42459:8"/>
are once in Heaven, we shall not need the
World, and the Church will not need us; for
God hath the residue of the Spirit, and can set
others in our places, who shall fill them better
than we have done. While I am continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
you. I shall, by Grace assisting, make it
my business to help your Faith and Ioy; do
you work together with me, and God with us
all. Be friends to your selves, and one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
why are you brought into an holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
but in order to mutual edification?
And our life is not to be measured so much by
the multitude of days, or plenty of enjoyments,
as by usefulness<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> He that doth most service, shall
have the greatest commendation, and weightiest

            <p>THese words are a little part of
our dear Saviour's first Sermon,
and the longest that ever he
Preached; full of excellent mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
most worthy of the <hi>Preacher,</hi> most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and profitable for the <hi>Hearers;</hi> it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds
with wholesom and excellent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and affords most precious and cordial
Comforts. They that would taste his
Comforts, must follow his Counsels; and
as they desire that Christ would admit
them into Heaven when they dye, they
must be very careful while they live, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
and practice what he taught while he
was here upon Earth: Learn of him as a
Prophet, if you would be advanced by him
as <hi>King.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:42459:9"/>In the beginning of this Chapter, he
commands his Disciples and Followers <hi>to
take heed.</hi> Caution becomes Christians,
their Case calls loudly for it; the life which
they live in the flesh, requires a great deal
of caution for the leading of it, that it
might not be a vain and empty life, a low
and unworthy life; and the duties of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
to the doing of which they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged,
requires as much, that they may
not be spoiled by them, nor rejected by
God; nor thrown as dung into their faces.
Take heed, O Professors, how you live,
and walk and carry in the World; weigh
all your actions, and ponder the path of
your feet. Take heed what you hear, and
how you hear; take heed how you pray,
for what, and in what manner; take heed
how you converse, and with whom; take
heed how you eat and drink, and buy and
sell; how you think and speak: Take heed
that you avoid all sinful things, and that
you do not sin in any lawful things. There
is a great deal of unseen danger, there is a
multitude of snares subtilly and privily laid;
and we are very prone to miscarry, to fall
into those dangers, and be caught in those
snares: We have need to be circumspect
and wary. Take heed therefore, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
and considering, He gives the charge,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42459:9"/>
who loves you dearly, and knows better
than you what need there is of it.</p>
            <p>Our Lord in particular gives this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and caution concerning the ordinary
works of <hi>Alms-giving</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> and that
extraordinary duty of <hi>Fasting:</hi> all which
are so good and excellent in themselves,
that he would not have them spoil'd by
any of his Servants, whatever they are by
others, who will needs pretend to him,
while they have no more of him than the
name; and that which as to these things
he doth in general caution them about, is,
<hi>That they be not as the Hypocrites.</hi> Hypocrisy
is a thing exceeding odious unto God. An
Ape is most like a Man, but is not one; and
of all creatures he is most deformed. An
Hypocrite is of all others most like a Saint,
but is not; and of all Sinners he is most
hateful. He shall not stand before God,
but be banished furthest from him: The
worst, darkest, hottest place in Hell, is his
apartment. God doth so much loath Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites,
that he doth not allow his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to resemble them. He would not have
them to be Hypocrites; nay, he would not
have them to be <hi>as</hi> Hypocrites: When thou
gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>est Alms, do not sound a Trumpet <hi>as the
Hypocrites do:</hi> Instead of letting the <hi>world,</hi>
do not let thy <hi>left hand</hi> know what thy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ight
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:42459:10"/>
hand doth. When thou prayest, thou shalt
not be <hi>as</hi> the Hypocrites are, for they love
to pray standing in the Synagogues: They
do not love to do good without having
many Witnesses of the good they do: As
if that Duty were lost from which they do
not reap the praise of Men. When thou
fastest, be not as the Hypocrites, of a sad
countenance: They love to put on a sour
face; but never look after nor care for a
broken and contrite heart. Thus our Lord
and Master would not have his followers to
conform to them; Do not fashion your
selves like them; get not into their mode
and dress, though it seem great and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some;
Be ye followers of God, as dear
Children, in all things; Keep as close to
him as ever you can. Put on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
be ye cloathed all over with Christ;
That as near as may be, nothing but Christ,
and his Spirit, and Vertues, may be seen in
you; but be not like the Hypocrites in any
thing. An Hypocrite loseth all he doth,
and will be himself rejected.</p>
            <p>In the words which we have under our
consideration, you find the direction which
our Saviour gives concerning Prayer after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
an excellent pattern to frame it by;
here's an excellent Rule. In the former
Verse, He had taken notice of the guise or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42459:10"/>
manner of the <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in those days, <hi>They
loved to pray standing in the Synagogues, and in
the corners of the streets,</hi> in open and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
places, where they were sure not
to fail of Spectators and Observers of their
Devotion, who would, as they hoped, tell
what they had seen, and cry them up as
persons eminent for their Piety, though
that was a thing of which they had no
more than the shew. Thus they had meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an external Religion, unto the practice
whereof, they were carried out only by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
considerations. It was not a Spring
within, but Weights without, that set their
Wheels a going. The <hi>end</hi> that they in all
aim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>d at<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> was <hi>to be seen of men,</hi> that among
them they might raise a name, obtain cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
and applause, and be accounted some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodies
for Religion, though they knew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be no other than Cheats. Christ
tells us the issue hereof; they do not miss
the mark, but catch what they fish for.
<hi>Verily they have their reward;</hi> there is none
to come, none laid up for them in Heaven,
they have it now, in this present time, all
that is good of it; Glory, but a vain glory;
a Name, but nothing else; they get an
esteem with ignorant men, who are as
empty as themselves; they are reckoned
great Men, Who but they for their Sanctity?
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42459:11"/>
And let them have it, and bless themselves
in it: But thou who lovest thy Soul, and
desirest to be indeed a gainer by thy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<hi>enter thou into thy Closet when thou pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;</hi>
run not into a corner of a Street, but
some nook or corner of the House; <hi>and when
thou hast</hi> (not opened thy Casement, but)
<hi>shut thy door, pray to thy Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may rationally look upon Christ, as
supposing that all who call themselves, and
would be by others accounted Christians,
do pray; that every one who counts it his
honour to take up that Name, will also
reckon himself obliged to take up that work.
And indeed it is a contradiction for any
Man to say that he is a Christian, and yet live
a Prayerless Life; no Man can have a Spirit of
Holiness given him, who doth not pour out
his Soul unto God in Prayer. It is as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
to find an Holy Devil in Hell, as a
prayerless Saint upon Earth. <hi>Paul</hi> was no
sooner thrown to the ground, but we have
him upon his Knees; no sooner a Convert,
but a Supplicant: Grace cannot possibly be
in that Man's heart, who lives without
Prayer in the World. Christ takes it then
for granted, that Disciples will pray; when
they can do nothing else, they will do that:
If they be in the furthermost parts of the
Earth, they will from thence send up a cry
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42459:11"/>
to Heaven. <hi>Ionah</hi> thought the Belly of the
Fish, in which he was, to be the Belly of
Hell; yet there he did pray, and resolve to
look toward God's Holy Temple. So then,
I say, our Saviour takes it for granted, that
those who are his Disciples do pray; and
therefore here he only gives them counsel
and advice for the right management of it,
that they might not, through some fatal
mistake, lose their labour, spend their
breath to no purpose, offend the God
whom they seek; and instead of obtaining
a blessing from him, pull down wrath and
a curse upon their own heads. Do not
you in your Prayer fly so low a pitch as to
make esteem with Men your end, either
the whole or any part of your end. Do
not aim at vain glory; suppose by that
means you may get a Name, that gain will
not make you rich; a Name you may have,
but such an one as will rot and perish. A
great noise you may make in the World,
but it will be an empty sound: And what
will you be the better for that? A little
popular breath may swell and puff you up;
but it will not raise you any thing nearer
to God and Heaven, nor blow you on any
faster to the Port of Glory. It is no matter
how much there is of privacy in your
Prayer, so that there be sincerity and purity
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42459:12"/>
too, nor how secretly it goeth up to God,
so that it doth not go out of feigned Lips.
When others are altogether for the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues
and Streets, Do thou, O Christian,
enter into thy Closet, or Chamber, and
shut thy door about thee; do thou take
pleasure in thy retirements. When no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
sees, thy God doth, yea, and he loves
to see; and when no body hears, thy God
doth; and what he hears, he likes; thy
Prayers, thy Sighs, thy Groans are his Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick:
Only I desire that this may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
That while Christ doth here
command and enjoyn secret duty, it is not
any part of his purpose to exclude or take
us from publick; only he would shut out
and separate Vanity and Pride from both.
That point of Doctrine, which from hence
I shall raise and discourse upon, is this:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Doct.</hi> Closet, on Secret Prayer, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and advantageous duty, which all
the People of God ought to be very much
in the performance of; when you are alone,
and have no body with you, then be you
with God. At a night, when you are in
Bed, <hi>commune with your hearts,</hi> and be still;
turn your eyes inward before sleep closeth
them; and before you go to Bed, spend
some time in seeking of, and communing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:42459:12"/>
with your God. Take your leave of your
Friends and Relations; or if you please,
steal away from them, that you and your
God may be together. When upon an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
command given him by God himself,
<hi>Abraham</hi> went to offer up his only and dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloved Son <hi>Isaac,</hi> Genesis 22. 5. <hi>He said
unto his young men, Abide here with the Ass,
and I and the Lad will go yonder and worship,
and come again to you.</hi> He feared that if they
went with him, they would be an hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to him, and therefore would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of their Company. So let worldly
business be laid aside, and acquaintance set
at a distance, while you go by your selves
to perform acts of Worship, and to pour
out your requests into the bosome of your
Heavenly Father. Think not that I speak
against <hi>Publick Prayer,</hi> for God loveth the
Gates of <hi>Zion,</hi> and Christ walks in the
Golden Candlesticks; when his people are
met together in his name, he will be in the
midst of them. Nor am I for your casting
off Family Prayer; there is a Prayer upon
record in Scripture against prayerless Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
calling for wrath to be poured out by
God upon them. Both these kinds of
Prayers ought to be presented, let them not
be neglected. Secret Prayer is a choice part
of your work too, be not any of you want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42459:13"/>
to it. In the handling of this point,
I shall first lay down these four proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> Prayer in general is the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
duty; a burthen laid upon us by God
himself. It is very much commanded in
the Word, and the Precept of it frequently
repeated, <hi>Matt. 26. 41. Watch and pray,
that ye enter not into temptation.</hi> 1 Thess. 5.
17. <hi>Pray without ceasing.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 8. <hi>I
will that men pray every where,</hi> without wrath
or doubting. And in <hi>Matt. 18. 1. Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
spake a parable to them to this end, that
men ought always to pray, and not to saint.</hi> You
should be continually in a praying frame,
having your Graces and Affections ready;
and you should be frequent in the Work.
This is a piece of natural worship, the very
Law of our Creation doth oblige us to it;
and the light of Nature (though it be now
since the Fall exceeding dim, and like a
Candle burnt down into the Socket) hath
directed the Heathens themselves to the
performance of it: They, when in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing
Storm, and <hi>Ionah</hi> fast a-sleep in the
Ship, could go and awaken him, and bid
him to call upon his God.</p>
            <p>Prayer is what we owe to God, not only
as we are Christians, but likewise as we are
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42459:13"/>
creatures; not only as Saints, but also as
Men and Women. It is a part of that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
which we ought to pay to him, as we
had our Being from his Power, and as we
have that Being continued and sweetned to
us by his Goodness. In a word, It is a
practical acknowledgment of that necessary
and constant dependence we have upon him.
So that the Man or Woman who doth not
pray, is no better than an Atheist, both in
Heart and Life. He doth first cast off God
who casts off Prayer, <hi>Psal.</hi> 14. 1. The <hi>fool</hi>
first saith in his heart, <hi>there is no God;</hi> and
then you find in <hi>vers.</hi> 3, 4. That he doth not
seek God, nor call upon him. Let Men
and Women make never so great and fair
a profession, attribute to themselves what
they will, and lay their claim to as many
glorious Names and Titles as they please,
their Profession is no better than a Lye; those
Names and Titles do not at all belong to
them; and the Religion unto which they
pretend, is no other than a lifeless Image,
which God, when he awakes, will most
certainly despise, in case they live without
this excellent duty. You may call and
count them Atheists, without doing them
any injury. Those that live without Prayer
in the World, are the Men and Women that
live without God in the World; and if
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42459:14"/>
they live without God in this World, you
may easily know with whom they shall live
in that World which is to come.</p>
            <p>Some may be apt to think it a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
for any Atheists to be found in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
where there is so much Knowledg,
such plenty of Means, such a great and
glorious Light shining; but I fear, if there
were an enquiry made, it would plainly
appear there are more of them than we do
imagine; yea, I am not in the least afraid
to affirm, that in this famous City there are
the greatest and vilest Atheists in the World.
The Lord himself saith, <hi>Isa. 42 14. Who is
blind but my servant? or deaf as my messenger
that I sent? Who is blind as He that is perfect,
or blind as the Lord's servant?</hi> As if he should
have said, There is no reason to wonder at
the ignorance and blindness which is among
the Heathen who live in the dark places of
the Earth, when there is such blindness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
my Servants, both Prophets and
People, who have their habitations in a
Land of Light, a Valley of Vision. There
are none so blind, as those who are blinded
by the Sun, and have their Eyes put out by
that very light by which they should see.
None so blind as those that will not see;
none so ignorant as those that will not
learn and know. First Men do wickedly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42459:14"/>
shut their own eyes, and then God doth in
just judgment put them out, <hi>Isa. 6. 9. Go,
and tell this People, Hear ye indeed, but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
not; see ye indeed, but perceive not; make
the heart of this People fat, and make their ears
heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their
eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
with their hearts, and convert and be healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But know that in the first place; remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
and consider it. <hi>Prayer is absolutely your
duty:</hi> charge it upon your selves, and make
conscience of minding and doing it: you
are obliged to it both as you are Christians
and Creatures; it is a part of your reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
service: and your neglect of it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
discharge and deliver you from your
engagement to it. If you do not pay it,
the Debt goes on; the Sin increases; and
how great a sum will it at last amount to!
every day that you pass without your Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Evening Sacrifice, you do feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
rob God of that glory which is due to
his Name, and wickedly transgress the Law
of your Creation.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Prayer it self is your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
so a liberty to pray is your choice privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ere, and pause a little, and seriously think
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42459:15"/>
with your selves, how great a matter it is
for a poor contemptible Worm to have the
Ear of the Infinite and Glorious God open
to its cry: for you; who are no better (as
<hi>Abraham</hi> freely acknowledged) than dust
and ashes, to have the door of Grace open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to you, and leave to approach, and make
your application to the Majesty of Heaven,
and to state your case to him, and to spread
all your desires before him, and to pour out
your requests and groans into his Bosome at
any time, and as often as you please, so that
you come in a right manner, and behave
your selves with a becoming reverence, and
godly fear. Converse and Communion
with God was the happiness of innocent
Man. So long as our first Parents persisted
in that pure and perfect state in which they
were created, they could think of God with
rejoycing, contemplate his Glory with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and walk with him as Friends: But
all this was forfeited and lost by the Fall.
Sin, at its first entry, broke that harmony;
it cloathed God with terror, and Man with
shame; his confidence was gone, and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
took its place; so that instead of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with God, man fled from him, and
would have hid, had he known how, and
where. Sin presently erected a middle-wall
of partition between them. It would have
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42459:15"/>
been fatal to man, and as much as his life
was worth, to have adventur'd in his lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
state into the presence of God, whom
he had highly provoked, had there not
been help laid upon one that is mighty,
and the gracious interposition of a powerful
and prevailing Mediator.</p>
            <p>God is in himself a devouring fire, and
everlasting burnings. How then is it safe
for man to approach to him, or to dwell
with him, since he is of a plasant Plant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
no better than a Briar, a Thorn, dried
Stubble, fit for the burning? how well
might guilty Sinners <hi>call</hi> (with them in the
6th of the <hi>Revelutions, v. 16.) to the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
and Rocks to fall upon them, and hide
them from the face of him that sitteth upon the
Throne?</hi> But the beloved and ever-blessed
Son of God, in a most gracious compliance
with, and pursuance of his Father's will,
hath restored unto man freedom of access
to God. Jesus Christ, though He knew
full well how great the attempt was, and
how much it would stand him in, did put
his life in his hand, and engaged his heart
to approach unto God; and being our peace,
hath procured for us a liberty of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
too, and of drawing nigh, going as
near as we will, even to his very Throne,
<hi>Heb. 10. 19, 20. Having therefore, brethren,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42459:16"/>
boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of
Iesus, by a new and living way, which he hath
consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say,
his flesh.</hi> Christ entred into the holiest of
all, he entred in triumph as one that had
conquered all his Enemies; He entred with
joy as one that had finished the work, and
sate down at the right hand of God, to
take there his everlasting rest; and (as you
have it in the 9th of the <hi>Hebrews, v. 12.) He
entred not by the blood of Calves and Goats, but
by his own blood.</hi> He carried that along with
him; and now by that Blood we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
too, we may enter with safety, there is
no danger for a gracious person, a believing
Soul: Though the Throne of God be a
Throne of Glory, yet is it a Throne of Grace,
a Mercy-seat, that hath a Rain-bow round
about it; and because we enter with <hi>safety,</hi>
therefore we may enter with <hi>boldness,</hi> both
with a freedom of speech, telling God all that
is in our hearts; and with the full assurance
of Faith, as those that shall find mercy and
grace to accept, and help in time of need.
Now if that any of you do not value this
privilege at an high rate, if you do not care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
improve it, and make use of it now it
hath been purchased by Christ for poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
you deal very disingenuously, do not
well consider the inestimable price which it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42459:16"/>
cost, and you offer a most vile and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
affront to the precious Blood of <hi>Iesus,</hi> as
if it were an unholy thing, of no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
than that of a Beast, a common and
ordinary man, or of a guilty and death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deserving
Criminal.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> All the sorts of holy Prayer
are to be made use of, <hi>Eph. 6. 18. Praying
always with all prayer in the Spirit, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto with all perseverance, and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for all Saints.</hi> Your Prayers must be in
the Spirit: that is, with your Spirit; Prayer
must not only be a Lip-labour, but the
work of the heart; the words in Prayer are
but the carcase of the duty; the fervour
and heat of the Affections, are the life and
soul of it: and also it must be with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Spirit; whose work it is to help his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
Infirmities, and to make intercession in
them: Prayer must be by the influence and
assistance of the Divine Spirit, and with the
heat and earnestness of our own spirits: so
then we are to pray in the Spirit, or, as
<hi>Iude</hi> saith, <hi>in the Holy Ghost:</hi> and happy
they who have not fallible men to make
their Prayers for them, but the Spirit of
God: but there are two other Expressions
in the forementioned Scripture we ought to
take a little notice of. <hi>Praying always,</hi> Do
not understand it as if you were to be day
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42459:17"/>
and night at it, as if praying were the whole
of your duty, for you have a great deal of
other work to do, which must be carefully
attended, and therefore the Original is,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>. in all opportunities, in every
fit and proper season for prayer: in every
condition into which Providence casts you,
and upon every occasion that calls for it:
The other Expression most pertinent to our
present business, is, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>with all prayer and supplication,</hi> i. e. with
ordinary prayer, and with extraordinary
too, that which hath fasting joined with it:
private prayer and publick too; ejaculato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
prayer, when the Soul <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>allies out on a
sudden unto God, gives him a visit, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
knocks at his door, puts in a short
Petition, and is gone, like one that is enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
about some other business, and cannot
stay: and also composed Prayer, in which
the Soul fixeth and abides some consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
time with God: Family-prayer,
and Closet-prayer; Prayer in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with others, and alone by our selves.
We may, and must, make use of all these
kinds of Prayers as opportunity offers, and
occasions do require. But to come more
close to the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Secret Prayer is a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent
upon Christians. Now that we
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42459:17"/>
call <hi>secret Prayer,</hi> when a person gets alone
by himself, and makes his requests known
to God. When being sequestred from all
company whatsoever, and withdrawn from
his nearest and dearest Relations, his most
familiar and intimate Friends, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
in a most close and private retirement, he
sends out his Soul upon the wings of holy
and servent desires, and labours with all his
might to fetch down his God to him by his
gracious presence, and to obtain of him
those favours and blessings of which he finds
a sensible want, either in whole, or in part.
It is that by which he knocks at the gate of
Heaven, and goeth into the Holiest of all,
and gives his heavenly Father a visit
in such a manner as that no body may
know of it. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap> that he is ashamed of
what he doth, for he is free to own God
for his Sovereign Lord, Christ for his dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beloved, Prayer as his duty and work,
before all the World, though he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached,
scorned and maligned for it; but
because he would avoid the suspicion of a
<hi>Pharisaical</hi> vain glorious Spirit, and also that
he might get as far as ever he can, out of
the reach of Impediments and Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions:
He enters into his Chamber, and
there shuts his Door upon him, that so he
might shut out all that would interrupt and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42459:18"/>
disturb that fellowship with his God which
he hath so often found an incomparable
sweetness in, as that he counts it his Heaven
upon Earth. At other times he will make
one of the great Congregation, <hi>and go to
the House of God with the voice of joy and praise,
with a multitude that keep holy-day,</hi> Psal. 42.
4. he loves the Gates of <hi>Sion, and to behold
the beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his
Temple,</hi> Psal. 27. 4 and also he knows how
to go out, as <hi>Isaac</hi> did, into the Fields to
meditate; and in the night season to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and consider, with <hi>David,</hi> the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
which are the works of God's hand,
the Moon and the Stars which he hath crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and so take some turns in an holy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship;
and, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, <hi>walk with God,</hi>
before he be removed from hence, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
up to the habitation of his Holiness and
Glory, the Chamber of his presence; and
in these Walks he finds his heart warmed,
and an holy fire kindled, and then returns
with that burning within him; then he
speaks with his Tongue, and sends up a
pure flame of earnest supplications.</p>
            <p>Confident I am, The excellency of this
course will not be in the least question'd by
any who believe there is a God, and own
that absolute and necessary dependence,
which both as Creatures and Christians we
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:42459:18"/>
have upon him, and who have any sense of
Religion upon their Souls: yea, I believe it will
be acknowledged a duty by many, very many
of those who yet do not themselves live in
the performance of it: there hath such a
clear light broken in upon them, as hath
convinced their Judgments, though that
conviction hath not had power enough up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their wills, as to bring them to the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
of it. And for my own part, I do not
know so much as the shadow of a reason
why it should be question'd, and made a
point of controversie: This I do with a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of persuasion assert, That if there be
any such thing in the World as a duty
which we owe to God, secret Prayer is so.
And I do add this, wishing those (into
whose hands this little Piece shall come)
seriously to think of it; those persons that
do not make conscience hereof, let them
make never so great a noise, do indeed
make conscience of nothing. He is not a
true Christian that is not a through Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian;
nor he a real Disciple that hath not a
cordial respect to all that Christ commands
him; and I shall not at all wonder to see
or hear that man is remiss and careless and
negligent in other things, for which at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
he pretends a zeal, and at the long run
to throw up all. Yea, and I will venture
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42459:19"/>
to add this one thing further; He that
doth not seek God when he is alone,
hath no reason to promise himself God's
gracious meeting with him when he is in
Company; but if you will exclude, and
shut God out of your Chamber and Closets,
you will not to your comfort, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
you may to your terrour, find him in
the Congregation. The only thing which I
shall do more in the doctrinal part, will be
to prove the Point; and in order thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
I shall endeavour with all convenient bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>y
to shew, That secret Prayer is,
<list>
                  <item>I. A Duty.</item>
                  <item>II. An Advantage.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the former of these. Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
or secret Prayer is a great duty, which
all that call themselves Christians, ought to
be much in the performance of. For the
evidencing of this to you, I shall lay down
these four things.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> Secret Prayer was the practice of
our blessed Lord Jesus; as he came into the
World to redeem us, so to direct us: as
his Death was an expiatory Sacrifice, so his
Life was a leading Example. He is that
excellent Copy without blot, after which
we are to write; and that most exact and
perfect Pattern, without blemish or defect
the imitation whereof we are obliged to stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42459:19"/>
and endeavour, and that to our utmost;
we must lead his Life as near as ever we can,
and tread in his steps, for that is to foot it
right; and we must shew forth his virtues;
there must be an impress of them upon our
dispositions and conversations. <hi>The same
mind ought to be in us that was in him, Phil.</hi> 2.
5. Then is a Christian in his beauty and
glory, when he is cloathed with Christ, and
shines with the beams of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now Christ was very much in the work
of secret Prayer, and exceedingly frequent
at it. How did his perfectly pure and
precious soul delight to be on the wing,
and mounting up to his and our Father in
his recesses? He did not only teach his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
to pray, giving them in this Chapter
a most excellent pattern for them to draw
theirs by; nor did he only pray with them,
as Master of the Family; but he likewise did
many and many a time pray by himself alone,
a great deal oftner than we do, or any in
the world ever did know of; but some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to this purpose, hath been by the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Spirit (who guided the Holy Penmen)
put upon Record in the Sacred Scripture,
Thus in <hi>Matt.</hi> 14. 23. after he had wrought
that great and amazing Miracle of feeding
five thousand Men, beside Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when he had no more provision than
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42459:20"/>
five Loaves, and two Fishes: He sent the
Multitude away; and not being satisfied
with <hi>their absence alone,</hi> he would have <hi>his
very Disciples</hi> go by Ship to the other side:
it is said, <hi>he constrained them to go:</hi> poor
hearts! they loved him dearly, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
enjoyed themselves so well as they
did when they were in his company, and
therefore they were loath to leave him; but
he would have it so, he order'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
them to be gone; but what was
the matter? what did our Lord do when
they were all gone? That Text tells you,
<hi>He went up into a mountain a-part to pray, and
when the evening was come, he was there alone.</hi>
He had his Father with him, and doubtless
a multitude of the heavenly Hoast, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Angels attending and waiting, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
else: none of the multitude, not so
much as one single Disciple. Now let me
desire you to think seriously of this; that
it was far otherwise with Christ, than it
is with the best of us. He had another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of command over his mind and heart,
his thoughts and Affections, than the most
gracious Man or Woman upon Earth hath.
He could with the greatest ease imaginable
keep his Soul close to, and intent upon the
business which was before him, without the
smallest diversion and extravagancy; and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42459:20"/>
yet he chose to be a-part from all, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
by himself when he prayed unto his
Father: and shall not we go and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise?
Sure that which Christ did, was very
well done<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> You have another Scripture
which holds out the same, and refers to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
time, when he had healed <hi>Simon</hi>'s
Wife's Mother, who lay sick of a Fever,
and many others that were diseased, and had
cast out many Devils. <hi>Mark 1. 35. In the
morning, rising up a great while before day, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e
went out, and departed into a solitary place, and
there prayed.</hi> Hypocrites, as you have heard,
chuse the corners of the Streets, places of
concourse; go into the Abbeys and Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drals,
and there you will see them by a Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
at their devotion; but Christ chose soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tariness,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, a desert, lonely place,
where there was no body, there he loved
to meet his Father. Take but one Text
more, which you have in <hi>Luke</hi> 22. 39, 40.
<hi>He came out, and went, as he was wont, to the
Mount of Olives, and his Disciples followed him;
and when he was come to the place, he said unto
them, Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</hi>
First, he set them to their work: he knew
that the Devil would quickly be at his
work, and Christ would have his Disciples
be at their work first. We are then least in
danger, when a danger comes and finds us
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42459:21"/>
at our work. Christ knew that an hour of
temptation was coming, and he would have
them lay up-Prayer against that hour. Will
Satan tempt? then do you pray; thus he
setteth them at work: if you ask what
Christ did then do himself? I answer, You
may be sure he was not idle; what he bid
them do, he did; but he did it alone; <hi>He
was withdrawn from them about a stones cast, and
kneeled down and prayed.</hi> This was Christ's
wont, as to go to the Mount of Olives, so
to get alone and pray, not having so much as
any of his Disciples with him. Now is not
this a plain evidence of the thing? and shall
not this be a prevailing motive with you?
In my mind, the practice of Christ should be
a powerful and cogent Argument with all
those that call themselves his people.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The people of God in their
several Ages and Generations have taken
the same course, and walked in the same
way; I mean, all those whose hearts have
been upright with God; and the desires of
their Souls have been to his name, and the
remembrance of him, and communion with
him. <hi>Iasob</hi> was a plain man, but a great
wrestler, and very famous for his skill
in that holy and excellent Art, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
he was with admirable success. He <hi>wrestled</hi>
with God, and <hi>prevail'd</hi> like a Prince; tho
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42459:21"/>
he got a <hi>lameness,</hi> which he carried with
him to his Grave, yet he got a <hi>blessing</hi>
which kept him company into the other
World, and he was alone at the work,
<hi>Gen. 32. 22, &amp;c. He took his two Wives, and
his two Women-servants, and his eleven Sons,
and sent them over the Brook; and being left
alone, he wrestled with the Angel till the break
of day:</hi> it is, by the way, said, there was
a man wrestled with him, who was no other
than the Lord Christ, who, saith Dr. <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot,</hi>
sought to kill him for his diffidence, and
for his sending a Present to his Brother <hi>Esau,</hi>
before he had, according to his Vow, paid
the Tythe to God: But be that how it will,
this is plain, He prayed when he was alone;
then he wept, and made supplication.
When that <hi>Rebeccah</hi> had conceived, and there
were Twins in her Womb, which fell to
struggling, God thereby shewing that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
which would afterward be between
them: and it is said, <hi>Gen. 25. 22. She went
thereupon to enquire of the Lord:</hi> which indeed,
according to the Opinion of some Learned
Men, was by consulting of some Prophet;
but I rather think, according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of others, she did apply her self to
God immediately, and consulted, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of him in a way of Secret Prayer:
And that it was so, seems to be evident
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42459:22"/>
from the 25th verse, which tells us, she
had her answer from God himself; <hi>The
Lord said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb;</hi>
i. e. two Heads of Nations: <hi>and two manner
of people shall be separated from thy bowels;</hi> so
that the good Woman got alone to pray and
seek the Lord. We do also read in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25.
22. That <hi>Abraham planted a Grove in</hi> Beer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba,
<hi>and there he called on the Name of the
Lord, the Everlasting God.</hi> He singly, and
by himself. <hi>Ionathan</hi> saith, that Grove was
an Orchard full of Fruit-trees, which did
afford both what was pleasant and grateful
to the taste, and a comfortable refreshing
shade in that hot Countrey; but that is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a <hi>Iewish</hi> Tradition: This we learn
form the Text, That thither he was wont to
retire himself for prayer; that was his Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ory
when he had a mind to be alone.
When <hi>Elijah</hi> was by <hi>Iezabel</hi> threatned with
death, he came to <hi>Beersheba,</hi> and left his
Servant there; but 1 <hi>Kings 19. 4. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
went into the Wilderness a days journey, and
sate under a Iuniper-tree, and be requested for
himself that he might die, and said, It is enough
now, O Lord, that I die, for I am not better
than my Fathers.</hi> He would have no body
with him, not so much as a Friend, no not
his Servant. Once more, in <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 9. it
is said, <hi>Peter went up upon the house-top to pray,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42459:22"/>
about the sixth hour:</hi> not then with the Family
in which he was, nor with any of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren;
but by himself, at the top of the House,
upon the Leads, in the open air, from whence
he might look toward the Temple at <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
and be remote from all Company and
Spectators; so that you see what hath been
the practice of these gracious persons, whose
Names stand upon Scripture-record; and I
dare say, all the Saints who have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with God, have been familiarly
acquainted with this work too; and now I
say, Do you go and do the same; and in
this be ye, as well as in other things, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of them, considering the most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
end of their holy conversation.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is an express and special
command that binds this upon you as your
duty. Our dear and precious <hi>Iesus,</hi> who
hath bought us, and so is our Lord and
Master, hath directed us to this practice,
and in plain terms required it at our hands:
for the proof of this, we will go no further,
for we need no more than the Text before
us. <hi>Thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,
and when thou hast shut thy door,</hi> make all
as close and private as thou canst, when
thou art so alone, as that no body can come
at thee, then <hi>pray to thy Father.</hi> I told you
before, and think it worth my while, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42459:23"/>
it may be profitable for you, to repeat
it, and tell you again, That our Lord Jesus
doth suppose thee to be one that feareth
God, and that makest Prayer thy business;
He takes it here for granted, that the new
Nature thou hast received, will act like it
self: and therefore though the doth in other
places command you to do it, yet He doth
not do so here, but supposeth it: and sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
every man that is himself, doth pray. He
that is a man of sense and wisdom, will be a
man of prayer. He that doth not pray, is
a Mad-man. He hath not the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a man; he doth not act according to
the dictate of his own reason, which, if
consulted, would certainly put him upon it,
as a thing highly due to God, and every
way advantageous to man. Christ there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
doth here suppose you do pray: and
therefore doth only direct you as to the
manner, and that in this one particular.</p>
            <p>And I do likewise desire you to observe,
That our Lord Jesus doth here speak in the
Second Person, Singular, <hi>Thou,</hi> in the same
language, with the same particular applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and awful Majesty, as the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments
were given forth: thus you
know they run; Thou <hi>shalt have no other Gods
before me;</hi> Thou <hi>shalt make to thy self no gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Image;</hi> Thou <hi>shalt not take the name of the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42459:23"/>
Lord thy God in vain; Remember that</hi> thou <hi>keep
holy the Sabbath-day.</hi> So here, Thou, <hi>when</hi>
thou <hi>prayest.</hi> Christ would have every one
that nameth his Name, that takes upon him
the Profession of being one of his People,
to make a particular application of this to
himself, and to look upon this counsel as
given, and this charge as laid upon him.
Thou, <hi>Thomas,</hi> when thou prayest, do this;
and thou <hi>Iohn,</hi> when thou prayest, do
this; and so, thou <hi>Matthew,</hi> and thou <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew;</hi>
and so every one that was then alive,
or that shall live in any Age or place of the
World. It is spoken to you, and to me,
and to all: do <hi>thou</hi> enter into thy Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<hi>thou</hi> alone, and shut the door upon
thee, not upon others with thee, but upon
thee, and <hi>so</hi> pray unto thy Father; get <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi>
saith Christ, and pray <hi>alone:</hi> do it when
there is no body by, none to see thee, none
to overhear thee. God and an holy Soul
are very good company, when it goes out
with tears, and he meets it with smiles:
when it draws up its Confessions, and he
seals its Pardons: it breathes out holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
and longings, and he affords it graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
answers, and in them satisfactions: it
states its case, tells its Diseases, open its
Sores, and he applies easing and healing
remedies. In a word, When the Soul fires
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42459:24"/>
its Sacrifice, and then in the holy flame
thereof the blessed Angel of the Covenant
doth wonderfully. It is oftentimes good
for the Saints to go one with another into
the presence of their Father; they have
been called upon to strive together in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and that in Family duties, or in publick
Ordinances, or in cases of common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment;
but there is no Christian, who
hath not his own wants, and his own pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and his own bitternesses, and upon
these accounts it is best for him to go alone:
and thou canst not tell, O holy Soul, what spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
favour God may shew thee, what token
of love he may put into thy hand, when
there is no body by. When disconsolate
<hi>Hannah</hi> had been watering her plants, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
greatly alone, pouring out her Soul in
tears and prayers before the Lord, she had
such an impress upon her Spirit, such a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
of peace whisper'd to her, as made her
glad at heart, and on a sudden dried up all
her tears, so that <hi>her countenance was no more
sad.</hi> Thou, if thou engagest in this work
in thine uprightness, mayst believingly and
comfortably expect the same in God's time.
However, set this down with thy self, and
act accordingly, That Secret Prayer is thy
unquestionable duty by virtue of a Divine
Command.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:42459:24"/>4. <hi>Lastly,</hi> There is a very gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made to Secret Prayer: and here I shall
lay down this Assertion as worthy your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
notice of; That the great God doth
not make promises to any thing, which he
doth not require, and which is not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and pleasing to him, and which accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
is not duty in man: Promises do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Precepts, and are designed for the,
strengthening of our hearts and hands, the
encouraging us to Acts of Obedience, and
the sweetning those Obediential Acts to us.
He is angry at those, who offer to do those
things in matters of his Worship, for which
they have not his Warrant. Hence such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry
as this; <hi>Isa. 1. 12. Who hath required this
at your hands? viz.</hi> to come in such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
And hence also that Complaint and
Charge; <hi>That they burn their Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
in the fire,</hi> made a Sacrifice of them,
which as he saith, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 31. He <hi>commanded
them not, neither entred it into his heart. Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
Design was good, and it pleased God
that he had an heart so set for his honour,
yet it was a rebuke and check to him that
God sent him this message by <hi>Nathan,</hi>
2 Sam. 7. 7. <hi>In all the places, wherein I have
walked with the Children of</hi> Israel, <hi>spake I a
word with any of the Tribes of</hi> Israel, <hi>whom I
commanded to feed my poople</hi> Israel, <hi>saying, Why
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:42459:25"/>
build ye not me an house of Cedar?</hi> From
whence, saith <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> we learn, that
<hi>David</hi> failed in attempting such a thing,
when he had not a word for it from God,
from whom he ought to have expected and
waited for a peculiar command, as to the
thing, and time, and place. Those that
run on such Errands as God never sent them
on, and presume to do such works as God
never set them about, or will venture to
do his work in a way of their own, cannot
with any shadow of reason expect a reward
from his hand, let them get one where they
can: Why should God pay them for doing
that which is none of his work, or for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it after their own fashion? <hi>Nadab</hi> and
<hi>Abihu</hi> did the work of God in offering In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
but they did it after their own fashion,
in making use of strange fire, and it cost them
their lives; they found God not a bountiful
Rewarder, but a dreadful Revenger. When
Promises are made by God to any thing, they
do plainly speak that thing, to which those
Promises are made, a duty. Now we find
here in the Text a great and gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made by our <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> to secret
Prayer: <hi>Do this, saith he, when thou prayest,
enter into thy chamber, and shut thy door about
thee;</hi> study all possible privacy and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
let no body know of that which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42459:25"/>
thou goest about, if thou canst help it: do
it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
               </gap>, in secret; there is <hi>Christ</hi>'s Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,
and it must needs be good, because gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by him, in whom are all the treasures
of wisdom and knowledge, and whose
name is <hi>Wonderful, Counsellour:</hi> now take
with you the Promise annexed to this
Counsel. <hi>Thy Father, which seeth in secret,
shall reward thee openly.</hi> God will not send
one single Petitioner empty from his Throne
of Grace: though thou goest begging, yet
thou shalt return rejoycing. <hi>Abraham,</hi> the
Father of the Faithful, had bowels of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
yearning over his wicked Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
he prayed in secret for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ilthy <hi>Sodom.</hi>
There was no body to back him in that
Suit, nor to plead together with him:
that City was indeed so bad, that he was
both ashamed and afraid to appear as an
Advocate for them, and therefore he did
more than once deprecate the Divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure;
<hi>Oh let not the Lord be angry:</hi> yet
observe how mighty he was with God.
He lifted up prayer after prayer, and God
condescended to him again and again. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and solitary <hi>Abraham</hi> had such a great
interest and success, that the glorious and
provoked God did not give over granting,
until <hi>Abraham</hi> had given over praying</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:42459:26"/>By what hath been said, I hope the first
thing promised is performed, namely, it
is made plain and evident, That Secret-prayer
is the Christian's duty. We now
proceed to the Second, which is to prove,
That if it be rightly managed, it will be his
advantage; and to that end, I shall only
shew, that it will afford him these two
things:
<list>
                  <item>1. Safety.</item>
                  <item>2. Comfort.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>First,</hi> Secret Prayer is a choice and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
means of <hi>Security;</hi> would a Man be
safe when he is alone, then let him pray
when he is alone? On this side of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
there is not any one place to be sound,
in which a person may rationally look upon
himself as quite out of the reach of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.
I heard one once wittily say, He <hi>did
not upon the Road fear Highway-men, so long as
be was alone.</hi> But there are other enemies
from whom we may apprehend mischief
when we are most alone. The subtil Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
wrigled himself into Paradise it self;
and there he did mortally sting our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and undid them and all their posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in them. Holy <hi>Paul</hi> was perfectly safe
while he continued in the third Heaven,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42459:26"/>
the malicious Tempter could not come at
him there; since he was cast down from
that blessed place, He never yet could, and
for the future he never shall make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entry;
nor is his Arm strong enough to
shoot an Arrow, or throw a fiery Dart so
high: But no sooner was that eminent
Apostle come down again, but he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperately
set upon, worse than the <hi>Philistins</hi>
were upon him; there was a Thorn stuck
in his flesh, which could not but put him to
pain; and a <hi>Messenger of Satan</hi> was sent to
buffet him, who without peradventure gave
him no small blows.</p>
            <p>One would conclude a person safe
enough when no-body is with him;
as there is none to <hi>help,</hi> so there is none to
<hi>hurt;</hi> yet even then he may be in danger;
for though there be no Man with him, yet
there is a Devil with him; yea, more than
one, possibly more than a Legion. It might
have been rationally concluded, That <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
walking upon the top of his House, did
not stand in need of his Life-guard about
him; Who was that should or could do the
King a mischief there? Yet even there a
Naked Woman conquered that Man of War,
and a malicious Devil let fly one of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venom'd
Arrows, and wounded him to the
very heart by the eye. It had been well
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:42459:27"/>
for that good Man, if, instead of gazing
about, and viewing every object that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented,
he had been looking up to his God,
and praying in secret.</p>
            <p>Know and consider, O thou poor Soul,
the Devil hath a mind to thee, not out of
any Love he bears thee, for there is no
such thing in Devils; they must cease to be
Devils before they can have any kindness
for Men: But he hath a mind to you, as a
roaring Lion hath to his prey; and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suance
of his bloody design, he is restless;
though he can do himself no good, he rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kons
it worth his while to do thee a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief;
and therefore he doth not only walk
with thee up and down in the Street, and
from this private or publick House to that;
nor only follow thee to the publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,
there to divert thy thoughts, or
deaden thy affections, or direct thine eye to
some vain and wanton object, or pick up
the seed which is sown, that though it be
cast in at the ear, yet it may never reach so
far as the heart to root there, and bring
forth precious fruit in the Life and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;
but he will also dog you into your
Chambers, and intrude into your Closets;
when the Door is shut, he will get in; you
cannot, while here, get clear of the <hi>old Man,</hi>
and the <hi>old Serpent;</hi> and where-ever he is,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:42459:27"/>
you may be sure, He comes for no good.
He is wholly set upon mischief; that is his
constant imploy, his beloved work, his
heart is set upon it, he follows it close, and
with all his might.</p>
            <p>Therefore my advice is, That thou wouldest
make Prayer thy Closet-business; that when
this implacable Enemy of thine finds thee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
he may not have an advantage against
thee. When in <hi>Ephes.</hi> 6. the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
had told you of the Enemies you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
with, that they are not only <hi>flesh and
blood,</hi> but also <hi>principalities and powers, and
spiritual wickednesses in high places;</hi> he advised
you to put on <hi>the whole Armour of God,</hi> and
over and above he directed you to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and necessary work <hi>of Prayer,</hi> as
knowing that both your security and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
depend as much upon that, as any thing:
Your <hi>Armour</hi> will not do without your <hi>God;</hi>
and him you cannot expect without <hi>Prayer.</hi>
If then you would not fall both <hi>into</hi> tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and <hi>by it,</hi> your care and work must
be to watch and pray; and I do not in the
least doubt but Prayer hath laid many a
<hi>restraint</hi> upon the Devil, and kept him off
from medling with a Child of God when
his fingers have itch'd at him, and <hi>blunted</hi>
his tools often and often, so that he could
not do the work he intended with them;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:42459:28"/>
and <hi>broken</hi> the neck of many a cursed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
which he was most industriously carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Secret Prayer is a special way
for the making of your retirement <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and pleasant to you.</hi> Solitariness is look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as having Melancholly for its usual.
Companion; and a Life of loneliness and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement
is reckon'd a very disconsolate Life.
The Prophet made this a part of his bitter
complaint, <hi>Psal. 102. 7. That he was as a sparrow
alone upon the house top.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> saith,
Eccles. 4. 10. <hi>Wo be to him that is alone.</hi>
Hence one said, <hi>He that loves to be alone, is
either a Beast, or a God.</hi> But Secret-Prayer
is an excellent way to sweeten solitariness,
and take off the uncomfortableness of it.
If thou dost but in thine uprightness apply
thy self heartily to this work, when thou
art without any Company, thou shalt not
be without matter of rejoycing; but with
<hi>Hagar</hi> in the Wilderness, find a <hi>Spring open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to thee.</hi> That was a great saying of one,
<hi>Nunquam minus solus quam cum maxime solus:</hi>
I am never less alone, than when I am most
alone. He did never find less want of
Company, than when he had none; then a
Man enjoys his God and himself; and he
that hath indeed that enjoyment, needs no
body. <hi>Iohn</hi> 16. 32. Our Saviour spake thus
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:42459:28"/>
to his Disciples, <hi>The hour cometh, yea, is now
come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his
own, and shall leave me alone, and yet I am
not alone, because the father is with me.</hi> Not
alone when alone. I shall be altogether
without you, but not without my Father,
who doth more, infinitely more than fill up
those vacancies; as at noon-day we do not
want the Stars, though they be all obscur'd
and disappear, because we have the glorious
Light and Beams of the Sun, who doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
supply their absence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> tells us in <hi>Psalm</hi> 145. 18. which is
a <hi>Psalm</hi> of Praise, That <hi>the Lord is nigh unto
all them that call upon him, to all that call upon
him in truth.</hi> Sincere Prayer will fetch God
down from Heaven, to stand at thy right
hand. Our Heavenly Father is more ready
than the most affectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>ate tender-hearted
Mother upon Earth, to arise and come in
at the cry of the Child. In <hi>Psalm</hi> 18. we
find that good Man in his distress, <hi>called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Lord, and cried unto his God,</hi> and God
heard him: Divine Love is quick of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>He heard my voice out of his holy temple,
and my cry came before him, even into his ears.</hi>
And now observe what haste God made to
his Servant; <hi>Vers. 9, 10. He bowed the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and came dewn: He rode upon a Cherub
and did fly; yea, he did fly upon the wings of
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:42459:29"/>
the wind.</hi> When Holy <hi>David</hi> wanted his
God, <hi>God</hi> would be with him presently.</p>
            <p>I dare assure thee, O Saint, if thou wilt
but get thy Soul upon the Wing, and by
the hand of servent believing Prayer knock
at Heavens door, thou shalt to thy comfort
find, that thy beloved will not be long from
thee; no, no, he will be sure graciously to
return thy Visit, he will come and drop
some sweet smelling Myrrh upon the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
of thy lock; Secret Prayer is the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and readiest way to secret and intimate
Communion with God; as it is an opening
of the heart to God, so it makes way for
God's opening of his heart to the Saint;
and when that is opened, what blessed dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
are made, what treasures appear,
and riches of Grace, what counsels of
Wisdom, and thoughts of good and great
designs, the very sight of which is ravish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and may well put the Soul into a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport!
When guilty, but convinced, <hi>Ephraim</hi>
got alone, and made his reflections, and
thereupon bemoan'd himself for his former
folly, stubbornness and obstinacy, and
begged hard for converting, turning Grace,
<hi>God</hi> presently turned toward him, and with
yearning Bowels spake his love; this resolution
was immediately taken up, <hi>I will surely have
mercy upon him.</hi> In a word, God doth
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:42459:29"/>
sometimes in displeasure withdraw from
his sinning Children, but it is with a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
to be found of them when they seek
him; and to return to them when he is
sent for. <hi>Hos. 5. 15. I will go and return to
my place, till they acknowledg their offence, and
seek my face.</hi> I will stay away, I will not
come near them, I will have nothing to do
with them <hi>till</hi> they do this; but let them
do it as soon as they will, and they shall
meet with acceptance; I will rise out of my
place, and visit them with Salvation. He
will be sure to come at Prayers call, if some
crying sin or other do not drown the voice
of it; and his Presence and Beams will
effectually scatter the thickest and blackest
Clouds; the light of his countenance,
when once lifted up, will make it a day of
gladness to the most benighted Soul: When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he comes, he will be sure to bring a
blessing along with him, and so appear
unto its joy. These particulars, to which
I have largely spoken, are, I hope, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to prove, that Secret Prayer is both
your Duty and your Interest; and so I have
done with the Doctrinal part, and shall
now proceed to the improvement of it by
Application, which will be twofold:
<list>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:42459:30"/>
                  <item>1. For Reprehension.</item>
                  <item>2. For Exhortation.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The use of Reprehension or Reproof,
shall be directed to three sorts of persons,
who do indeed deserve to fall <hi>under</hi> it; and
oh that it may come with such power as to
make them fall <hi>before</hi> it, and issue in their
amendment of those things, which by the
light of Truth breaking in upon them,
they shall see to be amiss.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> They are sharply to be reproved,
for they are deeply guilty before God, who
instead of making Conscience, and living
in the performance of <hi>Secret Prayer,</hi> are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
strangers to, and live in the total
neglect of all <hi>Prayer:</hi> They do not know
what it is to approach unto the Throne of
God, and to pour out their Souls before
him; they <hi>go to their Beds</hi> at night, like
Swine to their Sty, not begging Divine
protection; and <hi>rise out of them</hi> in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and go about their business without
paying any acknowledgments to their great
Benefactor, under the Wing of whose care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Providence they were secured; yea, sit
down to their Tables, without asking
God's Blessing, as if they had no depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
upon him; and when they have eaten
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42459:30"/>
and are full, rise up to work or play, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
giving God Thanks, as if they were not
at all beholden to him. And thus they live
Prayerless lives in the World: They have
passed <hi>many</hi> days, and escaped <hi>many</hi> dangers,
and received <hi>many</hi> mercies, and committed
<hi>many</hi> sins, but never set themselves, at least,
in good earnest, to put up <hi>one</hi> Prayer. Oh
how do they tumble out by wholesale an
innumerable company of execrable Oaths,
and tremendous Curses, which speaks their
Tongues the Devils Instruments, set on fire
with the fire of Hell; but no body ever
saw them upon their knees before God,
nor heard a word of Prayer drop from their
Lips. They have had many Dangers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented;
but never sought refuge, nor took
shelter in God. They have every day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
multitudes of Mercies; but did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
solemnly beg one. God did in the
time of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> order that the
Fire of the Altar should never go out, and
appointed the morning and evening sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;
but poor creatures, these have no fire,
their hearts are as cold as Ice, they know
not what true love to God means, and
having no fire in themselves, God shall
have no sacrifice from them, his Altars
shall be empty, they have nothing to lay
on from the beginning of the year to the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42459:31"/>
end of it. How many are there that never
made an attempt this way, never tried to
Pray, never went about the work? <hi>They
in the pride of their countenances will not seek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
God. He is not in all their thoughts,</hi> Ps. 10. 4.
In all of them! He is but in few of them; and
when he is in any, when he forcibly breaks
in upon them, and makes his own way,
(for they never invite him, nor study to
think of him) he is not welcome nor grateful
to them. I fear, if a man should come and ask
some of you such a question as this; Friend,
Neighbour, what intercourses are there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
God and you? what converse and
fellowship have you with God? do you
pray a-days? do you pray by your selves in
your Chambers, or with your Families?
are you some of that blessed wrestling Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
who seek the face of the <hi>God of</hi> Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob?
if you would speak the truth, and
not cover your sin and shame with a lie,
you must answer, No, not I: God knows,
I cannot pray, I do not know how to pray,
I never went about it, I see no need of it, I
have no heart to it: may we not say of
these, what <hi>Agur</hi> said of himself, <hi>Prov. 30. 2.
Surely they are more bruitish than any man, they
have not the understanding of a man, they have
not learned wisdom, nor have they any knowledg
of the Holy.</hi> Let them be reckoned for
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:42459:31"/>
Beasts in human shape. Some have written
as if they did not look upon Reason but
Religion, as the thing which makes the
specifical difference between a Man and a
Brute; because there is something in Brutes
which, say they, may pass for Reason, to
be sure it looks very like it, but there is
nothing like Religion in them; and I
would fain know, what there is, or at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
can be of Religion in that Man or Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who lives without Prayer; and how
unworthy is such an one of the name, <hi>Man?</hi>
The late Learned <hi>Bishop Wilkins,</hi> in his treatise
concerning the Principles and Duties of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion, hath these passages: <q>In the
Actions of many brute creatures, there are
discernable some footsteps, some imperfect
strictures and degrees of Ratiocination, such
a natural sagacity as at least bears a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
to Reason. From whence it
may follow, that it is not Reason in the
general, which is the form of humane
nature; but Reason as it is determined to
actions of Religion, of which we do not
find the least signs or degrees in Brutes.
Man being the only creature in this visible
World, that is formed with a capacity of
worshipping and enjoying his Maker. And
he adds, This is not any new Opinion, but
what several of the Ancient Writers,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:42459:32"/>
Philosophers, Orators, and Poets have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
to, who make the notion of a Deity,
and Adoration of him, to be the true
difference betwixt <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Beast.</hi>
               </q> Thou
then who hast hitherto lived without God
and Prayer in the World, own thy dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy,
take unto thy self both the name
and shame of a Brute, and now begin to
act the part of a Man, in falling <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>pon thy
knees before God, and with an humble
blush, crying out as good <hi>Asaph</hi> did, when
once got from under the power and fury of
an hideous temptation, <hi>Psalm 73. 22. So
foolish was I, and ignorant, I was as a beast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Besides this, I would have you to
consider the disingenuity you discover in
living at such a rate, and in such a neglect
and contempt of God as this; what<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> will
you not so much as thank God for all that
good he doth you? will you own him
in none of the footsteps of his Providence,
and evidences of his care? doth he step in
between you and your dangers, hold your
Souls in life, lade you with benefits, direct
your affairs, assist you it business, succeed
your endeavours? doth He day unto day shew
his bounty, and night unto night his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and is it not worth the owning? Wilt
thou not make any thankful acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:42459:32"/>
nor pay him any tribute of praise:
wouldst thou carry thus to thy Fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
or wouldst thou thy self bear it from
another?</p>
            <p>Think again how unnatural you are to
your own Souls: if a poor Creature wants
bread, how will he go out into the Fields
and Streets, and ask of every one he thinks
able to give, and continue upon his knees
hours together? dost thou not see them?
While thou dost, thou hast reason to reflect
upon thy self with indignation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency:
will he beg for a penny? and wilt
not thou pray for a Kingdom and a Crown
of Glory far better than those of Gold?
When a Criminal hath a Sentence of death
past upon him, he will plead hard for his
life, and leave no stone unturn'd. <hi>Benhadad,</hi>
though a great King, when in danger, sent
his Servants in a most submissive manner,
with Ropes about their Necks, to beg for
his life: Thou art a Criminal, the Sentence
is past upon thee, and none can tell how
soon execution may be done; thou canst
not promise thy self an hours respite: how
unnatural then art thou, how hard is thy
heart, and how cruel to thy self, who goest
day after day, and year after year, without
sending up a Petition for the life of thy Soul,
though thou hast often heard that the King
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:42459:33"/>
of Heaven is a merciful King, and that
there are forgivenesses with him?</p>
            <p>What shall I say? if you are resolved to
go on at this rate, and persevere in this inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
neglect, thou mayst e'ven as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
thy Allegiance to God, disown thy
being any of his Creatures, deny any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
which thou hast upon him. Call
not thy self from henceforth a Man, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
indued with reason, or acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the principles and dictates thereof,
but acknowledge thy being sunk down and
degenerated into a Beast; and truly thou
deservest to be sent with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to
graze among them, till thou art made better
to understand both God and thy self. What,
O Man, O Woman, what dost thou mean?
live, and not pray? live merely upon God's
mercy and patience, and not pray? live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his goodness, and his cost, and not pray?
must thou one day dye and go into the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
World, and not send any prayers thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
before thee? Must thou go to God, in
order to thy being judged by him, and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
as to thy everlasting state, and yet
not pray? Surely thou hast lost thy reason,
and art chargeable with egregious folly and
madness. Oh that I could do something in
order to thy cure, and bringing thee to thy
self, and upon thy knees, and that God
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:42459:33"/>
would by his Spirit and Power accompany
what I shall to that purpose offer to thy
most serious and repeated consideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That man who spends his days al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
without Prayer, is dead while he
lives: though he hath a natural life, yet he
hath nothing of the life of Grace, nothing
of that divine life of which the Lord Jesus
was the Purchaser, and is the Principle,
but is to this very day alienated from the
life of God thorough the ignorance and
perverseness which is in him, and dead in
trespasses and sins. New-born Children
cry: What! can a person be born spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
born of God, and brought forth unto
God, and yet not cry, not pray! It is a
thing impossible, it cannot be. The work
of Prayer, indeed, may be for a while in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted,
sometimes through inward weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and oppression, as that holy man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
in <hi>Psalm 77. 4. I am so troubled, that
I cannot speak:</hi> sometimes through violence
offer'd him by temptation; the Enemy of
God and Man comes and stops his mouth:
otherwise the very nature which a Saint
hath been made a partaker of, doth carry
him out hereunto: and that holy fire which
is kindled in his Soul, will be ascending up
in such a flame; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 13. It is written,
<hi>I believed, therefore have I spoken: we also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:42459:34"/>
and therefore speak:</hi> that is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of speaking in a way of <hi>confession;</hi> but
it is true also, speaking in a way of <hi>supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
In <hi>Acts 9. 11. The Lord said unto</hi> Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,
<hi>Arise, go into the street, which is called</hi>
Straight, <hi>and enquire in the House of</hi> Judas <hi>for
one</hi> Saul <hi>of</hi> Tarsus, <hi>for behold, he prayeth.</hi>
Poor <hi>Ananias</hi> was startled at the Order, and
not very willing to be sent upon such an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,
and began to object; Lord, this man
hath got a very bad name, I have heard of
him by many. He is the talk both of Town
and Countrey, as having been a mischievous
Instrument; he hath done much evil to thy
Saints at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and now he comes arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with Authority from the Chief Priests to
bind all that call on thy Name. Well, <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi>
do what thou art bidden; for though
it is true, that he hath been a vile Wretch,
a cruel and malicious Enemy, fear him not,
the Wolf is turned into a Lamb; It is no
matter what formerly he was, he is now
quite another thing, and is acted by a far
better Spirit. He is a new man, and thou
mayst take this for a certain and undoubted
evidence of it. He is a Praying-man. He
that before spake nothing but blasphemies
and outrages against Christ, and breathed
out threatnings and slaughter against the
Disciples of the Lord, did now that he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:42459:34"/>
was converted and sanctified, speak sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications.</p>
            <p>It is the fashion of a great many, when
the Lord's day comes, they will go out to
hear, and they are for variety, this man and
that, and twenty more, possibly three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
upon a day, peradventure four: and
I do not blame any for being swift to hear,
it is an excellent thing to see Christians
hungry, and of good appetites, so that they
do but allow themselves necessary time for
concoction, and be not wanting to personal
and Family duties; but Conscience, do thou
speak, and that loud enough to make guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Persons hear and feel too: be there not
some of these, who at home are never upon
their knees before God? If a man could
look into their Houses, and into their Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
he would find that Prayer is quite shut
out from thence. And for my part, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but tell you, That let these Persons hold
their heads never so high, and have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
never so great a name, I can look upon
them as being no better than a company of
walking Ghosts, such as do really want an
inward vital principle, and are carried up
and down from one Congregation to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by some external consideration. Prayer
is a breathing in Heaven's Air, it is the
breathing of the Soul in the bosome of God;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42459:35"/>
it draws in spirit and life from him, and
then again it pours out and empties it self
into him: and it is full out as possible for a
man to live a natural life without natural
breathing, as it is for him to live a spiritual
life without spiritual breathing, I mean,
without Prayer. You know when God
promiseth his Spirit, <hi>Zechar.</hi> 12. 10. he
doth it in these Expressions: <hi>I will pour out
upon the House of</hi> David, <hi>and the Inhabitants
of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>the Spirit of grace and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
Wheresoever the Spirit of God comes
and dwells in the Soul as a Spirit of Grace,
there he doth certainly act as a Spirit of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications:
and the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.
8. 15. That the Sons of God receive the Spirit of
Adoption, whereby they cry Abba, Father.</hi>
Which imports a filial boldness and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in dealing with him by fervent
Prayer.</p>
            <p>I remember what you may meet in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi>
13. 1, &amp;c. <hi>Though I speak with the tongues of
men and Angels, though I have the gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
and understand all Mysteries, and all
knowledge: though I have all faith, so as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
mountains; though I bestow all my goods
on the poor, and give my body to be burned, yet
if I have not Charity, it profits me nothing; I
am nothing, but as a meer sounding brass and
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>inkling cymbal.</hi> What he there speaks of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:42459:35"/>
Charity, or Love, which doth indeed make
Actions lovely in the sight of God and men,
and puts a lustre and beauty upon them;
the very same may be affirmed concerning
Prayer. Let a man be never so well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
never so raised in his attainments,
never so fluent and warm in his discourses,
never so eminent for his profession, never
so frequent and attentive in his hearing, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so abundant in acts of Charity, yet
if he be a prayerless Person, he is nothing;
nothing in Religion, nothing to purpose;
all his parts and performances, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
and specious, will amount to nothing;
in Heaven's Arithmetick they will be of no
more significancy, than so many Cyphers
without a Figure, to put a value into
them.</p>
            <p>That which I have said, amounts to thus
much; To live without Prayer, is utterly
inconsistent with a gracious and holy frame;
and all that such an one doth, will never turn
him to a good account. You may as soon
live a spiritual life without Faith, as live by
Faith without Prayer: for, as was before
observed, they that believe, will speak.
When God hath kindled a spark of Grace
in the Soul, it will be working in a way of
Prayer; that spark will fly upward, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the Soul along with it. Thus we find it in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:42459:36"/>
               <hi>Psal. 39. 3. My heart was hot within me; while
I mused, the fire burned: then spake I with my
tongue.</hi> What did he speak? Prayers. <hi>Lord,
make me to know my end, and the measure of
my days.</hi> Therefore my advice is, that you
would either take up Prayer, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it as a principal part of a Christians
work, or else lay down your Profession;
boast not of a filial Relation to God, while
thou art not possessed with a filial spirit and
disposition. Never talk of your being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with God, and some of his Friends,
when in all your lives you never spake one
serious hearty word to him. If you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to live without Prayer, be so just and
reasonable as to put off the honourable name
<hi>Christian,</hi> which doth by no means belong
to you, and call your selves Heathens, Beasts,
nay, which is worse, though not too bad
for you, down-right practical Atheists.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your Condition at the present
is very miserable, though you know it not:
so long as you live without Prayer, you live
without a blessing: whatsoever may light
upon you, the blessing of God is the portion
of a praying People. If you will look into
the Book of God (which, I believe, you
seldom do; for those that will not beg his
mercy, will not labour to know his will)
you may see how much it cost <hi>Esau</hi> to get a
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:42459:36"/>
blessing from his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> he shed many
tears, and lifted up loud cries; <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.
33, 34. <hi>Isaac</hi> told him, that one had brought
him Venison, which he had eaten of, and
he blessed him, and he should be blessed.
It is said, <hi>When</hi> Esau <hi>heard the words of his
Father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter
cry, and said unto his Father, Bless me, even
me also, O my Father:</hi> and when <hi>Isaac</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
<hi>vers. 37. Behold, I have made him thy
Lord, and all his Brethren have I given to him
for Servants, and with corn and wine have I su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stained
him: and what shall I do now unto thee,
my Son!</hi> Vers. 38. Esau <hi>said unto his Father,
Hast thou but one blessing, my Father? Bless me,
even me also, O my Father; and</hi> Esau <hi>lifted up
his voice, and wept.</hi> What, art thou so poor,
O my Father, as that in giving one blessing,
thou hast given away all? Hast thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
one? And all this he was fain to do,
before he could obtain. Yea, and it was
not only thus with a profane <hi>Esau,</hi> who
might well be thought to have forfeited the
blessing by his selling his Birthright; but
even good <hi>Iacob</hi> himself, when he would
have a blessing from Heaven, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to wrestle with the Angel for it,
and to put forth all his strength in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict,
and to keep his hold, though the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>med willing to shake him off; yea,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:42459:37"/>
and to tell him at last, that he would not let
him go until he had got it. Thus it hath,
been formerly: Blessings come down from
Heaven upon the wings of Prayer.</p>
            <p>And what, O man, dost thou think, that
the Blessings of God are fallen so much in
their price, and grown so cheap at this day,
as that they go a begging? Or that men
may have them without asking for? God
hath been wont to stand more upon his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
than so: and therefore hath declared
his will, that Prayer shall come in between
the Promise and the Performance; he
would have his People sue out the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
before they shall have the good which
is contained in it; as is evident from
that well-known Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. we
find the heart of God greatly inlarged to
his People, and Promises flowed in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
from him, and He gives them the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of his fixed resolution in the thing.
<hi>I the Lord have spoken it, and I will do it.</hi> Do
not you doubt, call not my truth in question,
I will be as good as my word. Yet observe
what follows in the 37th <hi>verse; Thus saith
the Lord God, I will yet be enquired of by the
House of</hi> Israel <hi>to do it for them.</hi> All those
great and good things had been in the
heart and purpose of God from eternity,
and now he was graciously pleased for their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:42459:37"/>
comfort to put them into his Promise; but
if they had a desire to have them, they must
send Prayer to Heaven for them.</p>
            <p>Holy <hi>David</hi> tells us, <hi>Psal. 3. 8. God's
blessing is upon his People:</hi> and certainly every
one will grant that there is a great deal of
reason why it should be upon them <hi>exclusive</hi>
to all the World beside; upon them, and
upon none but upon them: they only have
been by the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> redeemed from the
curse of the Law, and therefore they only
can lay a rightful claim to the Blessings of
the Gospel. God may, yea, and he eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
day doth give bread to his Enemies; but
surely as long as they continue his Enemies,
he will not give them his blessing; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
why should they expect it? But now,
O prayerless Soul, how wilt thou prove thy
self one of his People? Thou hast upon thee
those Spots which are not the Spots of his
People, when at the same time thou dost
want those Marks which are the Marks of
his People: thou who spendest thy days
without prayer, dost pay no homage unto
God, thou ownest no dependence upon
him, thou givest him no reverence, thou
dost him no service, thou bringest him no
honour, and I pray, tell me, why should
his blessing be upon thee? God may deal
bountifully with thee; possibly he doth do
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:42459:38"/>
so already, and gives thee waters of a full
cup; it is his manner; many srcaps and good
bits fall under his Table; He lets them fall
on purpose for his Dogs to gather up: his
Sun shines, and his Rain falls upon bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Wildernesses and noysome Dunghills,
as well as upon fruitful Fields, and pleasant
Gardens; Outward mercies are therefore
called Common Mercies, because all have
their share in them, the just and the unjust
too, the evil as well as the good; so that the
Wise Man tells us, <hi>No man can know either
love or hatred by all that is before him.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let no man be proud of his temporal
Enjoyments, nor of an elated Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he is of a raised condition, and stands
upon the World's upper ground. If thou
hast no other arguments to use, but those
thou fetchest from the World's Topicks,
thou wilt never prove thy self Heaven-born,
nor make out thy Title to the happiness and
glory which is above. God indeed may fill
thy Pocket, and spread thy Table, furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it with variety of Dainties; He may
cram thy Bags, and make thy Cup run
over; He may throw into thy Possession
Houses and Lands, as he gave <hi>Quales</hi> to the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> in his wrath; and if thou wilt
take the pains to turn over all thou hast, and
make as diligent search as thou canst, thou
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:42459:38"/>
wilt not find one blessing in it; many a
Creature, and in every one a curse: thy
Cloaths have a plague in them, witness thy
Pride; thy Table is thy snare, witness thy
excess; and Riches are laid up by thee to
thy hurt, whilst thou makest them thy God,
which should be no more than thy Servants.
Thus it is with thee at present, and thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
condition is thy best condition: unless
thou growest better, that will not: all that
thou canst do, is to rejoyce in sense, thou
must leave it to others to rejoice in hope. But
however, if it will do thee any good, and
the Lord grant that it may, we will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
what is like to be hereafter. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> Let us look on to the consequence,
and consider what will follow this sinful
bruitish negect of your unquestionable duty.
You know, your own Consciences tell you, that
you do not pray; you are not convinced of
any need that you have of it: other things
there are which you think you cannot be
without, such are your Jovial Companions,
and your vain antick Dresses, but you can
be, and do very well without Prayer; you
taste no sweetness in it: ranting and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is
musick, Healths and Huzza's, Balls
and Masques, are ravishingly delicious; but
to you, Prayer is a very dull and insipid bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:42459:39"/>
But, I pray, what will be at the last?
I would stain have my best at last, and so
would you too, if you be wise: if you have
not your best at your latter end, you
will be found fools at your latter end. I
find an excellent wish concerning <hi>Israel</hi> of
old, whether it was God's wish<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> or <hi>Moses</hi>'s,
or both, I am sure it was very good, and
carried in it a great deal of love; <hi>Deut. 32.
24. O that they were wise, that they understood
this, that they would consider their latter end.</hi>
By latter end there, according to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Expolitors, we are not so much
to understand their death, as the end and
issue of that course which they were then
steering. O that they would seriously
think with themselves, and wisely fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see
whither that way would bring them,
in which they were then walking. It was
a very smooth and pleasant way, it was
paved with delights, but the great business
was, whither did it lead them? It is my
hearty wish for you, whoever you are,
that you would once in a day retire your
selves, and get alone, and seriously think
what your total neglect of Prayer will
produce, when you are on a Death-bed,
and after Death, in Eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:42459:39"/>
               <hi>First,</hi> What fruit you will have from
hence, when <hi>Sickness</hi> Arrests you, and you
find that the <hi>King of terrors</hi> is at your very
door; that will be a dismal time, and it
will cause many thoughts and tremblings of
heart; and then, if ever, you will stand
in need of <hi>Cordials,</hi> and happy the Man
that hath his comfortable Reflections and
Prospects to support his Spirits; who can
look <hi>back</hi> to his Life past with <hi>peace,</hi> and
look <hi>forward</hi> to Eternity with <hi>hope.</hi> When
a Child of God, that hath maintain'd a
close and intimate Communion with his
God, and given himself unto Prayer, comes
to lie upon his Death-bed, he is so roughly
handled by that last enemy, that he cannot
pray; his heart is so faint within him, and
his pains are so strong upon him, that he
hath not any leisure for that work in which
he hath found so much sweetness, and for
which he hath so dear a love: Alas then
his case! his weakness, his agonies, his
tumblings and tossings are such, that he
cannot pray as he was wont, only sigh and
groan, and lift up an eye, and give a look
toward God's Holy Temple, and dart up a
short ejaculation: Poor Soul! that is the
utmost length he can go, and it is no small
grief to him that he is so straitned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined.
Holy <hi>Asaph</hi> put this among the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:42459:40"/>
of his bitter complaints, <hi>Psal.</hi> 77. 4
That <hi>he was so troubled, that he could not speak.</hi>
But at that very time he can relieve and
comfort himself with his former praying,
and former walking and Communion with
God; his former seeking of God, and
conversing with him. When there was a
message of death, by the Prophet, brought
to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he could send this short Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
up again to Heaven, <hi>Isa. 38. 3. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,
now, O Lord, I beseech thee, how I
have walked before thee in truth, and with a
perfect heart, and have done that which is good
in thy sight.</hi> He could do but very little then,
his strength was gone, and his breath was
short; but he could with comfort remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
and desire God himself to remember
how he <hi>had</hi> walked, and what he had done
in his Halcion and healthful days. So when a
gracious person is disabled for his work, he
can think thus, There is a stock of Prayers
which I have laid up in Heaven, against
such a time of need as this is; and the
thought thereof will be a singular support
and comfort to him.</p>
            <p>But what do <hi>you think will become of you</hi> at
such a time, you that have been all your
days strangers to this work? When you
come to dye, you <hi>cannot</hi> pray, your distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and pains will not l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>t you, and you

do not know how to go about it, nor how
to do one stroke at it; and it will then be
a sting and horrour to you to think, that
when you were in health and strength, and
all things well with you, you <hi>would not</hi>
pray. You were called upon often, by
your godly Ministers, and by your gracious
Friends and Relations, but you would not.
At a dying hour you will have <hi>no fitness</hi>
for that work; and all the time that you lived
before, you had <hi>no heart</hi> to it. But possibly
you will comfort your selves with this, that
when you are sick, and full of fears and
inward disquiets, and you are not in a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of praying for your selves, then you,
or some of your Friends for you, will send
for some godly Minister or other, and desire
him to pray for you. Well, suppose that
is done, and the Minister sent for, comes,
if he knows what a wretch thou hast been,
and how much thou hast neglected God
and thy Duty all thy days, What straitnings
of Soul must he of necessity be under as to
thee? With what holy confidence and hope
may we go to God in Prayer on the behalf
of a godly person when sick, if we can say
to God as they did to Christ on the behalf
of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11. 3. <hi>Lord, he whom thou
lovest, is sick?</hi> But what a damp must it needs
be to us, when we think we are going to
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:42459:41"/>
God for a sick and dying Man, but such an
one as neglected God, and hated him, and
lived without him, and in open rebellion
against him? I fear, I fear, there are too
many among us that befool and deceive
themselves with this, That if they can get
a Minister to Pray by them (especially if it
be such an one as will give them the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
too) oh, then all is well, and their Souls
go immediately to Heaven without any stop
by the way, and the Gate of Glory is open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to them, and entrance granted; but it
is probable that will not do, and that these
Men build their high hopes upon a Sandy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundation
that will fail them: And I
would fain know what great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or what sufficient ground we have to
believe, that we shall carry them in the Arms
of our Prayers safe to Heaven, who would
not themselves take one right step in the
way that leads thither; would never be
humble Petitioners for the pardon of their
Sins, or for the Life and Salvation of their
own Souls? That I look upon as exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
worthy of your observation and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thoughts, which we meet with in the
<hi>1st</hi> of <hi>Samuel, chap.</hi> 12. After that good

their great wickedness in asking a King; and
likewise put them into a great consternation

should sin in ceasing to pray for you.</hi> He had
prayed for them, and would continue to
pray for them. But now mark and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
that which followeth in <hi>vers.</hi> 24.
<hi>Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth with
all your heart.</hi> Which is, as if he had said,
I will not be wanting to my Duty, you are
a people that I dearly love, and hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wish welfare and prosperity to; I will
speak for you, and plead for you, and
wrestle with God for you; but do not you
lay too great stress upon my Prayers; look
to it that you be not found sinning against
God, whil'st I am praying to him for you,
left you do your selves more mischief than
I can do you good. My Prayers will not
prevail on your behalf, unless you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
to fear God your selves, and to seek
and serve him your selves, and pray, and
honour and obey him your selves. By war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of that Scripture, I do now say to you,
when you are sick and in distress, and fear
you shall dye, you will call the Ministers to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:42459:42"/>
pray for you, and we are ready to do it;
when you send for us we will come (only
I wish that we may be sent for sooner than
we are by some of you, <hi>viz.</hi> while you are
able to give us an account of your selves,
and in a capacity of receiving counsel and
advice) and when we come, it shall be with
bowels of pity and compassion, and we
will pray for you heartily, and with all
our might; but do not you trust to that,
and pass the time of your health and strength
in a supine carelesness and neglect, but now
make Prayer your business, go to the
Throne of Grace upon your own errand,
and seek God your selves.</p>

of this total neglect of Prayer, after Death
hath put a period to your sinful careless Life,
<hi>Enoch,</hi> while in the way, walked with God;
and then in the end <hi>God</hi> took him. The
Communion was begun here, that shewed

A Praying Saint doth at death go

they lived a Life of Prayer upon Earth, and
they shall live a life of Praise in Heaven.

But what will become of you that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
strangers to the work? what kind
of Eternity is that which you shall launch
into? How unspeakably doleful will your
condition be in the other World? You are
not fit for the work of Praises, for your

interest; set upon the work, if you did but
get acquaintance with it, you would love
it; if you were but once used to it, you
would never leave it. <hi>Psal. 116. 1, 2. I

I shall direct my Discourse to those
who are altogether for <hi>Publick Praying,</hi> get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

<hi>Consecrated places,</hi> there <hi>to shew</hi> (I think that

Devotion; though I do not see, but that
when their hours of Prayer are come, and

exceeding empty, which is indeed a shame
to them; for if they are persuaded in their
Consciences, That is the way of God, why
do they not frequent it? If they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced,
That is the work of the Lord, why
do they not abound in it? There is a great
cry among them for that form and Mode of
Worship, and I heartily wish it may do
them much good that love it; but since
their cry for it is so loud, why is their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion
so little? Why do small matters
keep them at home upon week-days? why
do they chuse Taverns and Ale-houses,
rather than their places of Prayer? Let them
look to it, that their <hi>seeming zeal</hi> do not
come from a bad Principle, and be not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

That is not my business, who desire
to follow those things that make for Peace,
Let those that like it and chuse it, use it
if they please; let them that find it heart-raising,
heart-warming, heart-inlarging,
go on in their attendance upon it: I envy
none that which they like, and may do
them good, especially when I have that
which pleaseth me better. Blessed be our
Gracious God, and thanks to those in Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
over us, we have liberty to serve
God according to our Judgments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences;
yea, and that Liberty established
by a Law. We know there are many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
that are enraged at it; but
through Divine Goodness, there is <hi>a wide
and effectual door opened,</hi> the Lord grant <hi>none
may be able to shut it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which I blame many for, is their
<hi>Idolizing</hi> of Publick Places, as if they did
put an Holiness and Virtue into work done
in them; and as if Publick Prayer were
enough, and would serve for all. How have
we some superstitious persons, as they pass
through an Abbey, Cathedral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not
only bare their heads, but drop upon their
knees in a Pew, or at a Pillar! And others,
that I have known, when the Bells chime
in, up they get, and to the Church they go,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:42459:46"/>
and there they sit till the Service be finished,
and that they think sufficient, and with
that they do at present put off their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,
that is all the Prayer they make,
then to Eating, and Drinking, and Visiting,
and Gaming, there is no Praying in their
Families, none in their Chambers and Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets;
I appeal to your Consciences in the
Case, and accuse no body living, unless
their Consciences accuse them. Now, my
Friends, what do you think of this? Is it
well? will this do? is this the way to
please God? Is this to fill up your days and
places with Duty? Is this to deal bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
with that God, who doth deal so
bountifully with you? Is this to fit your
selves for the giving up your account unto
God? The proud <hi>Pharisee</hi> went to the
Temple to pray; but when he had done,
he came away with a world of sin in him,
and with a load of guilt upon him. He
did, indeed, justify and applaud himself;
but God's Soul abhorr'd and loath'd him.
Whereas the poor, humbled, broken-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<hi>Publican</hi> stood a great way, and prayed
in the Spirit from an inward and deep sense
of his own vileness, and he was sent home
to his House justified; God gave him a
Pardon and a Smile. I shall not spend
much time or pains about this sort of Men,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:42459:47"/>
because I conclude their prejudice is so
great, that they will give very little heed
to any thing that I shall say, though deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
with all possible meekness, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
designed for their good; yet not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what it may please that God to do up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, who is the Father of Mercies,
and God of all Grace, and hath the hearts
of Men in his hand, and can make what
impressions upon them, and changes in
them, seem good in his sight, I shall not
pass them by altogether in silence; but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to their consideration these two things,
which, in my judgment, carry something
of weight in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Places do not add any value to
Actions of Religion, so as to commend
them to God. I remember, that which after
the discourse of <hi>Cornelius, Peter</hi> said unto
him, <hi>Acts 10. 34. Of a truth I perceive that
God is no respector of persons; but in every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he that feareth him, and worketh righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,
is accepted of him.</hi> And I may say,
as there is no respect of <hi>Persons</hi> with God,
so there is no respect of <hi>Places</hi> with God;
He hath no more esteem for the Chancel,
than for the body of the Church; and that
which is within the Rails, is no more Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
than that which is without them.
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:42459:47"/>
There is as near, compendious, and direct a
way to the Throne of God from thy House,
O Believer, as there is from the Church,
or the most magnificent Cathedral; and
those Supplications which are made and
presented there with an holy heart, by the
assistance of the Divine Spirit, and in the
name of Christ, shall find as free an access
to God, as ready an audience with him,
and as gracious an acceptance. It is indeed
by us, and all, granted, That the <hi>Temple</hi> at
<hi>Ierusalem</hi> was an holy place; yea, there was
in it, not only an Holy Place, but the Holy
of Holies. God himself had sanctified it,
and appropriated it to his own most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
service; there he had been pleased to
place his <hi>Name,</hi> that was an excellent <hi>Type</hi>
of the <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> our ever-blessed Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;
and where-ever the <hi>Iews</hi> were, into
what Countrey soever they were scattered
or carried Captive, they were to pray to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
it. <hi>Dan. 6. 10. When Daniel knew
that the writing was signed, he went into his house,
and his windows being open in his chamber to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Ierusalem, he kneeled upon his knees
three times a day and prayed, and gave thanks
before his God, as he did afore-time.</hi> But that
Temple being destroyed, and not so much
as one Stone left upon another, that Church-state
being at an end, and that dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:42459:48"/>
ceased; I know no such thing as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
of Places here below. The <hi>Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</hi>
among the <hi>Iews</hi> in the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi>
were not Holy; but only convenient
places for them to meet together in for the
performance of publick Worship, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon God in the way of his Ordinances.
And our Churches at this day, come not
in the room of the <hi>Temple,</hi> but of those
<hi>Synagogues.</hi> There was indeed a very great
stir and hot contention in our Saviour's
days, and before, about the place of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-worship,
between the <hi>Iews</hi> and the
<hi>Samaritans:</hi> The <hi>Iews</hi> were for the Temple
built by <hi>Solomon</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and they
were in the right; for that was the place
which God had chosen and appointed. On
the contrary, the <hi>Samaritans</hi> stood stifly for
the Temple, which had been built by their
Ancestors upon Mount <hi>Gerizzim.</hi> The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of <hi>Samaria,</hi> having an opportunity put
into her hands, did in <hi>Iohn</hi> 4. 20. start
the Question, and propound it to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
seeking, as one saith, to be by him
satisfied about it, as in a <hi>case of Conscience.</hi>
Now it is worth our while to observe his
Answer thereunto, which you have in
<hi>Verse 21. Iesus said unto her, Woman, believe
me, the hour cometh when ye shall neither at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,
nor in this Mountain, worship the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:42459:48"/>
Prayer, Ordinances, and the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God, shall not be restrained to this
place nor to that; it shall not be more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
powerful and prevalent in one place,
for the place's sake, than it is in another.
Add hereunto, that which the Holy Apostle
<hi>Paul</hi> saith, in 1 Tim. 2. 8. <hi>I will, that men
pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without
wrath and doubting.</hi> Mark his manner of
expression, <hi>I will;</hi> he speaks with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
we may be sure he received this from
the <hi>Lord.</hi> He would never have said, <hi>I will,</hi>
had he not been sure that it was <hi>God's will;</hi>
it was God's will, and therefore it was
<hi>Paul</hi>'s will. But what was it? That Men
do not look to the <hi>place</hi> in which they pray,
but to the <hi>manner</hi> how they pray; let them
pray any where, every where, in what
place they themselves judge fit and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient,
so that their hands be washed in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency,
and their hearts are but cleansed
from their filthiness and superfluity of
naughtiness. Holy and pure Prayer shall
be welcome to God, and have a most gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
reception, from what quarter or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
soever it comes. We find that good
<hi>Ionah</hi> prayed unto the Lord his God, when
he was in the <hi>Belly of the Fish,</hi> which was so
dark and dismal a place, that he counted
and called it <hi>the belly of Hell;</hi> yet his Prayer
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:42459:49"/>
made there, did not lose its way, nor fail
of the end for which it was sent. <hi>Ionah</hi> 2. 2.
<hi>I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord,
and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I,
and thou heardest my voice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I do advise and desire you <hi>to
examine your selves,</hi> and to be better studied
in, and acquainted with your own hearts,
than, it may be, as yet you are; for I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but tell you, though this be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
work, and necessary for all that would
manage Religion to everlasting advantage,
and approve themselves to God; so it is in
a particular manner necessary for them that
lay so much stress upon places, and other
things of like nature, to watch their hearts
narrowly, and to keep a very strict eye
upon them, lest by those superstitious ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances,
they be found wanting to, and
of the very vitals of the Duty, and hug
and please themselves with a rotten and
stinking Carcass, where the Soul and Life
are wanting; and as our Lord said to the
<hi>Pharisees,</hi> Matt. 23. 23. <hi>Wo unto you, Scribes
and Pharisees, hypocrites, for ye pay tythe of
mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted
the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and faith:</hi> They neglected the <hi>magnalia
legis,</hi> the great things of the Law, while
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:42459:49"/>
they were greatly solicitous about the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutula,</hi>
the little things, which did speak
the unsoundness of their hearts; so what
shall we think of them who spend all, or
the greatest part of their care and heat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
those things which come not under
any express command of the Divine Law?
They that are most curious about their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
are, as it is to be feared, most care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
about their Souls; they spend so much
time at their Glass, that they have none for
the <hi>Bible;</hi> they are so careful that a Pin
be not stuck amiss in their Cloaths, that
they leave every thing amiss in their Hearts;
by the Garbs and unreasonable Dresses, in
which some sillily proud persons come into
the Assemblies, it is easie for Spectators to
determine how they spent and profan'd the
Morning of the Sabbath at home; and we
may apprehend and fear the same in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
case, that those persons who are so much
set for such things as this, are, at least,
very apt and prone to bestow none of their
care about that which deserves most; they
are so much for the place, that they forget
and neglect the heart; they are so thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
where they pray, that they do not mind
how they pray; they are so set for a form,
they do not mind, nay, possibly they hate
the Power. But by the way, let<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42459:50"/>
this in the ear of these persons, That
the Altar will not Sanctify a corrupt thing:
If you bring dead, formal, lifeless Prayers,
though you offer them up in your Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
Churches, nay, at your adored Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
they will not come up with a sweet
smelling favour and acceptance before
God.</p>
               <p>I would not have any body think that I
do, God forbid that I should say, A Form
of Prayer, and Formality of Heart, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable
Companions; I do not doubt
but meer formal Professors are most for
forms; but I dare not affirm that all those
who make use of Forms, are meer formal
Professors. I do not doubt but some look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon Forms as lawful, and out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty,
and an humble sense of the lowness
of their own parts, do make use of Forms
when they pray with others, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scientious
in the use of them; and they do
accompany the Petitions, Confessions, and
Thanksgivings contained in them, with
sincere affections, and do meet with a

               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:42459:50"/>But this I will also be bold to say, and if
any be offended at it, upon them be it; That
constant stated forms of Prayer and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
are borderers upon one another; they
live at no such great distance, but that they
frequently, yea commonly, meet together in
the same Service, and in the same Persons:
And really I am of the mind, that it stands
them in hand, who make use of forms, to be
very cautious, and look warily to themselves,
lest they do, even before they are aware,
fall into formality; that indifferency and
lukewarmness of Spirit which God cannot
endure. When in the forequoted Scripture
the Woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> fell into discourse
with <hi>Christ</hi> about the place of Worship,
whether it ought to be at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> or in
that Mountain, <hi>viz. Gerizim?</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi>
did wisely and graciously take her off from
that, as a matter not so momentous as to
deserve either her Enquiry, or his Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and fell to acquainting her with, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
her to, and putting her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> upon the
Spirituality of that Worship, which is to be
performed, as that which she and every one
ought principally to attend unto, because it
is that which the heart of God is most for,
and upon which his pure eyes are chiefly
set. 4 <hi>Iohn 23, 24. The hour cometh, and now
is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42459:51"/>
in spirit and truth; for the Father seeketh
such to worship him. God is a spirit; and they
that worship him, must worship him in spirit, and
in truth.</hi> Spiritual Worship is most congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and agreeable to God. Childish Toys
please Children, who have no more wit;
outward Pomp and Ceremonies please vain
men, who have not so good hearts as they
should: but spiritual Worship is acceptable
to that God who is himself a Spirit; such
Worshippers he seeks, others he rejects when
he finds them; therefore you must be such,
if you would find favour, or receive a Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.
And to shut up this particular, I will
only add, That if men were once set, as they
should be, for the spirituality of Worship,
they would not be so unreasonably eager as
they are for, nor so tetchy, froward and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious
about Places, Modes, and Forms,
which can fetch their pedigree and original
no higher than meer human Invention and
Appointment. Enough of that; and it
will be well if some persons do not think this
a little too much.</p>

               <p>In the third and last branch of this Use
of Reprehension, my work will be to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
rouze, and startle; to convince, and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:42459:51"/>
bring those to judge and condemn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
who live without secret Prayer: I
hear from some, and I do more than partly
believe it, That there are many Professors,
and those too of some Name and Eminency,
who live under the dreadful guilt of this
sinful omission: and if there be <hi>some such,</hi>
how great may we suppose the total
number to be, of them who are this
way chargeable! tho' let them be never so
many, every one of them, Man, Woman, and
Child, is known to that God who observes
our down-lying and our up-rising, and is
acquainted with all our ways. There are
those that will come to publick Ordinances,
that they may not be counted Heathens,
nor suspected to be Papists, which Party now,
blessed be God, is under great infamy and
reproach, tho' not greater than they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
upon account of the very Principles of
that cursed Religion which they have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and do profess: Yea, and they will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
upon those Ordinances which they
think are most purely administred, and also
join themselves in Communion with those
Churches which they look upon as being of
the most Scriptural Constitution, that so they
may be reckoned among Christians of the
highest Form, and chiefest Rank; yea, and
peradventure they will set up Family-duties,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42459:52"/>
they will call their Children and Servants
together, and all under their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Charge, to seek the Lord; lest upon a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
or remove, some-body within doors
should tell tales, by means whereof their
reputation should be blasted, and the truth
of their Religion called in question by any
of those to whom they are desirous, yea,
ambitious of approving themselves. But,
wretches as they are! as for Prayer by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
either in Chamber or in Closet, or
any where else, they do lay it aside altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
God himself will be a swift Witness
against them, that He and they never so
met together. They find much other work,
and can do many other things when they
are alone: They can spend a great deal of
time at the Glass, viewing and dressing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
they can tell their Money, and read
over their Bills and Bonds: but as for Soul-searching
Works, and Heart-examining,
and seeking after God, either acquainting
themselves with him, or making their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests
known to him, they are utter stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
to it, and never troubled themselves
about any thing of that nature.</p>
               <p>Now let me ask you, Is this kind? Is
there any thing of ingenuity in it? Can the
great God, unto whom you are infinitely
obliged, take it well at your hands? You
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42459:52"/>
would have God look after you in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where you come: You do not indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in his Company, but would be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of his Care; you would have his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and Goodness follow you all the days of
your life. If <hi>Israel</hi> wanted any thing in the
Wilderness, if they had not Water here, and
Flesh there, they took pet, and fell a grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.
You expect that God should secure
you, and support you, and supply you, when
you are alone, as well as in Company; and
I would have you give me, if you can, one
good reason, why you will not seek and serve
Him when alone, as well as in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny?</p>
               <p>And I desire you to study the frame of
the <hi>Spouse</hi>'s Spirit, and take notice of the
resolution she took up, and consider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be nothing in it worthy of your
learning and imitation. <hi>Cantic. 8. 1, 2. O
that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the
breasts of my mother! when I should find thee
without, I would kiss thee, yet I should not he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised.
I would lead thee, and bring thee into my
mothers house.</hi> Bear with me, while I present
you with a few thoughts upon these words.
In them you have the Spouse's Option and
Resolution. Her Option or Wish: <hi>Oh that
thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of
my mother.</hi> That is, As near in relation and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42459:53"/>
conjunction to me, as near can be: I am
for no distance that may issue in strangeness,
but the greatest nearness possible, that will
warrant familiarity, and justifie a free con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse.
<hi>Oh that thou wert as my Brother!</hi> mine
own Brother, my Brother in all respects,
who did not ouly lie in the same Womb,
but was nourished and brought up with the
same Milk, and sucked the same Breasts.
Well, suppose it had been so; what then?
what advantage would she have had? what
encouragement would she have taken from
thence? That you may see in her <hi>Resolution,</hi>
which fixed upon two things: <hi>When I should
find thee without, I would kiss thee;</hi> the world
should see, that I have an heart, and love for
thee. But what, O thou enamour'd Spouse,
thou faithful Turtle, what of that? Others
will do so too; they will have their lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindnesses,
who are meer strangers to an
hearty and sincere affection. How many
men will abound in expressions of love when
they are <hi>without,</hi> extraordinary kind to their
Wives in the streets, and in their Neighbours
houses; huge loving and good-humour'd
before folks, when they are meer Dogs, or
rather Devils within doors; <hi>Naphtalies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
that give goodly words; but <hi>Nabals</hi>
at home, where their Tongues are sharp
Swords. Let such men know, and tremble
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42459:53"/>
while they know, there is a God in Heaven,
and a Conscience in their own bosoms, that
curiously observe and record all. And just
so it is in the present Case. A great many
will seem to kiss <hi>Christ</hi> abroad in a Church,
and at a publick Ordinance; who there so
devout as they? They will cringe and bow
to his very Name, <hi>Iesus;</hi> a great stir they
make, but it is nothing else than a Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
when they turn back upon the
Church, they turn their back upon Christ
too; and going home, they leave at the
Church-door all the respect and kindness
which they would be thought to have for
him. But the Spouse was acted by another
Principle; she carried the same dearness of
affection to Christ along with her to all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
where she came; and therefore she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
not only to kiss him when she found
him without, but likewise to <hi>lead him, and
bring him into her mothers house;</hi> She would be
as dear over him, and respective to him at
home, as abroad; she would indeed be glad
to meet him abroad, to meet him in the
High-way of his Ordinances; thither she
goeth, there she walks, and waits for that
very purpose; she esteems Ordinances, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they are divine appointments, and
have the stamp of God's Authority upon
them; but she rests not in the bare enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42459:54"/>
of them, but in and by them would
have communion with Christ himself; and
let her Sanctuary-sighs, and sense of his
Power and Glory there, be never so clear and
sweet, she would, for all them, long to have
him at home; home would not be home to
her, but a Wilderness, an Hell, if she could
not have communion and an intercourse of
kindness with Christ there.</p>
               <p>And this which we find her in that place
fixedly resolved to do, was no more than
what she had formerly done, when she had
been so happy as to meet with him. She had
found it was a thing seasible; <hi>Christ</hi> was
easie to be intreated; if desired, he would
not refuse to come under her Roof; and she
had found how much good she got by his
Company, that in having Him with her,
she had All in him. That she had done thus
before, you may see in <hi>Cant. 3. 4. It was
but a little that I passed from them, but I found
him whom my soul loveth.</hi> And glad she was
that she had found him; she did not repent
of the great pains and many weary steps that
she had taken in the search. But what did
she do now that she had found him? She
tells you, <hi>I held him, and would not let him go.</hi>
I am persuaded <hi>Christ</hi> did not intend to leave
her, he delights to stay where he is welcom
and made much of; nothing drives him
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42459:54"/>
away but unkindness. Yet true love is jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and afraid: He hath withdrawn, and
I did not know then how to be without him;
when my Sun was gone, it was dark night
with me; and therefore she would make as
sure of him as ever she could: He was too
good to part with, therefore now she had
got him again, she would keep him. If you
ask, How long? she tells you, <hi>Till she had
brought him into her mothers house, and into the
chamber of her that conceived her.</hi> She was for
secret Duty and Fellowship, Chamber-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
and Communion.</p>
               <p>And I think this may be taken for granted,
that there is not any one truly gracious Soul,
who knoweth what it is to have the sweet
gracious comfortable presence of Christ, and
what it is to lie and labour, sigh and groan
under his subductings and absence, but will
be of the same mind with the Spouse; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
recover'd his loss, he will in a pang of
love, and rapture of joy cry out, O thou
whom my Soul loveth! hast thou been gone
so long, and have I been mourning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
after thee so long, and seeking
thee so diligently, going, and weeping as I
went, dropping tears faster than I took
steps, and have I found thee at last! I will
not part with thee: if thou wilt not take
me up to thee, thou shalt not deny to go
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42459:55"/>
along with me; unless desires and longings
are grown insignificant, unless Prayers and
Tears have lost their wonted power, I will
have thee to my House, to my Family, to
my Chamber; I am now set for the greatest
privacy, and for the sweetest intimacy:
there will I pour out my fervent Prayers,
and there I will humbly and patiently, yet
with inflamed longings, attend thy pleasure,
and wait thy gracious Answers.</p>
               <p>We find that holy <hi>Abraham</hi> did erect Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
to God abroad, in the several places to
which he came. God had his Tables for
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> would have his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars
for God; God was very gracious, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
very ingenuous; God was bountiful,
and <hi>Abraham</hi> grateful. At <hi>Sichem</hi> the Lord
appeared to him, and there he built an
Altar, and another he made near unto <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel;</hi>
and another in the Plain of <hi>Mamre:</hi>
and doubtless, as he had his Altars, so his
Sacrifices; as all places were witnesses of
God's kindness to <hi>Abraham,</hi> so he would
have them witnesses of his mindfulness of
God. Yea, and as he had his Altars abroad,
so, as you have already heard, he had his
<hi>Grove</hi> at home; an Oratory, a place of
Prayer, where he called on the Name of the
<hi>Lord,</hi> the Everlasting God. There are those
in the world, and among our selves, who
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:42459:55"/>
can find Altars abroad; and if there be
none, they <hi>will</hi> make some; they had as
lieve be without Churches, as without Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars:
And oh! how do they admire them,
as the most holy places, tho' there be no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice!
and how do they plead for them,
and stoop and bow to them! and herein they
place a main piece of their Religion, tho' it
be but a piece of foolish Superstition, if not
something worse; from which God deliver
<hi>England</hi> and other Reformed Churches,
which do yet need a further Reformation.
Well, these people have these things abroad;
but suppose one should ask them, what they
have at home? May they not say, We have
rich Tables, full Cups, stately Chambers,
Down-beds, yea, and Cards and Dice,
Healthing and Ranting, Chambering and
Wantonness? Yes, it is very probable: But
what is there of the Service of God, of the
Worship of God, of any Honour done to
God? Nothing of all this; no, nothing at
all. And art thou one of this number?
then I earnestly desire thee to think with
thy self, and seriously consider, what a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
place is thy Closet, in which there is
no Prayer; how it stinks in God's nostrils:
Whatever other Sweets thou maist have,
where there is no holy Duty to perfume it;
what a wicked place, what an Hell is thy
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:42459:56"/>
Chamber, out of which the Glorious Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of Heaven is, so far as thou canst do it,
excluded! If there be no Prayer there,
then for certain there is no God there; I
mean, by his gracious presence; and if there
be no God there, then there are a thousand
Devils.</p>
               <p>But my chief design is not to deal at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
with the gross and openly flagitious;
I have no cause to wonder that they have no
such thing as Prayer in their Chambers and
Closets, who do by their loose, vicious and
abominable Lives proclaim to all that know
them, that there is no fear of God before
their Eyes; I would indeed speak a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
words to do their Souls good, and
think my time and labour well bestowed:
But now my business lieth among Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors,
those of them who live in the shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
neglect of Secret Prayer, to whom I
shall propound these four Questions, and
let them consider what Answer they can
give.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Art thou a Christian indeed, or
art thou not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Dost thou make Religion thy
business, or dost thou not?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> What account dost thou make
of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="tcp:42459:56"/>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Doth not thy Conscience charge
thee with the omission of a Duty? I
desire to deal faithfully with you, as
one that must answer before my
Judge; and oh that you would deal
faithfully with your own Souls, for it
is your great and everlasting Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Art thou a Christian, or art thou
not? I mean not in Profession only, but
in reality; not in shew only, but in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;
not in word and in tongue only, but
in deed and in truth? thou wilt answer,
yes, I am a Christian, God forbid I should
be otherwise. Thou sayst well, but the
great business is to make it out. How dost
thou prove it? Thou wilt, perhaps, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
Thou hast been baptized: that is well
too, that thy Parents did their duty in
bringing thee to that sacred and solemn Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of initiation, and thereby binding
thee to the faith, fear and service of thy
great Creator, and Lord Redeemer. But
my Friend, Is that all thou hast to say for
thy Christianity? Is that all the Evidence
thou art able to produce? I cannot forbear
telling thee, That Baptism (where there is
that, and no more) doth make a company
of pitiful Christians. There was an <hi>Israelite</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:42459:57"/>
in shew, and an <hi>Israelite</hi> in deed. Wilt
thou observe and make due use of that
which <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom. 2. 28, 29. He is not
a Iew which is one outwardly, neither is that
Circumcision, which is outwordly in the flesh;
But he is a Iew which is one inwardly, and
Circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit,
and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men,
but of God.</hi> And in the same sense I may
say, that is not Baptism which is only out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that is not enough to give the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
upon that single account Christ
will not own a person for a Sheep of his
Fold, a Member of his Body: that lays in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
on all them that receive it, an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
unto holiness, and it will greatly ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate
the sins which they afterward live
in the wilful commission of; but it will not
entitle them to Salvation, and everlasting
happiness. 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 21. Baptism doth now
save us by the Resurrection of Iesus Christ:</hi>
possibly now thou thinkest thou hast e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.
<hi>Baptism saveth,</hi> and what do I need
more: but stay, let the Apostle explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
which he doth in the very same Verse.
<hi>Not the putting away the filth of the flesh,</hi> by
sprinkling water upon the face, according
to most; or dipping in it, according to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
or plunging the whole body in it
over head and ears, according to some;
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:42459:57"/>
neither this, nor that way will be sufficient
and saving alone. The unregenerate Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Israel,</hi> though circumcised, were
unto God as the Children of the <hi>Ethiopians,
Amos</hi> 9. 7. And as one saith, A man may
go to Hell with the water of Baptism upon
his face. <hi>But,</hi> saith <hi>Peter, the answer of a
good Conscience toward God.</hi> When Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is able to give this testimony of a man,
that he hath been baptized by the Holy
Ghost, renewed in the spirit of his mind;
that it is his desire to answer the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Baptism, to attain the blessed Ends
of Baptism, and to approve himself to God,

be not thou so disingenuous and ungrateful
as to shut him out of thy Chamber, when
thou lettest in the World and Sin. Holy
<hi>Paul,</hi> speaking of himself, and others of the
true Apostles, he saith, 2 <hi>Cor. 2. 14. That
God made manifest the savour of his knowledge
by them in every place:</hi> that was a very great
and excellent work; they were not moral
Preachers, but Gospel-preachers: They
did not preach <hi>Plutarch,</hi> but <hi>Iesus.</hi> The
Spouse had said, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. 3. That <hi>the name of
her Beloved was as an ointment poured forth.</hi>
Now said <hi>Paul,</hi> I determined to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
among you but Jesus Christ, and him
crucified; and all the Apostles were acted
by the same Spirit, and inflamed with the
same love to Christ: they took his name as
a box of most precious Ointment; and
whereever they came, they opened it, and
made Christ known; and whereas the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
World was exceeding unsavoury, and
all places did stink most wretchedly of their
Idolatry; the Apostles perfum'd and sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:42459:58"/>
and brought into them the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
savour of the knowledge of the true
God in Christ. Now accordingly I would
have you act, if you be professors: make
every place where you come, to savour of
Religion; let all your Discourses have a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of it; carry that savour with you into
your Friends Houses, and publick Houses of
entertainment; and be sure that in your
own Houses, in your Chambers and Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,
you do make manifest the savour of
that <hi>knowledg</hi> which you have of God, and
of that true sincere love which you have for
God. If you be Christians, be uniform,
practice Christianity always, every-where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I would seriously propound this
Question to thee, Dost thou make Religion
thy business? I have not lived above
Threescore Years in the World without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
some Observations, and getting some
knowledge of it; and I must needs say, I
know a great deal more than is good. I
have read many Books, and I have read
Men too, though indeed many of them
are crabbed pieces, not easie to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood:
But this I have found, and still do, to
my sorrow, and to their shame, that many
Persons among us do make a profession of
Religion, who never indeed took it up, nor
buckel'd to it as their Trade: they are not
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:42459:59"/>
altogether strangers, but will be doing
something; but here's the mischief, it is
only as a <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap> business by the bye
their thoughts, and cares, and studies, are
carried another way; their main work doth
lie somewhere else; namely, in the World,
that is the thing they are devoted to, and
set their hearts upon, and spend their time
and strength in the pursuit of; how they
should get it, how they shall increase it,
how they shall secure it, and how they shall
inebriate themselves with the comforts,
delights and pleasures of it. Whereas the
gracious Soul, that is sound at the bottom,
and that in truth which he would go for in
the account and esteem of men, makes his
Religion his great and principal work. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
said, <hi>Psal. 109. 4. I give my self unto prayer,</hi>
others give themselves over to sin. God
gives them up to a reprobate mind, and to
vile affections, and to their own hearts
lusts, and they give themselves up, one to
his drunke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ness, and another to his unclea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Now <hi>David</hi> gave himself to prayer;
and what he saith of Prayer in particular, is
true as to Godliness in general; a godly
Man gives himself up to it, he is addicted
and devoted to it, he is all for that; and
the truth is, none but such an one will do
good upon it. Believe it, O Professors!
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:42459:59"/>
for your own experiences will in the end
make my words good; none but such as
do indeed make Religion their Trade, will
thrive upon it, and grow rich toward God.</p>
               <p>Now then, if thou dost indeed make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
thy business, thou wilt heartily study,
and do all thou canst to promote it; as you
know the promoting of Trade is the matter
of common discourse among men, and
they are greatly set for it, they are glad to
hear of any thing that will contribute there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Now there is nothing in the World
that doth forward a Christian more in this
his great business, and that doth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the Trade of Godliness and Religion,
than Secret Prayer doth. I am not willing
to compare one Duty with another, or one
Ordinance with another, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>. You know that many

with that, they will have their Secret Stock
also, and will trade by themselves: So here,
the Saints and People of God should be tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
and have a great deal going in the
common Stock, in publick Worship, in the
Assemblies and Congregations of the Saints,
<hi>Psal.</hi> 42. 4. Holy <hi>David</hi> did reckon it a brave
time when <hi>he went with the multitude to the house
of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a
multitude that kept holy day,</hi> Psal. 122. 1. <hi>He
was glad when they said unto him, Let us go into
the house of the Lord.</hi> And it is prophesied
and promised as a choce and singular bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
<hi>Isa.</hi> 2. 3. That <hi>many people shall go, and

of the Lord, to the house of the God of</hi> Jacob,
<hi>and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk
in his paths.</hi> But it is not to be expected that
they should thrive amain, and grow very
rich toward God<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> unless they have a Secret
Stock going too, and will be trading by
themselves in private and keeping up that
communion<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> correspondency and intercourse
with God and Christ, which others do not
know of <hi>David</hi> was very much for Sanctuary
sights and enjoyments; when he was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

for them, <hi>Psal<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>

you read in <hi>Psal.</hi> 119. 164. It was his
constant practice to be at <hi>his praises of God
seven times a day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> I would ask thee this Question,
What dost thou think of God? what figure
doth he make? I know, notwithstanding
his unmatchable Excellencies, and infinite
Perfections, he is very low in the thoughts
of many, yea most; but I am now speaking
to thee who art a Professor, and pretendest
to a knowledge of him, and a love to
him: But prithee, What room dost thou
give him? where dost thou place him?
dost thou deal becomingly with him? dost
thou value and esteem him as a God ought
to be valued? dost thou believe that he alone
is more than all the Angels in Heaven, and
all the Men on Earth put together? dost
thou think that to have his Eye upon thee,
is a far greater matter, than to have the
Eyes of the best and greatest Persons upon
Earth upon thee. It really is so, for what
is all the World to God? what is Heaven
and Earth to God? what is their loving
thee, if he hate thee? what is their liking
thee, if he loath thee? what is their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
and justifying thee, if he reject and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:42459:61"/>
condemn thee? but I ask now, what thy
thoughts are? and again, I ask, dost thou
think, that to have his presence with thee,
is more than to be in the most frequent and
numerous Assembly, the most thronged Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation?
and certainly it is so: the presence
of God alone should be more awing, and it is
more delighting than that of any other.</p>
               <p>Now if thou hast this high esteem for
God, if thou makest this account of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
then remember, that <hi>He seeth in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret.</hi>
So our Saviour tells us in the Text.
His Eyes run to and fro in the Earth; not
only in the High-ways, and broad Streets,
but they look into Nooks and Corners also.
He doth not only walk in the golden Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesticks,
but steps into Chambers and Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets
too: as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9. 8. he order'd the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
to dig in the wall,</hi> and commanded him to
go in and see the Abominations that were
done there. And Verse 12. He speaks of what
the <hi>Ancients of the house of</hi> Israel <hi>did in the
dark, every one in the chambers of his imagery.</hi>
Idolaters act their idolatry, and ungodly
Men their wickedness as close as they can;
they have darkness and walls to conceal it;
but to God the darkness is as the light, and
the night shineth as the day: and in the
wall there is an hole, through which God's
Eye looks and discovers all: and he that
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:42459:61"/>
can find an hole in the wall, hath also a
window in the Chamber. Now if the
Eyes of Men will make thee pray in thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
if they have such a powerful influence
on thee as to fetch thee out of thy House,
and draw thee to join with the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> the Acts of Publick Worship; give
me a reason, if thou hast one worth the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
why the All-seeing Eye of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and holy God, should not make thee
pray in thy Chamber by thy self, since he
doth most curiously observe thee there,
though no body else doth. I think my self
bound to tell thee, whether thou wilt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and consider it or not, I must leave to
thy self, That if thou dost neglect Secret
Prayer, it is an evident sign that thou un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluest
God; It is no less than a base
slight put upon God: and <hi>those that despise
him, shall be lightly esteemed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let me once more inquire of
thee, what agreement is there between thee
and thy Conscience? When you do not seek
God, do you find and enjoy peace within?
is Concience quiet? doth it not quarrel
with you? and make you feel its anger?
I remember what the Apostle saith in
<hi>Rom. 14. 22. Happy is he that condemneth not
himself in that which he alloweth:</hi> that is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:42459:62"/>
about the thing which he doth;
whatever others say against him, he is not
self-condemned. So I may say, Happy is
the man who condemneth not himself in the
thing that he omitteth. Thou never prayest
in secret, but art thou not in that wanting
to thy duty? art not thou injurious both to
God and thine own Soul? dost thou not
withhold from him that which is his
due? doth not thy Conscience tell thee,
thou art wanting to thy duty: doth it
not vote for it? doth it not upbraid thee
with the neglect? doth it not sometimes
flee in thy face, and charge it upon thee,
and put thee into a Little-ease? I think, I
have said enough in the Doctrinal part for
the proving it to be thy Duty; And hath
not thy Conscience gone along with those
things, and subscribed to them as the
Truths of God? And if so, what account
wilt thou be able to give unto thy supream
Lord for thy not giving ear to his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent,
that he himself had appointed and
set up in thy bosome? How wilt thou an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
him, when he shall say, Why didst
thou not attend to the dictates of thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science?
why didst thou not do that which
thy Conscience told thee thou wast bound
to do? How dost thou think to come off?
what plea wilt thou use at the last and great
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42459:62"/>
day, when thy heavenly Master shall say, I have
not found thy works perfect before me, they
have not been filled up, here hath been an
huge Chas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>e, a great vacancy; I have
been forgotten and neglected by thee when
thou wast alone; thou wouldest not do me
service when thou hadst nothing else to do;
thou wouldest rather sit still nodding in thy
Chair, than take the pains to give me a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit.
We are commanded, <hi>always to ahound
in the work of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>verse</hi> last.
How darest thou then to omit so consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
so sweet and so necessary a part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
especially when thy Conscience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
and called thee to it? Conscience
will be heard sooner or later, in one way or
other; if you will not hear its softer
Counsels, you shall its louder Thunders;
if you will not follow its Directions, it will
pursue you with its Terrors. In a word,
if you will not attend to the Dictates of
Conscience, you shall feel the Fury of
it; and when you feel it, you will find it
intoll<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Having thus ordered out those Reproofs
which I judged necessary upon occasion of
this Text, and begging they may take place,
and be accompanied with a blessing upon
those who are guilty before God in one of
these respects or other; I come to speak
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42459:63"/>
unto you in a way of hearty and serious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation:

oh, that by the concurrence, and effectual
working of the Divine Spirit, I might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail

God, and desire to do it with thankfulness,
That these Discourses, when Preached, were

they may go and bring forth much more

ought to be a matter of Practice. Do not <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crastinate</hi>

I beseech you, out of hand, answer
the call; make your Houses <hi>Churches,</hi> and

much to your advantage, <hi>to converse frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p>Tell me, O Christian, Have there not
been such times in which thou hast found
God speaking to thee? <hi>Elihu,</hi> indeed, saith,
Job 33. 14. <hi>God speaketh once, yea, twice,
yet man perceiveth it not.</hi> Many a Man is so
careless, that he doth neither understand
God, nor mind; he doth not perceive
<hi>what</hi> God saith, what his meaning is, it is
all a strange Language to him, and he doth
not perceive <hi>that</hi> God speaks; he doth not
think that God saith any to him. <hi>Isa.</hi> 26. 11.
<hi>Lord, when thine hand is lifted up, they will not
see.</hi> No, they shut their eyes, and are
willingly ignorant; and as they will not
<hi>see</hi> when God's hand is lifted up, so they will
not <hi>hear</hi> when God's voice is lifted up. The
Saints if well, and in health, have all their
senses exercised; but wicked men have
none, of their senses exercised about the
things of God. But hast thou not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God speaking to thee, once, yea twice,
in <hi>divers manners?</hi> By his Providences,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42459:64"/>
frowning and smiling, prosperous and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse?
by his Word and Ministers? by his<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Holy and Blessed Spirit, and by thine own<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
Conscience, which he hath awakened when
it was drowsy and sleeping, and opened its
mouth, and put words into it that it should
say to thee? Hath he not spoken to thee<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> at
<hi>divers seasons?</hi> In a dream, when thy eyes
were shut, and when awake; abroad and
at home; when in company, and when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
when up, and when laid, <hi>in a vision
of the night,</hi> as <hi>Elihu</hi> said, <hi>when deep sleep
falleth upon men; in slumberings upon the bed.</hi>
And he hath spoken to thee to divers pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;
sometimes Precepts to direct thee,
sometimes Promises to revive thee; now a
Rebuke, then a Cordial; at one time Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and at another time Peace: Thus
according to thy case and exigency, he hath
varied his Applications.</p>
               <p>Now, hath God spoken so often to you,
and do you find nothing to say to God?
Will you be always in the possession, and
under the power of a dumb Devil? Are
you so full of goodness and comfort, so
rich in knowledg and grace, so increased
in mercies and blessings of all sorts, that
you have no more to ask? Do you find that
to be a <hi>Canaan,</hi> a Heaven, which others
call a Wilderness, because of pinching

Remember how <hi>Laodicea</hi> was mistaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

Is it so throughly and perfectly well with

no complaint to make to him, not one boon
to beg of him? Is thy day so serene and

there no sin within that is too hard for
thee? Doth it never war against the Law
in thy mind? or doest thou immediately
knock it down, and get a complete victory
at thy first entrance into the field? Hast
thou quite shaken off that body of death
which poor <hi>Paul</hi> could not for his heart get

assure thee, that being in the hand of so
great a Physician, it shall be carried on; but
what, is it perfected already? In a word,
is there nothing at all that troubles thee?
or hast thou nothing to say to God in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate?
what, nothing, but what thou
wouldest have every body hear and know?
But I pass by that at present; we shall by
and by have a fitter opportunity of speaking
more concerning it.</p>
               <p>Come, come, Christian, be thine own
Friend, better than ever thou hast been yet,
and without more ado be persuaded to get
alone, and shut thy door, and fall down
upon thy knees, and pour out thy Soul into
the bosom of thy heavenly Father; I am
confident, if thou wilt begin it in good
earnest, thou wilt not easily give it over.
I do not, indeed, know what interruption
the Devil may give thee, who hates all the
Work of God, and good of Man; but if,
by temptation, thou shouldest for a time be
taken off from it, thou wilt not be well,
nor able to enjoy thy self till thou dost re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to it again. I dare say, in an humble,

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42459:66"/>
so much benefit and advantage accruing to
thee, that thou wilt go on, and call upon
God as long as thou livest, and then expire
thy Soul in the same manner as <hi>Stephen</hi> did,
whose last words were Prayer, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 59.
<hi>Lord Iesus receive my spirit; and, Lord lay not
this sin to their charge; and when he had said
this, he fell asleep.</hi> That which I have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to do, will be in these two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. Lay down Motives to the work.</item>
                     <item>2. Give Directions for managing it.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I shall begin with the Motives for the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luring
and drawing you to this excellent
work, who have hitherto been altogether
strangers to it, or very backward, and by
consequence inconstant, off and on; and
I shall most heartily rejoice, if the Lord
would graciously please to succeed these en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
so that what I shall suggest to
you, may bring you upon your knees; that
there may be more of this Chamber-pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
more of a Chamber-fellowship, and
Closet-communion with your God. The
Motives are these:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Do you pray in secret, because that
God, who is the proper Object of Prayer,
seeth in secret; as trusting in him, you do<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:42459:66"/>
at no time and in no condition, trust in a
God that cannot save; so directing your
Prayers to him, you do in no place pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a God that cannot hear. When <hi>Hagar</hi>
had in a fear fled from the face of her incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Mistress, God found her out in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness,
where she was absconded, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
and spake unto her there; whereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it is said in <hi>Gen. 16. 13. That she called
the name of the Lord that spake unto her, Thou
God seest me; for she said, Have I also here look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after him that seeth me?</hi> We may, as some
do, reckon these words to be words of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension,
as relating to herself; and words
of admiration, as referring to God. <hi>Have
I also looked after him!</hi> Here I am, but how
stupid and foolish have I been! I have been
looking back to the Comforts which I had
when in the Family, and under the wing of
my Master <hi>Abraham;</hi> and I have been look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the displeasure and severity of my
Mistress <hi>Sarah<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  </hi> and I have been looking to
the desolate place and distressed condition
into which I am now brought: but have I
here minded God, and looked after God?
I have been so afflicted with my loss, and
have pored so much upon my troubles, that
I have been unmindful of God, did find
neither heart nor leisure to think of Him,
or look after Him: (a Case it is too common
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42459:67"/>
among the children of men!) yet <hi>here he

my person, and upon my affliction and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
And maist not Thou, my Friend, say
the very same, when thou art alone, and in
thy Closet-recesses, <hi>Thou God seest me?</hi> When

me desire thee, after that serious considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to propound this as a serious Question
to thy self; Have I also here looked after
him that seeth me? God's eyes have been
here upon me; but have mine eyes been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
upon God, and unto God? It may be,
thou art able to say, In the publick Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
I have looked after that God who
seeth me, there I have had many, frequent,
repeated, and raised thoughts at him; there
I have waited for him more than they that
watch for the morning, yea, more than they
that watch for the morning. But when thou
art in thy Chamber, canst thou make thy
Appeal to God, and say, <hi>O Lord, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
and art my witness, that even here I have
looked after thee that seest me; here mine eyes of
Faith and Prayer have been toward the Lord that
seeth me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an Argument which our de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Question speaks it a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible
to be done. His eye is fastned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
thee, and follows thee whithersoever
thou goest: look to thy self, and ponder all
thy actions; thou art under the pure and
piercing, and all-discerning eye of the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely

thou art in the Congregation, and in the

yea, and when thou art in the Closet too.
And since he doth see thee there, what
wouldst thou have him see thee doing?
wouldst thou have him see nothing but va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

done by thee, but looking into thy Glass,
and into thy Chests and Bags, or turning
over thy Fineries and Fooleries, and so
feeding thy Wantonness and Pride; or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

and sensual Appetite: but never see thee up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Soul?</p>
               <p>Oh that <hi>His Eye</hi> might affect <hi>your Hearts!</hi>
That Divine Eye which is upon all your
ways, and looks you thorow and thorow;
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:42459:68"/>
That Eye which is ten thousand times, yea<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
inconceivably more than the eyes of all the
Angels in Heaven, and of all the Men upon
Earth. The Eye of God should, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
have these two effects upon us, and
upon all men that know and own him:
<hi>First,</hi> It should awe us; <hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>ondly,</hi> It should
quicken and animate us. It should awe us
when we are in secret, and be an effectual
curb to those Lusts and Corruptions which
would otherwise break loose and grow ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pant.
When no body is by, do not dare to
sin, because God is by. This preserved
young <hi>Ioseph</hi> from falling before a great
temptation. When he might have procured
the savour of his Mistress, and, as some
would have thought, have done himself a
kindness; this thought brake the neck of
the temptation, <hi>How shall I do this great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness,
and sin against God?</hi> Again, the Eye
of God should animate and put life into you<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
it should, as a golden Spur, quicken you to
the careful and lively performance of Duty
when you are in secret, and no body at
hand to take notice of it, and make report.
Let it be enough for you, enough alone, that
God seeth your love to him, and the desires
of your Souls to his Name, and a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of him, and communion with him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
and He needs none to inform him of your
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42459:68"/>
unmindfulness and neglect of him; no, no,
He seeth it himself; He seeth where your
thoughts are, He understands them afar off,
and He seeth where your hearts are: so it
appears by the charge he gave out against
<hi>Israel</hi> of old, <hi>This people draweth near unto me
with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.</hi>
And I would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ain know of you, how it is
possible but that he should take it very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindly
at your hands, and be highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if that he should be slighted by you,
who is so excellent and glorious in himself,
and so absolutely necessary for you, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom you are so everlastingly beholden
and obliged? How can he otherwise chuse
but be angry with you, if in your leisure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time,
and at your spare hours, you will not
give him a visit; if you cannot find in your
hearts to bestow some of that time upon
him, which you have to spare from your
earthly Friends, and worldly Business?
When he seeth this, how canst thou think
but that his fury will come up into his
face?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Praying in secret is a very good
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>nd comfortable sign of sincerity. I do not
say that it is a certain and infallible sign,
and that every one that sets upon this work
hath indeed the Spirit of Adoption, and may
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42459:69"/>
from thence arrive to an assurance of Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
and draw an undeniable conclusion, <hi>That
he is born again:</hi> for I do very well know, there
is no external act of Religion which an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite
may not set his hand to. As Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Credit among men may bring
them out to publick Ordinances, so that
<hi>they shall come as the people cometh; and sit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their Minister as the people sitteth, and hear
his words, Ezek</hi> 33. 31. so an enlightned,
awakened, uneasie and importunate Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
may bring them upon their knees in
private. An hypocrite's heart is really in no
piece of the work of God; while he draws
nearest to him with his lips, that is far from
him: how indeed can he raise that up to God,
which he hath set upon his iniquity? Yet he
may have a finger in every thing that is of the
out-side. A <hi>Iehu</hi> knows how to be zealous
against Idolatry, and for the Lord, when
so to be, paves his way to a Throne; tho'
when he has once got it, and is warm in it, he
himself would be as bad as any, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.
31. <hi>Iehu took no heed to walk in the Law of the
Lord God of Israel with all his heart: for he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
not from the sins of Ieroboam, which
made Israel to sin.</hi> A <hi>Soul</hi> would sacrifice, yea,
was too hasty at it; and a <hi>Pharisee</hi> would
pray in the <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Synagogue;</hi> and those
hearts run after their Covetousness, and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42459:69"/>
would not be obedient to the Word of God,
would yet go out to hear it: And I do not
know, but persons of the like Spirits and
Principles as rotten at heart as any of them,
may set upon Religious Actions when they
are alone; they may, when by themselves,
take up a Bible, or good Book, and read in
it; and they may, when there is need, fall
upon their knees, and offer up their requests
unto God. An hypocrite may be at duty in
his Closet, tho' his heart never be with
God in duty, neither in his Closet, nor any
where else.</p>
               <p>But now observe, this is not so acceptable
to him, it is not that which he takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
and delight in; he is put upon it; he
is under a force; Conscience offers violence,
and drag him into it: as <hi>Ioab<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> when he
saw Justice would take hold on him at the
last, tho', it is probable, he never had any
great love for the Altar, yet then he would

                     <desc>â€¢â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ee and catch hold of the Horns of it, and
would even die there. But, I say, this is not
the matter of their delight, they do if not so
much out of choice as cut of constraint;
it is not That which they take pleasure in;
and because it is not their <hi>pleasure,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap> their <hi>practice.</hi> They may do
such a thing now and then in a straight,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:42459:70"/>
when they are put to a pinch; but they do
not make it their Trade. Our Saviour tells
us where we are most like to meet with
them, if we have a mind to find them at
their Devotions; that is, <hi>in the Synagogues,
and the corners of the streets.</hi> If you would
find them in their wickednesses; for hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites
are Villains, they make use of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for no other end, but as a Cloak to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their Knavery; and there is a great deal
of that, which some of them are guilty of
God is pleased now and then to pluck off
their Masques: and oh what Deformities
do then visibly appear in their lives and
conversations! When their Paint is once off,
there are no persons so ugly: But, as I was
saying, if you would find them in their
wickednesses, then look for them in the
dark, and in holes; it is not for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
it is inconsistent with their design, to
be so impudent and brazen-fac'd as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
Cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>w, who glory in their shame, no,
no, these are sneaking wretches, who would
steal their sins, and no body know of them.
But if you would find them at their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
do but listen, and you may possibly
hear their Trumpet found; or if not, the best
way is to look for them in some noted and
frequented places, the Synagogues, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of streets. Publick places are the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:42459:70"/>
haunts, for they are most conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient
and proper for the carrying on of
their design, which is not to be <hi>approved of
God,</hi> but <hi>seen of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I say, Though secret Prayer,
and the performance of other duties of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
in secret, be not a <hi>certain and infallible</hi>
Argument of an heart renewed by Grace,
and upright with God; yet it is a <hi>very good</hi>
Argument. Tho' it be not such an Evidence
of Grace, as alone will put it out of all doubt
and question, yet it is a good Evidence, and
will do much in a cumulative way, and in
conjunction with other things. And tho' he
may be a wicked man, who doth several
things that every good man cannot but do; yet
he cannot be a good man, who doth not do
those things. <hi>A wicked man</hi> may be found in
a good way; but he is not a <hi>good man,</hi> who
always turns his back upon a good way,
and doth never walk in the Law of the Lord.
So here, tho' he may be an <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> who
doth pray in secret, yet he cannot be a <hi>Saint</hi>
who never prays in secret: He who doth
not desire and maintain secret Communion
<hi>with God,</hi> hath not, whatever his pretences
may be, an heart indeed set <hi>for God.</hi> The
hearts of men are curiously searched into
now, and they shall all be openly discover'd at
the last; and when the day of manifestation
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:42459:71"/>
shall c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>me, he that now is not for being <hi>with
God,</hi> when he is alone, will then be found
and condemned as one that hath not been
<hi>for God at all.</hi> And this I do positively lay
down as an undeniable Truth, <hi>That love to
fellowship with God in secret, doth speak a real
love to God.</hi> Tho' a person may pray in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,
and yet be unsound and rotten; yet a
person hath an heart sound in God's Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
who so prays in secret, as not to be
satisfied with the work done, unless he be
with God in it; <hi>i. e.</hi> sensibly find God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to him with the communications of
his Grace, and the sweet discoveries of his
Covenant-love; or, at least, his soul work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out to God in holy desires and long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Thou canst not but be conscious
to thy self of a great many secret sins with
which thou art chargeable before God; and
is there not a great deal of reason why thou
shouldst perform secret Duties, where
thou didst commit secret Sins? and that
those places should be witnesses of thy fear
of God, and love to him, which have been
frequent witnesses of thy neglect of God,
and rebellion against him? There are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
those who commit uncleanness with
greediness, and act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n with highest impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence:
they do so dearly love and delight in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:42459:71"/>
it, that they are not at all ashamed of it, but
can without a blush do the Devil's drudgery,
the dirtiest and basest of his work. Hence as
in one place this is the complaint, <hi>They draw
iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as with
cart-ropes,</hi> so in another place, <hi>viz. Isa.</hi> 3. 9.
the complaint is thus: <hi>They declare their sin
as Sodom, and hide it not;</hi> no, not they<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
but like some who think they can mend
what a better than they have made, they
carry their black spots in their very faces,
and <hi>glory in their shame, Phil.</hi> 3. 19. Former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
indeed, men were more modest; they
cast a Mantle over their Nakedness, and did
the works of darkness in the dark. <hi>Paul</hi>
saith, in his time, <hi>They that were drunk, were
drunk in the night:</hi> but now wickedness is
grown more common, and men more auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,
and they do not avoid the light of
the Sun, nor the eyes of men: the open
street and the noon-day are thought now as
convenient time and place as any other: they
are grown <hi>so desperate,</hi> that they care not
what they do, they will run upon the mouth
of the Cannon, <hi>the bosses of God's Buckler;</hi>
and <hi>so impudent,</hi> that they care not who seeth
them: as 2 <hi>Sam. 16. 22. There was a tent
spread for Absalom upon the top of the house, and

the sight of all Israel.</hi> Yea, these wretches,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:42459:72"/>
when they have acted to their utmost, and
sinned as they could, do not yet so tire and
weary themselves in the Devil's service, but
that they will find something to do at home,
and give some stroaks there to the further
pleasing of their tyrannical Lord, and gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
their insatiate Lust. The Scripture
speaking of uncleanness, tells us of eyes that
<hi>cannot cease to sin,</hi> cannot brook an intermissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they are not <hi>at rest</hi> any longer than they
are <hi>at work:</hi> they are looking round about
for new Objects, and every such Object in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames
them, and by it away they are carried
to fresh transports of defiling folly and mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>But I have dwelt too long upon these
Vassals of Satan, and sworn Votaries of the
Flesh: let us turn our thoughts another
way, and consider whether the Children of
God themselves have not their secret Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Follies, and Extravagancies? When
didst thou so put off the Old Man, that there
was none of his deeds to be found in thine
hands? What stream hath flowed from thee,
which hath run clear; nay, what drop that
was perfectly pure? Name that place, if
thou canst, in which thou hast not done
more than enough to pollute thy Soul, to

O Christian, and let that tell thee, Hath
not God seen thy pride in thy Closet, and
thy worldly-mindedness? hath he not been

and repinings, when thou couldst not get the
good thing thou hadst a mind to, or didst lose
what rhou hadst set thy heart too much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?
Possibly, many of these things thou
hast forgotten, but God hath them sealed
up in a Bag; they are all in the light of his
Countenance. I have often considered those
expressions of holy <hi>David,</hi> who was a <hi>preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
Saint, tho' his great miscarriages spake
him far from a <hi>perfect</hi> one; and I do advise
you to consider them too, and heartily wish
you would. <hi>Psal. 19. 12. Who can understand
his errors? Cleanse thou me from secret faults.</hi>
It is a thing utterly impossible for man to
understand himself perfectly: it is a mercy
for him to understand his way, but he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
understand all his deviations. As a
Christian doth not understand his progress,
so not his wandrings; and as for his faults,
there are some of them so secret, that tho
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42459:73"/>
he be very circumspect and wary, tho' he
doth with utmost diligence study himself,
his heart, and life, yet he doth not know
them; they are secret, <hi>some of them, to him;</hi>
he doth <hi>not know them to be sins;</hi> they seem
lawful unto him, when they are not so; his
ways are right in his own eyes, but not in
God's eyes, which are purer than his; some
of them he doth <hi>not take any notice of:</hi> such
is our foolish incogitancy, that many actions
pass from us, which we do not seriously pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
before we do them, neither do we with
any due deliberation reflect upon them when
done. Again, a man hath other faults open
to him; they stare him in the face, and his
own Conscience doth roundly tell him of
them; but there is a veil of darkness drawn
over them, so that they are <hi>secret to all the
world beside.</hi> Some are such Masters in the
Black-Art, that they can lead a very bad Life,
and yet keep a very good Name. Oh! what
abominations did the <hi>Ancients of the house of
Israel do in the dark!</hi> Ezek. 8. <hi>Every man in the
chambers of his imagery!</hi> Will you be persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to sit down a little, and take a review
of your lives, and consider what iniquities
you commit in the Chambers <hi>of your privacy?</hi>
how many are they, and how great? You
your selves know most of that, tho' I know
nothing. Your own Consciences will tell
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42459:73"/>
you what no body else can; I advise and
beseech you to consult them, and to give
them leave to speak all they have to say;
do not stop their mouths, nor hold the
truth in unrighteousness. And let us now
bring this to the business in hand, and see
if there be not something of weight and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
in the Argument: Have you your
secret Sins, and will you not have your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
Duties? Have you your secret Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
and is it not sit that you should
have your secret Supplications? Will you
not seek his face, where you sin to his face?
Oh! look carefully to it, that as there are
secret Faults, so there be secret Prayers
and Tears; as secret Sins, so secret Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There are special and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous
Causes and Reasons for secret Prayer,
Surely there is not that Man nor Woman to
be found upon the face of the earth, but
hath something or other which he would by
all means have a Mantle of privacy thrown
over; something or other which he may be
free and willing to whisper in the ear of a
prudent intimate Friend, and lock up in his
bosom: but he would not have it divulg'd
and come abroad to the knowledge of every
body. Now let me ask thee, Hast thou no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:42459:74"/>
to speak to God in his ear, something
which thou wouldst not have any person in
the world acquainted with; something, it
may be, that doth greatly oppress thee, and
whilst thou dost smother it altogether in
silence, thy heart is almost broken within
thee? There is an absolute necessity of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
vent, and thereby some ease to thine
over-burden'd mind: and where canst thou
do it with more freedom, and greater hope
of relief, than when thou art alone before
a gracious God, whose mercies are ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting,
and his compassions do not fail?</p>
               <p>Will that, which they call <hi>Common-Prayer,</hi>
r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ach thy <hi>whole Case?</hi> doth it contain in it
all that is in thine heart? dost thou find eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of thy wants mention'd there? every
one of thy groans form'd there? every one
of thy desires drawn up there? is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
singular and peculiar in thy Case?
is it exactly stated by others in all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities
of it? I am sure, the Wise Man
tells us, <hi>Prov. 14. 10. The heart knoweth his
own bitterness, and a stranger intermedleth not
with his joy.</hi> These things are so lock'd up
in the heart of a man, that no body else
hath a key to let him into them. I think it
is most proper for a poor diseased Patient to
tell his Physician how he feels himself: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
if he be so disturbed in his reason, or
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42459:74"/>
so much enfeebled, that he cannot do it,
then it is necessary for some other to do it,
that hath been about him, and curious in his
Observations: but I am of the mind, that
the wise Physician will like that account best,
which comes from his Patient's own mouth,
supposing him capable of giving one. Do
thou go and do so to thy great and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed
Physician, the holy God, and to
that end, study both <hi>his Word</hi> and <hi>thy Heart;</hi>
that by studying his Word, thou maist come
to know how <hi>it should be</hi> with thee; and
by studying thine own heart, thou maist
know how <hi>it is</hi> with thee, and then go and
tell him.</p>
               <p>Again, will <hi>Publick-Prayer</hi> at all times
become thee, and in every one of thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments?
Hast thou so much of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spotted
innocency, or such a large measure
of confidence, as that thou wilt not blush
to tell the whole story of thine heart and
life upon the House-top? Hast thou been so
undefiled in the way, that thou needest not
care who knows what thou hast <hi>been,</hi> and
what thou hast <hi>done?</hi> Indeed, when a
proud and self-conceited <hi>Pharisee</hi> makes it
his business to display his glory, and to
trumpet out his own commendations, to
tell God that he is a <hi>Phoenix,</hi> a kind of <hi>none<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>such</hi>
in the World, one that is so free
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:42459:75"/>
from common defilements, so abundant in
goodness and acts of goodness, that his
fellow is scarce to be met with; it is no
wonder to find him ambitious of having
Auditors enough, and to see him in the
pride of his countenance, and with his hand
by his side, strutting it to the Temple, where
he doth expect a great confluence of people,
who might go and inform others what
great things they had heard concerning him
from his own mouth, and so raise to him
Thousands of admirings among such as
would be credulous, and believe him upon
his bare word: But methinks when a poor
<hi>Publican,</hi> that groans under an heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of sin and guilt, who knoweth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unable to answer for one of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand,
and who hath had often and often
the sentence of death in himself, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by his own awakened and wounded
Conscience; when, I say, he is to draw up
an Indictment against himself, and to read
it in the presence of his righteous Judge,
and then, having so done, to beg upon his
knees, and plead hard for his Life, <hi>Lord be
merciful to me a sinner.</hi> He may stand a great
way off, and get alone by himself as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
ashamed, and even confounded. When
thou goest to acquaint God with thy disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
foul loathsom diseases of Soul, and to
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:42459:75"/>
open thy Artery Sores, and those wounds in
thy Conscience, which as poor <hi>David</hi> found
and owned, stink and are corrupt, it speaks
an humble modesty, and doth highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
thee to do it between him and thee
alone. Now, Christian, give me leave to
deal particularly with thee, and to come as
close as I can, and to propound some few
Questions to thee, and to desire thee to
propound them to thy self when I have
done.</p>
               <p>1. Hast thou not some secret sins to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
to God? Hast thou been all thy
days so sober, and righteous, and godly,
so circumspect and exact, that no action of
thine troubles thee, or will reflect dishho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
upon thee, or in the least put thee out
of countenance? is there no blot in thy
Escutchion, no dead Fly in thy Box of Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
Are there not some things done by
thee which nobody doth know of, and
which thou wouldest not for more than I
will say, have any body know of? Let this
bring thee to Secret Prayer, for <hi>they must be
confest.</hi> Indeed, unless it be in some cases,
thou dost not need to do it unto Men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
there is no necess<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

is an abomination. But a Confession
there must be, else the wound of Conscience
will not be healed, the oppressed Spirit will
not be relieved, the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

out, the Sin will not be pardon'd. The
Promise is, <hi>He that confesseth and forsakes his
sin, shall find mercy;</hi> as much as he needs or
can desire. And the word of Truth gives
us this assurance, <hi>I Iohn</hi> 1. 9. That <hi>if we
confess our sins, God is just and faithful to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
us <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>u sins, and to cleanse us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.</hi>
Blessed be God for those
words, <hi>from all.</hi> Pardoning Mercy, and
Justifying Grace, will make thorow work
where-ever it comes; it takes away iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
transgression and sin, all sorts and sizes,
sins of all kinds and degrees. But where
doth this take place? Only in them that
Confess. Where there is no Confession,
you cannot with reason hope for a Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
Add this, You may very well spread
before God those sins which you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in secret, because <hi>it is not in your power
to hide them from him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> they are all in the light
of his countenance, he understands them
already, for he counts thy steps, and tells
thy wanderings; he knoweth every act of
sin which thou hast done, and every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
with which that act is cloathed.

them in order before thee.</hi> Upon which words,
Reverend Mr. <hi>Dickson</hi> hath this passage,
<hi>Sins forgotten, cast behind the back, and
thrown into confusion by the secure sinner, shall
in the day of God's reckoning be brought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance,
with time, place, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and so presented to the Conscience, as
the sinner shall not be able to look aside from his

And the only way to prevent God's char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
them upon us to our confusion and
everlasting condemnation, is for us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
them unto him with contrition and
self-abhorrency; therefore do you go and<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
do it quickly and fully. Yea further, <hi>it is
your duty, you ought to do it;</hi> for t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

give him glory. Joshua 7. 19. <hi>Ioshua said
unto Achan, My son, Give, I pray thee, glory to the
Lord God of Israel, and make confession unto
him.</hi> Thou didst greatly dishonour him
by thy foul sins, but thou wilt honour him
by thy humble and free confession, as it is
an owning and acknowledgment of his
Omnisciency; there is no need of doing
this openly and before others, unless it be
where the sin is open, and others by it
scandalized. Open and full Confession of
secret sins before Men, is not, or may not
be in all cases safe; it may not be <hi>safe for
others,</hi> because of the bad example; by
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42459:77"/>
which they may be infected; and it may
not be <hi>safe for thy self,</hi> but expose thee to
punishment. To be sure, Men cannot heal
thy Soul, nor wash away thy filthiness, nor
lay the furious storm which is in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
but they may reproach and blemish
thy name, and give such a fatal blow and
wound to thy reputation, as cannot be cured
without a scar, while thou breathest.</p>
               <p>2. Art thou not sensible of base cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
in thy heart? vile Lusts which lurk
and lodge in thy bosome? Are they not
often troublesome and vexatious to thee?
do they not stink in thy Nostrils, when
they stir in thy Soul? and are they not fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
too too powerful and prevalent?
Thou hast oftentimes, perhaps, <hi>horrible and
blasphemous thoughts,</hi> those <hi>fiery Darts of the
Devil</hi> are with a strong hand thrown into
thy mind, and do so startle and affright
thee, that thou art a burthen and terror to
thy self, and even weary of thy Life; at other
times thou hast <hi>filthy, unclean, and lascivious
thoughts,</hi> which would be fitter for a Goat
or Dog than for a reasonable creature, who
should be able to govern and command
himself; and then again, thy mind being
like the raging Sea that cannot rest, but is
continually casting up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ire and dirt; there
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42459:77"/>
appear <hi>cruel, malicious and revengeful thoughts,</hi>
yea, and in thy very Duties, thy most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
solemn attendances upon God, thou
aboundest with <hi>vain, foolish and impertinent
thoughts.</hi> And now, I ask thee, Wouldest
thou have all know what a vile Nature,
and wretched heart thou hast? how that
loathsome dunghill is sending forth its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>savory
smells? what a filthy scum is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
rising up? and what vermin over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spreads
and covers the face of thy Soul,
which should have <hi>the beauty of the Lord its
God upon it?</hi> No, no, I am persuaded, thou
wouldest not have thy dearest Friend privy
to all this for a World; if others should
know that by thee, which thou doest know
by thy self, thou wouldest be ashamed to
shew thy head: Let this then drive thee to
thy Secret Prayer. A Person that labours
under the Foul Disease, and desires a Cure,
will go in private and acquaint his Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
whose silence he dares promise him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
God is the great and only Physician
of Souls, go and tell him thy Case, who
hath graciously and faithfully promised that
he will not tell again, but so <hi>pardon</hi> as to
<hi>cover.</hi> To this purpose, read what himself
hath said and given us under his hand,
Ezek. 33. 16. <hi>If the wicked turn from his sin,
and do that which is lawful and right, none of
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42459:78"/>
his sins that he hath committed shall be mentioned
to him.</hi> They shall not be <hi>charged</hi> upon him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
had it been said so, it would have been an
admirable mercy; but that is not all, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Mercy doth not stop there, they shall
<hi>not be mentioned,</hi> but buried in Eternal Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion,
and carried into the Land of forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.
As they shall not be charged upon
him to his <hi>condemnation,</hi> so they shall not be
mentioned to his <hi>reproach.</hi> God will take
care not only of his Peoples <hi>souls,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
of their <hi>names.</hi> James 5. 11. <hi>Ye have
heard of the patience of Iob.</hi> Yes, and we have
heard of the passions of <hi>Iob,</hi> his cursing the
day of his birth; but hold, not a word of that
it now is as if it had never been.</p>
               <p>3. Let me propound to you one Question
further; Hast thou nothing to ask of God?
is there not some secret boon and kindness
which thy heart carrieth thee out to the
desiring of at the hands of God? such a
<hi>scruple</hi> in thy Conscience, which puts thee
to pain, and wouldest gladly have taken
out, but canst not by all thy study and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
remove: and such a <hi>blot</hi> in thine
evidence for thy being in a state of grace,
and having a title to the glory and happiness
of the other World, which puts thee to a
stand, so that thou canst not read on, nor
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42459:78"/>
make any thing of it to thy comfort and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction?
this thou would not have others
know, but desirest a deliverance from Thou
hast such a <hi>good purpose and excellent design</hi> in
thy head, which thou knowest not how to
communicate, yet thou wouldest be directed,
assisted and prospered in. Thou hast, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<hi>a yoke-fellow,</hi> that is a Son of <hi>Belial,</hi>
doth not know the duty of his place; or
though he knows it, he will not do it; but
is a thorn in thy side, and makest thee go
mourning all the day; and thou lovest him
so well, and art so tender of his reputation,
that thou wilt not tell the dearest Friend
thou hast of it; and I commend thy pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and affection, bear it as long and as
well as ever thou canst; but thou mayst do
both him and thy self a singular kindness by
telling thy God of it. Thou hast an <hi>unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and disobedient Child,</hi> who came out of
thine own Bowels, and whom thou lovest
as thy own Soul, but he neither fears God,
nor reverenceth man; he is so far from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
the good counsel thou givest him,
that he will not so much as hear it; thou
canst not think of him without breathing a
sigh, scarce see him without dropping a tear,
and thy Soul doth even break with the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
it hath to see him another man, a new
man, convinced, converted, sanctified,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42459:79"/>
turned from his disobedience to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of the just, and brought over from the
power of Satan to God; thou wouldst have
more of the love and kindness of such an
one as thou art nearly related to, or hast great
dependence upon: These things, and, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly,
twenty more, which may be reckoned
up, are very much the matter of thy desire,
and all of them are within the reach of the
Divine Power: that <hi>God who performed all
things for</hi> David, is able to perform all these
things for thee: and if thou wouldest not
willingly have others acquainted with these
things, if thou art loath that thy Family
should be privy to the stirrings and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of thy heart in these respects, then let
them bring thee upon thy knees in thy secret
Retirements: there thou mayst be bold,
and as free as thou pleasest; there thou
mayst fully open thy case, and unbosome
thy self, and tell God all that is in thine
heart, and keep back nothing: after the
manner of holy <hi>David,</hi> who could say in
<hi>Psal. 38. 9. All my desire is before thee, and
my groaning is not hid from thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The pleasantness of the work is
enough to attract and draw an holy Soul to
the performance of it. Secret Prayer brings
the Christian into secret Communion with
God, and secret Communion is a sweet
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42459:79"/>
Communion, as that person tastes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences,
who loves God indeed. Two
Lovers have abundantly more delight and
satisfaction in each other's company, when
they are got in a corner, and no body to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt
or observe them, than when they
are in a croud and throng of People, or in
a room, where many eyes are upon them;
for there they cannot be so familiar and free,
as their mutual affection doth require. We
have free leave given us, yea, we are under
a Divine Command, <hi>to come to the throne of
grace with holdness,</hi> Heb. 4. 16. with a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of speech, to fetch up the bottom of
our hearts, and tell our whole minds to
God; but when the Saints go in company,
many times he that is called out to be at
that time the mouth of the rest to God,
finds himself confin'd and bound up by a
natural and over-powering modesty, and
his Christian Child-like boldness is abated,
nay, wholly to seek; and he is at such a
great loss, and so exceedingly <hi>troubled that
he cannot speak,</hi> that I may use the words of
that holy man <hi>Asaph,</hi> Psal. 73. His freedom
is turned into oppression, and he is so full
of matter, that his heart is almost ready to
break within him, because at that time he
knoweth not how to give himself vent: in
such a case there is an awe upon him, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42459:80"/>
that doth issue in a painful restraint. Oh
Christians, if you could hear some gracious
Souls in their private Addresses to God, it
would put you into an amazement, you
could not forbear standing and wondering
how bold they are with God, though not
saucy; how familiarly they will speak to
God, yet know and consider their distance;
how plain they will be, how earnest and
importunate, how they will plead with him,
and produce their Arguments and strong
Reasons, and with vehemency urge them,
wrestling with him, as those that must have
their Petitions granted, and will too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they have done; and yet they do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
that which they have learned from above,
and use those words which the Holy Ghost
teacheth, who speaks in them: they do not
herein forget themselves, or take too much
upon them; nor are they more bold than wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
when they have raised and enlarged
their desires, and wound up their importunity
to the highest pitch; they do no more than
what they have their kind and gracious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
allowance for, and then are their
Prayers his Musick. And when they have
done thus, who but themselves, and such
as have taken the same course, are able to
tell or conceive the fruit and advantage
which thereby cometh into them? when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42459:80"/>
their Souls have had so large a vent, what
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>

but such as passeth understanding! how do
their Faces shine, even as that of <hi>Moses</hi> did
when he came down from the Mount?
what delights have they had, what joys of
Faith, what a satisfaction do they find
within. This is no more than what holy
<hi>David</hi> did with highest confidence promise
unto himself; and I do not in the least que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
but he was encouraged to promise so
much to himself for the future, by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences
he had had in former times, <hi>Psal.
63. 5, 6. My soul,</hi> saith he, <hi>shall be satisfied
as with marrow and fatness;</hi> He looked not
only for a little taste, a drop of mercy, or
some crumbs of comfort, so much only as
would set him a longing, or keep life and
soul together, but a full meal. He promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
himself <hi>the best,</hi> not brown-bread and
water, ordinary course fare; but <hi>marrow and
fatness;</hi> yea, and <hi>enough</hi> too, a fulness,
so that he should not rise up complaining, but
admiring and triumphing; <hi>my mouth shall
praise thee with joyful lips:</hi> when he had his
sweet refreshing, his fill, then he would
bless his Benefactor. But I desire you to
take notice of the time when, and the place
where, he did promise himself these rich
and comfortable Enjoyments, it was in his
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:42459:81"/>
retirements, in his secret converses with
God. <hi>When I remember thee upon my bed, and
meditate upon thee in the night-watches.</hi> Upon
which words Mr. <hi>Dickson</hi> hath this Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
very apposite to the business in hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The way to find refreshment spiritual,
is, beside publick Ordinances, to give our
selves to spiritual Exercises in secret, at
such times as our civil and natural necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
may best spare, and then and there to
recall to mind what we have heard, seen
or felt of God's Word or Working, and
to keep our thoughts upon this holy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
by Prayer, Soliloquy, and Meditation.</q>
This, this brings in spiritual refreshment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
this warms the heart, this feasts it,
this delights it, this raiseth it, this furnishes
it with new Songs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Secret Prayer shall not be vain.
Our Lord Jesus doth not only walk in the
midst of the Golden Candlesticks, in the
great Congregations, in the full Assemblies
of his Saints; thou indeed the Prophet
tell us, <hi>Psal. 87. 2. The Lord loveth the gates
of Zion,</hi> i. e. saith <hi>Ainsworth,</hi> the publick As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies,
<hi>more than all the dwellings of Iacob:</hi>
but<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> he will graciously condescend so far as
to afford his presence, and give a meeting
to <hi>two or three of his friends</hi> when met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:42459:81"/>
in his Name; there he will be in the
midst of them. You have Christ's own word
for your assurance in the Case, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.
20. as to assist, so to accept, and bless, and
do for them the good things which they
desire; yea, his Grace is so infinite, and his
Love so great, that his condescention shall
be lower yet; for he will come into a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
when he has a Child of his alone pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and crying. <hi>Cantic. 2. 14. O my Dove,
that art in the clefts of the rocks, and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
places of the stairs; let me see thy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy
voice, and thy countenance is comely.</hi> When she
is most retired and absconded, Christ loves
both to see her and hear her; tho' she be
Sun-burnt with Persecution, and sooted
with Infirmities, yet her Countenance is
comely in the eye of Christ, because there he
seeth his own and his Father's Image; and
tho' her Prayers be broken, and as the chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terings
of a <hi>Crane;</hi> yet the voice is sweet in
the ear of Christ, because it is the language
of his own Spirit. And although our Lord
spake this to his Spouse the Church, yet it
may be applied to particular Christians, who
are Parts and Members of the Church, and
may take the comfort of it to themselves.
When <hi>Elijah</hi> was, as you heard, and we
noted before, under the Juniper-Tree, God
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:42459:82"/>
was pleased to come and join himself to him,
and would have from his own mouth an
account of his Case, and the reason of his
withdrawing himself, <hi>What dost thou here,
Elijah?</hi> what was it that brought thee
hither? and what is it that thou wouldst
have of me? Know, O holy Soul, thou
standest in the same relation to God, and
hast the same interest in him, and maist pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
thy self the same kindness; God will
not think it too much for his Majesty to
come to thee alone when desired, and when
he comes, to bring with him a blessing for
thee: though thou takest none here to back
thee, hast not a Friend on Earth to join in
the Suit, yet do thou go and state thine own
case, draw up thy Petition, and present it
unto God with an hand of faith, setting the
name of Christ to it, and God will present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
add his <hi>fiat,</hi> his Amen; though it may be
the answer shall not presently be given in to
thee, yet the grant shall be past in Heaven,
thy Father will say, <hi>Be it unto this soul even as
it will.</hi> Nay, he will not only give the
thing, if it be good for thee, but more too:
and while thou askest like a Child, he will
answer thee like a God.</p>
               <p>A most gracious assurance hereof you
have in the words of the Text from the
mouth of Jesus Christ himself, who is the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:42459:82"/>
faithful and true witness; <hi>Thy father which
seeth in secre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>â€¢</desc>
                     </gap>, shall reward thee openly.</hi> He
sees the sincerity of thy heart, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of thy desires; he seeth how
thou labourest at the Oar, and what pains
thou hast taken, and with what great wrest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
thou hast wrestled; and having seen,
<hi>he will reward;</hi> the work is done, and the
reward is to come. So then, if thou wilt
believe Christ, thou shalt not lose thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
thou shalt not have pangs and throws
of Soul, and after all bring forth nothing
but wind; never did any one Holy Prayer
fall short of Heaven, and drop by the way;
the great God is not wont to set his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
about any unprofitable work. <hi>Paul,</hi>
I am sure, was of that mind, when he said
in 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. last, <hi>Be stedfast, immovable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing
that your labour shall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi>
As their grievous sufferings turn them to a
very good account, so shall all their holy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
There is never an appointment of duty
for them, but it carrieth in its Bowels a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of Mercy. <hi>He saith not to the seed of
Iacob, seek ye my face in vain;</hi> the <hi>preparing</hi>
and engaging of their hearts to pray, speaks
his readiness and resolution to <hi>incline his ear</hi>
to hear. When he bids them <hi>open their
mouths,</hi> it is that he might <hi>fill them;</hi> He
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:42459:83"/>
would not have them give a <hi>knock</hi> at his
door to no purpose; but hath promised
when they do, it shall be <hi>opened to them;</hi> and
when he opens his <hi>door,</hi> he will open his
<hi>heart and hand too,</hi> and not send them away
empty. When he bids them <hi>seek,</hi> it is
in order to their <hi>finding;</hi> and that which
they find, shall be worth their while, and
pay them for all the pains they took; to be
sure they shall not have cause to complain,
as those that sit down losers, and have a
disappointment of their expectations. Nay,
further, our Saviour tell us, that he will
reward us <hi>openly.</hi> He will not be ashamed
that the World should see how he useth his
Servants, they shall see there is a reward
for the Righteous; and though the <hi>Devil</hi>
was a Fool in going about to charge rotten
sordid designs, and a mercenary selfishness
upon <hi>Iob,</hi> yet he himself was forced to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg,
that <hi>Iob did not serve God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>
nought.</hi> He will reward thee openly, both
here and hereafter, before Angels and Men<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
as you have compassed his Altar with your
Supplications, so will he compass you about
with Favour and with Songs; he will
make it manifest, he will convince his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
a foolish, wicked and ungrateful
World, <hi>of all the hard speeches which they had
spoken against him,</hi> they themselves shall see it
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:42459:83"/>
false, That it is a vain thing to serve God;
he will by his liberal rewards given them,
extort from them this acknowledgment,
That the <hi>Lord is good to them that wait upon
him, and to the soul that seeks him;</hi> especially
it shall be thus at the last and great day,
which will be the day of recompences, the
day in which <hi>God will make up his Iewels,</hi>
and set them, not in <hi>Gold,</hi> but in <hi>Glory.
Then,</hi> as you have it in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 18. yea,
<hi>then,</hi> indeed, <hi>shall ye discern between the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
and the wicked; betweem him that serveth
God, and him that serveth him not;</hi> between
him that seeketh God, and him that seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
him not; between him that prayeth,
and him that prayeth not. Then there
shall be an apparent and manifest difference;
the stone-blind World, those that are wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly,
wilfully blind, shall see it to their vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
and torment.</p>
               <p>These are the motives by which I did
design, and do hope to work upon your
hearts, these the Silken Cords of a Man,
the Rational Arguments, with which I
would allu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

chearful performance of this excellent,
necessary and Soul-chearing, Soul-fattening
Duty of Secret-Prayer; and oh that I might
hear you have been wrought upon by them,
and prevailed with. Now, that you might
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42459:84"/>
do this work well, and not fail as to the
right management of it, and so not miss
and fall short of those singular benefits and
advantages which come by it, I shall afford
you what assistance I judge needful in the
case, and in silence passing over those Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
which refer to Prayer in general, I shall
give you up some that do particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
and relate to Secret-Prayer, they are
these: I beseech you mind and Practise
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Make thy secret approaches to
God with the greatest solemnity of Spirit
that thou canst; though thou goest in the
<hi>multitude of mercies,</hi> and with <hi>faith in Christ,</hi>
and with <hi>hope of finding Grace,</hi> yet be sure
that <hi>in his fear</hi> thou worship toward his

                     </gap>umility and reverence in thy carriage and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment,</hi>
as if thou hadst the eyes of all the
World upon thee; though thou mayest in
thy retirements be more <hi>free and open, in</hi>
giving an account of thy self and thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
thy burthens, wants and desires,
because <hi>no body sees</hi> thee; yet thou must not
be <hi>rude, unmannerly, and sawcy,</hi> because <hi>God
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:42459:84"/>
sees thee.</hi> When thou art in a <hi>Corner,</hi> God
is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> upon a Throne of Glory, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by innumerable Angles, who in his
presence cover their Faces with their Wings,
as knowing their distance, their inability
and unworthiness to behold him. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
thou hast to do with <hi>Majesty,</hi> yea,
with an Infinite and Glorious Majesty;
and <hi>Shall not his excellency make you afraid?
and his dread fall upon you?</hi> Job 13. 11.
And, indeed, then are we most excellent,
when we do most fear God's Excellency.
<hi>David</hi> began <hi>Psalm</hi> 8. with the admiration
of God's Excellency, <hi>O Lord, our Lord, how
excellent is thy name in all the earth!</hi> And then
in the same <hi>Psalm</hi> he fell to humbling and
vilifying thoughts and expressions of Man.
<hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him?
and the son of man that thou visitest him?
Abraham</hi> was the Father of the faithful,
and the Friend of God; yet how low was
he in his own eyes, and how much fill'd
with an awe of God, when he alone stood
before him<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> pleading for wicked <hi>Sodom?</hi>
Observe how he carried, and what he said,
Genesis 18. 27. <hi>Behold now, I have taken up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust
and ashes.</hi> And <hi>vers. 30. O let not the Lord
be angry, and I will speak.</hi> And yet again,
<hi>verse 32. O let not the Lord be angry; and I
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:42459:85"/>
will speak yet but this once.</hi> By all this you
see, how much he was afraid of offending
God; and this is that which God expects
from his creatures, yea, from his dearest
Children; he stands upon his honour, and
looks to be treated like himself. <hi>Levit. 10. 3.
Moses said unto Aaron, This is that the Lord
spake, I will be sanctified in all them that come
nigh me. See then that you have grace to serve
him with reverence and godly fear, as knowing
that your God is a consuming fire,</hi> Heb. 12. 28,
29. <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> found him so, when
destroyed by fire that came from his presence
upon their not observing his order in matter
of worship; they brought with them <hi>strange</hi>
fire, and met with <hi>devouring</hi> fire. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
do you fear before him when you pray
to him; and though no-body be by, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
and consider that God is by, as to
hear your Prayers, so curiously to observe
both the frame of your spirits, and the
manner of your deportments before him;
as he is of pitiful eyes, so of pure and
piercing eyes, which cannot indure to
behold iniquity, and from which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be hid; all is naked and
open before him with whom you have
to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:42459:85"/>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> When thou settest about the
work of Secret-Prayer, study and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
secrecy to the utmost, and be as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
as ever thou canst; do not tell others
the business thou art taking in hand; What
though none know of it, let it be enough
for thee that thy Father doth, for that is
enough; he alone is sufficient to be thy
witness, and to do for thee all that thou
desirest. Never go to it with a design,
nor in such manner that others may take
notice of it for thy commendation. A
Christian, indeed, may do Alms, and pray
so as to be taken notice of, and let his light
shine before Men in order <hi>to the alluring of
others, and drawing them to the like acts of piety
and charity:</hi> But to give others, by any
means, an item of our private Duties, in
order <hi>to our own applause,</hi> that we might have
praise with Men, and be by them accounted
in the number of serious, strict and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Christians, is too <hi>low a pitch</hi> for the
Children of God to fly, it is <hi>Pharisaically</hi>
wicked and abominable. And sure I am,
you your selves will find it true at the last,
That a <hi>name</hi> thus obtained, will not <hi>pay the
charge,</hi> but cost you a great deal more than
it is worth. It is far better for us to <hi>take
care of our duty,</hi> and leave it to God to <hi>take
care of our names.</hi> If we can please God,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42459:86"/>
and get to Heaven, we shall be glad to be
there, though no-body knew all the steps
we took in the way thither. When thou
art in the work, and warm at it, when the
Fire burns, <hi>speak with thy tongue,</hi> it is thy
<hi>friend</hi> in Prayer, and thy <hi>glory</hi> in Praises;
but command it to keep a due <hi>decorum;</hi>
be not <hi>so loud</hi> that others may hear; do
not, like some, make the <hi>street ring;</hi> I rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
grant that the lifting up of the voice
is sometimes the <hi>effect of an oppressed spirit,</hi>
whom speaking will not serve; there must
be crying, and that aloud; sometimes it is
the <hi>effect of a soul fir'd and inflam'd</hi> with
holy longings; and it may be allowed to
be an <hi>help to the raising up of the spirit and
affections:</hi> Only when thou dost make use
of it, get as far as thou canst out of the
hearing of others, that thou mayest <hi>not be
as the hypocrites are.</hi> If thou hast not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency
for that, neither within doors
nor without, then go to God as he came
to <hi>Elijah,</hi> in a <hi>soft and still voice.</hi> Thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
can <hi>hear thy whispers,</hi> for thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
speakest in his ear; yea, more,
Romans 8. 27. <hi>He that searcheth the heart,
knoweth what is the mind of the spirit.</hi>
He had in the Verse before, spoken of <hi>groans
that could not be utter'd;</hi> desires that are in
the Soul which it knoweth not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press;
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:42459:86"/>
but though thou canst utter nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sighs, nor groans, nor words, God
knoweth your minds, what your spirits are
working out after: when you say nothing,
he can tell what you would have: <hi>All my
desire is before thee.</hi> He understands the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of thy <hi>sighs,</hi> yea thy very <hi>tears</hi> are to
him articulate, when he doth not hear the
words of thy mouth. We do not find that
Woman said any thing who washed Christ's
Feet with her tears, and wiped them with
the hairs of her head; but in those tears
and actions Christ saw love and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<hi>much is forgiven her, therefore she loveth
much;</hi> yea he doth know what you have a
mind to, by your very <hi>looks.</hi> Hence it was
that when the floods compassed <hi>Ionah</hi> about,
and all the billows and waves passed over
him, and he looked upon himself as being
in a perishing condition, he resolved upon
giving God a look, before he was quite lost;
<hi>Ionah 2. 4. Then I said, I am cast out of thy
sight, yet I will look again toward thy holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple:</hi>
and that look saved him, Verse 6.
<hi>Thou hast brought up my life from corruption, O
Lord my God.</hi> He looks <hi>pitifully</hi> up to God,
and God looks <hi>graciously</hi> down upon him:
do thou so act the <hi>Saint,</hi> as carefully to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void
every thing of the <hi>Pharisee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:42459:87"/>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> When thou art <hi>alone</hi> in prayer,
make it thy great desire and care to be with
God. In all thy approaches <hi>to</hi> him, and in
all thine appearances <hi>before</hi> him, make sure
that thou be <hi>with</hi> him. The <hi>Psalmist</hi> could
say, <hi>Psal. 139. 18. When I awake, I am still
with thee:</hi> this some understand of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy
of God's kindness. <q>Though the
most vigilant of the Saints sometimes fall
into sleepiness and drowsiness of spirit,
that they perceive not God's presence with
them, nor care over them, nor love to
them; yet when the Lord awakeneth up
their Souls, and reneweth their spiritual
senses, they are made to see and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the Lord doth never leave
them, no, not when they least perceive his
presence.</q> But others do by this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the gracious frame and workings of
<hi>David</hi>'s Spirit. He was every morning with
God; as soon as ever he opened his eyes, he
directed them to God. God was the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
and endeared Object that he would
first converse with, and bestow his morning
visit upon. I am still with thee by meditation.
Oh that thou couldest say the same in truth
as to this duty of Prayer. Lord, when I
am at prayer, I am still with thee. I am
often upon my knees, and I am as often
with my God; I <hi>Iohn 1. 3. That which we
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:42459:87"/>
have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye
also may have fellowship with us; and truly our
fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son
Iesus Christ.</hi> Do you press after that, a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship
with God: do you enquire for that,
as <hi>Elisha</hi> when he had got the Mantle which
his Master had dropt, he cried out, <hi>Where is
the Lord God of</hi> Elijah? so do you: here is
the Prayer, but where is the fellowship?
Truly that Person is both wickedly and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serably
alone in his duty, who is not with
God in duty. He sins greatly in it, and he
shall get nothing by it. That is an accursed
privacy out of which the great and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blessed
God is excluded. He is indeed <hi>with
thee</hi> in all places, in thy greatest retirements;
<hi>Psal. 139. 8. If I ascend up into Heaven, thou art
there; if I make my bed in Hell, thou art there.</hi>
So, if thou art in the Congregation, God
is there; if in the Chamber, God is there;
if in the Field, God is there. He fills
all places, and he takes notice of all persons,
and of all their Actions; but that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough;
no gracious Soul that doth indeed
love him, will sit down satisfied with that.
While God is with thee by his Omnipresence
observing thee, and all thy ways; what du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
thou dost, and how thou dost them; it
must be thy great care to be <hi>with God</hi> in a
way of holy meditation and affection: to
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:42459:88"/>
have the <hi>thoughts</hi> dwelling with God, the
<hi>desires</hi> running out to God, and the <hi>delights</hi>
feasting upon God. Have a care, that when
you pretend to be alone in your duty, you
do not lay the reins upon your necks, and
allow your minds in their loose and vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>ursions.
Christian, go to thy duty, and
go to thy God too<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> So that good man wisely
resolved; <hi>Psal. 43. 3, 4. O send out thy light
and truth, let them lead me, let them bring me
unto thy hill, and to thy tabernacles; then will I
go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding
joy.</hi> He would not stop at the Altar, but
get up to the God who was worshipped
there: and when thou art with him, keep
with him, as close as thou canst: let no
temptation draw thee away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whensoever thou art in secret
before God, reveal all thy secrets to him:
deal plainly and openly with him; anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mize
thy Soul in his presence; tell him all
that is in thine heart, and all that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrest
hath been in thy life; and do not
hide any thing from him: whatsoever thine
own Conscience preacheth to thee, do
thou go and repeat it all to God: confess
to him those evil Actions thou didst in a
corner, and under the covert of darkness,
though no mortal eye saw them, nor can
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:42459:88"/>
any body charge thee with them. The
keeping back of part of thy sins, may be thy
ruine, as well as keeping back part of the
price of the Land, and covering the fraud
with a lie, was the death of <hi>Ananias</hi> and
<hi>Sapphira.</hi> Acknowledge to him those heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptions
which did never come into act;
the law in the members that warreth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the law in your mind; the sin that
dwelleth in you; that cursed root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which lieth under ground: the vicious
fountain that is continually boiling and bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
up in filthy thoughts and vile affections,
though it never sent forth such muddy and
abominable streams as run in an impetuous
and rapid manner in the lives of others,
overflowing all the banks that Religion and
Reason do set them. In a word, Do
thou thy self acquaint God with the plague
of thine heart, which threatens the life of
thy Soul, though there be no spots to be
seen by others upon thee, though it doth not
shew it self in botches and boils. I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
told you, that though you need not
let men know, not your dearest, intimate
and most faithful Friends know all that you
are chargeable with; yet you are bound to do
so to God, and it is indeed no other than a
giving of him the glory of his Omniscience,
and (if you do it as you ought in a belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42459:89"/>
way) the glory of his Mercy and
Goodness too, as being a God ready to
forgive and multiply pardons. Besides, as
I have said, it is in vain to hide any thing
from him; because he seeth all, searcheth
the hearts; possesseth the reins, and hath
our most secret sins in the light of his
countenance; <hi>He that covers his sins, shall not
prosper;</hi> not in that action: when men go
to eover, God will come to discover. <hi>Adam</hi>
having sinned, went like a guilty Malefactor
to hide himself, but God knew where he was,
and fetcht him out with a word. <hi>Achan</hi> having
stoln the wedge of Gold, and two hundred
pieces of Silver, and a goodly Babylonish
Garment, went and hid them in the earth
in the midst of his Tent, but God made
him fetch them out again. When all is
done, plain-dealing is best, specially when
you have to deal with God. And let me
here add, That freedom and openness of
heart in a way of humble confession unto
God, is a very good argument of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
frame of heart, and speaks a person
acted by an ingenuous filial spirit, that he
is no friend to sin, no admirer of himself,
but willing to load himself, that so he might
the more loath himself, and work his heart
into the greater admirings of <hi>that patience</hi>
which, notwithstanding so many affronts,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:42459:89"/>
hath so long born with him; and <hi>that grace,</hi>
which, notwithstanding so great provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
doth yet open to him a door of hope.
And take one thing with you further: this
freedom and openness of heart in confessing
your sins to God, is a singular and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
way (mingling with it faith in Christ)
to provide for your own peace and comfort:
when you do humbly and freely load your
selves with the acknowledgment of the sins
you are guilty of, you may find them
lie more light upon you Consciences:
when you bind them upon your selves, you
may find God loosing them, and taking
them off by the assurance of a gracious and
full pardon. Till <hi>David</hi> came to this, poor
man, he was in a most dismal condition;
<hi>Psal. 32. 3. While he kept silence, his bones
waxed old through his roaring all the day:</hi>
he kept silence, <hi>i. e.</hi> he did not confess sin;
and then he was fain to spend all his time
in roaring, because of the torment and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
which he felt; and so long as he did
not carry toward God in a way of ingenuity,
God carried toward him in a way of severity.
Vers. 24. <hi>Day and night thy hand was heavy
upon me; my moisture is turned into the drought
of Summer.</hi> He was sunk under the weight of
that hand, and broken almost to shivers,
and dried up like a potsherd. But now see
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:42459:90"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ1 page duplicateã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:42459:90"/>
                  <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:42459:91"/>
what a comfortable change was wrought,
and how God appeared to his joy, when he
brake off that sinful silence, yea, as soon as
he took up a resolution of doing it! Ver. 5.
<hi>I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
have I not hid: I said, I will confess my
transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgavest
the iniquity of my sin.</hi> So then, this is the way,
to remove Judgements, to pacifie the wrath
and displeasure of God, to quiet the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,
to recover the sense of Divine Favour,
and to get for broken bones, the joy of God's
Salvation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> When thou art in secret, keep a
strict watch over thy self: Watch over both
thy Body and Soul; watch <hi>over thy body,</hi> that
it may not sleep, as the Disciples did very
unseasonably, when they had the greatest
reason to keep awake. You know what our
Saviour said, That <hi>the body is weak where the
spirit is willing.</hi> It is a great sin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a great shame for people, (yea, such as
profess godliness) when they are about the
Work and Service of God in these Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies,
hearing and praying, to sleep away so
much of that precious time as they do, as if
these things were none of their business, and
they were not at all concerned in it. Sure I
am, this is not to sit here as God's People
sitteth; this is no sign of a serious Christ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:42459:91"/>
coming to hear for Life, and to pray
for Life, and working out Salvation with
fear and trembling; and yet they sleep
in the midst of Observers, when they have
some on all sides to give them an awakening
jog; and I desire you to make conscience of
doing it, it is an act of Duty and of Love;
it is a friendly jog, and the party to whom
you give it, is obliged to take it thankfully at
your hands as a kindness: He doth not
know how much he may lose by a little
Nap; some precious Truth may then be
spoken and passed, in which he was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
concerned, and by which he might have
been greatly benefited; but it is gone and
lost as to him, he slept it away. But when
thou art all alone, thou hast none by to do
that friendly Office, to bestow a jog upon
thee, then thou must do all the work thy
self, and look to thy self; therefore thou
shouldst be the more thine own Friend, and
take the more care and pains. And also
<hi>watch thy Soul,</hi> thine heart; keep it, as thou
art commanded, with all diligence: And as
<hi>Deborah</hi> said to her self when she was in the
midst of her work, <hi>Iudges 5. 12. Awake,
awake, Debroah; awake, awake, utter a Song;</hi>
so do you call upon your selves in your
Duties, Awake, awake, O my Soul; awake,
awake, lift up a Prayer: Thou hast now
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:42459:92"/>
wrestling-work in hand, do not be dull,
heavy, and lazy at it; watch thine heart,
for it needs it; and two things in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
it is very subject to, <hi>wandrings and cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;</hi>
the heart of man is <hi>a wandering heart<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi>
will not keep its way, nor dwell upon its
proper Object. <hi>David</hi> could say, <hi>My heart is
fixed, O God, my heart is fixed:</hi> But could he
say so always? or canst thou? No, tho' it
is fixed in its choice of God, in its affection
to him, in its resolution for him; yet it
hath not that fixation of thoughts and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
upon him, nor that fixedness of
fellowship and communion with him, which
should be. Thou thinkest thou carriest thy
heart with thee to thy duty; but dost thou
not often find it hath given thee the slip,
and is gone before thou hast done? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
look to it, keep thine eye upon it,
that it may keep its place, and to its
business. But then again, the heart of
man hath its <hi>coolings,</hi> as well as its <hi>wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings:</hi>
As it should keep its <hi>way,</hi> so it should
carefully keep its <hi>heat.</hi> Be much, therefore,
and frequent in stirring up thy self, when
thou goest by thy self, to take hold of God;
beware of all deadness and dulness, when
thou art going to serve a living God. When
fire-brands are together, they will help one
another, and burn to the last: but he that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42459:92"/>
would keep a single one alive, had need to
tend it carefully, and be often blowing it,
yea, and adding some fewel too. Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is as great and necessary a Duty, as any
the Christian hath to do; he must watch
<hi>unto Prayer;</hi> that he may not go about it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonably,
that he may not lose a fit op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
but set up his sail as soon as the
wind blows, and that he also might make
use of all advantages for the tuning of his
instrument, and getting his heart into a right
frame; and he must watch likewise in <hi>prayer:</hi>
that when he is at the work, he may not
idle in it, and so lose his duty by losing
himself, for want of looking to. Alas,
what is Prayer without the heart, unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to man, abominable to God: it is like
a Carcase, when the Soul hath once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
it, a stinking and offensive thing;
who would make a Present of it to a great
King?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sixthly,</hi> When thou art upon thy knees,
engaged in secret Prayer unto God, be sure
that thou double thy diligence, and put thy
strength forth to the utmost. When a great
many are lifting at an heary weight, every
one may spare himself, and put forth the
less strength, because there is such a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
to assist: but when there is no more
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42459:93"/>
than one single person tugging at it, he
had need strain and labour hard, else he
must leave it where, and as he found it.
When we are joined together with others in
Prayer, when with a Church of Christ, an
Assembly of Saints, there is a number of
Supplicants, a great many besieging the
Throne of Grace, wrestling with God, and
pulling down the Blessings which are desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
and then we may speak in the same
manner as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Psal. 7. 6, 7. Arise,
O Lord, in thine anger, lift up thy self, because
of the rage of mine enemies: awake for me, to
the judgment which thou hast commanded; so
shall the congragation of the people compass thee
about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰</desc>
                     </gap> for their sakes therefore return thou on
high.</hi> Yea, when there is a Congregation
of God's People compassing him about, we
may say, Lord, for their sakes shew thy
self, be exalted in thy strength and in thy
goodness and mercy. Yet know, this is no
Argument why any one single Member of
that Church or Congregation should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss,
and abate of his zeal and endeavours;
for we are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>ã€ˆ in non-Latin alphabet ã€‰</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 30. When
we <hi>are together</hi> in Prayer, we must <hi>strive toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Prayer;</hi> the word is very emphatical.
When we are together, we must not be in
Prayer only, but in an agony too; we
must not only <hi>seek</hi> Mercy, but <hi>strive</hi> for it;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42459:93"/>
strive mightily, as Wrestlers do, and Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions
in the field: It is, saith <hi>Beza,</hi> a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor
taken from Military Affairs, and signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
such fervency and zeal as is used in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Life and Death; there must be a lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
hold on God's strength, and a putting
forth of ours, an acting to the utmost. Tho
we are together, and that a great number
together, yet we must every one strive,
else it would be our shame; as in a School, if
all the Boys are studying and conning their
Lessons, any one should not mind it, but be
toying and loitering; or as in a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
many should be labouring hard till
the sweat run off their faces; but in the
midst of that industrious Company, there
should be one sleeping, and there another
trifling: and also it will be to your loss;
for tho the Church may obtain a gracious
Answer, and prevail for a Blessing, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
themselves in the goodness of the Lord;
yet the lazy, lukewarm Christian, who did
nothing, or at best out of an indifferency of
Spirit, will, an hundred to one, fall short,
and miss of a share, being one of those fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish
slothful seekers, that are not able: And
while a <hi>Iacob,</hi> after his wrestling, is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and rewarded, hath his Name changed,
to his honour, from weak <hi>Iacob,</hi> to mighty
<hi>Israel;</hi> from <hi>Iacob</hi> a Worm, to <hi>Israel</hi> a
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42459:94"/>
Prince with God. While resolved and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate
Souls are most graciously smil'd
upon, and sent away, as the Woman of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>
was, with their desires fulfilled, and
their joys running over; <hi>Be it to you even as
you will; I can, I will deny you nothing:</hi> thou
maist be sent away with a severe rebuke from
God: <hi>Thou wicked and slothful servant.</hi> And
what shall I say, with a flea in thine ear? no,
no, with a sting in thy Conscience. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
now if there be such joint endeavours re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
such utmost striving when you go
before God with your united forces, surely
there is no reason why you should be cold
and freeze, why you should trifle and be
careless when you are alone, and in secret
with God; No, no, then it doth nearly
concern you to summon all the powers of
your Souls, to muster all your forces, and
to put all your affections into a lively and
fervant frame, and every grace to its post
and business. Being you have to do all your
work your selves, get as much strength
from Heaven as you can, and employ all
you get: whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,
thine own single hand, be sure that thou do
it with all thy might. Christians, you must
seek mercy diligently, if you would be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesful
in your seeking.</p>

                  <hi>Seventhly<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi> Let not thy secret Prayer shut
Prayer out of thy Family; do not make use
of that performance as a sufficient excuse for
this neglect and omission, neither think to
stop the mouth of conscience now, with
that which will not pass for a good plea
when thou shalt come to appear before the
Tribunal of an holy God. It is indeed thy
duty to pray alone; and if thou dost do it,
thou doest well; yet thou must not only
pray alone, but with others also; yea, this is
an indispensible duty, incumbent upon you
who are Governours of Families; you should
see to it, that your Houses be Churches, not
<hi>Bethavens,</hi> Houses of vanity, but <hi>Bethels,</hi>
the Houses of God. We read of a Church
that was in the House of <hi>Precilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila,
16 Rom.</hi> 5. and a Church which was in the
House of <hi>Nymphus, Coloss.</hi> 4. 15. and a Church
that was in <hi>Philemon</hi>'s House, <hi>Philemon</hi> 2.
It is a common Saying and a true one, That
every man is to be a Prophet, Priest and King
in his own House: You do well enough re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
your being Kings, and as such do
insist much upon your Authority and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and know how to Lord it enough; only
by the way take this short Advice which I
shall give you; So rule as Kings, as not to
degenerate into Tyrants; You are Heads,
and to be honoured for such; but let not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42459:95"/>
your Crowns be Thorns, rending and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
afflicting and vexing those that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
your shadow, and should rejoyce in it.
And withal, do not forget that you are to
be <hi>Prophets</hi> too, teaching and instructing
those that are under your Charge and Care.
<hi>Gen. 8. 19. I know Abraham, that he will
command his children and his houshold after
him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</hi>
Yea, and you are to be <hi>Priests</hi> also, Praying
for your Families, and with them: What
is more reasonable than this? what more
decent and comely? Do you not live toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
do you not love together? do you not
eat and drink together? do you not rejoice
and make merry together? and I appeal to
your own judgments; <hi>Conscience,</hi> what saist
thou? should not, ought not these persons
to worship God together? ought they not
to pray together, and to seek the face of
God together? This is the way to make
your Communion an holy Communion, to
sweeten your comforts and converse, and to
sanctifie all your enjoyments. 1 <hi>Tim. 4. 4, 5.
Every creature of God is good, and nothing to be
refused, if it be received with thanksgiving;
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.</hi>
Prayer, Family-Prayer, is needful for the
sanctifying of Family-enjoyments; without
it, you sit down at unsanctified Tables, and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42459:95"/>
you lie down in unsanctified Beds; and I do
heartily commend to your consideration
and imitation the holy and brave Resolution
of <hi>Ioshua.</hi> He was a great Man, a Prince, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-General,
and Leader of <hi>Israel;</hi> do you
see how much he was fixed in this gracious
purpose, <hi>Iosh. 24. 15. As for me and my house,
we will serve the Lord:</hi> not only <hi>I,</hi> but <hi>we<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
                  </hi>
not only <hi>we a-part,</hi> but also <hi>we together.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let every one of you lay aside your
vain pretences, and weak reasons against a
great duty. Never pretend <hi>modesty</hi> in the case<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
thou art ashamed to pray before others, but
this is such a Fig-leaf as cannot cover thy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness;
be ashamed of thy folly and sins, of
thy vain words and frothy talk, but be not
ashamed of thy work: be ashamed that thou
dost it no better, but be not ashamed to do it:
art thou asham'd to pray? but hast thou not
a great deal more cause to be ashamed of thy
not praying? Know for a certain, that is
a sinful modesty which doth unfit and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
thee for any part of thy duty.</p>
               <p>Do not say, thou art not able to do it, thou
are not furnished with gifts for such a work.
But let me ask thee, whose fault is that?
whom wilt thou blame for that? <hi>God</hi> for
not giving them, or <hi>thy self</hi> for not getting
them? not to be able to pray, is both thy

because thy sin. Dost thou know how to beg thy
bread, and dost thou not know how to beg
thy life? dost thou know how to ask a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Man, and not how to ask mercy of
God? thou mayst blush to say so: thou
wouldest be counted a wise man, but in
this thou dost charge thy self with egregi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
folly. But I desire thee to begin. I fear
thou hast nottried, be persuaded to try now.
We have a Proverb amongst us pertinent to
the case in hand, <hi>Vse legs, and have legs.</hi> Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is the ready way to get the gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er:
practising is the most effectual way of

we seek, if we follow on to seek the Lord:
then shall we pray, if we follow on to pray:
thou didst not know how to go at first,

                  </gap>on, thou couldst
go, and run, and leap too; by doing thy
duty, thou wilt attain to an ability and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Make a wise choice of the time
when thou wilt set about this Secret Prayer.
Let it be done as in a right manner, so in
the proper season. It is true, whensoever the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:42459:96"/>
wind bloweth, we should set up our Sails:
open when Christ knocks, and answer when
he calls, and go about that which he sets
thee to: we should be very observant of
the Spirit's motions, and comply with them:
just as it was with the living Creatures and
the wheels, <hi>Ezek. 1. 20. Whithersoever the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
was to go, the living creatures went, thither
was their spirit to go, and the wheels were lifted
up over against them, for the spirit of the living
creatures,</hi> or of life, <hi>was in the wheels.</hi> The
spirit of God is to be the Spring, and all our
Wheels should move as that Spring draws.
Therefore when he puts thee upon Prayer,
do not consult with this nor that, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
to it immediately, but withal know, the
Spirit of God is a Spirit of wisdom, and
knows how to order motions regularly and
seasonably, <hi>Eccl. 3. 1. To every thing there is
a season, and a time to every purpose under the
Heaven; a time to plant, and a time to pluck up;
a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to
weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn,
and a time to dance,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but man knoweth not
his time,</hi> Eccles. 9. 12. Often he doth not,
therefore he doth often meet with troubles,
snares and losses. Now the Spirit of God
knows these times exactly, and moves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly:
therefore if there be any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
impulses and motions, reject
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:42459:97"/>
them, as those that are not of God, nor his
Spirit.</p>
               <p>Always take a fit time; make it thy busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to nick it. God hath in his mercy gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
thee time enough for all thy work, and
in his infinite wisdom he hath given thee
choice opportunities<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> for every part of it.
Thou hast thy seasons for labour and for
rest; seasons for buying and for selling; a
season for praying and for hearing: now
look thou carefully to it, that thou do eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing in its season: that is the excellent
property of him whom the Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth
a blessed man. He is, and <hi>he shall
be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that
bringeth forth his fruit in his season,</hi> Psal. 1. 3.
We cannot well do two things at once;
and that God who understandeth our frame,
hath ordered out accordingly concerning us.
There is but one thing thy duty at one
time. Now it is thy business to understand
what that one thing is, and so to do it. In
short, Let not thy secret Prayer hinder thee
from waiting upon <hi>Publick Ordinances</hi> and
Publick Worship on God's Holy-day; the
<hi>Church</hi> being met together in Christ's name,
thou oughtest to meet with them, if able,
because thou art a Member of that Body.
Thou sinnest if thou art praying at home,
when thou shouldest be hearing abroad. So,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:42459:97"/>
God hath given thee time for the duties of
thy <hi>general Calling,</hi> as a Christian; and for
the business of thy <hi>particular Calling</hi> too;
and he would have thee to mind both. It
is not his will that thou shouldest be cruel
to the Body, or unnatural to thy Family,
under a pretence of being tender over thy
Soul. He that provides not for his own
House, is so far from being a good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> tells us in 1 <hi>Tim.
5. 8. He hath denied the faith,</hi> i. e. practically,
and in his deeds, and <hi>is worse than an Infidel,</hi>
who doth from a natural instinct take care
of his own. Thou who sittest under the
light of the Gospel, and hast the Law of
God revealed and opened to thee, art far
worse than the Heathens, because thou dost
neglect that duty which they perform, who
have no other Light to direct them, than
that of Nature. Know, O man, thou sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
if thou art in thy Closet, when it is thy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
duty to be in thy Shop; or thou, O woman,
when thou oughtest to be employed about
the affairs of thy Family; and thou, O Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
when thou shouldest be doing thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
or thy Mistris's business: thy time, to be
sure, is none of thine own; thou must not
injure them to serve him. <hi>He hates robbery
for burnt offering.</hi> Come, Christians, learn
a piece of holy wisdom; do righteousness at
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:42459:98"/>
all times, and in all things. Keep all the
Wheels going, and all in their order. The
right <hi>timing</hi> of what you do, is putting of a
glory upon what you do: if all men would
keep their place, and wisely time their
actions, we should have better men, and a
better World than now we have, <hi>Eccles. 3. 11.
God hath made every thing beautiful in his
time.</hi> How beautiful is frost in Winter, and
heat in Summer: joys and comfort, <hi>if need</hi>
be; yea and heaviness, by reason of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sold
temptations, <hi>if need</hi> be: all the Works
of God are done with the greatest exactness
as to every circumstance, in a proper time,
and in a lovely order; so let yours be done
too to the best of your knowledge, and the
utmost of your power.</p>

                  <hi>I astly,</hi> When thou art in secret at thy

and spiritual; thou owest it Prayers.
It is indeed a sinful Nation, a People loaden
with Iniquity, that hates to be reformed,
and is settled upon its Lees: but upon that
score it needs Prayer the more. There are
Thousands pulling down Judgments by
their Superstition and loud-crying Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
and making a Breach for an whole

now that her condition is very low, and we

cannot tell what may be the products of the
ensuing year. And that the Sacrifice of
Prayer may be fired, and send up before the
Throne of God, a vehement and pure flame;
often think, and seriously meditate upon that
which <hi>Iehovah</hi> hath spoken to you, <hi>Isa. 66.
10. Rejoice ye with Ierusalem, and be glad
with her, all ye that love her. Rejoice for joy with
her, all ye that mourn for her, that ye may suck,
and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that ye may milk out, and be delighted with
the abundance of her glory.</hi>
