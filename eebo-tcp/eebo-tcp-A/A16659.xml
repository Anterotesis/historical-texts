         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

past, since I made
bold to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
to my Right
Honorable LORD
your Husband, an
<hi>ENGLISH
GENTLEMAN;</hi>
whom hee was
pleased, forth of
his Noble disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to receive into his Protection. Into whose
most Honourable service hee was no sooner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained,
<pb facs="tcp:23374:3"/>
and upon due observance of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie
approved; then upon approvement of
his more piercive judgement, he became gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
received. Out of these respects, my most
Honourable Lady, I became so encouraged, as
I have presumed to preferre unto your service
an <hi>ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN,</hi>
one of the same Countrey and Family, a deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
sister of so <hi>generous</hi> a brother: Or (if you
will) a pleasing Spouse to so <hi>gracious</hi> a Lover.
Whom, if your Honour shall be but pleased to
entertaine, (and your noble Candor is such, as
she can expect nothing lesse) you shall finde
excellently graced with sundry singular quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
beautified with many choice endowments<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and so richly adorned with divers exquisite
ornaments, as her attendance shall be no dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
to your Honour, nor no touch <hi>to your</hi>
unblemish'd <hi>Selfe,</hi> to retaine her in your favour.
Sure I am, the sweetnesse of her temper, sorts
and sutes well with the quality or disposition
of your Honour: For shee Loves without any
painted pretences to bee really vertuous, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
popular applause to be affably gracious,
without any glorious glosse to bee sincerely
zealous. Her Education hath so enabled her,
as shee can converse with you of all places, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
her judgement conceivingly of most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and discourse most delightfully of all
fashions. Shee hath beene so well Schooled in
the Discipline of this <hi>Age,</hi> as shee onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
<pb facs="tcp:23374:3"/>
to retaine in memory that <hi>forme</hi> which is
least affected but most comely; to consort with
such as may improve her <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>practise</hi>
of goodnesse by their company; to entertaine
those for reall and individuate friends, who
make actions of pietie expressivest characters
of theyr amity. Diligent you shall ever finde
her in her imployments, serious in her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
temporate in her Discourse, discreet in
her answers. Shee bestowes farre more time in
eying the glasse of her life to rectifie her errors,
if there bee any, then the glasse of her face in
wiping of such outward staines as might ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
her beautie. Neyther in preserving that,
is shee altogether so remisse, as not to retaine
that seemely grace in her feature, as may put
her in remembrance of the unexpressive beauty
and bounty of her Maker. Neate she goes usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in her attire, which she puts on with more
<hi>care</hi> then <hi>cost.</hi> And to these shee addes such a
well-seeming grace, as she bestowes more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on them, then shee receives from them.
Phantasticke habits or forraine fashions are so
farre from taking her, as with a sleight but
sweet contempt they are disvalued by her. She
wonders how a wise state should employ so
much time in inventing varietie of disguises to
disfigure theyr <hi>Shape.</hi> This makes her desire
rather to bee out of request with time, then
with a civill and well-composed mind; whose
honour it is to bee prized more by her owne
<pb facs="tcp:23374:4"/>
internall worth, then any outward weare.
Constant shee is in her <hi>behaviour;</hi> wherein she
<hi>affects</hi> little, but <hi>observes</hi> much. With a bash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
admiration she smiles at these civilized si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pring
Dames, whose onely glory it is to affect
a kind of reserved state; which, as they hold,
consists principally in a minc'd speech, set
looke, or ginger pace. Shee loves alwayes to
bee her selfe, nor to entertaine ought which
may estrange her from her selfe. So as, there is
nothing in the whole posture of her <hi>Behaviour,</hi>
but with a native gracefull propriety doth infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
become her. Take upon her to instruct
others, shee will not, such is her Humilitie; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
every moving posture which comes from
her, may be a line of direction unto others to
follow her. <hi>Complement</hi> shee affects not, as the
world takes it. The word in his owne native
and unborrowed signification is good, and in
that sence she admits it; but to be restrained to
an inforced formality, shee cannot relish it.
Whence it is, that she preferres the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Liberty of her mind, before the mutable
formality of a Deluded age. Shee desires to be
<hi>Compleat</hi> in the exercise of goodnesse; to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
her Honour not by titles but a lovely
and lively proficience, graced with a continuate
practise in all vertues. She cannot indure this
later introduc'd kind of Complement, which
consists in Cringies, Congies, or supple salutes.
A cheerefull modesty is her best <hi>Complement,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:23374:4"/>
which shee ever weares about her as her chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest
ornament. <hi>Decency,</hi> shee affects in her
<hi>Cloathes,</hi> affability in her Discourse; shee hath
made a covenant with her eyes never to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
nor intentively to bestow themselves on
any other object than the glory of her Maker.
A proper personage is no such attractive mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
to her eye, to make her loose her selfe.
Whatsoever shee undertakes beseemes her, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
shee affects naught but what naturally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
her. Her beauty is her owne; and
whatsoever else may better accomplish her.
Her pathes are evenly vertuous; her desires
truely religious; Piety is her practise; which
shee expresseth so fully in every action; as the
whole course of her well-disposed life is not so
much as justly conscious of the least aspersion.
So highly shee values her <hi>Estimation,</hi> as she will
not engage it to suspition. Promises cannot
tempt her, nor hope of advancement taint her.
She wonders one should preferre a conceit of
being <hi>great</hi> before a desire of appearing <hi>good.</hi>
Protesting Lovers she holds for no better then
deceiving Lures. Bee their vowes of <hi>seruice</hi>
never so incessant, their assaults never so vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent;
her resolves have vow'd her constant.
Hope of <hi>Profit</hi> cannot surprize her, nor
thought of <hi>Pleasure</hi> vainely delude her. <hi>Esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi>
she holds her highest grace; with which
untainted shee purposeth to goe to her Grave.
Shee knowes how to <hi>fancie;</hi> and in her shee
<pb facs="tcp:23374:5"/>
retaines what shee <hi>fancies</hi> most: A <hi>chast soule;</hi>
this is that she <hi>loves,</hi> and with which she cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<hi>lives.</hi> Shee was neuer yet acquainted with
a passionate <hi>ah me;</hi> nor a carelesse folding of her
armes, as if the thought of a prevailing Lover
had wrought in her thoughts some violent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper.
So seriously doth she taske her selfe
to imployment, as she never reserues so much
time as to treate of so light a Subject. Yet shee
unfainedly vowes, that if it be ever her fortune
to make her <hi>choyce,</hi> her constant affection must
never admit any <hi>Change.</hi> To be <hi>Generous</hi> in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
action, hath beene ever the height of her
ambition. Howsoever she might boast of <hi>Des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</hi>
her desire is to raise it by <hi>Desert.</hi> Shee
holds, no family can bee truely <hi>Generous,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
it be nobly vertuous. Her <hi>life</hi> must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the <hi>line</hi> from whence shee came. Shee
scornes to entertaine one thought below her
selfe. Or to detract from the glory of that
house from whence she came. As the blood
that streames through her veines was nobly
Derived, so must it not by any <hi>action</hi> or <hi>affection</hi>
drawne from the rule of her direction, become
corrupted. For <hi>Honour,</hi> she admits it, but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
or never admires it; the <hi>Staires</hi> by which
she meanes to clime to it, must be faire &amp; firme,
or she will never mount them. She rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires
the Ages folly; while shee observes how
many hazard their high-priz'd liberty, for a
vading glimpse of popular glory. Her desires
<pb facs="tcp:23374:5"/>
are higher seated, where they are onely to bee
sated. A secure State consists not in <hi>styles</hi> but
<hi>vertues,</hi> which are <hi>Honours</hi> surest stayes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
her highest <hi>Honour</hi> reflects on her Creator,
wherein she is so farre from fearing, as shee is

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have heere presented
vnto your view one of
your owne Sexe; One,
whose improved Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
will bee no blemish
but a beautie to her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Peruse her, and I
make little doubt, but
you will so approve of
her Behaviour, as you shall acknowledge her right
worthy the title of a <hi>Sister.</hi> More shall you
finde in her, by freely conversing with her, than
in those <hi>YOVNG</hi> but loose <hi>ENGLISH
GENTLEWOMEN,</hi> whose long mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinarie
Prostitution vpon the <hi>Stall,</hi> hath brought
them out of Request, and made them grow too
<hi>Stale,</hi> by being exposed to publike <hi>Sale.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Countries hath shee coasted, sundry Dangers
<pb facs="tcp:23374:7"/>
accoasted, Courts and Cities hath shee frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
to returne home better freighted, and re-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey
the benefit of that fraught to this <hi>Iland,</hi> where
shee was first bred and now arrived. Doe yee itch
after <hi>Fashion?</hi> She is for you; yet not that, which
the vanity of this Age admits; but what Modestie
onely affects. She hath observ'd much in forraine
Courts, which deserv'd rather <hi>Contempt</hi> than
<hi>Imitation;</hi> this shee would not for a world intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
into a well-govern'd <hi>State;</hi> so tender shee
is of her Fame, as no <hi>place</hi> nor <hi>person</hi> shall derive
from her the least staine. Whatsoever shee hath
commended to be seene, is no lesse fully than faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
showne, and with that temporate style drawne,
as in every line some one precept of <hi>Vertue</hi> seemes
to shine. Neither in this her strict or serious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of Times, doth shee resemble those <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miae,</hi>
who vse to take their eyes with them when
they goe abroad, but lye them aside when they come
home: No; so little doth shee favour her selfe, as
shee preferres others Censures before her owne; and
in no one particular so much expresseth her owne
true glory, as in the constant practise of Humilitie.
Hence it is, that shee is no curious pryer into others
actions, nor too cens<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rious a reproover of others

               </gap>s; being indeed, a <hi>TYRESIAS</hi> in the
eying or descrying of others errors, an <hi>ARGUS</hi> in
her owne. What is good and amiable in the eye
of Vertue, she imbraceth with an affectionate tender;
making it her highest honour, to promote the glory
of her Maker. But least by being too serious, shee
<pb facs="tcp:23374:7"/>
might become tedious; she will not sticke to walke
abroad with you into more pleasing groves or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures
of Delight: where shee will converse with
you of Love, and intermixe her Discourse with
such time-beguiling Tales as varietie shall no lesse
sharpen your attention, then the modesty of her
Method beget admiration. Every Subiect she treats
of, you shall finde so equally tempered with <hi>profit</hi>
and <hi>delight;</hi> as the one shall no lesse benefit your
minde, than the other solace your Eare. Shee
can reprove without <hi>gall,</hi> blush without <hi>guilt,</hi> love
without <hi>guile,</hi> live without <hi>gaine.</hi> Her <hi>gaine</hi> is
to purchase <hi>vertue</hi> more followers; her <hi>guile,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
the <hi>world</hi> of her favourers; her <hi>guilt,</hi> to
defeat all vitious pioners; her <hi>gall,</hi> to disrelish all
Voluptuous practisers. She can discourse of Love
without lightnesse; converse with Love without
loosenesse; and consort with those shee loves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leudnesse. She knowes how to retaine a seeme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
state without pride; to expresse her selfe praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
without selfe-praise; and in all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to make <hi>Vertue</hi> her highest prize. <hi>Humilitie,</hi>
which is the princesse of Vertues, the conqueresse of
Vices, the mirror of Virgins, and Crowne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
shee so much honours, as shee values it above
all humane glory: whence it is, that shee hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
reapt more spirituall profit by <hi>dis-esteeme</hi> then
<hi>selfe-esteeme.</hi> Day by day shee recreates herselfe
in her <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>goodwill;</hi> and in her recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
shee makes this her soule-solacing Meditation:
<hi>Who be they that neighbour neare me, and
<pb facs="tcp:23374:8"/>
whose weake estates stand in need of me?</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
with this charitable resolution: <hi>There is
none so poore, but to my power I will relieve,
so long as I live, for the honour of his Image
whom I love.</hi> Shee devides her day into houres,
her houres into holy taskes. Employment takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
all occasions of distraction. Should she suffer
a light or indisposed thought to worke upon her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:
or giue way to any such intruder to di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>sturbe
the peace of her <hi>inward house,</hi> she would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
her selfe worse for many yeares; and inflict
vpon her extravagant affections such a censure, as
might deterre them thenceforth to wander. She
distastes none more than these <hi>busie house-wives,</hi>
who are ever running into discourse of others fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,
but forget their owne. Neither holdes shee it
sufficient to be onely an <hi>House-keeper;</hi> or Snayle-like
to be still vnder roofe: she partakes therefore of
the <hi>Pismire</hi> in providing, of the <hi>Sarreptan</hi> wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
in disposing: holding ever an absent providence
better then an improvident presence. She is no
common frequenter of publique feasts, but if neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
require it, she will admit of it: wherein
she demeanes her selfe so civilly, as there is no dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>creete
person but ioyes in her society. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
must beget in her a distemper, having ever
a tender eye o're her honour. In the report of others
praises she is attentive, but deafe to her owne. Bee
she in places of publique resort or privately retyr'd,
she ever enioyes her selfe; neither can excesse of
mirth transport her; or any crosse occurrent much
<pb facs="tcp:23374:8"/>
perplexe her. There is nought that aliens her mind
more from those with whom shee consorts, than an
immodest discourse, which shee interrupts with a
discreet anger. Wheresoever she sets her rest, shee
makes <hi>Vertue</hi> her guest, whom she entertaines with
so sweet an embrace, as nothing can divide them:
so firme and inviolable is the league that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them. She conceives no small delight in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducating
the young and unexperienced Damsels of
your sexe: wherein she retaines an excellent facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and facility. It shall not be amisse therefore for
you who have Daughters, to recommend them to
her direction; whose government is such, as neither
her too much indulgence shall spoile them; nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
dull them. Whatsoever she in many yeares
hath learned (so desirous is shee to benefit where
her <hi>Observations</hi> may afford profit) she is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to impart; to the end shee may procure <hi>her</hi>

               </gap> servants, whom she<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> religiously hath ever
vow'd to serve. Long hath she beene a Learner,
neyther is she asham'd to be so still. Onely for <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>
honour, is shee become a Teacher; that the
<hi>Younger</hi> may be instructed by those that are <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
the vndisciplin'd by such as are riper. Ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall you find her slow in performing, what she
hath so perfectly learned. For her very Life is a
continued line of Direction, being solely dedicated
to a vertuous profession. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> did sharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reprove a rich woman, for comming into the
Lords Temple without her Oblation: But this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe
she would be loath iustly to incurre: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb facs="tcp:23374:9"/>
she goes better prepar'd, that her portion of
Glory may be sooner shar'd: having an Oblation in
her hand, Devotion in her heart, and a Crowne of
consolation in hope. You then, who love modesty,
entertaine her; for she will sort well with your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and through her acquaintance improve your
honour. For such who sacrifice the Morne to their
Classe, the Afternoone to the Stage, and Evening to
revelling; she holds no correspondence with them.
These she holds for no employments; nor the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
of them worthy her knowledge. They must not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse
time, that are commended to her trust. She is
not so weary of time, neither doth she so disvalue it,
as with such impertinences to consume it. Those like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
who preferre <hi>Fashion</hi> before <hi>Decency,</hi> formal
<hi>Punto'es</hi> before reall <hi>Formality,</hi> &amp; will suffer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to be deluded by Vanity; they must not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into her family. She hath learned <hi>better
things</hi> than to foole her selfe in a painted disguise, or
to labor of that Vniversall disease, which the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a full and flourishing State usually produceth.
She hath learned with that <hi>better Sister,</hi> to <hi>chuse</hi>
the <hi>better part.</hi> Constant be her purposes, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
her desires, consonant her delights. Be it then
your <hi>honour</hi> to be informed by her, seeing her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions
are equally mixt with <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</hi>
Now if you obiect, that shee hath beene too
flow in comming, seeing her <hi>GENTLEMAN</hi>
so long since arrived; heare mine answer; and sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
your Censure, by imputing this fault to our
English Error. Where <hi>Venus</hi> is longer in trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
<pb facs="tcp:23374:9"/>
than <hi>Mars</hi> in training. Many provisions
were required by her, before the World were to be
possessed of her. Much likewise expected from
her, before the World had knowledge of her; this
made her the longer to retire, that shee might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
the more in her returne. May you,
<hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> bee the instance of it; so shall
both the <hi>Author</hi> and his <hi>labour</hi> reioyce in it.
To draw then to a Conclusion, lest my <hi>Portell</hi>
rise too high for my <hi>building;</hi> as you are not
to expect from her any guga-tyres, toyes, or trifles;
love-sented gloves, amorous potions, perfumed pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures,
or love-sicke pouders; so shee doubts not, but
to finde in you an <hi>Eare,</hi> prompt to attention; a
<hi>Tongue,</hi> cleare of invection; a <hi>Spirit,</hi> free from
detraction? with an <hi>Heart</hi> apt to harbour affection.</p>
            <p>Now for the <hi>Volume,</hi> I had purposely made it
more portable, that it might become your more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
follower; had not my observation told mee,
that albeit <hi>amiablenesse</hi> consist in a lovely feature,
the <hi>goodlinesse</hi> of a <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> rests in her
comely Stature. Besides, this corresponded better
with the Portraiture of the <hi>ENGLISH
GENTLEMAN,</hi> her affianc'd Lover. For
the <hi>Margin,</hi> I have not charg'd it with many Notes,
lest you should neglect the <hi>Garment,</hi> by being taken
too much with the <hi>border.</hi> Improve it to
your best profite, and let <hi>GOD</hi> have
the glorie of it.</p>

made him flye to the

shame compelled him
to play the artlesse Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and through meere
<hi>necessity</hi> to make him a
Couer. Well enough
was he before that time attyred, albeit naked: and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23374:25"/>
so happily stated, as we are to imagine, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
kept him not from the knowledge of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
but that his Originall purity freed him
from these necessities. But no sooner was the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fruit tasted, then poore <hi>Adam</hi> became tainted,
his nakednesse discouered; so as now for honour of
modesty, he must of <hi>necessity</hi> betake himselfe to that
<hi>science,</hi> whereto (being <hi>free</hi> till that time) he was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<hi>bound Apprentice.</hi> His inhibited taste made him
sensible (and therein more miserable) of what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he felt not. No distemperature of cold or heat
could before that time annoy him. Now his failing
in performing what he ought, brings him to a feeling
of that he neuer knew. Now tender <hi>Eue,</hi> whose tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
repose ministred her all content in a sweet
and cheerefull Arbour, with all the varieties and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies
of nature, feeles a shaking &amp; shiuering in her
ioynts: Such a strange distemper hath the tast of an
Apple wrought in her. Shee must fit her selfe then
to endure that with patience, which she procur'd to
her selfe and second selfe, through disobedience; and
put on what before she needed not, a Vaile to couer
her Nakednesse, and subiect her selfe to these Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sities.
It is true, that <hi>Cloathing</hi> keeps the body warme
two wayes: By keeping in the naturall heat of the
body; and by keeping out the accidentall cold of
the Ayre. All Creatures enter the world sheelded
and shrouded, saue onely poore man, who enters
lists naked. Tender and delicate hee is by nature;
more subiect to preiudice by distemper, than any o<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
Creature. Now to fence himselfe against all
occurrents, and the better to endure all intemperate
violence, the Diuine Prouidence hath accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it selfe to his <hi>Necessity,</hi> from the very first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of his <hi>infancy:</hi> yet were it fit, when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
vpon himselfe thus decked and attired, to recal
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23374:25"/>
to minde the prime occasion of these <hi>Necessities.</hi> So
equally tempered was the Ayre where he first brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed;
so farre from the distemper of heat or cold
freed; with such variety of all delights stored; as
then in all happinesse he seem'd to be stated: but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
after his fall, began these to faile. That soyle,
which before was naturally fruitfull, became wilde
without manuring: Those Riuers, which before
were purely relishing and delighitng, became mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
brackish, and distasting: Yea, that Ayre, which
before was euer sweetly and temperately breathing,
became vnseasonably scorching or freezing. <hi>Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>
then hath prouided for <hi>Adam</hi> and his Collapsed
posterity a Coat, to shroud them from the incle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency
of all seasons. And whence came this <hi>necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
but from sinne? To glory then in these <hi>necessities,</hi>
is to glory in sinne. Which were, as if some graue
Capitall offender, hauing committed high Treason
against his Soueraigne, should, notwithstanding, out
of a Princely Clemency be pardoned; yet with this
condition, that hee should weare a Cord or Halter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
his necke during his life, to put him in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of his disloyalty and treason. In which Badge,
this frontlesse Traytor should pride himselfe more,
than if it were some ancient Crest of honour. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
then vpon the originall source of your sorrow,
<hi>Eue,</hi> ye daughters of <hi>Eue.</hi> Ambition prompt her to
sin, sin brought her to shame, shame to her shroud.
Meere <hi>necessity</hi> compelled her to weare what before
she knew not, and to prouide her selfe of that which
before she needed not. How is it then, that these
ragges of sinne, these robes of shame, should make
you idolize your selues? How is it, that yee conuert
that which was ordained for <hi>necessity,</hi> to feed the
light-flaming fuell of licentious liberty? Was <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell</hi>
first intended for keeping in naturall heat, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23374:26"/>
keeping out accidentall cold? How comes it then
that you weare these thinne Cobweb attires, which
can neither preserue heat, nor repell cold? Of what
an incurable cold would these Butterfly-habits pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse
the wearer, were pride sensible of her selfe?
Sure, these attires were not made to keepe cold out,
but to bring cold in. No <hi>necessity,</hi> but meere vanity,
introduced these Pye-coloured fopperies amongst
vs. Vnuaile many of our light Curtezans, whose
brothell practice hath reft them of the ornament of
a woman, and you will finde a strange Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phosis;
<hi>Venus armata</hi> turn'd to <hi>Venus calua.</hi> We say
there is no good congruity in a proud heart and a
beggers purse. Why should we then pride our selues
in that which displayes our beggery? Before wee
had cloathes, we wanted nothing; hauing cloathes,
we stand in need of all things. Primitiue purity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted
vs from these <hi>necessities;</hi> Originall impurity
subiected vs to these <hi>necessities.</hi> Cold wee grew in
Charity, cold in euery Christian duty; garments
then stood wee in need of, to shroud vs against the
tempest of a benummed Conscience. These habits
then, it appeares, were ordained, at first, for <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>
to shield vs: Vanity had not then set inuention
on worke, nor the age sent her Phantastickes abroad
to trafficke with sorraine fashions. Winter made
choyce of his garment to fit the season; so did Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
without an affected singularity, fit him to a
seasonable fashion. They stood not much either vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
colour or curious border; temperate heat they
desired to retaine, intemperate to repell; cold to
keepe out, naturall warmth to keepe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that, ancient times intended; this was all that they
affected. <hi>Necessity</hi> enforced them to doe what they
did; otherwise, I am perswaded, they had not beene,

generall applause of the people extolled, and in their
triumphall <hi>Eb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

I commend her for the good vse which she

but shee watred it with a teare, remembring what
<hi>necessities</hi> her ambitious thoughts had brought her
to: for by aspiring to know more than shee did, she
became depriued of that excellent beauty which she
had. Patternes likewise of modesty you may be, and

how to <hi>array your selues in comely apparell, with

                     </gap> fastnesse and modesty, not with broided haire, or
gold, or pearles, or costly apparell: But, as becommeth
women that professe the feare of God. For euen after this
manner in time past did the holy women, which trusted in
God, tire themselues.</hi> Here is a prescript forme by way
of direction; for your habit. Choicer ornaments you
cannot haue to adorne you; nor any fashion that
will better seeme you. Where you walke, you may
enioy your selues freed from light eyes, gazing and
admiring vanity: your very <hi>habit</hi> is your <hi>Testate</hi> to
witnesse for you: loose thoughts nestle not in your
bosome, nor doe wandring distractions surprise your
breast: you haue learned to your highest solace, euen
in euery motion, action, posture, gesture, to obserue
modesty, as an ornament to honour. For, seeing that
the very habit of the minde may bee best discerned
and discouered by the state or carriage of the body,
the disposition of the body by the habit; to auoyd
scandall, and retaine that Christian opinion which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
one ought to preserue, wee are to make choyce
of that attire, which conferres most seeming graui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on vs. This the very Heathen, whose best dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
was morality, were carefull of: for in the <hi>vse</hi>
of <hi>Apparell,</hi> they retained such constant course, as
they held it the greatest blemish they could asperse
vpon their Nation, to introduce any new or exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke
fashion, either to effeminate the dispositions
of their people, or to derogate from the honour of
their memorable predecessours; whose modell was
their direction in habit, and all other obseruable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes.
What a simple, honest Rusticity our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors
retained in their weare, might bee easily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scerned,
if wee should make recourse to one of their
ancient Wardrobes; where antiquity may prescribe
for many ages, and constancy second what antiquity
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23374:27"/>
had introduc'd. Yea, so obseruant were former times
of those fashions which preceding ages had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to them, as they held it ominous to inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
or bring in any new forme, euen in matters of
indifferency. When <hi>Darius</hi> had altered the fashion
of his Sword, which vsed to be Persian, into the
forme of the Macedonian (in the yeere immediately
before he fought with <hi>Alexander)</hi> the Chaldees or
Sooth-sayers prophecied, that into what fashion as
<hi>Darius</hi> had altered his Sword, time would reduce his
State; and that the Persian glory was drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
her last period, by subiecting her selfe to the
Soueraignty of Macedon. Which prediction was
soone confirmed by the next yeeres Conquest. But
tell me, ye curious Dames, who hold it a derogation
to your honour, to entertaine ought that is vulgar;
whereto were Cloathes first ordained, but to couer
that nakednesse which sinne brought, and to skreene
that shame which the effect of sinne first wrought?
The <hi>vse</hi> of <hi>Apparell</hi> is not to dignifie the wearer, or
adde more beauty to the Creature. Sure I am, that a
iudicious eye, who measures dignity by desert,
scornes to preferre the <hi>Case</hi> before the <hi>Instrument,</hi>
the <hi>Rinde</hi> before the <hi>Pith.</hi> Those who are worthy
to be your Iudges, will determine your worth by
what there is in you, not by what you weare on you.
Let May-games and Morrices beautifie themselues
with Anticke dressings, to captiuate the vulgar eye;
your breeding hath beene better, your iudgements
clearer, your obseruations wiser, than to stoope to
such base Lures. Our life consists in the perfection
or temperate infusion of naturall or radicall humour,
or in the conseruation of naturall heat: to preserue
this, to increase that, Nature hath prouided meanes
inward and outward. To inuert the <hi>vse,</hi> is to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert
the <hi>Ordinance</hi> it selfe: So <hi>vse</hi> the outward, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23374:28"/>
you darken not the inward; so dispose of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that it may rectifie the outward. Reflect on
antiquity, yet no farther than may suit with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of the age wherein you liue. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
how many fashions formerly vsed, would in
this age deserue rather derision than approuement.
And that the infancy of the world had many shapes,
as then but onely in their <hi>Embrio</hi> or rather Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which succeeding times, accommodated by
more exquisite artists, brought afterwards to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
<hi>Vse</hi> your habit as an ornament of decency;
let it not haue the least Edging of vanity. Many
Eyes are fixed on you, sundry motiues of imitation
are deriued from you. Send not out one fruitlesse
sigh for any phantasticke fashion which you see:
they cannot be sighes of compassion, that are sent
meerely out for fashion. Sigh rather that your
Country should labour of so vaine a birth, as to
preferre forraine inuentions before the ornament of
a <hi>Maiden Ile,</hi> constant modesty. Spend not a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
houre in an vnprofitable garnish of corruption:
<hi>Vse</hi> these outward dressings as if you did not <hi>vse</hi>
them: Let them be rather your <hi>scorne</hi> than your <hi>pride;</hi>
your <hi>contempt</hi> than <hi>content.</hi> Be those curious Cases
of mortality decked or dawbed with neuer so much
adulterate beauty, they cannot conferre vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
one beameling of lasting glory. Looke vpon
those poore <hi>bases</hi> of frailty, your <hi>feet,</hi> what a <hi>tinkling</hi>
they make, to partake of a lasciuious meeting in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacy:
Eye those <hi>rising mounts,</hi> your <hi>displayed breasts,</hi>
with what shamelesse art they wooe the shamefaste
passenger: View those <hi>wandring Lamps,</hi> how they
roue abroad, as if they would flye out of their
Lodges, and spheere themselues in some amorous
Orbe. Call them home, lest <hi>Dina<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

themselues by straying, impeach their honour by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23374:28"/>
wandring, bring themselues woe by their lasciuious
wooing. Affect no fashion that may beget in your
generous bosomes a light thought; Contemne that
fashion which detracts from the natiue beauty of
the feature, or which brings it to that admiration of
the Creature, as it makes it forgetfull of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.
O how contemptible a thing is man (the word
may reflect equally vpon either sexe) if he erect not
his thoughts aboue man! What a poore <hi>vse</hi> makes
that miserable creature of his being here, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes
so much time in the <hi>Tyring house,</hi> as hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
what part he is to play on the Stage? O consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the preciousnesse of time! it is all that may bee
properly said ours. Neither can we terme that por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of time which we call <hi>ours,</hi> yeares, or dayes, or
houres. A moment is our portion, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandingst
Emperour hath no larger proportion. Of
which moment, whatsoeuer is past, is not now;
and whatsoeuer is to come, is not yet. Eye then
your Houre-glasse, vye in teares with graines of
sand. Bestow not this little scantling, this moment
shorter than nothing, in too curiously attiring of
vanity, but in meditating of your owne frailty, and
redeeming the time you haue lost in security. As
<hi>Apparell</hi> was ordained for <hi>necessity; vse</hi> it with Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
ciuility. In obseruing this, you make the <hi>vse</hi>

Our Commerce with forraine Nations was not for
fashions, feathers, and follies. There was distinction
in our attires; differences of ranks and qualities; a
ciuill obseruance of decent habits; which confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no lesse glory on our Ile at home, than victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mannagements by the prowesse of our Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,

found in latter times? What neare resemblance and
relation hath womans to mans: suting their light
feminine skirts with manlike doublets? <hi>Semiramis,</hi>
that victorious Princesse, commanded all to weare
<hi>Tyres</hi> vpon their heads, and to put vpon them wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
apparell without distinction, that shee might
reigne securely without exception: Thus the come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
habit of modesty became a pretended vaile to an
vsurped Soueraignty. But these succeeding times
haue tyred our women with tyres; translating them
to a plume of Feathers. Fashion is now euer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
saile: the Inuention euer teeming; Phantasticke
Wits euer breeding. More time spent how to <hi>abuse</hi>
time, and corrupt licentious youth, than how to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresse
employment for the one, or to rectifie the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers
of the other. Take a suruey of all degrees,
and tell me what vniformity you finde in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.
And to make instance in three seuerall pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
(for to these all others may haue proper relation)
take a more precise and punctuall perusall of <hi>City,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23374:29"/>
Court,</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> and returne me a briefe of your
Suruey. In the <hi>first,</hi> you shall finde many graue Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
modest Maids, deuout Widdowes; but are
these all? No; with these you shall finde a strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mixt generation. Some affecting nothing more
than what is most nouell and phantasticke; Others
enuying what they disdainfully see in others, which
fashion rather than they will misse, they will not
sticke to set their honour at sale: All, or most, true
<hi>Biantines,</hi> carrying all their wealth about them. For
the <hi>second,</hi> you shall find, amongst many other plants
of promising growth and excellent proficience, sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
sweet-sented sprigs of <hi>Cynnamon,</hi> whose rinde is
worth all the body. No discourse can rellish their
formall palate, but fashion; if <hi>Eues</hi> Kirtle should
be now showne them, how they would geere their
Grandam? For the <hi>last,</hi> though it be long ere they
creepe into forme, hauing once attain'd it, they can
take vpon them as vnbeseeming a State in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
Pew, as if they were Ladies for that yeare, and
had beene bred in the Art of mincing since their
childhood. But what are these, but such, whose ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of time is scarcely valued? Sacrificing more
houres to their Looking-glasse, than they reserue
minutes to lament their defects. Such, whose vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
thoughts neuer harbour the least conceit that
may betray their honour, or depraue those more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
parts wherewith they are indowed; scorne to
drowne their <hi>better part</hi> in these dregs of sensuality.
Vertue is their attendant, Honour their obiect, all
inferiour delights their lowest subiects. Day by
day haue these their taske imposed, that the poyson
of sloath may be better auoyded: No day passeth
without a line, no action without a limit: obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
the course of that vertuous Mirror, of whom it
is said:
<q>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:23374:30"/>
                     <l>In distinct houres she did diuide the day,</l>
                     <l>To walke, to worke, to meditate, and pray.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Much different from this pious resolution, was
that Libertines impious conclusion, who held that
none could bee frequently deuout in prayer, and
fashionably decent in attire. Shee bestowed too
much time on her <hi>Glasse,</hi> to reserue any for her
Lampe. Pride had exiled her zeale; delicacy of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
sanctity of heart. Her day might be easily diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded:
Shee bestowed the forenoone on her skinne,
the afternoone on a Play, clozing her Euening Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
with a reere supper: and this was her Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Taske. Miserable is the condition of that Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
who, so her skin be sleake, cares not if her soule
be rough. So her outward habit be pure and without
blemish, values little her inward garnish. Such an
one hath made a firme Contract with vanity, clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing
her contemptuous age with a fearefull Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strophe.
Thus farre haue we discoursed of the effect
or <hi>abuse</hi> it selfe, wee are now to treat of those two
sources, from whence these <hi>abuses</hi> properly arise; to
wit, <hi>Delicacy</hi> in being more curious in our Choyce
of <hi>Apparell</hi> than <hi>necessity</hi> or <hi>decency</hi> doth require; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>Superfluity,</hi> in storing more variety and
change of rayments than either nature needs, or
reason would admit, were shee not transported with
a sensuall affection, by giuing way to what vnboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
appetite requires.</p>
               <p>IN the search of any Minerall,<note place="margin">How the <hi>vse</hi> of <hi>Apparell</hi> may be inuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>abuse.</hi>
                  </note> we are first to digge
for the veine; and in the curing of any maleuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
effect, we are duely and seriously to inquire the
producing cause, that by stopping the Spring or
source, wee may stay the violence of the streame.
We are then to insist of those two precedent means,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23374:30"/>
by which the <hi>vse</hi> may bee inuerted to <hi>abuse;</hi> and
that which of it selfe is approueable, if obserued with
decency, becomes iustly reprehensible by corrupting
so necessary and consequent an <hi>vse,</hi> either by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy,</hi>
which weakens and effeminates the <hi>spirit,</hi> or
by <hi>Superfluity,</hi> which euer darkens the beameling
of <hi>reason</hi> with the Cloud of <hi>sense.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reproofe touching <hi>Apparell</hi> may bee occasioned
from foure respects:</p>
               <p>First, when any one weareth <hi>Apparell</hi> aboue their
degree, exceeding their estate in precious attire.
Whence it is that <hi>Gregory</hi> saith; there be some who
are of opinion, that the weare of precious or sump<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tuous
<hi>Apparell</hi> is no sinne: Which if it were no
fault, the diuine Word would neuer haue so punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
expressed, nor historically related, how the
<hi>Rich man,</hi> who was tormented in hell, was cloathed
with Purple and Silke. Whence we may note, that
touching the matter or subiect of attire, humane cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
auaileth highly. The first stuffe or substance
of our garments, was very meane; to wit, Skinne
with Wooll. Whence it is we read, that God made
<hi>Adam</hi> and his wife <hi>Coats of Skinnes,</hi> that is, of the
Skinnes of dead beasts. Afterwards (see the grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this vanity deriued from humane singulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
they came to <hi>Pure Wooll,</hi> because it was lighter
than Skinnes. After that to <hi>rindes of trees,</hi> to wit,
<hi>Flax.</hi> After that to the <hi>dung and ordure of Wormes,</hi> to
wit, <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ke.</hi> Lastly, to <hi>Gold and Siluer, and precious
Stones.</hi> Which preciousnesse of attire highly displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
God. For instance whereof (which the very
Pagans themselues obserued) we read that the very
first among the <hi>Romans,</hi> whoeuer wore <hi>Purple,</hi> was
strucke with a Thunder-bolt, and so dyed suddenly,
for a terror and mirror to all succeeding times, that
none should attempt to lift himselfe proudly against
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23374:31"/>
God in precious attire.</p>
               <p>The second point reprehensible is, <hi>Softnesse</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy</hi>
of <hi>Apparell:</hi> Soft Cloathes introduce soft
mindes. Delicacy in the <hi>habit,</hi> begets an <hi>effeminacy</hi> in
the <hi>heart. Iohn Baptist,</hi> who was sanctified in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
wombe, wore sharpe and rough garments.
Whence wee are taught, that the true seruant of
God is not to weare garments for beauty or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
but to couer his nakednesse; not for State
or Curiosity, but necessity and conuenience. Christ
saith in his Gospell, <hi>They that are clad in soft ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
are in Kings houses.</hi> Whence appeareth a
maine difference betwixt the seruants of Christ and
of this world. The seruants of this world seeke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
honour, and pleasure in their attire; whereas
the seruants of Christ so highly value the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of innocence, as they loath to staine it with
outward vanities. It is their honour to <hi>put on</hi>
Christ Iesus; other robes you may rob them of,
and giue them occasion to ioy in your purchase.</p>
               <p>The third thing reproueable is, <hi>forraine Fashions:</hi>
When we desire nothing more than to bring in some
Outlandish habit different from our owne; in
which respect (so Apishly-anticke is man) it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
more affected than our owne. Against such
the Lord threatneth,<note place="margin">Zephan. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>I will visit the Princes and the
Kings children, and all such as are cloathed with strange
Apparell.</hi> Which <hi>strange Apparell</hi> is after diuers
fashions and inuentions, wholly vnknowne to our
Ancestors. Which may appeare sufficiently to such,
who within this 30, or 40, or 60 yeares neuer saw
such cutting, caruing, nor indenting as they
now see.</p>
               <p>The fourth thing reproueable is, <hi>Superfluity of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell,</hi>
expressed in these three particulars: first, in
those who haue diuers changes and suits of Cloaths;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:23374:31"/>
who had rather haue their garments eaten by
mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ths, than they should couer the poore members
of Christ. The naked cry, the needy cry, and
shreekingly complaine vnto vs, how they misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
labour and languish of hunger and cold. What
auailes it them that wee haue such changes of ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
neatly plaited and folded; rather than wee
will supply them, they must be starued? How doe
such rich Moath-wormes obserue the Doctrine of
Christ, when he saith in his Gospell; <hi>Hee that hath
two Coats let him giue one to him that hath none?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, wee are to consider the <hi>Superfluity</hi> of
such who will haue long garments, purposely to
seeme greater: yet, which of these can adde one cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit
to his stature? This puts me in remembrance of
a conceited story which I haue sometimes heard, of
a diminutiue Gentleman, who demanding of his
Tayler, what yards of Sattin would make him a
Suite, being answered farre short in number of
what he expected: with great indignation replied,
<q>Such an one of the <hi>Guard</hi> to my knowledge had
thrice as much for a Suite, and I will second him.</q>
Which his Tayler with small importunacy conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
to, making a <hi>Gargantn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>'s Suite</hi> for this <hi>Ounce
of mans flesh,</hi> reseruing to himselfe a large portion of
shreads, purposely to forme a fitter proportion for
his <hi>Ganimede</hi> shape.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Superfluity</hi> ariseth from their vanity,
who take delight in wearing great sleeues, misha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
Elephantine bodies, traines sweeping the earth,
with huge poakes to shroud their phantasticke
heads, as if they had committed some egregious
fact which deserued that censure: for in the Easterne
Countreyes it hath beene vsually obserued, that such
light Women as had distained their honour, or laid
a publike imputation on their name, by consenting
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:23374:32"/>
to any libidinous act, were to haue their heads
sow'd vp in a poake, to proclaime their shame, and
publish to the world the quality of their sinne.</p>
               <p>NOw to insist more punctually on that effemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
both of youth and age,<note place="margin">Delicacy of <hi>Apparell.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Delicacy of Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell;</hi>
I would haue our Daughters of <hi>Albion,</hi> reflect
vpon themselues, those poore shells of corruption:
what a trimming and tricking they bestow on their
brittle houses. <hi>Petrarchs</hi> aduice was, that we should
not be afraid though our out-houses, these structures
of our bodies, were shaken, so our soules, the guests of
our bodies, fared well. Whereas contrariwise, these,
whose onely care is to delude the outward appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
with a seeming faire, so they may preserue the
varnish, disualue the foundation. O may this folly
be a stranger to our Nation! To allay which fury,
at temper which frenzy, I hold no receit more so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
than to enter into a serious meditation of
your frailty. As first to consider, what you were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your birth; secondly, what from your birth to
your death; lastly, what after death. If you reflect
vpon the first, you shall finde that you haue
beene, what before you were not, afterwards were
what now you are not, first made of vile matter (see
the Embleme of humane nature) wrapped in a poore
skinne, nourished in an obscure place, your Coate
the second skinne, till you came to a sight of the
Sunne, which you entertained with a shreek, imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your originall sinne. Thus attired, thus adorned
came you to vs; what makes you then so vnmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
of that poore case wherein you came among vs?
Hath beauty, popular applause, youthfull heate, or
wealth taken from you the knowledge of your
selues? Deriue your pedigree, and blush at your
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:23374:32"/>
matchlesse folly, that pride should so highly magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
it selfe in dust, or glory most in that which brings
with it the most shame. Why doe you walke with
such haughty necks? why doe you extoll your selues
so highly in these Tabernacles of earth? Attend and
consider; you were but vilde corrupted seede at the
first; and now fuller of pollution than at the first.
Entring the world with a shreeke to expresse your
ensuing shame, you became afterwards exposed to
the miseries of this life and to sinne, in the end
wormes and wormes meat shall you be in the graue.
Why then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> you proud, ye dusty shrines, yee ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
vessels; seeing your conception was impurity,
birth misery, life penalty, death extremity? Why
doe ye embellish and adorne your flesh with such
port and grace, which within some few dayes
wormes will deuoure in the graue? Meane time you
neglect the incomparable beauty of your soules. For
with what ornaments doe ye adorne them? With
what sweet odors or spirituall graces doe ye perfume
them? With what choyce Flowers of piety and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion
doe ye trim them? What Habits doe ye pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
for them, when they must bee presented before
him who gaue them? How is it that ye so disesteeme
the soule, preferring the flesh before her? For the
Mistresse to play the Handmaid, the Handmaid the
Mistresse, is a great abuse. There can be no successe
in that family, where the houshold is mannaged so
disorderly. O restraine your affections, limit your
desires, beare an equall hand to the better part! The
Building cannot stand vnlesse you remoue the rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bish
from the foundation. The Soule in the body is
like a Queene in her Palace. If you would then haue
this little Common-wealth within you to flourish,
you must with timely prouidence suppresse all facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and turbulent molesters of her peace: your pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:23374:33"/>
especially those of vaine-glory, must bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained;
motiues to humility cherished; chast
thoughts embraced; all deuious and wandring Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations
excluded; that the soule may peaceably
enioy her selfe, and in her Palace liue secured. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
if you obiect, that this is an hard lesson; you
cannot despise the world nor hate the flesh; tell mee
where are all those louers of the world, cherishers of
the flesh, which not long since were among vs?
Nothing now remaineth of them but dust and
wormes. Consider diligently (for this considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
will be a Counterpoize to all vaine-glory) what
they now are, and what they haue beene. Women
they were as you are: they haue eat, drunke, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
spent their dayes in iollity, and now in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
gone downe to hell. Here their flesh is appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
to wormes, there their soules appointed to
hell fire: till such time as being gathered together
to that vnhappy society, they shall be rowled in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
burnings, as they were before partakers with
them in their vices. For one punishment afflicteth,
whom one loue of sinne affecteth. Tell mee, what
profiteth them their vaine-glory, short ioy, world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power, pleasure of the flesh, euill got wealth, a
great family, and concupiscence arising carnally?
Where now is their laughter? Where their iests?
Where their boasting? Where their arrogance?
From so great ioy, how great heauinesse? After such
small pleasure, how great vnhappinesse? From so
great ioy they are now fallen into great wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
grieuous calamity, vnsufferable torments.
What hath befallen them, may befall you: being
Earth of Earth, slime of slime: Of Earth you are, of
Earth you liue, and to Earth you shall returne. Take
this with you for an infallible position in these your
Cottages of Corruption: If you follow the flesh,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:23374:33"/>
you shall be punished in the flesh: if you be deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the flesh, you shall be tormented in the flesh:
for by how much more your flesh is cockered in this
world with all <hi>delicacy;</hi> by so much more shall your
soules bee tormented in hell eternally. If you seeke
curious and delicate rayments, for the beauty and
brauery of your rayments shall the moath bee laid
vnder you, and your Couering shall bee Wormes.
And this shall suffice to haue beene spoken touching
<hi>Delicacy of Apparell:</hi> we are now to descend briefly
to the second branch, <hi>Superfluity;</hi> whereof we intend
to discourse with that breuity, as the necessity of the
Subiect, whereof wee treat, shall require, and the
generality of this spreading malady may enforce.</p>
               <p>DIuine is that saying,<note place="margin">Superfluity of <hi>Apparell.</hi>
                  </note> and well worthy your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention:
The couetous person before he gaine
loseth himselfe, and before hee take ought is taken
himselfe. He is no lesse wanting to himselfe in that
which hee hath, than in that which hee hath not.
Hee findes that hee lost not, possesseth that hee
owes not, detaines that he ought not, and hates to
restore what hee iniuriously enioyes. So vnbounded
is the affection, or rather so depraued is the auariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mans inclination, as hee cannot containe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
within bounds, nor enter parley with reason,
hauing once slaued his <hi>better part</hi> to the soueraignty
of a seruile affection. This may appeare euen in this
one particular. Food and rayment are a Christians
riches: wherein he vseth that moderation, as hee
makes that Apostolicall rule his Christian direction:
<hi>Hauing food and rayment, I haue learned in all things to
be contented.</hi> But how miserably is this golden rule
inuerted, by our sensuall worldling? Competency
must neither be their Cater in the one, nor Conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:23374:34"/>
their Tayler in the other. Their Table must
labour of variety of dishes, and their Wardrobe of
exchange of raiments. No reason more probable
than this of their naked insides, which stand in need
of these <hi>superfluous</hi> additaments. What myriads of
indisposed houres consume these in beautifying rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
tombes! How curious they are in suiting their
bodies, how remisse in perferring their soules suit to
their Maker! How much they are disquieted in
their choyce, how much perplexed in their change,
how irresolute what they shall weare, how forgetfull
of what they were! This edging suits not, that pirle
sorts not, this dressing likes not: off it must after
all be fitted, and with a new Exchange, lesse seemely,
but more gaudy suited. The fashion that was in
prime request but yesterday, how it begins to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rellish
the wearer, as if it had lost the beauty by vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable

how much they tyre themselues with their attiring,
how they trouble themselues with their trimming!
It seemes wonderfull to me, that they are not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
crushed, with that onerous burthen with which
they are pressed. What a shop of guga nifles hang
vpon one backe? Here the remainder of a greater
worke, the reliques of an ancient Mannor conuerted

eyes are estrang'd from sleepe, their weakened ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
from repast, their wearied limbs from repose.
Melancholly is their sole melody; They haue made
a Contract with griefe, till griefe bring them to
their graue. And these poore wenches are much to
be pittied, because their owne tender hearts brought
them to this exigent; hauing either set their <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>
where they thought verily they might bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited
and were not, or else where they receiued
like seeming tender of <hi>affection,</hi> but afterwards reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
what they wished to effect they could not. So
as, in time, if continuance of absence reduce them
not to a better temper, they fall into a poore <hi>Maud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins</hi>
distemper, by giuing raines to passion, till it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange
them from the soueraignty of reason. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
others you shall see, though not such kind soules,
nor halfe so passionate, yet more discreet in their
Choyce, and in the passages of loue more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.
These will not deigne to cast a loose looke vpon
their beloued: but stand so punctually vpon their
termes, as if they stood indifferent for their choyce,
albeit constantly resolued neuer to admit of any
change. These scorne to paint out their passions in
plaints, or vtter their thoughts in sighes, or shed
one dispassionate teare for an incompassionate Louer.
Their Experience hath taught them better Notions:
they wil seemingly fly to make them follow, and so
take them by whom they are most taken. They can
play with the flame, and neuer cinge their wings;
looke loue in the face, and preserue their eyes; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
where they take delight, and colour their <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi>
with a seeming disdaine. These are they who
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23374:41"/>
can walke in the Clouds to their intimatest friends:
make their eyes strangers to their hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude;
nothing more foolish than Loue, if discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red;
nothing more wise, if artfully shadowed. But
I neither approue the <hi>violence</hi> of the former, nor <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference</hi>
of the latter. The one interlayeth <hi>affection</hi>
with too much passion, the other with too much
dissimulation. These were well to bee so allayed or
attempered, as neither too much eagernesse taxe
the discretion, nor too much remisnesse argue coole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of <hi>affection.</hi> For the former, I must tell them
they giue great aduantage to an insulting Louer, to'
entertaine Loue with such vehement ardour: it fares
with these, as with hot <hi>duellists,</hi> who fight them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
out of breath, and so subiect their relenting
<hi>force</hi> to the command of a better tempered enemy.
For the latter, they hold constantly that position in
arguments of <hi>Loue,</hi> as well as in other actions of
their <hi>life;</hi> She knowes not how to <hi>liue,</hi> nor how to

what they are with that discreet temper, as
they may deserue the embraces of a Noble Louer.
In briefe, let such as are too hot in the quest of their
desires, attemperate that heat with intermissions:
such violence is best rebated by absence. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
such as are too coole, let them quicken that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse

vsher reuenge, which they can act with as much

their iniury. But this <hi>Passion</hi> neuer workes more
tragicke of fearefull effects, than when it streames
from Iealousie or Competition in the Subiect where
they loue. Whereof wee haue variety of instances
euen in our owne Iland, to omit <hi>Italy,</hi> which is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Theatre of Tragicke Conclusions in this kinde. It
is not long since we had one matchlesse President of
this stampe. <q>It sometimes pleased a young <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman,</hi>
whose fortunes had swell'd her high, to
settle her affection on a <hi>Gentleman</hi> of deseruing
parts, which he entertained with a generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall:
nothing was omitted that might any way
increase this respect, or second the height of their
ioyes. Continuall resort and frequent made them
inseparably one: No day so pleasing, as when they
were together; No houre so tedious as when they
were asunder. But how short is that moment of
vading happinesse, which hath in it a rellish of
lightnesse, and is not grounded on essentiall good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse!
Long had they not thus liued, and sociably
loued, but the <hi>Gentlewoman</hi> conceiued some pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
suspition, that her selfe was not sole soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignesse
of his heart, but that another was become
sharer in his loue. Neither was this Competitrice,
whom shee suspected, any other than her owne at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant,
whose Caskets shee secretly opened,
where she found a Ring of especiall note, which
shee had formerly bestowed on him. This confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
her Conceit, changed her reall loue into
mortall hate; which shee seconded with this tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke
act: Inuiting him one day to a Summer Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,

where in former times they were vsually
wont to repose, amidst of an amorous discourse,
she <hi>casually</hi> fixt her eye vpon three <hi>Lennets,</hi> one
whereof picking some priuet leaues purposely to

tenderly and intimately doe those poore fooles mate it?
Were it not pitty they should euer be diuided?</hi> Which

flew away, and left the Male alone, till an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other

and amorously wooed as hee had done before.

<hi>These poore Birds doe but according to their kinde. Yea,
but what doe ye kind men then, who ingage your loues,
interest your selues, empawne your soules to bee constant
where you professe loue, and performe nothing lesse than
what you professe most.</hi> Nor would her long intended
reuenge admit more liberty to her tongue; for
with a passionate enterbreath shee clozed this
speech with a fatall stabbe: leauing so much time
to her vnfortunate and disasterous Louer, as to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
to one of that sorrowfull family the ground
of her hate, the occasion of his fall, which hastned
on the dolefull Scene of her Tragedy.</q> Now to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
or abate these passionate furies, there is no better
meanes than to enter parley with reason; to chastise
all such innouating motions as disquiet the inward
repose of the mind; to vse the helpe of such whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
instructions, as may attemper the heat of those
indisposed and inordinate passions. Anger, being an
inflammation of blood about the heart, is such a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23374:42"/>
as to giue way to it, is to disclaime reason: much
wisedome is then required, mature aduice to bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
all assistants of <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> to be employed
before this <hi>Adder</hi> can be charmed. For wee shall
hardly see any one more forget themselues, than
when they are surprized with this <hi>Passion.</hi> Some you
shall obserue so amazed or entranced, as they become
wholly silenced: They cannot vtter an articulate
word to gaine a kingdome. Gladly would they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
their distaste, and menace reuenge, if their
tongues would giue them leaue, but wrath hath tyed
them to <hi>good behauiour.</hi> Others are so voluble of
tongue, as nothing can passe them vntouch'd, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperse
disgrace on such by whom they hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
wrong'd. If any infamy (which to that time
lay buried) offer it selfe to their memory, how they
ioy in the occasion of venting their malice on their
persons, be their Calumny seconded with words of
fowlest aspersion: Which sort of people the euerli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<hi>Pindarus</hi> termes persons of vnbounded and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brideled

take along with you these instructions: they will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
you much in the height and heat of your anger,
and allay your <hi>passion</hi> when it rageth and riseth into
hugest distemper. Forthwith, so soone as you shall
perceiue your selues moued, restraine your passion;
but if you cannot appease nor compose your inward
Commotion, at least restraine your tongue, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne
it silence, that if it speake no good, it may
speake no euill, lest being loose and set at liberty, it
vtter what <hi>wrath,</hi> and not <hi>reason</hi> dictates: More so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
and peacefull it will bee for you to retire

and will minister you comfort when you are
most distempered. So soone as your disquieted minds
begin to expostulate with the quality of your
wrongs, which your Enemy is apt to aggrauate and
exasperate, purposely to hasten your precipitate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge;
propose and set before you all the disgraces
which possibly you can suffer, and conferre them
with those that were aspersed on your Sauiour: this
will prepare you to suffer, teach you to conquer: for
Arrowes foreseene menace lesse danger.</p>
               <p>Likewise, when you consider the iniuries which
are done you by others, you may reflect vpon the
wrongs which are done by you vnto others: for
the consideration of your owne infirmity, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act
of you towards others an impunity. Weigh with
your selues how much others suffer of you, how
much God himselfe suffers of you, who, if he should
haue inflicted reuenge for euery particular offence,
you should haue perished long since. In a word, you
your selues are frequently grieuous, and displeasing
to your selues: Seeing then you are so distastefull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
your selues, as you must of necessity suffer many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries
and affronts from your selues, repine not at the
sufferings which are inflicted by others on our selues.</p>
               <p>You are likewise to consider these discommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
which arise from this <hi>Passion;</hi> which will arme
you with patience, if of your selues you haue any
compassion. What auailes it to be reuenged, after our

to be cured? Or disgrace tendred, by rendring
disgrace restored? Besides all this, see what hee
obtaineth, who <hi>anger</hi> obeyeth: 1. He is depriued of
the Crowne of glory, and reward of eternity: 2. He
becomes a Minister and Instrument of the Deuill:
3. He destroyeth his owne soule, that he might hurt
an others body:<note place="margin">Greg.</note> For a dispassionate or angry person
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23374:43"/>
is like vnto him, who that he may kill his Asse, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth
himselfe; or rather like him, who for huge
debts which he is not able to discharge, is throwne
into prison, and disdainefully refuseth any ones offer
to pay his debt for him. For by him, who doth you
wrong, is the debt which you owe to God, forgiuen,
if with patience you suffer the iniury which is done.
Whereas the angry person, who will bee his owne
reuenger, telleth God how and in what sort he is to
deale with him: that as he suffered not small disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
from another, so neither should small things be
suffered in him by God. As it is written, <hi>With what
measure you mete, the same shall be measured to you againe.</hi>

yet trust me, they are no trifles that are aym'd at in
those exchanges. Let nothing passe from you, that
may any way impeach you, or giue others aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
ouer you. Your innocent credulity (I am resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued)
is as free from conceit of ill, as theirs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
from intendment of good: but these inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
of Courtesies are not to be admitted, lest by
this familiarity, an Entry to affection bee opened,
which before was closed. It is dangerous to enter
parley with a beleagring enemy: it implyes want
or weakenesse in the besieged. Chastity is an <hi>inclosed
Garden,</hi> it should not be so much as assaulted, lest the
report of her spotlesse beauty become soyled. Such

most in danger, because none were left, whom they

those alwayes proued weakest, who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidentest

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23374:45"/>
daring sinne, and euer brings out some vntimely
birth, which viper-like depriues her vnhappy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
of life. I haue knowne diuers so resolute in their
vndertakings, so presuming of their womanish
strength, so constantly deuoted to a single life, as in
publike consorts they held it their choycest merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to giue loue the affront, to discourse of affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
with an imperious contempt, geere their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous
suiters out of Count'nance, and make a very
<hi>Whirligig</hi> of loue. But marke the conclusion of these
insulting spirits: they sport so long with loue, till
they fall to loue in earnest. A moment makes them
of Soueraigns Captiues, by slauing them to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruedly,
which at first they entertained so disdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.
The way then to preuent this malady, is to
weane you from consorting with folly. What an
excellent impregnable fortresse were <hi>Woman,</hi> did
not her <hi>Windowes</hi> betray her to her enemy? But
principally, when shee leaues her Chamber to walke
on the publike Theatre; when shee throwes off her
vaile, and giues attention to a merry tale; when she
consorts with youthfull bloud, and either enters par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
or admits of an enter-view with loue. It is most
true what the sententious moral somtimes obserued:
We may be in <hi>security,</hi> so long as we are sequestred
from <hi>society.</hi> Then, and neuer till then, begins the
<hi>infection</hi> to be dispersed, when the sound and sicke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

hazard not your Christian liberty. You shall encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

lest you prostitute your selues to their prostrate ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice.

What a serious intercourse or sociable dialogue is
betweene an amorous Mistresse and her Looking-glasse!
The poynt or pendent of her feather wags
out of a due posture; her Cheeke wants her true
tincture; her captious Glasse presents to her quicke

This is her CLOSET for LADIES, where

which is the period of her content, while purer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects

them, by a Ciuill and Morall vse of them, to
their benefit. They may chat and conuerse with a
modest freedome, so they doe not gossip it. For
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23374:49"/>
these <hi>Shee-Elpenors,</hi> and <hi>Feminine Epicures,</hi> who sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet
out their time in an vnwomanly excesse, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them the pale of our Common-weale. Be
they of what <hi>state</hi> soeuer, they are staines to their
<hi>Sexe</hi> for euer. Especially such, who carouse it in
deepe healths, reioyce at the colour of the wine, till
it sparkle in their veines, inflame their bloods, and
lay open a breach to the frailty of their Sexe. For
preuention whereof, we reade that kinsmen kissed
their kinswomen to know whether they drunke
wine or no, and if they had, to bee punished by
death, or banished into some Iland. <hi>Plutarch</hi> saith,
that if the Matrons had any necessity to drinke wine,
either because they were sicke or weake; the Senate
was to giue them licence, and not then in <hi>Rome</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but out of the City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macrobius</hi> saith, that there were two Senators in
<hi>Rome</hi> chiding, and the one called the others wife
an Adulteresse, and the other his wife a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard;
and it was iudged, that to be a drunkard was
more infamy. Truth is, they might ioyne hands as
mates of one society, for I haue seldome seene any
one subiect to Ebriety, preserue long vntainted the
honour of their chastity.</p>
               <p>Now for <hi>publike</hi> Employments, I know all are
not borne to be <hi>Deborahs,</hi> to beare virile spirits in
feminine bodies. Yet, in <hi>chusing the better part,</hi> you
may fit and accommodate your persons to <hi>publike
affaires,</hi> well sorting and suting with your ranke and
quality. <hi>Claudia</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> were nobly descended,
yet they <hi>publikely</hi> resorted, where they might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously

others in those principles wherein they were infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
It is said of the <hi>Vestall Virgins,</hi> that they first
learned what to doe; secondly, they did what they
had learned; thirdly, they instructed others to doe
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23374:50"/>
that which they had both done and learned. For

seene some in these places of <hi>publike repaire,</hi> expresse
such a well-seeming State without Apish formality,
as euery action deserued imitation of such as were in
their Company. Their Conceits were sweetly

These are such mirrors of modesty, patternes
of piety, as they would not for a world transgresse
the bounds of Ciuility. These are Matrons in their

But to draw in our sayles, touching the
prosecution of this branch; our reproofe shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
vpon two sorts especially, whose deuious course
drawne by an indirect line, may seeme to deserue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
worthily. The <hi>first</hi> are such, who giue
too easie raines to liberty; making <hi>Pleasure</hi> their
<hi>Vocation:</hi> as if they were created for no other end,
than to dedicate the first fruits of the day to their
<hi>Glasse;</hi> the residue to the <hi>Stage</hi> or <hi>Exchange.</hi> These,
no sooner haue they layd their <hi>Artificiall Complexion</hi>
on their adulterate faces, than they grow sicke for
their Coach. They must visit such a Lady, or what,
perchance, is worse, such a Lord. A minute now
in their Chambers seemes a moneth. Shall wee
display one of these in her colours? The <hi>Play-bills</hi>
must be brought her by her <hi>Pentioner:</hi> her eye views
and reuiewes, and out of her feminine iudgement
culls out one from among them which shee will see,
purposely to be seene. Much shee obserues not in it,
onely she desires to be obserued at it. Her <hi>Behauiour</hi>
in a <hi>Box,</hi> would make any one thinke shee were a
Bee in a box; shee makes such a buzzing and rusling.
This is her daily taske, till death enter the Stage and
play his part; whom shee entertaines with such
vnpreparednesse, as her <hi>extreme act</hi> presents obiects
of infinite vnhappinesse: <q>As it sometimes fared
with a Gentlewoman of our owne Nation, who so
daily bestowed the expence of her best houres vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Stage, as being surprized by sicknesse, euen
vnto death, she became so deafe to such as admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
her of her end, as shee clozed her <hi>dying scene</hi>
                     <pb n="54" facs="tcp:23374:51"/>
with a vehement calling on <hi>Hieronim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi>
                  </q> So inap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensiue
was shee of death at her end, because she
neuer meditated of death before her end. Now for
the <hi>second sort,</hi> they are meere <hi>Antipodes</hi> to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;
These are onely for <hi>profit,</hi> as the other were for
<hi>pleasure.</hi> These become so wedded to the world, as
they afflict their spirits, macerate their bodies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strange
themselues from offices of Neighbourhood,
to improue their reuenewes, by discouering their
too much prouidence to the world. And these are
commonly such, as are matcht to Schollers, whose
contemplation hath taken them from the world, and
recommended the mannagement of their estate to
their wife. Now to both these sorts let me addresse
my instruction: As I could not possibly approue of
the <hi>former,</hi> because they made <hi>pleasure</hi> their <hi>businesse:</hi>
so I cannot commend these, because they make not
their <hi>businesse</hi> a <hi>pleasure.</hi> Let these take heed, that
they incurre not that miserable insensibility, which

their sexe: <q>Who approaching neere her hauen,
and entring now her last Conflict with Nature,
was, by such as stood about her, earnestly moued
<hi>to recommend her selfe to God, tender the welfare of her
soule, and to make her saluation sure;</hi> thus briefly, but

a booke entituled <hi>The Gift of feare,</hi> how a Religious
Diuine comming to a certaine Vsuresse, to aduise
her of the state of her soule, and instruct her in
the way to saluation, at such time as shee lay lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing
in her bed of affliction; told her, how
there were three thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>gs by her to bee necessarily
performed, if euer shee hoped to be saued: First,
she was to be <hi>contrite</hi> in heart; secondly, shee was
to <hi>confesse</hi> her sinnes; thirdly, shee was to make
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23374:51"/>
                     <hi>restitution</hi> according to her meanes. Whereto shee
thus replyed; <hi>Two of those first I will doe willingly:
but to doe the last, I shall hold it a difficulty; for should
I make restitution, what would remain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> to raise my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren

<hi>Without these three you cannot be saued. Yea but,</hi> quoth
shee, <hi>Doe our Learned men and Scriptures say so?
Ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

she) <hi>whether they say true or no, for I will restore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
                  </q>
And so resoluing, fearefully dyed, fearing
pouerty temporall, more than eternall, which shee
was of necessity to suffer, (without Gods infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding
mercy) for preferring the care of her po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity,
before the honour of her Maker.</p>
               <p>To be short, the <hi>former sort</hi> deserues reproofe, for
making <hi>pleasure</hi> their <hi>vocation;</hi> the <hi>latter</hi> for barring
<hi>businesse</hi> all <hi>recreation.</hi> A discreet temper will mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
both these; the <hi>first,</hi> by holding <hi>pleasure</hi> a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stime,
and no <hi>businesse;</hi> the <hi>last,</hi> by applying a cure to
an incessant care, and immixing some <hi>pleasure</hi> with
<hi>businesse,</hi> to attemper it, lest it incline to heauinesse.
Both which, equally concurring, are euer conferring
to the labouring mind, inward quietnesse.</p>
               <p>COmplexion inclosed in a box, giues no tincture
to the Cheeke, nor morall precepts vnapplyed,
beauty to the minde. Thus farre haue we proceeded
in directions of <hi>Behauiour;</hi> insisting on such remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable

not you be caught by indiscretion? Imitate nothing
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23374:52"/>
seruilely, it detracts from your <hi>gentility.</hi> I haue noted
some of our Chambermaids take vpon them such an
vnbeseeming state, when they came to visit their
poore friends in the Country, as they punctually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
both gate and garb of their mincing Mistresses
in the City. To their Parish-Church they repaire to

they will not sticke to returne this maiesticke an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer:

that appropriates to euery peculiar degree their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

which agree not with the quality of the

that shee may hide the want or greatnesse of
her teeth. Another contracts with her Tayler, lest
<hi>Nemesis</hi> should bee seene sitting on her shoulder. A
third weares her Gowne with a carelesse loosenesse,
to couer or colour her bodies crookednesse. This,
with <hi>Fabulla,</hi> buyes an artfull Periwig to supply her
art-fallen haire. That enazures her seered veines,
embolsters her decayed brests, to purchase a sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hart.
What an <hi>affected</hi> state this generally-infected

of phantasticke <hi>Behauiours.</hi> But these are none of
<hi>Vertues</hi> followers. Would you bee prayse-worthy?
Vertue to her selfe is her chiefest prayse, her choy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest
prize. There is nothing comparably precious to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23374:52"/>
a Continent soule. <hi>Affectation</hi> shee will not admit,
for her habit; both her <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Behauiour</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and not enforced; natiue and not apishly intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.
Shee cannot wooe a wanton Louer with a
dissembled blush, nor promise more with an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
presence, than shee resolues to admit with a
spotlesse Conscience. Outward semblances, if light,
shee holds apparant blemishes to her life. Her <hi>life,</hi>
as it is a <hi>line</hi> to her selfe, so shee would haue it a <hi>light</hi>
to others. <hi>Lacides,</hi> Prince of <hi>Argos,</hi> was accounted
lasciuious onely for his sleeke lookes, and mincing
gate. So <hi>Pompey,</hi> because hee vsed to scratch his
head with one finger, albeit very Continent and
modest. Beleeue it, though your <hi>Person</hi> be the <hi>Booke,</hi>
your <hi>Behauiour</hi> is the <hi>Index.</hi> Which will require a
large <hi>Comment,</hi> if it expresse it selfe in ought proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
incontinent. Now, for as much as nothing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
seemes you, more commendably adornes you, or
more absolutely accommodates you, than what is
natiue and vnaffected, so it be by <hi>Education</hi> seasoned:
be your owne Women; dis-value all apish formality;
resort not to the Temple to take a patterne of some
new fashion: modest discretion blusheth at such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uile
imitation. What you see in another, may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
them, which would not become another. The
Asse in the fable seeing the dogge fawne and leap vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Master, thought it would beseeme him, but
sorting not with his nature, it got him a beating for
his labour.</p>
               <p>Now to distinguish betwixt an enforced and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected
<hi>Behauiour,</hi> it is most easie; the very first blush
will discouer the one by the other. You shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue

on which the beames of Ciuill society seldome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect,
wee shall finde nothing but barbarisme and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociable
wildnesse. Education is the improuer of the
one, and producer of the other. Wee shall euer see
<hi>Complement</hi> shine most in places eminent. There are
<hi>Obiects</hi> fit for such <hi>Subiects:</hi> Such as expect it, and
bestow their whole dayes practice in exercise of it:
These aspire to the nature or <hi>definition</hi> of no art more

<hi>Complement.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some haue held, it consisted in congies, cringes,
and salutes; of which errour, I would this age
wherein we liue, did not too much labour: others,
meerely in a painted and superficiall discourse; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
they so miserably tyed themselues to words, as
they tyred the impatient hearers with foolish repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions,
friuolous extrauagancies; being, in a word,
so affianced to the <hi>shadow,</hi> as they forgot the <hi>substance.</hi>
The last, which were onely <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>complete</hi> Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
held a seemely gracefull presence, beautifide
with a natiue comelinesse, the deseruingst <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
that could attend vs. Certainely, if we should
exactly weigh the deriuation of the word, we could
not imagine so meanely of it, as to consist meerely
of words, or anticke workes. It was first intended
to distinguish betwixt persons of ciuill and sauage

carriage: yea, to appropriate a title of preeminence to
such, who exceeded others in grounds or pecepts of
Morality; whose liues appeared as Lampes to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
others, and consequently perpetuate the memory
of themselues. Many noble and eminent Ladies are
recorded both in diuine and humane writ to haue ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
in this <hi>Complement</hi> of honour. These knew
the <hi>definition</hi> of it, and moulded their conuersation to
it: They knew what belonged to a posture of state;
they could court it without apish curiosity; embrace
loue with a reserued modesty; expresse themselues
<hi>complete</hi> without singularity. Forraigne fashions they
distasted; painted Rhetoricke they disrelished; <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Complement</hi> was all they affected. Loue they could
without dissembling; discourse without affecting;
shew curt'sie without congying; still retaining
what was best beseeming. In the Court they resided
to better it; not a straid looke could promise a loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Louer least hope of a purchase; nor Coynesse dishear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
a faithfull seruant from his affectionate purpose.
They knew not what it was to protest in iest; to
walke in the clouds; to domineere ouer their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues,
or entertaine many Suitors. They freed <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement</hi>
of dissimulation, made vertue their Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone
to affection; their actions were dedicated to
good ends: by which meanes they made <hi>God</hi> and
<hi>goodmen</hi> their friends. Nor doe I feare it, but that

were held for vsefull supporters, but no <hi>Complemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi>
postures. New-minted words made not their
tongues more <hi>complete;</hi> nor an Outlandish Salute
their Persons more admired. Virgin-modesty made
resolution her <hi>Steletto</hi> to guard her honour. Plumes
and Feathers were held light dressings for staid
minds; suspicious trimmings for stale Maids. Actors
might weare them in their presentments vpon the
Stage, but modest Matrons were neuer allowed to
weare them in the state. Women were admitted to
haue Painters, but not to be their owne painters:

yet these, without any helpe of art, still retained
their owne natiue features. It was the <hi>Complement</hi>
of that age to deliuer their minde freely without

the street demurely without gazing. Wherein (with

is a second Nature, and this hath giuen that

to entertaine time with their amorous seruants;
redart wanton tales with light blushes; passe a whole

made beguilers of time; and these mixt now and then
with such lasciuious passages, as modesty might iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

knowes not what secret traines are laid for credulous
women, vnder these pretenced parlies? Doe you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
how their tongues are tipt with your prayses;
how they honour your shadowes; admire the earth
you tread on; adore the Ayre you breath on; and
with their ayrie applauses so gild you, as in the end
they palpably gull you; leauing you no lesse misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
deluded, than themselues seased of what their

And all this in such a proper and familiar manner, as
such who are tied to <hi>Complement,</hi> may aspire to it, but
neuer attaine it. Hee that hath once tasted of the
fountaine <hi>Clitorius,</hi> will neuer afterward drinke any
wine. Surely, howsoeuer this ciuil and familiar forme
of dialect may seeme but as pure running water in
comparison of <hi>Complement,</hi> which, like <hi>Nectar,</hi>
streames out in Conduits of delight to the humorous
hearer: yet our discreet <hi>Complementer</hi> preferres the
pure fountaine before the troubled riuer. It is true,
that many fashions, which euen these later times

Yet in the acceptance of these, you are not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
whatsoeuer these finer times haue brought

subiected, so as nothing but what is rare

decay of fashion, or make old ones new, and so

such a fashion generally affecting; such a dres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

space couered with contempt. What you obserue
then to be most ciuill in others, affect it; such an <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit</hi>
needs not to be <hi>refined,</hi> which cannot be bettered.
Fashion is a kinde of frenzy; it admires that now,
which it will laugh at hereafter, when brought to
better temper. Ciuility is neuer out of fashion; it
euer retaines such a seemely garbe, as it conferres a
grace on the wearer, and enforceth admiration in the
beholder. Age cannot deface it; Contempt disgrace
it; nor grauity of iudgement (which is euer held a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

Be thus minded, and this <hi>Complement</hi> in you will

So may you shew holinesse in your life, enioy happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse

And hence appeares mans misery. That those

True it is, that the Sunne, Moone, and Starres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

there is no pace for widowes: for in such meetings

to publike Courts, for redresse of our publike
wrongs? What of all this? Doe not complaine that
you are desolate or alone, Modesty affecteth silence
and secrecy; a chaste woman solitarinesse and priuacy.
If you haue businesse with the Iudge of any Court,
and you much feare the power of your aduersary, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

               </p>
               <p>This inestimable inheritance of Chastity is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
more to be esteemed, and with greater care
preserued by <hi>Widowes</hi> then <hi>Wiues:</hi> albeit, by these
neither to be neglected, but highly valued. Out of
that ancient experience which time hath taught
them, their owne obseruations inform'd them, and
the reuerence of their condition put vpon them;
they are to instruct others in the practice of piety;
reclaime others from the pathes of folly, and with a
vertuous conuoy guide them to glory. It would lesse
become them to tricke and trimme themselues gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
or gorgeously, then yong girles, whose beauty
and outward ornament is the hope and anchor-hold
of their preferment: for by these doe the husbands
seeke, and hope in time to get what they seeke.
Whereas, it were much more commendable for wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dowes
neither to seeke them, nor being offred, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them: le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> enforced by necessity, or wonne by
importunacy, or giuing way to their frailty, they
make exchange of their happy estate for a continuate
scene of misery. A widow ought to pray feruently,
to exercise workes of deuotion frequently, that the
benefit of her prayer redound to her effectually
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:23374:80"/>
and fruitfully; and not returne backe from the throne
of God drily or emptily. For I would (according to
<hi>Menanders</hi> opinion) haue a widow not onely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane
her selfe chastely and honestly, but likewise to
giue examples of her b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>amelesse life to such as heare
her instructions attentiuely. For she ought to be as a
Glasse to young Maids, wherein they may discerne
their crimes.</p>
               <p>Now I hold her a chaste Widow, who though
she haue opportunity to doe it, and be suited by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
vnto it, yet will not suffer her brest to
harbour an vnchaste thought, or consent vnto it. In
that Countrey where I was borne (saith <hi>Lud. Viues</hi>)
we vsually terme such widowes the greatest associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
and assistants of vices, whose too much delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
in bringing vp their children, makes them oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times-depraued,
and to all inordinate liberty addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
Wherefore, I approue well of their course, who
recommend the care of their children to some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and well-disposed person. For such is the too
tender affection of mothers towards their children,
and so much are they blinded with the loue of them,
as they thinke they treat them too roughly, albeit
they embrace them neuer so tenderly.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> writing vnto <hi>Saluina,</hi> saith; The
chastity of a woman is fraile and fading<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like a flower
quickly perishing and vading, with the least gust
or blast of aduerse Fortune failing, if not falling:
especially, where her age is apt for vice, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of her husband wants to afford her aduice;
from whose assistance, her honour deriues her best
succour and supportance. Who, if shee haue a great
family, many things are required of her, and to bee
found in her, to minister supply to the necessity of
time, and vse of affaires, wherein she stands interes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Requisite therefore it were, that shee made
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:23374:80"/>
choyce of some one discreetly ripe both in yeares
and inward gifts, by whose honest integrity her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
might bee better mannaged, with more dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
attended, and to the woman lesse occasion of
disgrace obiected.</p>
               <p>For I haue knowne very many women, who albeit
they spent their daies continually within their owne
doores, yet haue fallen into reproach either by some
persons obseruing them, or of their owne families
disposed by them; for suffering their seruants goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad
to neatly, arguing thereby a neglect of their
family: so as the handmaids pride brought her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse
into suspition of contemning her honour.</p>
               <p>Sure it is, that an honest woman, whose fame is
her highest prize, requires nothing else, desires no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, than to satisfie her husbands bequest,
though dead: honouring him with a due Comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moration
and admiration of his vertues: for the liues
of those that dye, consist in the memory of those that
liue. So did <hi>Anthonia</hi> the daughter of <hi>Marc. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi>
and wife to <hi>Drusus:</hi> leading all the remainder of
her life with her stepmother, and retaining alwayes
the remembrance of her dead husband. The like did
<hi>Liuia,</hi> who left both her house and land, that shee
might dwell vnder one roofe with <hi>Noemia:</hi> fearing,
perhaps, lest the Maids of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

lasciuiously wanton and inordinate, might by their
lightnesse preiudice her honor, which she incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
valued aboue any treasure. See you not hereby
our discourse (<hi>Gentlewomen</hi>) what excellent Lights
darted out from those darke times! <hi>Estimation</hi> was
their best portion; nothing of equall prize vnto it
vertues were their choycest Ornaments, which they
preseru'd with such constancy, as feare of death could
not depriue them of them, though after death they
had scarce the least glimpse of immortality.</p>

An excellent Commandresse was this Lady of

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:23374:89"/>
that it becomes not a Maid to speake of marriage in

modesty or shamefastnesse. There is a pretty pleasing
kinde of wooing drawne from a conceiued but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
<hi>Fancy;</hi> which, in my opinion, suits well with
these amorous younglins: they could wish with all
their hearts to be euer in the presence of those they

truest thoughts fully, yet would they not haue their
bashfull loues finde discouery. They would be seene,
yet seeme obscured; loue, but not disclose it; see
whom they loue, but not bee eyed. This the Poet

               <p>Now in this Subiect of <hi>Fancy,</hi> as there is nothing
more dangerous than entertaining it without due
and deliberate aduice: so there is nothing growes
more generally fatall to the indiscreet Louer, than by
grounding affection on outward respects, without

Loue in an equall poize. There bee many high and

will not onely discourse but discusse, before shee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
so mysterious and honorable estate. Disparity
in descent, fortunes, friends, with other like respects,
many times beget distraction of mindes. Whence it
was, that <hi>Pittacus</hi> of <hi>Muylene,</hi> being intreated by

where you professe, so long as you affect change.
Vowes deliberately aduised, and religiously groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
are not to be dispenc'd with. But say, you neuer
vowed: haue you made outward professions of loue,
and entertained a good opinion of that obiect in your

Now, I would haue you, when your desires are

               <p>For the first, wee may very properly reduce the

Thus aspiring to the knowledge of good and

euill, became to her and her posterity euill. The <hi>Eye</hi>
is a <hi>Liuing glasse,</hi> but if wee make it a <hi>false glasse,</hi> it
will neither represent vs truly, nor discouer our ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes
freely; but make that seeme faire which is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
and vgly. By this meanes, many good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
become <hi>Eye-soares</hi> vnto vs, which, if clearely
viewed, would like a soueraigne <hi>Eye-bright,</hi> restore
sight vnto vs. Fifthly, <hi>Consorts</hi> are theeues of time,
they will rob you of opportunity, the best treasure
time can afford you, if you suffer them to incroach
on you and abuse you. Chuse such then for your
<hi>Consorts,</hi> of whom you may haue assured hope, that
they will either better you, or bee bettered by you.
Chuse such, whom you may admire both when you
see them and heare them: when you see their liuing
Doctrine, and heare their wholesome instruction.
Lastly, <hi>Luscious fare</hi> is the fuell of euery inordinate
concupiscence. Nothing so much feeds it, nor insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sates
the vnderstanding by delighting in it. By re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of this, you shall learne to moderate your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires.
Whence you may reioyce, yet in him, who is
your ioy, if you can liue sparingly, and embrace the
meanes that may chastise in you all sensuality: for by
your spare life is lust extinguished, vertue nourished,
the minde strengthened, the vnderstanding to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly
things raysed. Yea, abstinence auaileth much
for preseruing health of body and length of life.

               <p>Now to descend to the second <hi>branch</hi> of our diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
in this <hi>Obseruation;</hi> wee might here enumerate
those many odious and inhumane effects, which haue
and doe daily arise from the violence of this <hi>Wanton
fancy</hi> or <hi>Wandring frenzy;</hi> and what tragicke euents
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:23374:94"/>
it hath in all times produc'd: but they would seeme
relations too full of horror to your modest and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Natures. Onely let mee tell you, if you desire
to be satisfied in subiects of that kinde, our <hi>Italian</hi>
Stories will afford you variety: Where indiscreet
Loue clozeth her dolefull Scene with so miserable an
<hi>Exit,</hi> as no Pencill can expresse any picture to more
life, than an historicall line hath drawne out the web
of their miseries. So as, that ancient Adage might
seeme verified: That from slaues and miserable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
God hath taken away the one halfe of their <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to cure this desperate malady (though to you
the cure, I hope, be needlesse, being free from all such
violent distempers;) the best and soueraignst receit
is to fortifie the weaknes of your sexe with strength
of resolution; that, with incessant deuotion. Be not
too liberall in the bestowing of your fauors; nor too
familiar in publike conuerse. Presume not too much
on the strength of a weake Fort. Make a Contract
with your eyes not to wander abroad, lest they bee
catch'd in comming home. Treat not of loue too
freely; play not wagges with the blinde boy; hee
has a dangerous ayme, though he hath no eyes. Sport
not with him, that may hurt you; play not with
him, that would play on you. Your Sports will turne
to an ill iest, when you are wounded in earnest: the
<hi>Fly</hi> may be then your Embleme:
<q>
                     <l>So long the foolish <hi>Fly</hi> playes with the flame,</l>
                     <l>Till her light wings are cinged in the same.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Fly to an higher Sphere: you are yet vntouch'd;
this <hi>wandring frenzy</hi> hath neuer yet surpriz'd you;
preuent the meanes, and it shall neuer inuade you.
Be not such foes to your selues, as to purchase your
owne disquiet. Examples you haue of all sorts, both
to allure and deterre you. Pure loue admits no staine.

               <p>It is not so hard to giue comfortable counsel to the

would haue you, whose more noble parts promise

occasions of sorrow. It is the condition of an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate

Marriage-night. Affaires of such weight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence
are not to be entertained without due ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice,

you plaid a little too long with the flame? Haue you

Haue you suffered your heart not onely to thinke of

Continuance of time, with discontinuance of his

These vnsociable Natures, who many times

contempt, and excludes them from all choyce, Or
<hi>Danaë</hi>-like, liue immured in their Chamber, til their

much from the relenting disposition of their Sexe.
It is their honor to be woo'd &amp; won. To be discreet
in their <hi>choyce,</hi> and to entertaine their <hi>choyce</hi> without
<hi>Change.</hi> Of such I speake, who haue not dedicated
their dayes to Virginity; which is such a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
as it aspires to an Angelicall perfection. Good,
(saith venerable <hi>Bede</hi>) is coniugall chastity, better
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:23374:97"/>
is viduall continency, but best is the perfection of
Virginity. Yea, Virginity exceeds the condition of
humane nature, being that, by which man resembles
an Angelicall Creature. Wee reade likewise, that the
<hi>Vnicorne,</hi> when he can be taken by no force nor sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till

               <p>To those onely I direct my discourse, who haue
a mind to take themselues vnto the world, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine
their <hi>Louer:</hi> but it is with such coolenesse,
as it driues their dispassionate <hi>Sweet-hart</hi> into strange
extremes. And this proceeds commonly from an
ouer-weening Conceit, which these dainty Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
haue of their owne worth: with the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
whereof they become so infinitely taken, as
they can finde none worthy their choyce. Of this
disdainefull opinion was that vnhappy Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who after many faire fortunes tendred, Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
of deseruing quality reiected, made her incestu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

               <p>A crime detestable euen to Barbarians and bruit
beasts. Insomuch as, it is reported of the <hi>Camell,</hi>
that they vsually hood-winke him, when at any
time they bring his mother vnto him; which act he
no sooner knowes, than hee tramples her vnder his

                  </gap>tures. You,
whose discreet affections haue cast anchor, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
choyce of some deseruing Louer; afflict him
not with needlesse delayes; if he merit your choyce,
one day is too long to deferre him; if vndeseruing,
taxe your owne indiscretion to rashly to entertaine
him.</p>
               <p>Is it bashfull modesty that with-holds you? I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
it; it well becomes you. Chastity cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse

it selfe in a fairer Character, than in blushing
lines of louing shame fastnesse. Is it consent of friends
that detaines you? I approue that too; These rites
are best accomplished, when they are with consent
and consort of friends solemnized. But if the ground
of your delay trench either vpon some future ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectance
of better fortunes; or indifferency of
affection in respect of your Choyce: the issue can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
possibly proue well, being built vpon such
weake grounds. For, to insist cursorily vpon either
of these two; Shall a deceiuing hope of preferre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
dispossesse him of your heart, whom personall
deserts make worthy of your loue? Looke to it;
Such fortunes cannot purchase you content, which
are got with an aged husbands contempt. It shewes
a seruile nature, to cashiere a faithfull Louer, because
he is poorer; and to preferre another lesse desertfull,
because hee is richer. This inconstancy cannot suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
well, because the foundation is grounded ill.</p>

day out of date? This, indeed, is such a coole and
easie-tempered Loue, as it will neuer mad you; yet,
trust me, it may well delude you. <hi>Fancy</hi> will not so be
playd with. You will obiect, I imagine, your sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks
are too queasie to digest Loue. Why then did
you euer seeme so greedily to feed on that, which
your stomackes now cannot well digest? Haue you

and bestow your eye on the <hi>Picture.</hi> Such impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

               <p>
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> being much in loue with <hi>Apelles,</hi> as
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:23374:98"/>
one highly rapt with the exquisitenesse of his art,
proposed him that Modell for a taske, which hee of
all others, affected most; commanding him on a

which <hi>Apelles</hi> hauing done, such impression wrought
the <hi>Picture</hi> in his affection, as <hi>Apelles</hi> fell in loue with
her, which <hi>Alexander</hi> perceiuing, gaue him her. It
is incredible, what rare effects were sometimes
drawne from a <hi>Morian-Picture,</hi> being onely hung

                  </gap>, as none of a more holding temper; so hot, as
none of a more lasting feruour: yet becomes her
splendour darkened, her vigor weakened, her feruor
cooled, when she is in a cold brest entertained. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble,
rather, the <hi>Iuniper-tree,</hi> whose coale is the
hottest, and whose shadow is the coolest: be hot in
your <hi>affection,</hi> but coole in your <hi>passion.</hi> If you finde

any thing which vrgeth passion, quench it: contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riwise,

feed in you loues heat; but represse in you all
passionate hate. Take into your more serious thoghts,
a view of his deserts whom you affect: increase the
conceit of them by supposing more than hee expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth.
The imagination of <hi>Loue</hi> is strong, and works
admirable effects in a willing subiect. Yet in all this,
let not one straid thought wrong your Mayden-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
so much, as to suggest to you a straine of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:

vnion arising; how griefes will be attempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by one anothers suffering; how ioyes will bee
augmented by one anothers sharing. These thoughts
cannot but well become you; nor otherwise chuse
than with a pure affection inflame you; nor receiue
lesse than free acceptance from you.</p>
               <p>Thus may that Loue, which seem'd before to

solemniz'd, which was honoured by Christ, with his

In a <hi>Vine,</hi> wild and luxurious branches are to bee

neuer to be expected any fruitfull increase of vertues,
till there be weeded out of it all the thornes of vices.
The difference betwixt a <hi>Wise</hi> and <hi>wilde</hi> Loue, is this:
the one euer deliberates before it loue; the other
loues before it deliberate. The first question that she
askes, who <hi>wisely</hi> loues: <q>Is he, who is here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
to my choyce, of good repute? Is he rich
in the endowments of his minde?</q> Next question
shee askes, are of a lower siege: <q>May his perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
giue content? Are his fortunes such, as may
not beget in loue a contempt?</q> Thus beginnes shee
that loues <hi>wisely,</hi> with goods inward, and ends with
outward; whereas, shee that loues <hi>wildly,</hi> beginnes
with outward, and ends, or else neuer remembers the
inward: <q>Is hee, you tender to mee, of promising
personage? Is hee neat in his cloathes? Complete
in his dresse? Can he Court mee in good words?
and perfume them with sweet protests? Can hee
vsher me gracefully in the street? and in his very
pace expresse a reserued state?</q> Next question shee
askes, must be neare the same verge: <q>Is he rich in
Manors? Hath not fortune made him a younger
brother? Can he, to buy himselfe honour, pawne
the Long-acre? May his swelling meanes furnish
me of Coach, Caroach, and daily fit mee for some
<hi>Exchange</hi> trifles? I haue a moneths mind to see the
man!</q> Hee cannot but deserue my loue. Wherein
shee sayes well, for in very deed hee could deserue
little else. Now as the <hi>former,</hi> seldome bestowes her
selfe, but where shee findes content; so the <hi>latter,</hi>
seldome or neuer, but either she with her Choyce, or
her Choyce with her falls into contempt. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is, this <hi>wilde</hi> Girle neuer cares for more than to
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:23374:100"/>
be married. If she may but see that day, it accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
her content: though shee haue but one Comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
day all her life. Yea, it is as well as can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from her hands, if she attaine that <hi>style</hi> without

the worst, they were married betime, lest they
marre themselues before time. Albeit, moderate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint,
seasonable aduice (presupposing some seeds
of grace to worke on) haue wrought singular effects
in many of these <hi>wilde-ones,</hi> who afterwards became
graue and modest Matrons.</p>
               <p>To you then, <hi>kind-hearts,</hi> am I to recommend some
necessary cautions, which carefully obserued, may
make you wiser than you thought of; and cause you
haue a tender care of that, which before you had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
mind of. Your brests are vnlock'd, your tongues
vnty'd; you cannot loue, but you must shew it; nor
conceiue a kinde thought, but you must tell it. The
<hi>Index</hi> of your <hi>hearts</hi> you carry both in your <hi>tongues</hi>
and <hi>eyes;</hi> for shame, learne <hi>silence</hi> in the one, and <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy</hi>
in the other. Will you giue power to an insul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
Louer, to triumph ouer your weakenesse; or
which is worse, to worke on the opportunity of
your Lightnesse? Doe not; rather ramme vp those
<hi>portells</hi> which betray you to your enemy, and preuent
his entry by your vigilancy. Keepe home and stray
not, lest by gadding abroad, you incurre <hi>Dinahs</hi> fate.
You haue Consorts of your owne sexe to passe time
withall; their society wil teach you to forget, what is
better forgot than kept. Let not a straid thought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray
your innocency. <hi>Checke</hi> your madding <hi>Fancy,</hi>
and if it vse resistance, curbe it with restraint. It will
doe excellently well, if you forbeare to resort to pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of publike meeting; till you haue drawne vp and
seal'd a Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enant with your eyes, to see naught that
they may not lawfully couet. These, when they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:23374:100"/>
they breed in the heart, a dangerous distemper.
Lastly, addresse your imployment euer to something
that is good; so shall your <hi>fantacy</hi> finde nought to
worke vpon that is ill. This shall afford you more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
than the whole worlds freedome can afford
you.</p>
               <p>Now to you, <hi>Coy ones,</hi> whom either <hi>coldnesse</hi> of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
hath benummed, or <hi>coynesse</hi> hath made subtill to
dissemble it. You can looke and like, and turne ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
way, where you like most. No obiect of loue
can take you, till it ouertake you. Be not wise too
much. True affection cannot endure such dissimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Diuide not him, whom you loue, into such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes:
you may be modest, and spare a great deale
of this <hi>Coynesse;</hi> It is the rule of Charity to doe as
you would be done to. Now, would it content you
to be entertained with disdaine, where your deserts
merit acceptance? Rectifie this then on your selues,
which you would not haue done by another to your
selues. It is an ill requitall, to recompence fancy with
contempt, or constant loue with disdaine. This were
to incurre ingratitude, a vice so odious, as no age
could finde euer ought more vnciuilly impious. I do

               <p>Let me now reflect vpon you, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> whose
<hi>generous</hi> birth should bee adorned with <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rtuous</hi>
worth, and so make you mouing Obiects of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
both in life and death.</p>
               <p>Are you nobly descended? Ennoble that descent
with true desert. Doe not thinke that the priuilege
of greatnesse, can bee any subterfuge to guiltinesse.
Your more ascending honour requires more than a
Common lustre. In places of publike resort you chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
precedency, and it is granted you. Shall the
highest place haue the least inward grace? No; let
not a word fall from you, that may vnbeseeme you.
Others are silent when you discourse; let it be worth
their attention; lest a presumption of your owne
worth draw you into some friuolous excursion.
There is not an accent which you vtter, a sentence
you deliuer, any motion in your carriage or gesture,
which others eye not, and eying assume not. Your
Retinue is great; your family gracious; your acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
should be the life of the one, and line of directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the other. To see a light Lady descending from
a noble Family, is a Spectacle of more spreading in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
than any subiect of inferiour quality. I cannot
approue of this Apish kinde of formality, which
many of our better sort vse; it detracts from their
<hi>descent,</hi> to make <hi>affectation</hi> their <hi>Tutresse.</hi> They were
free-borne; nothing then that is seruile can become
them. It is nothing to retaine the fauour or feature
of your <hi>Ancestors,</hi> and to estrange you from that
which truly dignifi'd your <hi>Ancestors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vertues haue more liuing Colours, and are secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:23374:104"/>
with more lasting honours than any outward
beauties. You deceiue your selues, if you thinke that
honour receiued her first life from descent; no, It
was <hi>demerit</hi> that made <hi>descent</hi> capable of honour. A
Pedigree argues your <hi>Gentility:</hi> but had not some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
action beene, you had neuer attained to any
noble Pedigree. For <hi>Gentility</hi> is not to be measured
by antiquity of time, but precedency in worth. If
brackish or troubled water seldome come from a pure
Spring; wild and vnsauory fruit from a good tree;
whence is it, that noble Predecessors, whose pure
blood was neuer corrupted with any odious staine,
should bring forth such degenerating scienes? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
this generally proceeds from the too much liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that is granted to our youth; whose inclinations,
though otherwise good and equally disposed, are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
by <hi>Custome,</hi> which becomes a <hi>Second nature,</hi>
miserably depraued. Society they affect, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
them; repaire to publike places they admit,
and this corrupts them. Those eminent examples
which their Noble Progenitors left them, become
buried with them. They comply with the time;
<hi>Vertue</hi> (they say) can hardly subsist, where <hi>Vice</hi> is in
highest request. What though <hi>Plato</hi> aduise them to
make choyce of the best way of liuing, which may
be easily effected by assiduate vse and daily custome:
they haue learned to inuert his rule, by affecting that
custome most, which tends to the practice of vertue
least. Besides, there is another reason which may be
probably alleaged, why <hi>generous descents</hi> become so
much corrupted; and vertuous Parents by vitious
Children so frequently seconded. Our Nobler wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
though in other respects truly imitable, and
for their vertuous Conuersation admirable; come
short in one peculiar duty, which euen Nature exacts
of them, and which being duely perform'd, would,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:23374:104"/>
doubtlesly, no lesse enable and ennoble them who
are descended from them, than any particular, were
it neuer so powerfull, that could informe them. These
which are mothers by generation, are seldome their
Nurcing-mothers by education. No maruell then,
if they degenerate, when they partake of the natures
of other women. Though their owne mothers blood
streame through their veines, a strangers milke must
feed them, which makes them participate of their
<hi>nature,</hi> as they are fed with their <hi>substance.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
the Nurses milke is receiued, the Nurses man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
are likewise retained. Whence it was, that
<hi>Chrysippus</hi> expresly commanded that the very best
and wisest Nurses should be made choice of; that what
<hi>good blood</hi> had infused, might not by <hi>ill milke</hi> be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
It was the ioynt aduice both of <hi>Plutarch</hi> and
<hi>Pha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orine,</hi> that a mother should bee her childrens
Nurse: because, commonly, with the milke of the
Nurse, they sucke the quality or condition of her
life. Yea, according to ancient Decree, women were
bound to nurse their owne children, and not to ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e
any other women (vnlesse necessity enforc'd them) to
nurse them.</p>
               <p>Let this then bee rectifi'd; yee, whose Noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents
haue made you eminent in the eye of the
world; and whom Gods blessing hath made fruitfull
Mothers, to bring forth a faire and hopefull increase
vnto the world: nurse them with your owne milke;
this will expresse in you a motherly care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to them;
&amp; beget in them a greater measure of child-like loue
to you. Your care, the more it is parentall, will exact
of them a loue more faithfull and filiall. Nurse them,
I say, with the milke of your owne brests to feed
them; with the milke of your owne liues to informe
them. So shall their actions proue them to bee your
Successours; when they shall not onely <hi>deriue</hi> their

deserue her enuy; none so rich in the City, as may
beget in her an earthly desire; none so repos'd in
the Countrey, as to induce her to change her state.
Shee is infinitely happy, in that shee aymes at no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

scornes to stoupe to ought vnworthy of her: it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
her to contemplate that on earth, which she is

her; but all her pollicie cannot worke on <hi>vertues</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy.
Content is her Crowne; Contempt of the

had taken her selfe to a Cloyster-life, and seemed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
deuout; so as shee vsually said to her Confessor,
who came often vnto her, to heare her Confession,
and partake of her Deuotion: <q>
                     <hi>Good father, pray vnto
the Lord for mee; for I am a woman so euill, yea, euen
so vtterly nought, as I much feare left the Lord punish
others for my sinnes.</hi> Vpon this, the Priest out of a
discreet zeale, desired to try whether there were
in her the foundation of true humility or no. Next
time therefore, that shee vttered the like words
vnto him, saying; <hi>That shee was the very worst of all
women;</hi> the Priest forthwith answered: <hi>I haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
times at many hands beard thus much of thee before
this.</hi> Whereat she being presently incensed, replyed:
<hi>You lye in your throat: And whosoeuer hath told you, or
reporteth such things of mee, are all lyers.</hi> To attemper
which immoderate passion, the Priest humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
her this answer: <hi>Now I perceiue thy pride and
hypocrisie; for as much as thou speakest that of thy selfe,
which thou disdainest any other should speake of thee.
And this is no signe of true humility, but of inward pride
and grosse hypocrisie.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>These dissembled, be they neuer so assiduate, sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances,
are no colours for <hi>Vertues crest.</hi> They must
be dyed in graine, or they will not hold. These, who
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xpresse modesty in their outward carriage, are
good examples to those that consort with them; yet
if their priuate Parler be a witnesse of their dishonor,
they deface the figure of goodnesse in themselues.
<hi>Vertue</hi> consists note in seeming, nor piety in appearing
but practising. What is it to bee outwardly retyred
from the world, and inwardly affianced to the world?
How are those women in <hi>Turkie</hi> affected, that most
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:23374:106"/>
part of the yeare come not abroad? Those <hi>Italian</hi> and
<hi>Spanish</hi> Dames, that are mewed vp like Hawks, and
lockt vp by their iealous husbands? This is such an
enforced restraint, as it many times begets loose de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
in the restrained. It is the preuention of occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that crownes vs. More prayse-worthy were those
women of <hi>Sio,</hi> could they confine their actions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bounds of modesty, than these restrained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines.
For those Iland Women, as they are the
beautifull'st Dames of all the Greekes, so haue they
more liberty granted by their auaricious husbands,
than all the Dames in Greece. For their wiues pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
is their promotion. So as, when they see
any stranger or promising factor arriue, they will
presently demand if he would haue a Mistris: which,
for want of better supply, they mercenarily ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
him in the person of their owne wiues: so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
are they to weare the lasting Badge of infamy,
for base lucre or commodity.</p>
               <p>It is not then an enforced moderation of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
that deserues the stile of goodnesse. Wee are to
enioy freedome in our desires, and ouer those a noble

Diuinely sung our Moderne Poet:
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>To be of</hi> gen'rous <hi>blood and</hi> Parents <hi>borne,</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Let it be your highest scorne, to stoupe to any base
thought. It is not priority nor precedency of place,
but propriety and proficiency in grace that makes an
honourable Soule. That Cloath is of most worth
that weares best; and that fashion of most esteeme
that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lds longest in request. <hi>Vertue</hi> is right <hi>Sempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternum</hi>
for weare; and of that complete fashion, as
with Christian women it growes neuer out of date.
Make choice of this stuffe then to suite you, of this
<hi>Coat</hi> to gentilize you. All others are but counterfeits
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:23374:107"/>
in comparison of her; whose property it is to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
those that serue her; harbour those that flye for
refuge to her; and to reward those who constantly
stand in defence of her honour. There is nothing can
wound you, being thus armed; nothing ill-beseeme
you, being thus adorned; nothing disparage you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thus honoured. Heraldry findes a <hi>Coat</hi> for your
house, but <hi>Vertue</hi> findes honour to grace your person.
Retaine those diuine impressions of goodnesse in you,
that may truly ennoble you: display your <hi>gentility</hi>
by such a <hi>Coat,</hi> as may best distinguish your family;
so shall you liue and dye with honour, and suruiue
their fame, whose onely glory it was to enioy for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
fauour.</p>
               <p>PAinters are curious in the choice of their colors,
lest their Art become blemished, through those
decaied colours, wherewith their Pictures are por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.
Some are of opinion, that the receit of Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
or Colouring the substance of glasse through, is
vtterly lost; neither that these late succeeding times
can regaine, as yet, that mysterious perfection. Farre
more is it to be doubted, lest <hi>vertue,</hi> which we haue
proued by infallible arguments to be the best <hi>Coat,</hi>
want her true colour, and consequently become de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued
of her chiefe lustre. Some Pictures, I know,
will doe well in white; yet it is colour that giues
them life, Beauty neuer darts more loue to the eye,
nor with quicker conuoy directs it to the heart, then
when it displayes her guiltlesse shame in a crimson
blush. There is <hi>one flower</hi> to be loued of women,
which is the chiefest flower in all their garden;<note place="margin">Nazian.</note> and
this is a <hi>good red,</hi> which is shamefastnesse.<note place="margin">A shamefaste<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red the best Colour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blazon <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues Coat.</hi>
                  </note> These
standing colours are slow wooers to discreet Louers.
<hi>Vertues Coat</hi> then is best <hi>deblazoned</hi> when a <hi>shamefast<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>red</hi>
breathes vpon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:23374:108"/>
                  <hi>Protogenes</hi> tables, wherein <hi>Bacchus</hi> was painted,
and all his furious <hi>Bacchanals</hi> to life displayed, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
King <hi>Demetrius</hi> to such admiration, during his
siege of the City <hi>Rhodes,</hi> that where hee might haue
consumed the City with fire, and buried the glory
thereof in ashes, would not for the preciousnesse of
that table: so as, protracting time by staying to bide
them battell, wonne not the City at all. If a liuelesse
Picture could enforce such affection in a knowing
Commander, what effects may we thinke will a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
substance produce? Truth is, there is such sweet
and amiable correspondence betwixt <hi>vertuous</hi> beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and <hi>shamefaste</hi> modesty, as the one cannot subsist
without the others society. Not a light passage can
want the attendance of a blush, whilest modesty is in
presence. Yea, though shee be not conscious of any
conceit, that might beget in her face a shamefaste
blush; out of a modest Compassion shee will not
sticke to blush, when she obserues ought in another,
deseruing blame. Her eares glow at any light re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port;
which, lest they should grow too credulous,
shee fortifies with reason, to oppose the too easie en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of suspition. Shee partakes of no resemblance
lesse than that of the <hi>Chameleon,</hi> whose naturall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
it is to represent all Colours saue white. She is
a milde and moderate interpretor of others actions;
but a serious Censor of her owne. Light discourses,
which tend rather to the deprauing of the hearer,
than ministring any vsefull subiect to an attentiue
Obseruer, she excludes; vnciuill Complement shee
abhorres; what onely is modest she approues; and
seconds her approuement with a gracefull smile. She
holds an infected minde to be more dangerous than
an infected house: such Company shee shunnes, on
whom the rayes of <hi>vertue</hi> seldome or neuer shine.
There is not that Condition, bee it neuer so meane,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:23374:108"/>
which shee cannot with cheerefulnesse entertaine:
so as, shee holds outward pouerty the best enricher
of an inward family. Her desires are so equally poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed,
as shee neither seekes more than shee enioyes,
nor wants freedome to dispose of what she enioyes.
Honour shee affects, yet with no such eagernesse, as
to hazzard the losse of a dearer honour, for so vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a purchase. Friends and fauourites she admits,
and with that constancy, as it neither repents her of
accepting, nor them of tendring such vertuous fruits
of amity.</p>
               <p>Here you haue her, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> who will
tell you, and in her selfe exemplifie what shee tells
you; that <hi>modesty</hi> is the choycest ornament that can
adorne you. Now if you purpose to trace her path,
or conforme your selues to her line; you must worke
on your affections, to embrace what shee loues, and
reiect whatsoeuer she loathes. Are you conuersant at
any time with such <hi>protesting seruants,</hi> as make deepe
Oaths meere Complements; and whose tongues are
witty Orators in running descant on a wanton Tale?
These are such Consorts as <hi>Modesty</hi> would be loath
to conuerse with. She can neuer endure any of these
discourses without an angry blush. Should you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in these, you should quickly heare her out of a
vertuous passion, cry out with the Poet:
<q>
                     <l>O Age! most of our women know not now,</l>
                     <l>What 'ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, should you entertaine in your naked bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somes,
what some wantons haue too much affected,
light amorous Poems; perusing them with no lesse
Content, than if they had beene purposely penned to
worke on your Conceit; this cannot stand with
your <hi>modesty;</hi> These may corrupt you, but neuer
rectifie what is wandring in you. Suffer not a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
passage to play on your fantasie. Sinne would
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:23374:109"/>
neuer enter in vpon you, if she found but a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of resistance in you. Tell me, what a sweet grace
conferres it on you, to mixe your salutes with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
blushes, and entertaine your Suitors with a
shamefaste bashfulnesse! Sure I am, where loue is
discreetly grounded, this cannot chuse but be an espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
motiue to affection. There may bee, I grant,
such <hi>wilde louers,</hi> who preferre the loose loue of an
inconstant <hi>Phaedra,</hi> before the chaste embraces of a
continent <hi>Antiope:</hi> but their indiscreet choyce is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
seconded with a fearefull cloze. Those, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
more of a painted cheeke, than a natiue blush,
shall finde all their imaginary happinesse resolued to
a painted blisse. It is <hi>Modesty</hi> and not <hi>Beauty</hi> which
makes the husband happy. Would you then deserue
the title of Chaste Virgins, constant Wiues, modest
Matrons? While you are ranked amongst the <hi>first,</hi>
conuerse not priuately with a wanton thought; send
not forth a wandring eye to fetch in a Sweet-heart.
Dis-value not your owne worth so much, as to wooe
others to become your Suitors. This would bee a
meanes rather to depresse loue, than increase it; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payre
loue, than improue it. If you be worthy win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
you cannot chuse but be worthy wooing. Meane
time, let not a straid looke betray your too forward
loue; nor a light conceit tax you of deserued reproofe.
Dye your cheeks with a Rosie blush, when you heare
ought that may detract from the <hi>modesty</hi> of your
Sexe. Be as silent as the night; your best Rhetoricke
consists in maiden blushes, and bashfull smiles; which
will worke more powerfully on a Louers heart, than
a Rhetoricall tongue, bee it neuer so curiously tipt
with Art.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>second</hi> ranke; you know how strict a duty
is imposed on you; now are you not to conuerse with
strange loue: or suffer any other person haue the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:23374:109"/>
least share in your affection. To Court loue, or vse
any Complement, purposely to winne a priuate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourite,
would detract as much from your honour,
as for a Souldier to flye from his Captaine, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here
to a stranger. He hath inuested you in himselfe,
and ingaged himselfe yours by a sacred vow, which
death onely may reuerse: the dispersed loues which
you entertained before, must now be reduc'd to one,
and that but one, by whose mutuall choyce two are
indiuidually made one. A heart diuided cannot liue;
no more can the heat of diuided loue. You are now
so farre from entertaining any stranger; as you haue
vow'd with your heart, not to enter so much as any
treaty with an vniust intruder. It is dangerous to
conuerse with a profest foe, whose drift it is to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine
you; and such an one is euery loose louer,
who labours with the licentious art of adulterous
Oratory, to depriue you of that inestimable gemme,
which of all others, most adornes you.</p>
               <p>For you that are <hi>Matrons;</hi> ripenesse of yeares
hath enioyned you to bid a lasting adew to the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

for others to imitate.</p>
               <p>It were dotage in you now to begin to loue, when
your decay in Nature tels you, it is not long you are
to liue. You haue hitherto performed your parts
with a <hi>generous</hi> approuement of your actions, faile
not in the conclusion. This small remainder of
your declining pilgrimage, should be wholly dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the practice of goodnesse; that your pious
end may second your vertuous beginning. The Sunne
shines euer brighter at his setting than rising; so
should your life appeare better at your departing
than entring.</p>
               <p>It were incomparably beneficiall for you, now in
this your <hi>Exit,</hi> to haue your affections seated in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:23374:110"/>

or with-drawing your presence from dishonest or

a kind of zealous and deuout passion, when they
chanc'd but to heare any light or wanton communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
they could not hold but reproue them for
their impudence, and amidst their reproofe, to adorn
the Rosie Circlets of their cheekes with a blushing
shamefastnesse. Surely, this expressed a singular <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty</hi>
in them; which I would haue you (<hi>Gentlewomen</hi>)
in a serious imitation of them, to represent in your

you are to entertaine with such disgust, as these odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

to admire him, as simple people did, whose iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
most commonly were plac'd in their eyes:
but to reproue him for his vanity, an apt subiect for
Philosophy; and weane him from that, which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
ruine to his State. This delicate Prince had that
learned Sage no sounder found decked and adorned
with the choisest Ornaments, and seated on an high

with this vaine question: demanding of him, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>Solon</hi> right grauely answered; <hi>Yes,</hi> quoth he, <hi>I haue
seene House-cocks, Phesants, and Peacocks: And these
were graced with a naturall beauty; whereas yours is but

               <p>Truth is, should we iudge of mens worths by their
outward weare, or distinguish <hi>Gentility</hi> by a fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

a blinde man in his first discouery of colours. What

She considers, how he, by whom our corrupt blood
was restored, our vnualuable losses repaired, and our
primitiue nakednesse compassionately couered, was
not with a Diadem crowned, nor in a stately bed
couched; yea, scarcely rather with one poore coat
couered: which he wore not as an ornament to his
body, to bestow on it trimnesse, but for necessity to
couer his nakednesse. What a pouerty is it then for
you, whose ancient descent promiseth something ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary

you in that, which depriu'd you of your prime beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
You shall obserue in many of our graue Matrons,

inward ornaments are their chiefest care; their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing

They haue found such choice flowers, as they afford
more spirituall delight to the soule, than any visible

which haue taught them how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
earth, conquer death, and aspire vnto eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?
These by a continued custome or frequent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse
with heauenly things, cannot now conceiue
any obiect to be worthy their beholding on earth.
Fashions may be worne about them, but little obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

is their desired raiment. This they make ready for
the Nuptiall day; the meditation whereof so trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
them, as nothing below heauen can possesse
them. It is not beauty which they prize; for they

your time; to haue dedicated your selues to
the practice of vertue all your time; to haue beene
Mirrors of modesty to your succeeding sexe; to haue
dis-valued the fruitlesse flourish of fading vanity, for
the promising hopes of a blessed eternity. Supply
then that in you, which bleered iudgements expect

Trees by their fruits, and <hi>Generous bloods</hi> by their

the Philosopher) in euery good man: and these will
finde time to expresse themselues.</p>
               <p>It was <hi>Dauids</hi> testimony of himselfe: <hi>From my
youth vp haue I loued thy Law.</hi> An excellent preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue
giuen him, and with no lesse diligence improued
by him. Now these <hi>Natiue seeds,</hi> as they are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
so are the fruits which come of them, vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
disposed. Some haue a rellish of true and <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
bounty;</hi> wherein they shew that noble freedome
to their owne, in their liberality towards others: as
their very actions declare vnto the world, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
and soueraignty ouer the things of this world.
Others discouer their noble disposition, by their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<hi>pilty</hi> and <hi>compassion;</hi> These will estrange them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
from no mans misery. If they cannot succour
him, they will suffer with him. Their bosomes are
euer open with pittifull <hi>Zenocrates,</hi> to receiue a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed
one. Ouer a vanquish'd foe they scorne to
insult; or vpon a deiected one to triumph. They
haue teares to partake with the afflicted; and reall
expressions of ioy to share with the relieued. Others
shew apparant arguments of their singular <hi>modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
abstemious are these in their dishes; temperate
in their Companies; moderate in their desires. These
wonder at the rioters of this time; how they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
their daies in sensuality and vncleannesse. Their
account is farre more straight; their expence more
strait; but their liberty of mind of an higher straine.
Cloathes they weare, but with that decency, as cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity
cannot taxe them; meats they partake, but
with that temperance, as delicacy cannot tempt
them. Others from their Cradle, become braue
sparkes of <hi>valour;</hi> their very Childhood promiseth
vndoubted tokens of succeeding honour. These can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
endure braues nor affronts. <hi>Generous</hi> resolution
hath stampt such deepe impressions in their heroicke
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:23374:113"/>
mindes, as fame is their ayme; which they hunt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
with such constancy of spirit, as danger can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
amate them, nor difficulty auert them from
their resolues. Others are endued with a natural preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of <hi>wit;</hi> to whom no occasion is sooner offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
than some dainty expression must second it. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with more solidity of <hi>iudgement,</hi> though of lesse
present conceit. And these are such, as generally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
themselues in State-affaires; wherein Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
purchased by an vsefull expence of time, doth
so ripen them, as the Publike State takes notice of
them, and recompenceth their care with honours
conferred on them.</p>
               <p>These and many other excellent endowments shall
we obserue to bee <hi>lineally</hi> deriued from Ancestors to
their successors; which, as they retaine a neare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
of their persons, so they represent their
Actions: so powerfull is <hi>nature</hi> in bestowing her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Offices on euery creature, wherein they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
partake of their <hi>disposition</hi> as wel as outward <hi>fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi>
whence the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>Stout men and good are sprung from stout and good,</l>

               </p>
               <p>Yet see the iniquity of time! It fareth oft-times
with those who are endowed with these vertues, to
be most traduced, where their more noble and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
parts are to be highliest honoured. Which, as
it was a maine error in former ages, so descends it to
these present times. When <hi>Rome</hi> was in her glory,

               <p>Though <hi>Clitus</hi> open rebukes cost him his life, his

Those <hi>Natiue seeds</hi> of <hi>goodnesse,</hi> whereof wee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

fitter to perfect this excellent worke in you, than
those who were the secondary instruments of <hi>being</hi>
vnto you; Neither can those, who are deriued from
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:23374:115"/>
you, become better <hi>instructed</hi> than by you. Your loue,
I confesse, will be more indulgent, yet your care so
much the more incessant. Their dispositions are best
knowne vnto you; if motherly affection then will
giue way to discretion, who more fit to mold them
than you? Preceding times may afford you variety of
examples in this kinde.</p>

of coniugall vnity; <hi>Edesia</hi> hers in learning and
morality; <hi>Paulina</hi> hers in memorials of shamefaste
modesty. These, though Heathens, were excellent
informers of youth; so as, their Children were
more bound to them for their <hi>breeding</hi> than <hi>bearing,
nurturing</hi> than <hi>nursing.</hi> Besides, there is an inbred fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall
feare in Children to their Parents, which will
beget in them more attention in hearing, and reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in holding what they heare. Now, there is no

liuing. By that Line of yours, are they to conforme
their owne. Take heed then, lest by the dampe of
your life, you darken both their glory and your
owne. I might propose vnto you bookes of <hi>instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
which might minister arguments plenteously in
this kinde: but so short is the memory in retaining
what it reads, yea so distracted is the minde in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing
what it reads, that, as it fares with our <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

euen so, the booke is no sooner left out of the hand,
than the Contents are leapt out of the heart. Yet, to
the end you may not be vnprouided of such Tracts as
may enable you for <hi>instruction;</hi> and prepare you to

                  <hi>Hierom</hi> none more grauely copious, as

his, directed to those Noble Ladies, <hi>Marcella, Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria,
Laeta, Furia,</hi> &amp;c. wherein he vseth singular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations,
inuincible arguments, perswasiue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
sweet similitudes, and forciue examples. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
is the subiect hee commends vnto them; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
in apparell he approues in them; to a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
restraint of liberty he enioynes them; to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary
holinesse hee exhorts them; and with sweet
and comfortable promises of an incorruptible reward
he leaues them.</p>
               <p>Than S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> none more deuoutly feruerous;
in his reproofes he shewes mildnesse; in his treaties
a passionate sweetnesse; he winnes the sinner by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
reasons; hee strengthens the soule mightily
against temptations; he proposeth an excellent way
of moderating the affections; he applyes soueraigne
receits to soueraignizing passions: and concludes
with that sober and discreet temper, as with a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine

applies meanes how wee may resist, resisting van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish;
and by our Christian victory, receiue
Crownes of eternall glory. That Conquest he holds,
deserues small honour, which is atchieu'd without
Encounter. In a Diuine rapsodie drawne, as it were,
from himselfe, hee shewes what should be done by
vs. Earth is no obiect fit to entertaine our eye; nor
her deluding melody our eare: He exhorts vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to leaue Earth now while wee liue, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

Loue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Than S. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> none more Diuinely plenteous;
sweetly serious are his instructions; enforcing are
his reasons; he speakes home to the sinner: whom
he no sooner findes wounded for sinne, than hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
a Spirituall Salue to cure his sinne. Many graue
sentences are in his <hi>Offices</hi> methodically couched;
singular directions to guide euery Christian in his
Spirituall Path-way, are there deliuered. Like an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert
Physician, he first gathers the nature or quality
of your distemper, and then ministers soule-saluing
receipts to restore you to your right temper. Hee
shewes you how in your very motion, gesture, and
pace you are to obserue modesty: concluding that
nothing can afford true comfort to a soiorning soule,
but practise of piety.</p>
               <p>Than S. <hi>Hilary,</hi> none more fully sententious; hee
discouers the occasion of our corruption familiarly;
aduiseth vs with many passionate and teare-swollne

Tenderly hee compassionates the case of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
passionately treats he of those torments which

them that haue gone astray, to returne; those that
are already return'd, to goe no more astray. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes

nor contemplatiuely glorious; Diuinely morall are
his <hi>Morals;</hi> full of heauenly comforts are his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;
hee walkes in an higher way than others
trace, yet with that humility, as there is not a cloze
from him, but it discloseth in him a loue of meeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
lowlinesse, and piety. With proper and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
similitudes are his works adorned; with choice
sentences, as with so many select flowers, neatly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished;
in a word, hee is sweetly substantiall, and
substantially sweet. He reprehends the times graue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
commends the practice the vertue gracefully.
With an holy zeale he reproues the remisnesse of the
Ministry. Directions he giues vnto women, to haue
an especiall care of modesty: concluding, that the
loue of this life should not so possesse vs, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue
vs of that inheritance which might eternally
blesse vs. In good mindes he holds pouerty the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tresse
of humility: accounting those Euils or Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersities,
which doe here presse vs, to be the Cords
which draw vs vnto God who made vs.</p>
               <p>Touching those three Philosophers, this is my
conceit of them; wherein none can otherwise chuse
than concurre with me, that shall seriously read, and
sincerely scanne them: Than <hi>Plato,</hi> none more Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinely
Philosophicall; Than <hi>Cicero,</hi> more philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically
Rhetoricall; Than <hi>Seneca,</hi> more Sagely
Morall.</p>
               <p>But for as much as it is not giuen to most of you to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:23374:117"/>
be Linguists, albeit many of their workes be transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in your mother-tongue, you may conuerse with
sundry English Authors, whose excellent instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
will sufficiently store you in all points; and if vse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
applied, conferre no small benefit to your vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding.
I shall not need particularly to name
them to you, because I doubt not, but you haue made
choyce of such faithfull Retainers and vertuous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some-friends,
constantly to accompany you. Neither,
indeed, are <hi>bookes</hi> onely necessary; conference will
singularly improue your knowledge; but that is not
altogether so conuenient nor decent for your sexe in
publike places. So as, I much condemne their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
who hold no meanes so fitting to bring their
daughters to audacity, as a frequent consort with
Company. This, in time, begets in them rather <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence</hi>
than <hi>boldnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was held a touch to a Maid to bee seene talking
with any one in a publike place. But in priuate Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series,
which may be properly termed your <hi>houshold
Academies,</hi> it will suit well with your honors to treat
and enter into <hi>Conference</hi> one with another; or in such
places, where your owne sexe is onely conuersant.
For such indiscreet Mothers, who vsually trim and
deck their daughters, to send them forth to Showes,
Meetings, or Enterludes, they annoynt bauin with
oyle, that it may burne the better. But much more
blame-worthy bee those, who take them along to

               </p>
               <p>It is the very <hi>first instruction</hi> that takes the <hi>deepest im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression;</hi>
how necessary then is it for you, <hi>Gentle wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
whose sexe is the Embleme of weakenesse, and
whose best resolues are oft-times weakned by youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
promises, to furnish your blooming youth with
wholesome instructions: and so to improue them,
that they may increase in vigour, as you doe in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?
This your sexe exacts of you; this your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
estate requires of you: and this shall easily be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by you, if hauing (as is to be presupposed) dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
and religious Mothers, you submit your selues
in all humble obedience to their direction. For as it
is very hard for any one to know how to command,
vnlesse she know first how to obey; so will it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you to performe the office of a Mother, if you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
knew the duty of a daughter. Strict and seuere
may those Commands seeme to your youth, which
riper age will easily digest. Againe, you that
are Mothers, become patternes of modesty vnto
your daughters. Your liuing actions are the lines of
their direction. While they are vnder your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
the error is yours, not theirs, if they goe astray.
Their <hi>honour</hi> should be one of the principall'st things
you are to tender; neither can it be blemished, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
some touch to your Credit. I haue knowne some
inconsiderate mothers, and those none of the lowest
ranke or quality, who either out of a confidence they
had of their daughters good carriage, or drawn with
the hopes of some rich Suitors to aduance their mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
haue vsually giuen too free way to opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which brought vpon their daughters names a
spreading infamy.</p>
               <p>Your <hi>instructions</hi> will doe well with them, till so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:23374:118"/>
depraue them: diuert then the occasion, so shall
your daughters, be they neuer so poore, haue good
portions of reputation. Suffer not then those who
partake of your image, to lose their best beauty. Sigh
then if they bee soyled, for their shame must bee on
you aspersed.</p>
               <p>Grace is a pure balme, and consequently requires a
pure and sound vessell. In vaine is it infused, if the
vessell be not whole and sound to preserue it. Looke
then to your own actions; these must informe them;
Looke to your owne examples, these must confirme
them. Without you they cannot perish; with you
they may. What will you doe with the rest that is
left, when you see a part of your selfe lost?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Harpie</hi> hath the face of a man, but a Bird so cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
by nature, as when she is an hungry, she wil assault
any man and kill him. After which bloudy repast, she
becomes thirsty, so as, going to the Riuer to quench
it, she sees her owne face; and recalling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to mind how
it resembles him whom she slew, she conceiues such
griefe, as she dyes therewith. If your Education or
<hi>instruction</hi> depraue those who deriue their beginning
from you, the resemblance of this story may haue
proper relation vnto you. But if your pious examples
enable them, their proficiency in vertue shall enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
you; your comforts shall be multiplyed in them;
your hopes seconded by them; and to your euer-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
fames, the memory of your vertues preserued by
them.</p>
               <p>Let not that adage proue true, in respect of your
Charge: <q>
                     <hi>The most precious things haue euer the most
pernicious Keepers.</hi>
                  </q> Nothing more precious than a
Virgins honour; it were shame for the mother to
proue a <hi>Tarpeian</hi> or treacherous keeper. That Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
was elegantly expressed by the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi>
the fifth, in his instructions to the King his sonne;
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:23374:119"/>
                  <q>
                     <hi>That Fortune had somewhat of the nature of a woman;
that if she be too much woo'd, she is the farther off.</hi>
                  </q> But
I hope I shall not finde that auersenesse in you. I haue
wooed you in words; expresse your selues wonne by
the testimony of your workes. I would not follow
the indiscretion of Empericks, which minister same
medicines to all Patients; I know well, that such
Physicke as agrees with age, would not agree with
the hot constitution of youth: To either sort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

yea, vertuous actions, should they bee by
vicious persons commended, would rather lose of
their lustre, than become any way improued. To be
cheerefull in aduersity, humble in prosperity, and in
both to shew a temperate equality, is worthy praise,
and deserues <hi>Honour</hi> for a prize. Yet, should these be
but onely pretences to gull the world, or delude the
simple admirer, they would in time vnmaske them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
and display their counterfeit insides with
shame to the world. False and adulterate colours will
not hold, nor vertuous semblances long retaine the
esteeme they haue. We haue euer held them for most

yet in fashion. And such are all those Counterfeit
followers of <hi>vertue,</hi> who pretend fairely, but fall

Your Cloath, <hi>Gentlewomen,</hi> must be of another nap:

require reliefe. Yea, she loues those best, to whom
these arguments of bounty are in highest measure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest.
She auerts not her eare from the needy beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,
she will shew him all fauour for his image or
feature. She holds it an vnbeseeming state, to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
a sowre looke, where noble pitty should beget
in her a compassionate loue. She is so daily and duely
inured to <hi>workes</hi> of <hi>mercy,</hi> as shee ioyes in no obiect
more than occasion of bounty. Shee considers (and
this she Diuinely applies vnto her selfe) how nought
but vanity is to be attributed to them, retaine they
neuer so much earthly glory on them, who dwell in
houses of clay, whose <hi>foundation</hi> is in the <hi>dust,</hi> which
are <hi>crushed</hi> before the <hi>Moath.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob 4. 19.</note> Silken vanity cannot
delude her, nor any opinionate conceit of her owne
estate transport her. Her minde is not subiect to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering,
nor her walke to wandring. Be her life long;
her goodnesse becomes improued: be it short; her
desires are crowned. Neither reserues shee the glea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
for him, that is Master of the Haruest. Pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
appeare it neuer so despicable to her <hi>eye,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyes

the best, for his sake whom shee loues best. A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
minde she hates; for she conceiues how no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be better worth enioying, than a liberall
desire of disposing: which she expresseth with that
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:23374:125"/>
cheerefull alacrity, as it inhanceth the value of her
bounty. Thus shee liues in a free and absolute com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of what she enioyes; with an <hi>hand</hi> no lesse o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen

<hi>intention.</hi>

               <p>Neither is the true Nobility of her minde lesse
discerned by her loue to <hi>Chastity.</hi> Pure bee her
thoughts, and vnstained. The Sanctuary of her heart
is solely dedicated to her Maker; it can find no roome
for an inordinate affection to lodge in. Shee knowes
not how to throw out her loue-attracting Lures;
nor to expose the glorious beauty of her soule to
shame. A moments staine must not blemish her
state. Shee will not therefore giue her eye leaue to
wander, lest it should betray her <hi>honour</hi> to a treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
intruder. How weak proue those assaults, which
her home-bred enemies prepare against her? Her
<hi>looke</hi> must bee set on a purer Obiect than vanity:
Shee will not eye it, lest shee should be taken by it.
Her <hi>Discourse</hi> must be of a better subiect than vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
She will not treat of it, lest she should be engaged
to it. Her <hi>thoughts</hi> are not admitted to entertaine
vanity: They must not conceit it, lest they should
be deceiued by it. Occasions wisely shee foresees,
timely preuents, and consequently enioyes true free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of minde. You shall not see her consume the
precious oyle of her Lampe, the light of her life, in
vnseasonable reere-bankets; vnprofitable visits; or
wanton treaties. Those will shee not admit of for
companions, who are prodigall of their <hi>honour.</hi> These
she reproues with a mild spirit, labouring to reclaime
them with an ingenuous tender of her vertuous
compassion towards them. None shee more distasts
than these Brokers or Breakers of licentious bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaines:
Shee excludes them the List of all ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

How cauteious shee is, lest suspition should
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:23374:126"/>
tax her? Outwardly, therefore, shee expresseth,
what she inwardly professeth. That <hi>honourable bloud</hi>
which she from her Predecessors receiued, till death
surprize her, will shee leaue vntainted. Neither is
there ought shee hates more than <hi>pride,</hi> nor scornes
more than <hi>disdaine.</hi> Shee rightly considers how her
daies are <hi>mensurable,</hi> being but a span long, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
her breuity; and <hi>miserable,</hi> being <hi>altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
Shee disclaymes that state which consists in
scornefull lookes; A sweet and affable Countenance
shee euer beares: The <hi>honour</hi> she enioyes makes her
humbler; and the prayses which are giuen her, work
in her thoughts no distemper. So farre is shee from
affecting the pompe of this world, as it growes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
to her higher-mounting thoughts. A
faire and well-seeming retinue shee euer keepes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her: but none of these must be Sycophants, with
their oylie tongues to delude her; neither must any,
who cloaths his Countenance with scorne, attend
her. Shee obserues on what steepe and dangerous
grounds ambition walketh. Her sleepes are sweeter;
her content higher; her thoughts heauenlier. It is
one of her greatest wonders, that any one should be
so rest of vnderstanding, as to forget what infirme
ground he stands on. The purest Creature, be she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
so absolute in her feature, is of no richer temper
than <hi>Earth,</hi> our Common-mother. She is wiser than
to preferre a poore handfull of <hi>red Earth</hi> before her
choycest treasure. Though her deserts merit <hi>honour,</hi>
shee dis-esteemes her owne deseruings; being high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
valued by all but her selfe. Thus shee prepares her
selfe daily for what shee must goe to. Her last day
is her euery dayes memoriall. Lower may her body
be, when interred; but lower ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not her mind be, than

Nursery; Plants of all sorts are there bestowed.
Cheere and cherish those that be tender; but curbe

fruitfull Siens cannot be improued, till the luxurious
branches be pruned. But aboue all things; take espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

               <p>GENTLITY is not her boast, but that which

The more HONOVR that is conferr'd on

The cloze of her Pilgrimage a calme passage
