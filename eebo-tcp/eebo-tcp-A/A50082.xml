            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Noble Sir!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Will dispense a while with my tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Privacy and Retirement, which the Violence and Injustice of a Juncto and their Myrmidon <hi>Oliver</hi> enforced me to, and breath a little free <hi>English</hi> Aire in the Contents of this Paper: Withall to give you to understand, that I do yet, by Gods goodness, survive the implacable malice of mine Enemies, and have a life devoted, and to sacrifice to my Countries Happiness and Honour. And this not out of Ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any Presumption of my <hi>Interest,</hi> (for I could wish there was no such factious <hi>English</hi> word) which is no more than the bounden Dutie of every good Subject, in promoting by all lawfull means and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93608:3"/>
the Peace and Prosperity of the Kingdom: but that these difficult times do require a Review and Copie of the former and past Transactions of the State; wherein no man will deny I have had in both For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes my extraordinary share.</p>
            <p>Sir, I need not make this Defence to you for this trouble (for you have been wened to greater) the Universall Crie of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is yet resounding in your ears, and you have still but the Rudiments, the Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to their future Importunities; the People being so wary and weary of all Counsels tending to the prolongation of their Distractions, that they will make un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just Judges by their reiterated and urged Demands willing to comply. And while I think on that generall Desire of the three Kingdoms, I cannot restrain my self, but bring what I can to its conducement, and shall therefore liberally decypher to you my thoughts, and discover my self in this Pourtraicture of my mind.</p>
            <p>Towards the expiration of my Command
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93608:3"/>
and Government of the City of <hi>Glocester,</hi> (a place famed for its Fidelity to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I found their animosity against the Kings Partie so slaked, before the War was near extinct, that I could not but examine my self; in which scrutiny I saw the raked sparks of Loyaltie necessarily flying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and surmounting the clouds of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and envious exhalation. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in my <hi>Publick Trust</hi> (as being a Member of this now-sitting Parliament) I perceived such a relenting, such compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate considerations, of that hitherto unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable expence of blood, such mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and equal ways to a Settlement, that it was most plainly apparent, as <hi>Vox Populi</hi> is <hi>Vox Dei,</hi> that without the establishment of our ancient Government, there could be neither Peace nor Order. And now since to this time, we have seen such a deluge of confusion, one oppression ushering in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, one Power crushing and crushed by the other, all of us made Brethren by Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, as by another first Nature: What else
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93608:4"/>
can be added to our misery, but that we are resolved and content to be miserable?</p>
            <p>And this being the true state of our case, being alarum'd on all sides from abroad, awakened from our brain-sick Dreams at home, having nothing to fear within us, no danger if we be honest from without, why do we boggle at our Peace; What's the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora</hi> to our Safety? a few inconsiderable <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptists</hi> must have the Reputation here which they had not at <hi>Munster,</hi> to be able to obstruct our happiness. Certainly never any Souldier dreaded them, for they will make as Schismatical Armies as Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and be as many divisions as Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles. Why then do we not proceed dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly to a Settlement? I take that for no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick Maxime, <hi>The farthest way about the nearest way home,</hi> for what <hi>Lynceus</hi> eyes can spie any danger obviating such a course? What need have we of the <hi>Fabian Cuncta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> What potent Enemy is at door, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you reckon my Lord <hi>Lambert?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me, all delayes are dangerous, and our
<pb facs="tcp:93608:5"/>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93608:5"/>
wounds rankle, and what folly is it when we may be cured <hi>gratis,</hi> afterwards to pay the Chyrurgeon his own Demands?</p>
            <p>We are lost in a Wood, let's make all speed to get out; we are non-plust and baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled at our own Argument, 'twill be no dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous fallacy <hi>[Petitio Principii]</hi> and beg the Question; which an honest Subject, though a bad Scholar, may English <hi>[Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have made this Essay, no way doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but that it is the onely Consult of the Parliament, and their sole Business of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment: To which purpose I am not so remote, but if the leaft shadow of distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance should appeare, I am ready at all points to do my Devoir. Sir, I kiss your Hands, and remain,</p>
