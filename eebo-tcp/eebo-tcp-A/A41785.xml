            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>The Demonſtration.</head>
               <p>IS it not the uſual refuge of many in our Age to fly to their (particular) skill in the Hebrew and Greek Tongues, as a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient defence againſt ſuch as are not skilled in the literature thereof, when oppoſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch things touching Religion, as for which the Engliſh Text affords nothing? Yea, it is even deemed enough to ſilence the Unlearned, when aſſaying to reaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Religion, to tell them, They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
<pb facs="tcp:55177:4"/>
know not the Originals, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no Greek, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this occaſion I have taken this their Plea into conſideration, to ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of ſuch weight as is commonly thought. And verily (to the utmoſt of my underſtanding) it ſeems to have nothing of ſtrength in it: for (to ſay nothing of this vain boaſt of their knowledge of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals of holy Scripture, when yet they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw them, nor know where to look for them; I ſay, to let this paſs) if we conſider diligently wherein the effectual and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial knowledg of the Hebrew &amp; Greek Text of Scripture lieth, we ſhall find, that (as touching Engliſhmen) it lieth not in the knowledge of the Characters or Words of theſe Tongues (for this a Child of ſeven years old may know) but that which is the effectuall knowledge of the Hebrew or Greek Tongues to an Engliſhman, is His knowing the true Engliſh of the Hebrew and Greek Characters and Words: For example, theſe <note n="*" place="margin">ג ב א α. β. γ.</note> Hebrew and Greek Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters avail an Engliſhman nothing ſo long as  he can only ſound them in the Hebrew and Greek Dialects thus; <hi>Aleph, Beth, Gimel, &amp;c.</hi> or, <hi>Alpha, Beta, Gamma, &amp;c.</hi> But that which is the effectual knowledge of theſe Letters
<pb facs="tcp:55177:4"/>
to an Engliſhman, is to know that they are of the ſame ſignification with the Engliſh A. B. G. The like may be ſaid of words; for ſo long as our Engliſh-men can onely ſound the Hebrew word <hi>El,</hi> or the Greek word <hi>Theo,</hi> it edifieth not the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but when we know theſe words are the ſame in ſignification with our Engliſh word <hi>[God]</hi> this is that underſtanding of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew and Greek which to us is truly effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual: for whatſoever ſounds our lips pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, be they Hebrew, Greek or Latin, our underſtanding receiveth theſe ſeveral ſounds in the Engliſh tongue.</p>
               <p>This being evident, it now remains to be conſidered whether it be not poſſible (as things now ſtand) for ſuch Engliſh-men as know not the Hebrew or Greek Characters and Words, yet for all that to know the moſt proper and effectual ſignification of the Hebrew and Greek Text of the Old and New Teſtaments.</p>
               <p>That thus it may be, and is, will thus appear; Either the Tranſlations which we have, are the ſame in ſubſtance and effect with the Hebrew and Greek Bible, or they are not. If they be the ſame, in ſubſtance and effect, Then ſuch as know the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as tranſlated into Engliſh, do know
<pb facs="tcp:55177:5"/>
the ſubſtance and effect of the Hebrew and Greek Bible. Yea, further; If the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tranſlators (whether <hi>Cantabrigians</hi> and <hi>Oxonians,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Rhemiſts)</hi> themſelves knew the meaning of the Hebrew and Greek Text of the Bible, Then we who are unlearned do know the ſame. This muſt needs be true; or elſe we muſt conclude, that they knew the true meaning, and yet delivered a falſe: but this were a great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Charity, to think that they would thus abuſe themſelves and the whole race of Engliſh-men; or expoſe their Credit to everlaſting contempt, and themſelves and followers to eternal deſtruction, and all this wilfully, and only about the ſignification of Words and Letters, and not about the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine contained therein (for Tranſlation and Expoſition are two things:) But this (I ſay) were a great breach of Charity to think, and muſt needs argue great pride in any to affirm; and would certainly expoſe not only ſuch particular Learned-men, who ſo highly ſtand upon their Learning, but alſo whole Conventions of them, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable ſuſpition, let them give forth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſincere a Tranſlation; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe ſo many eminent for Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Induſtry, have vigorouſly and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
<pb facs="tcp:55177:5"/>
preſſed the Unlearned to adhere to the Engliſh Text, as the <hi>undoubted Voice of God,</hi> ſpeaking by his <hi>lively Oracles</hi> the Scriptures. Now then, if our Engliſh-Tranſlation be indeed the ſame in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and effect with the Hebrew &amp; Greek Bibles, at leaſt to the beſt of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Learned Tranſlators; and that their underſtanding may well be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before the underſtanding of any one learned Engliſh-man now living; Then it followeth, that ſuch as know the Engliſh-Text, do in ſubſtance and effect know the Hebrew and Greek Text, at leaſt ſo far as may equallize the knowledge of any learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Engliſh-man now living; Becauſe that which the Tranſlators DID know, the ſame for ſubſtance We DO know; And that which they attained to through much ſtudy, we know without either learning or ſtudy, further than to hear or read the Text of Scripture in our Mother-Tongue. For the Tranſlation which they gave forth was (by their own ſolemn proteſtation) the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, for ſubſtance, of their knowledge of the Hebrew and Greek Text of the Bible: But we have this their Tranſlation, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have in ſubſtance the ſame know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Hebrew and Greek Text of
<pb facs="tcp:55177:6"/>
the Bible which the learned Tranſlators had.</p>
               <p>This might be further illuſtrated by the conſideration of divers Arts, and obſcure Myſteries, which at the firſt were not found out without great learning and travel; but when once a familiar diſcovery thereof was made, divers have been expert therein, and that without the help of that learning and ſtudy which firſt brought them forth.</p>
               <p>As thus; The Unlearned may defend themſelves in the uſe of Holy Scriptures, when concerned in any Controverſie with the Learned about matters of Religion; So alſo may they defend themſelves in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Works of Greek or Latin Writers, ſo far as they are found to be tranſlated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Engliſh Tongue. And this may alſo ſerve for an Apology for the Quotations alleaged in the enſuing Dialogue, whether from Scriptures or Antient Writers.</p>
               <p>If now it ſhould be objected, <hi>That ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words in holy Writ are left untranſlated; and that therefore we muſt needs depend upon the preſent Learned for help in ſuch caſes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it may well be anſwered, That there are ſuch Lexicons, Dictionaries and Tables, long ago extant, and yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as may well ſuffice the Unlearned for
<pb facs="tcp:55177:6"/>
their attaining to the true etymology of all ſuch words, at leaſt in ſuch ſort as may be thought equivolent with what the preſent Learned are capable to accommodate us with.</p>
               <p>Hence it may be perceived that the mode of divers of our preſent Scholars (under what form of Religion ſoever) in their contradicting of Tranſlators and Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, which have communicated to us the holy Scriptures, or other Authors, in the Engliſh Tongue, is ſo far from forcing the Unlearned to a neceſſary reliance upon them in theſe caſes, that in truth it will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inforce them to a neceſſary diſclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as not much regarding what they either ſay or write. For if we have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all that have formerly pretended to ſerve their Generations in theſe weighty and eternal Soul-concerns, We ſhall have ſmall ground of incouragement to believe that we ſhall be ingeniouſly dealt with, by ſuch men, as (to the intent they may bring us under their deviſed fables and antiſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Traditions) do run that deſperate ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture to traduce the Scriptures as falſly tranſlated.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:55177:7"/>
For that diverſity which may ſeem to be among our Engliſh Editions of Holy Scripture (which perhaps may thruſt it ſelf in Objection-wiſe in this place) <hi>Auguſtine</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug. De Civ. Dei. lib.</hi> 18. <hi>cap.</hi> 43, 44.</note> hath ſaid well, who adviſeth the Reader, not to leave the ſignification of the Hiſtory for the circumſtance of a word, nor to condemn either of the Authorities.</p>
               <p>From the premiſes I will conclude with the words of the Problem; <hi>No Learned Engliſh-man can with modeſty pretend to know the meaning of the Hebrew and Greek Tongues (ſo far as they onely concern the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) any whit more in ſubſtance or effect than ſuch as are unlearned.</hi>

               <l>Is uſed in the way Prelatical;</l>
               <l>Which, I confeſs, did outwardly appear</l>
               <l>Right glorious, for to pleaſe both Eye and Ear.</l>
               <l>But when I call'd to mind the greateſt end,</l>
               <l>Of Divine Worſhip, which is to amend</l>
               <l>Mans pravity, by good edification,</l>
               <l>I found that Worſhip, a meer deſolation.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>One thing to me prodigious did appear</l>
               <l>Above the reſt, 'twas two men which did wear,</l>
               <l>Great Linnen Coats, and one had on his back</l>
               <l>A Red Cloath ty'd, as ſome men tye their Pack.</l>
               <l>Theſe did themſelves divide from all the reſt,</l>
               <l>And walked Eaſtward, bowing down their breſt</l>
               <l>At certain places, and obedience yeelded,</l>
               <l>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto a cover'd Board which there was builded,</l>
               <l>Where on a Cuſhon each man kneeled down,</l>
               <l>And when their Arms, on other two were thrown</l>
               <l>They ſeem'd to pray, having their eyes caſt down</l>
               <l>Upon two Printed Books: where having ſhown</l>

               <l>And turning Weſt, he did his Book uncloſe,</l>
               <l>And therein read a Chapter, which <hi>Paul</hi> wrote</l>

               <l>The rather, for becauſe, methinks it might</l>
               <l>Have given theſe two Readers much more Light</l>

               <l>Now when theſe Obſequies and Poſtulations</l>
               <l>Were finiſhed, then many made Orations</l>
               <l>Around the Quire: but what was ſaid or ſung,</l>
               <l>If I ſhould ſay I know, I ſhould but wrong</l>
               <l>My ſelf and them; for there was ſuch confuſion</l>
               <l>Of Voices, that wer't Truth, or wer't Deluſion;</l>
               <l>Nor hurt nor profit, did thereof enſue</l>

               <l>Yet theſe ſtrang ſights do cauſe me ſtil to wonder</l>
               <l>Why Prelates do againſt the Papiſts thunder,</l>
               <l>So much, becauſe of Image-adoration:</l>
               <l>For if that Wood or Stone, built in the faſhion</l>
               <l>Of Tables, may adored be by Saints,</l>
               <l>What lets the ſame, when ſome like Men it prints</l>
               <l>Eſpecially, if Chriſt his form it beareth,</l>
               <l>As reverend as a Table it appeareth.</l>
               <l>Now having theſe mens doings thus far viewed,</l>
               <l>I left them all within their ſtalls impued.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>And having heard that ſome in Priſon lay,</l>
               <l>Becauſe they could not cloſe with that fine way</l>
               <l>of Worſhip, I therefore anon repaired</l>

               <l>And being come unto their lodging place,</l>
               <l>I found the Priſoners, with erected face</l>

               <l>The mighty God, whom they did there adore</l>
               <l>With Pray'r and Praiſes (which I underſtood)</l>

By this Devotion; for my cogitations</l>
               <l>Provoked were to heav'nly meditations,</l>

               <l>In Truth to ſtand, and to have Preſervation,</l>
               <l>Somewhat by this means, from the ſeveral ſnares,</l>

                  <l>To us from exerciſing of our Talents,</l>
                  <l>Unleſs we be array'd like theſe brave Gallants.</l>
                  <l>Lord, at this door of man's Imaginations</l>
                  <l>Hath crept in many great Prevarications,</l>
                  <l>Under the ſpecious name of <hi>Decency,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>And honouring of thy Name more reverently.</l>
                  <l>But theſe pretences thoſe ill fruits have born,</l>
                  <l>Mens wayes have got th' applauſe, and thine the ſcorn.</l>
                  <l>It is ſo at this day, O Lord behold it;</l>
                  <l>For men are grown too lofty to be told it,</l>
                  <l>Though they the bitter fruits thereof do feel,</l>
                  <l>And muſt feel more and more, until they reel</l>
                  <l>Into the ditch: For this, Lord, thou haſt ſaid</l>
                  <l>Shall be the end of ſuch as void have made</l>
                  <l>Thy holy Word, that they their own Tradition</l>
                  <l>May here obſerve, though unto their perdition;</l>
                  <l>Unleſs it pleaſe thee by thy Goſpel-ſentence</l>
                  <l>To call them timely unto true Repentance.</l>
