            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HAving been ſo often importuned to publiſh Dr. <hi>Hewit</hi>'s Speech and Deportment upon the Scaffold, I ſhall not excuſe my ſelfe from giving the reaſon; the former (though ſo imperfect being ſo earneſtly received by all Perſons, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the compaſſion of ſome who had been his Auditors might wiſh it were not true. But knowing my ability in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter did advertize with me about it, being unwilling that ſo great a Perſon as the Doctor ſhould be ronged by falſe and imperfect Relations that might come out only upon Seniſter account, wherefore as a further proofe of the truth, I have ſpoken with ſeverall Perſons who were upon the Scaffold, who ſeeing my Papers ſubſcribed to them as the moſt exact, wherefore that all might appeare more lively, I have added the Subſtance of his defence before the high Court of Juſtice, his letter to Doctor <hi>Wilde</hi> after ſentence, and diſcourſes and deportment upon the Scaffold, with his Elegie, being certain his Auditors will continue to let fall a Celeſtiall due upon the flowers and lillies that growes upon the grave of this great Perſon.</p>

            <p>DOctor <hi>John Hewit</hi> being apprehended for a Conſpirator againſt the preſent Power and Authority, was on Tueſday the firſt of <hi>June,</hi> brought before the high Court of Juſtice, to anſwer to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement of high Treaſon, then and there exhibited againſt him, his Plea being demanded, he moved the Court not to reſpect his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, but to excuſe it, leaſt taking advantages by the niceties of the Laws, they might bereave him of thoſe benefits the Law allowed him, or over-power his Innocency; This was not denyed, but his requeſt reaching farther to deſire to hear the Commiſſion of the Court read, which he alledged was reaſonable, and that he conceived it to be his juſt right to know the validity of that Authority by which they ſat, and whether according to Law they were Compitent Judges in his Caſe; further urging that thoſe being matters of Law, he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſired to have the liberty to adviſe with Councel in theſe and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:109948:3"/>
other the like Cauſe which did highly concern him; this being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, he urged further that he conceived it to be his right, as an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> to be tryed by a Jury, and the Judges of his Highneſſe Corts to whom and to the common Law he did appeale, but being tould there could be no appeale from them to any Court, except to a Parliament, becauſe no other Court is above them; All thoſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to the Judges of the Courts of Judicature, or to his Highneſſe Councel againſt that, if they or any of them would give it under their hand that his Tryall was according to Law, he would ſubmit, but that not being granted, as tending to the diſhonour of that Court to appeale to any other Court or Perſons, the Dr. declared how in his owne opinion he ſtood bound in conſcience and duty not to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to that power (meaning the Court) of whoſe Authority accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law he was not convinced, his not pleading being recorded upon his default, he was taken from the Bar, where on <hi>June</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. he received his Sentence as a Traitor, to be hanged drawne and quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, which he received without the leaſt dejection of ſpirit.</p>

            <head>His Carriage and Diſcourſes in Priſon.</head>
            <p>A Friend of his a while after, telling him he were glad to heare he received his Sentence without diſturbance; he replyes at that preſent, I had this Meditation, my Lord and Maſter were made to carry his Croſſe, and I the meaneſt of his Servants ſhould be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to my Croſſe. The time drawing near of his death, which was Saturday <hi>June</hi> the fifth, the Sentence was altered, his head being to be ſevered from his Body, on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> on Tueſday the eighth of the ſame Moneth. The Lords day he implyed for the moſt part in earneſt ſeeking God by prayer, that ſo through thoſe ſorrows and teares, he might purchaſe the fruition of joys and pleaſures, moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, pure and perpetuall; The reſt of the day being the afternoon, he paſt away in diſcourſe with ſome friends, who came to condole his condition, who deported himſelfe with that chearfullneſſe, that they nor he need to metigate ſorrow, and as the feare of death was not tedious to him to imbraſe, charity bids us conclude he did it to put on a better Life; This afternoon too paſſages are obſerveable.</p>
            <p>The firſt, whil'ſt the Doctor was diſcourſeing with ſome Friends, a Woman got accidentally to his Chamber doore, and in a ſeeming mallincollineſſe drew neare him, and laid her hat at his Feet, ſaying, I can never be at quiet when the godly are to ſuffer. The next, the Gard being releived, he turned to them that were departing, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:109948:3"/>
with a chearfull deportment and humble carriage, ſaith <hi>faire well my deare friends,</hi> and in all this time ſeemed ſo little to be moved at his Impriſonment, that as the walls confinde his body, ſo meekneſſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned his paſſions. On munday morning his Lady came to viſit him, but with how little pleaſure or content, I leave it to them ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, who contemplatively can make her ſorrow their one, now ſhe muſt not onely take her leave for a day, but reſolve to ſee him no more in the fleſh, and indeed to me it ſeemes impoſſible to diſtinguiſh, which was the greateſt weight of ſorrow to her ſpirit, that he muſt ſuffer an untimely death, and be no more, or that ſhe muſt take her laſt farewell of him, and ſo ſhe have him dead to her whil'ſt alive, but ſince providence compels them to part here, Imagen, for I cannot expreſſe their affectionate farewels with teares, till they meet where joys are compleater &amp; perpetual; This being paſt, he makes it his only work to put of his, and to prepare for a better life, in which D. <hi>Wild</hi> added to his indeavours his pious aſſiſtance, the day being ſpent, Dr. <hi>Wilde</hi> left him not without the beames and light of a friends <hi>prayers,</hi> and the dayes glory together, but kept him company all that night, thereby to make day in his ſoule, though it were night in the World. (Immediately after came Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carill,</hi> Mr. <hi>Manton,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bates,</hi> and others, with whoſe diſcourſe they were ſo affected, that that evening they took Coach on <hi>Lud-gate</hi> Hill, and went down to white-Hall to beg his life of his Highneſſe the Lord <hi>Protector,</hi> but that were not granted.)</p>

            <p>I Have no cauſe to think that you have not at any time taken me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with you in the daily walk upon your knees to Heaven, but I beſeech you and all my Brethren to be (now eſpecially) very mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to call upon God for me. The more company I go withal, the more welcom I ſhall be made. I ſhould be loath either to leave out of my Creed, or to be left out of the benefit of the Communion of Saints, Two are better then one. Two or three have the advantage of a Promiſe; but to goe with a multitude to the Houſe of God, where all commers are welcome, is to be aſſured before-hand of good entertainment. Admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion will hardly be denyed to any, for whom there is great importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of many: If the Gate be ſhut, much knocking will open it; or if that would not doe it, united Forces would offer an Holy violence. Many will prevail, where one alone can doe but little good. <hi>Woe unto him that is alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore dear Brother, ſith it is the infirmity of our nature, that we live not without the occaſions of giving and taking of offence. And 'tis the corruption of our nature that the offences we give, we write in the duſt; Thoſe we take, we engrave in Marble. If you know, or ſhall heare of any one either of my Brethren, or other perſons whom by any act of ſcandall I have tempted, or provoked, or leſſened or diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, to exclude me the benefits of their charitable prayers or wiſhes; I beſeech you beg of them from me, for me, their pardon. And let not any private wild-fire of paſſion put out the holy flames of a diffuſive charity: And as for my ſelfe, I doe here proteſt before God that I do heartily deſire to forget the injuries of whoſoever has treſpaſſed againſt me, either by word or deed. And if God ſhould have been pleaſed to have granted a longer life, I would not refuſe, (yea I am ſtedfaſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſollicite termes of Reconciliation with them that have done me the wrong) And if my owne heart doe not deceive me, I would give my life to ſave the ſoule of any of my Chriſtian Brethren, and would be content to want ſome degrees of glory in Heaven, ſo that my very greateſt Enemies might be ſo happy as to have ſo<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ne, knowing that Chriſt is mine, that I am Chriſts, and that Chriſt is Gods, and he it is that for my ſins hath ſuffered me to be come a publick Spectacle this day to Men and Angels, and (I hope) God, who is Omniſcient, is now beholding me with much pity, and great mercy and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the more, becauſe I am now come to that end that his owne Son came into the wolrd to, To beare witneſſe to the truth; he himſelfe ſaid, <hi>For this end was I born, for this cauſe came I into the World, that I ſhould beare witneſſe to the truth</hi>: I was brought into the world (the Chriſtian world) for to beare witneſſe to the truth of the Goſpell, as a common Chriſtian; I was brought into the world (the Church) as a Miniſter of his bleſſed Word and Sacraments; [Bleſſed be his name for that great honour and dignity;] And I came into the World to dye more immediatly for the teſtimony of Jeſus, which God hath now called me to. I came into this world (this Common-wealth) to be a member thereof, to bear witneſſe to the Truths of the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, the Laws, the Liberties, and Priviledges thereof: and for ſo doing I am now to ſuffer; And me thinks it ſeemes to me a ſtrange thing, that in as much as we all plead for Liberty, and Priviledges, and I pleading for the Priviledges, the Laws,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:109948:5"/>
the Statutes, and the Cuſtomes of this Land, yet I ſhould dye by thoſe that ſhould ſtand for the Lawes, the Statutes, and Priviledges of the Land: And I am here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by thoſe that plead for their Liberties, and I hope I am pitied, becauſe I here give up my ſelfe willingly and freely to be a State-Martyr for the publick good; Indeed I had rather dye many deaths my ſelfe, than betray my fellow-free-men to ſo many inconveniences that they might be like to ſuffer by being ſubject to the wills of them that willed me to this death.</p>
            <p>And it is worthy remembrance that Mr. <hi>Aturny Gen.</hi> having impeached me of Treaſon (to the Commiſſioners of the Court) againſt his Highneſſe, I did often (when brought before thoſe Commiſſioners) plead for the Liberties of the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though I had no knowledge of the Law, yet I had inſtruction from theſe that were learned in the Law, and had ſeverall Law Caſes and Preſidents put into my hand, though not by them, and urged ſeveral Law-Caſes, and made my Appeal, Firſt, for the <hi>Judicature</hi> that I was to be tryed by, Whether it were according to Law? Whether it were according to the Act? And whether it were according to the words of the ſaid Act? I did appeal to have the ſaid Act argued by learned Lawyers on both ſides, and then to be reſolved by his Highneſſe own Councell, which was denyed me, [This by the by] I preſſing the Argument made a ſecond Appeal that thoſe Judges if they would give ſingly their ſeveral Judgements that it was a juſt and lawfull Court of Judicature, according to the Laws of the Land; I would anſwer to my Charge. I did make another Appeal to thoſe that were his Highneſs's Councel, and pleaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt m<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, That if they would deliver it to me under their hands to be according to Law, I would then go on to plead and anſwer to the Charge, but all was anſwered either with a denyall or a diſregard. What was then ſaid further, my ſpirits being faint, I ſhall not ſay much, but only this, I was taken in three defaults upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality of the Court. It ſeemes it is a cuſtome in all Courts, (which I did not know bfore) that if they anſwer not the third time ſpeaking by the Clerk, that then they are guilty of three defaults, and proceeded againſt as mute: [I had no ſuch know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law.] This advantage being laid hold on, hath brought my Innoſence to ſuffer as the guilty, for they found me guilty of thoſe defaults; and when I would have pleaded, and reſolved to begin to plead, I was taken from the Bar. I did the next day make my Petition to the Court in the Painted-Chamber, two Petitions were preſented the ſame in effect; in the former the Title was miſtaken: Yet becauſe the Title was miſtaken, and no anſwer was given, therefore it was that another Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was drawn up to the ſame effect, with a new Title given, (as I remember) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Serjeants at Arms, and one writ it over in ſuch haſte, leſt they ſhould be drawn out of the Painted-Chamber into the Court, that I had not time to read it over, only I ſubſcribed my name, and there was in the front of the Petition a word left out, but what the word was I know not, but muſt needs be ſenſible the treſpaſſe was but ſmall, and its hard that a miſtake of that nature ſhould take the blood of the Innoſent for the guilty; for it was taken ſo ill, as if I had put an offront and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on the Court; And it was thought they would have heard me plead; but becauſe of that miſtake, they ſent word, I ſhould have my anſwer when I came into the Court, and my anſwer I had indeed, which was the ſentence of condemnation that adjudged me to this place. And therefore I pray with all my ſoul, that God would forgive all thoſe that occaſioned the charge to be drawn againſt me, to give ſuch unjuſt things againſt me; I pray with all my ſoul, that God would forgive all
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:109948:6"/>
thoſe that upon ſo ſlender and ſmall grounds adjudg'd me to dye by taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſuch ſimpl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ignorance as I was in. And it is the mere to be obſerved, becauſe I had at the begining of my pleading engaged their Honors, no advantage ſhould be taken againſt me to my prejudice, that in as much as I underſtood nothing of the Law: And having heard that a man in the nicity of the Law might be loſt in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity thereof, meerly for ſpeaking a word out of ſimple ignorance, I made it my prayer to them that no advantage might be taken againſt me to the prejudice of my perſon: And there was to me a ſeeming conſent and promiſe, for the Preſident told me, there ſhould be no advantage taken againſt me: and upon theſe conſiderations I am afraid there was two great uncha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her, it is fit I ſhould give you ſomewhat as concerning my ſelfe, as I am a Chriſtian, and as I am a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy-man. Firſt, as I am a Chriſtian, I thank God I was baptized to the Holy Church, ſo I was baptized to be a member of the holy Catholique Church, that is, the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I dare ſay for purity of Doctrine, and orderly Diſcipline, till a ſad reformation had ſpoiled the face of the Church, and made it a querie, whether it were a Church, or no? I ſay, It was more purely Divine and Apoſtolical, than any other Doctrine or Church in the Chriſtian World, whether National, or Claſſical, or Congregational: And I muſt tell you, That as I am a member of this Church, ſo I am a member of the holy Catholique Church, and ſhall give a moſt juſt confeſſion of my faith, both negatively and affirmatively. Negatively, I am ſo a member of the holy Catholique Church, that I abhor all <hi>Sects, Schi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e, I would have diſcovered and betrayed I cannot tell what. I hope my converſation hath not been ſuch here in this City, where I have been a long time very well known, as to make one imagine I ſhould intermeddle in ſuch an action, and goe ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the practiſe of my proieſſion; and I hope there are none ſo uncharitable to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me, as to beleive I had a knowledge of that deſigne which is reported, I abhor.</p>
            <p>Here I muſt come to particulars for a Plot, of having a deſigne upon the City of <hi>London,</hi> for the firing of it. I ſo much tremble at the thought of the thing that ſhould have been done, as they ſay, for the carrying on of ſuch a deſigne, (if my
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:109948:6"/>
heart deceive me not) had I known it, I ſo much abhor the thing unfainedly from my heart, and as a dying man I am confident I ſhould have been the firſt diſcoverer of it: Nor ever had I correſpondency or meetings with ſuch perſons as would have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed on ſuch a deſigne. It Is ſaid likewiſe, I entertained the Earl, the Marqueſs of <hi>Ormond</hi>: To my remembrance I never ſaw the face of that honourable Perſon in my life. It is ſaid, One Lords day I did preach at Saint <hi>Gregories,</hi> and the next Lords day I was at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> or <hi>Bruges,</hi> and kiſt the Kings hand, and brought I cannot tell what Orders and Inſtructions from him. This I ſhall ſay, For theſe three years laſt paſt together, I have not been ſixty miles from this City of <hi>London,</hi> and I think it is ſomewhat further to either of thoſe places, than threeſcore miles. It is ſaid that I kept correſpondence with one <hi>Mallory</hi> and <hi>Biſhop</hi>: They are perſons I have heard of their names, but never in all my life to my knowledge ſaw their faces; and to my knowledge I doe not know they know me; nor doe I know them at all, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I have heard of their names. And whoſoever elſe hath ſuggeſted ſuch things againſt me, I know not, but the Lord God forgive them, who is juſt and mercifull.</p>
            <p>His Highneſſe was pleaſed to tell me, I was like a flaming Torch in the midſt of a ſheafe of Corn: He meaning, I being a publick Preacher, was able to ſet the City on fire by ſedition and combuſtions, and promoting deſignes H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re truly I do ſay, and have it from many of thoſe that are Judges of the High Court, by which I was condemned, that upon examination of the buſineſs they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>res. And truly I muſt needs ſay therefore, That it was a very uncharitable act in them (who ever they were) that brought ſuch accuſation againſt me, and irritated his Highneſſe againſt me, which firſt obſtructed my liberty, next brought to the Bar as a Traitor, which now commands me to ſatisfie them with my blood, but I will not ſay it was malice, it might be zeal, but it was raſh zeal which cauſed me to be ſentenced to this place: The God of Mercy pardon and forgive them all. And truly, as I am a member of the Church, and as a member of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, where on behalfe I have been ſpeaking, I cannot but doe as our Saviour himſelfe did for his Diſciples, when he was to be taken from them, he bleſſed them, and aſcended up to Heaven. My truſt is, in the mercy of the <hi>Moſt High I</hi> ſhall not miſcarry; and however my dayes are ſhortned by this unexpected doom, and ſhall be brought untimely to the grave: I cannot goe without my prayers for a bleſſing upon all the people of this Land, and cannot but bleſſe them all in the name of God, and beſeech God to bleſſe them in all their wayes, and his bleſſing be upon them all; and upon me that am to ſuffer an ignominious violent death, but my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is in the moſt high, and here is my hope that I am my Beloveds, and my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved is mine, therefore come Lord Jeſus, come quickly.</p>

O Lord our God! we pray thee that thy patience and long-ſuffering might leade to repentance, that thou wouldst be pleaſed, thou who delighteſt not in the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould turn from his ſins and live, that thou wouldeſt turn us unto thee, O Lord! and we ſhall be turned: Draw us, and we ſhall run after thee: Draw us with the Cords of love, and by the bands of thy loving kindneſs, by the powerfull working of thy holy ſpirit in our ſouls, worke con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition in our hearts, and a godly ſorrow for all our ſins, even a ſorrow to repentance, and a repentance to ſalvation never to be repented of.

Help us to live as thy redeemed ones, and (Lord!) let us not any longer by our wicked lives deny that moſt holy faith whereof our lips have ſo long time made profeſſion, but let us that call on the name of the Lord Jeſus, depart from iniquity, and hate every evil way.

O Lord, with what affliction ſoever thou ſhalt puniſh, doe not puniſh us with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall judgements and diſertions.
