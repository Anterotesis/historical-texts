            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>MATT. XXV. 34, 35, 36.</bibl>
               <q>Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, come
ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared
for you from the Foundation of the World: For I was
an hungred, and ye gave me meat; I was thirsty, and
ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me
in; naked, and ye cloathed me; I was sick, and ye
visited me; I was in prison, and ye came unto me.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>AS there is no Virtue more <hi>excellent</hi> in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
more <hi>honourable</hi> to our selves, or more
<hi>useful</hi> to Mankind than that of <hi>Charity;</hi> so I
do not know of any that has more Topicks to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it. The Occasions of exercising this Duty
are many and frequent, and they are often such as
call upon the Ministers of the Gospel to inculcate and
press it, and yet the Subject is not exhausted, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
still ample Matter for our Meditation.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Anniversary</hi> Meeting which we now celebrate,
gives a succession of fit Opportunities for a <hi>Discourse</hi>
of this Nature. And, blessed be God! it is a very
noble Demonstration that these Discourses are not in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42084:4"/>
               <hi>vain;</hi> that they do move the Hearts and Affections of
the <hi>Hearers,</hi> and that the Seed sown produces a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
Crop, to the Relief of Multitudes, some of which
are the <hi>Ornament</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of the present <hi>Solemnity.</hi>
And it must needs be a solid Comfort to all that are
truly zealous for the Honour of our Holy <hi>Religion,</hi>
to find, that among all the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of the Age which
are so justly complain'd of, there is yet such a Spirit
of <hi>Charity</hi> visible in this <hi>great City,</hi> as plainly shews
that <hi>Christianity</hi> has a <hi>Life</hi> and Vigor among us, and
that there are not wanting Numbers of those who
make it appear that they love the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi>
by their Pity and Compassion to his <hi>suffering Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What I am now to read to you is an ample <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi>
in this Matter, <hi>viz.</hi>

House for the keeping and curing the said Lunaticks, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
Persons: In the Building and Finishing whereof, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
of the said Hospital have laid out and disbursed above Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Thousand Pounds, whereby not only the whole Stock of the said
Hospital is expended, but the Governours thereof have been necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to
take up several great Summs of mony, for the finishing the same.
And therefore the said Hospital is a very fit object of all good mens
Charity, to do as God shall enable them, toward the relief of the said
poor Lunaticks, and Payment of their Debts; there having been,
and daily are, by the blessing of God, and the charge of the said Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital,
and the Care of those that are intrusted therewith, divers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to their former Senses.</p>
                        </div>

                           <p>Beside what is done toward the Relief of so many in these several
<hi>Hospitals,</hi> the President and Governours of the <hi>Corporation for the poor
of the City of</hi> London, lately erected, have begun an admirable design
for the employing the common Poor, and clearing the Streets of idle
Beggars and Vagrants; and for carrying it on, they have advanc'd a
considerable Loan of Money out of their own private Cashes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
they have provided Work-houses and neceassry-Implements;
and have already taken into their care, out of the several Parishes in
the City, above 200 Children, whom they provide with Dyet,
Cloathing, and Instruction, and bring them up to work at our Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures;
and they have contracted for the teaching about 800 more,
whom they will likewise constantly employ, and take their Work off
their hands for the best Price.</p>
                           <p>And they hope that, by the generous Contribution of Charitable
Persons, they shall be able in a short time to set to work <hi>all the Poor
of the City of</hi> London <hi>and the Liberties thereof;</hi> and likewise to employ
<hi>all poor Mechanicks,</hi> in the several Employments they have been bred
to, or shall be capable of, and to take off all the Work they make,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42084:6"/>
tho' they should lose thereby, that so they may prevent any of their
Inhabitants from living idly, and wanting Work, whereby many are
forced to beg, steal, or to have recourse to other dissolute, vicious and
unlawful Practices.</p>
                           <p>This being a work of so great Use, and of such excellent Example,
they trust all good Men will lend their Assistance toward it; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
since it is now in its <hi>beginning,</hi> and most wants Encouragement:
And should it fail, would probably discourage other Parts of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
from attempting the like; but if it succeed and flourish, it may
in time spread over the whole Kingdom, to the unspeakable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of the Publick, not only in increasing our Manufactures, but in
bettering the Manners of the poorer sort of People.</p>

            <p>These are indeed very good Tokens of a <hi>Christian</hi>
Disposition among us; and it is the continuance, the
growth, and the propagation of this Christian Dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
that is the main End of this Day's Assembly.
And it must be confessed, that the Assembly it self is
a very forcible Motive to it, where the Beauty, the
Comfort, and the Usefulness of it appears by those
<hi>numbers</hi> of poor Creatures who are relieved by it. And
this cannot but have its effect upon all that see it, and
must be felt without my Direction.</p>
            <p>But the great <hi>Festival</hi> now depending determines
my Thoughts to Arguments of another nature, and
the Commemoration of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi>
which must enliven the Hopes of our <hi>own,</hi> urges me
to press you to <hi>Charity</hi> and Compassion at this time,
rather from the <hi>Fruit</hi> you your selves shall reap from
it in <hi>another</hi> World, than that <hi>Support</hi> your indigent
Brethren shall receive from it in <hi>this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:42084:6"/>
               <hi>And for that reason I have made choice of these
words, which are a part of the account that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
himself gives of the great</hi> Resurrection, <hi>and of
his coming to</hi> judgment <hi>at the end of the World. Which
he begins at the</hi> 31. Verse, <hi>telling us, that</hi> When the
Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy Angels
with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory: And
before him shall be gathered all nations, and he shall sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his
sheep from the goats. And he shall set the sheep on his
right hand, but the goats on the left. <hi>And then follow
the Words of my Text,</hi> Then shall the King say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them on his right hand, come ye blessed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now these Words contain the most <hi>noble</hi> Arguments
for <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>pity,</hi> that can possibly be applyed to the
mind of Man: All acts of compassion done to our
wanting <hi>Brethren,</hi> are represented here as done to our
<hi>Saviour</hi> himself, and are declared to be so taken and
<hi>accepted.</hi> This acceptance is farther illustrated by the
glorious <hi>Reward</hi> that attends them, <hi>a Kingdom prepared
from the foundation of the world,</hi> and that will last when
this World shall be no more: And <hi>further</hi> yet, by the
<hi>particular</hi> place these works have, in the <hi>reason</hi> that is
given for this wonderful retribution; <hi>for I was hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and ye gave me meat; thirsty, and ye gave me drink,</hi>
&amp;c. Where 'tis observable, that no other good works
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42084:7"/>
are mention'd, but those of Charity and Mercy; from
whence, though we must by no means gather that
good actions of <hi>other</hi> kinds will not be <hi>regarded,</hi> yet
the least we can conclude, is, that these will have a
<hi>peculiar</hi> degree of acceptance, and that the Charitable
Man shall have a distinguishing share of the Character,
<hi>The blessed of the Father.</hi> Now if Charity at the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection</hi>
shall be, before Angels and men, thus <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,</hi>
thus <hi>rewarded,</hi> and thus <hi>distinguish'd,</hi> and <hi>that</hi>
by our <hi>Saviour</hi> himself, sitting in all the pomp of the
last <hi>judgment;</hi> 'tis not easie to imagine any thing that
can be so persuasive to move us, not only to <hi>exercise</hi>
this Virtue, but to be <hi>zealous</hi> in promoting it, and
desirous to <hi>excel</hi> in it: 'Tis a Consideration that will
work on our <hi>Reason,</hi> our <hi>Gratitude,</hi> our <hi>Interest,</hi> and
our <hi>Ambition,</hi> the most <hi>vigorous</hi> and active springs in
human Nature; and it must be either not well illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated
by the <hi>Preacher,</hi> or very ill considered by the
<hi>hearers,</hi> if it does not make a very sensible and lasting
impression on our Hearts.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore confine my present discourse, to
this <hi>threefold</hi> Argument for Charity and Pity, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
in my Text; and shall distinctly offer to your
reflection the several parts of it.</p>
            <p>I. Our Saviour's accepting the Charity we shew to
our distressed Brethren as done to himself.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:42084:7"/>II. The Reward which it shall meet with in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.</p>
            <p>III. The distinction, and peculiar degrees of glory,
that shall attend the Charitable Man in another
Life.</p>
            <p>I. I begin with the first, <hi>Our Saviour</hi>'s <hi>accepting the
charity we shew to our distressed Brethren, as done to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</hi>
That he does thus <hi>accept</hi> it, is sufficiently evident
from the words in the Text, I <hi>was hungry and ye gave</hi>
me <hi>meat,</hi> &amp;c. But to make it yet more <hi>plain,</hi> and
consequently the more to <hi>enforce</hi> the Duty, he frames
an <hi>Answer</hi> from the <hi>Righteous, v.</hi> 37. &amp;c. <hi>When saw
we thee an hungred, and fed thee, or thirsty, and gave
thee drink?</hi> &amp;c. Intimating, that they could not i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
how they should be entitled to the merit of
so many services to him, whom they had never seen
in his state of <hi>humiliation;</hi> and that therefore, how
great soever their <hi>Love</hi> to him were, they could not
pretend to have had such occasions of <hi>expressing</hi> it;
and this Answer our Saviour makes for them, to usher
in his own <hi>reply. v. 40. Then the King shall answer,
and say unto them, verily I say unto you, in as much as
ye have done it to one of the least of these my brethren, ye
have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If then, by this <hi>repetition</hi> and <hi>asseveration,</hi> it be put
out of all doubt, that our Saviour does accept our
Charity to <hi>his</hi> and <hi>our</hi> poor Brethren, as done to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:42084:8"/>
               <hi>himself;</hi> it must be out of all doubt too, that it ought
very nearly to <hi>affect</hi> us, and <hi>that</hi> whether we consider
these words as giving a <hi>Rule</hi> for our direction, or an
<hi>occasion</hi> for our <hi>gratitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I. If we consider this as <hi>a Rule for our direction,</hi> then
the <hi>strength</hi> of it will be briefly <hi>this.</hi> Our Saviour is
intimately <hi>affected</hi> with the wants of our Brethren, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
their <hi>afflictions,</hi> commiserates their <hi>pain,</hi> grieves
himself at their <hi>grief</hi> and sorrows, and has a <hi>fellow-feeling</hi>
of their miseries; his <hi>tenderness</hi> is so great for
them, that he reckons them his <hi>Friends,</hi> his <hi>Brethren,</hi>
yea even <hi>Members</hi> of his Body, and parts of <hi>himself;</hi>
the comfort or relief that is administred to them, is
so acceptable to him, that he professes himself to feel
a mighty satisfaction and <hi>comfort</hi> in it; and what can
the consequence be less than, <hi>go thou and do likewise?</hi>
Is there any better <hi>pattern</hi> for us to imitate? Or can we
regulate our <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> by a nobler Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del?
Is the blessed <hi>Iesus,</hi> the Son of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Saviour</hi>
of the World, so nearly concerned for those that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer?
And shall we who carry his <hi>name,</hi> believe his
<hi>Doctrine,</hi> and profess to imitate his <hi>example,</hi> have no
concern at all, or but a <hi>cold</hi> and disproportion'd one?
This sure is highly <hi>unfit</hi> and unreasonable; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
while our <hi>head</hi> professes this tenderness for all his
Members, the <hi>Members</hi> ought to have a like compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
one for another, and <hi>whether one member suffer, all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42084:8"/>
the members should suffer with it; or one member be</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted,
<hi>all the members should rejoyce with it; 1 Cor.</hi>
12. 26. Such force has the pity of our Saviour to
command ours, if we consider him barely as our <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi>
and Example. But there are two reflexions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
this head, which will make the impression yet
<hi>deeper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(1.) The first is, that our Saviour is in <hi>Heaven,</hi> at
the right hand of his Father, remov'd far from all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of <hi>Suffering</hi> in his own person: He has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>mortality,</hi> and all its Appendages, troubles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,
and even Death it self; and is in possession
of a Kingdom, Glorious, Eternal, and exempt from
all <hi>misfortunes;</hi> and yet in this state of immutable Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness,
he has this tender compassion for those who
are combating with the <hi>calamities</hi> of this lower World.
How much greater reason then have <hi>we,</hi> to have bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els
of Mercy toward those who suffer, since we our
selves are in the <hi>same condemnation?</hi> Our persons and
our condition are both here <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>uncertain,</hi> and we
are subject to the very same miseries that any of our
fellow Creatures suffer, and we do not know how
<hi>soon</hi> providence may call us to be tryed by them. Now
'tis a moving Argument to pity, that the case we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miserate
may one day be our <hi>own;</hi> and the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion
on what we would <hi>then</hi> desire for <hi>our selves,</hi>
must melt us into Charity toward <hi>other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:42084:9"/>(2.) And this puts us in mind of a <hi>second</hi> reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
that our Saviour has no other spring to move
him to this tender regard of those who suffer, but his
own infinite <hi>mercy</hi> and compassion; he can receive no
real <hi>Retribution,</hi> and no <hi>Accession</hi> to his Happiness
by it. He neither wants their <hi>prayers,</hi> their <hi>thanks,</hi> nor
their <hi>returns.</hi> But <hi>our</hi> case is quite otherwise; the Alms
we give may be amply repaid in fervent <hi>prayers,</hi> that
will pierce the Skies for us, and not return till they
have gain'd a Blessing on our persons or designs; the
<hi>thanks</hi> and acknowledgments that follow our bounty,
may increase our <hi>good name</hi> or our <hi>interest</hi> in the
World; and an exemplary Charity to the poor and
distressed, may entitle <hi>our selves</hi> or <hi>descendants</hi> to an
universal <hi>assitance,</hi> when it shall be our turn to want
it: And all these things have a strong influence upon
human Nature, and must suggest, that if we are bound
to imitate our Saviour, and to be merciful after his
Example, barely for the <hi>fitness</hi> and <hi>rectitude</hi> of the
thing in it self; then certainly we are still under grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obligation, not only to tread in his steps, but to
do it with <hi>zeal</hi> and <hi>constancy,</hi> when there are such <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current</hi>
Arguments as these to quicken our resolutions
and endeavours.</p>
            <p>2. But our Saviour's acceptance of Charity as done
to himself, does not only affect us as a <hi>Rule</hi> for us to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate,
but urges to the practice of this duty toward
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42084:9"/>
our Brethren, in <hi>gratitude to our Saviour</hi> to whom we
owe so much. Our returns, as I before hinted, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
properly reach <hi>him,</hi> nor can we really repay what
he has done for us; and therefore if he directs our
acknowledgments to any <hi>other</hi> Objects, whom he
shall make his <hi>Proxies and Receivers,</hi> our debt to him
must oblige us to pay what we can <hi>there.</hi> Since then
our Saviour declares that the pity and the relief which
we afford to persons distressed, shall be accounted as
if it had been applyed to himself in person, the very
same Arguments must move us to <hi>Charity</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion
to the <hi>poor</hi> and miserable, that call for our
<hi>gratitude</hi> to our <hi>Saviour</hi> and Redeemer. And one
would think there should be no need to mention these;
they are so <hi>many,</hi> that some of them must be always
before us, and they are of that <hi>force</hi> that it is very hard
to resist them. But since human Nature is too apt to
be <hi>insensible,</hi> or <hi>cold,</hi> or <hi>forgetful,</hi> I shall crave leave
to excite your Charity, as it is a piece of gratitude to
our Saviour, on these <hi>four</hi> accounts.</p>
            <p>(1.) As he is one that <hi>loves</hi> us; and <hi>that</hi> with such
a degree of <hi>tenderness,</hi> as human affections can never
measure, and human expressions can never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe;
he who is <hi>God blessed for evermore,</hi> left the
bosom of his Father to dwell among us; he uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
himself to us, not in <hi>appearance</hi> only, but in <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi>
took our flesh and blood upon him, made us
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42084:10"/>
his <hi>Friends,</hi> his <hi>Brethren,</hi> and even <hi>Members</hi> of himself,
undeserving, unprofitable, and rebellious as we were!
And for no other reason that we can fathom, but his
own good will and unmerited kindness, he distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd
<hi>Man</hi> from those <hi>Noble</hi> Beings, that wanted a
<hi>Redeemer</hi> as much as we; <hi>for he took not upon him the
nature of Angels, but he took upon him the seed of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
Now the most natural effect of <hi>Love,</hi> is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<hi>Love</hi> again, and a Love resembling that which
calls for it. And can we see what has so lov'd us,
and what we ought so to love again, <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>naked,</hi>
and <hi>hungry,</hi> and <hi>griev'd,</hi> and grant no compassion
or relief? And yet this is our case, when we are <hi>hard-hearted</hi>
and uncharitable to our afflicted Brethren. 'Tis
our Saviour that suffers in them, and calls for our
help; and when we commiserate their condition, and
supply their wants, we are but obliging and grateful
to him that <hi>first lov'd us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(2.) Our gratitude is due to our Saviour as he is
our great <hi>Benefactor,</hi> as one whose love has not been
bare <hi>Benevolence,</hi> but has flow'd to us in streams of
unspeakable <hi>bounty;</hi> he has not only pityed our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
and blindness, but has <hi>illuminated</hi> our minds, by
a clear Revelation of the Will of God, and the Duty
of Man; he compassions our weakness, and he <hi>sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports</hi>
it by his constant Encouragement and Assistance;
he <hi>intercedes</hi> for our pardon daily, when we do amiss;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42084:10"/>
and he as daily offers his <hi>Grace,</hi> to <hi>enable</hi> us to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
he <hi>protects</hi> us and <hi>guides</hi> us in this World, and
has prepared <hi>Mansions</hi> for us in a future. And can
we live under these, and infinite more continued
blessings of the like nature, and never think of doing
any thing in return? Benefactions do certainly create
a <hi>debt,</hi> and though, may be, <hi>civil</hi> Laws do not take
notice of it, or cannot enforce it, yet the Law of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
does oblige us to <hi>re-payment.</hi> And if we can
pay such debts as these, only by communicating some
of our <hi>conveniences,</hi> perhaps only our <hi>superfluities,</hi> to
Creatures like our selves, whose <hi>wants</hi> call for it, and
whose <hi>comfort</hi> and ease, and sometimes even Life and
<hi>Being</hi> depend upon it, sure we ought to be pleased
with the occasion and to close with it, and <hi>rejoyce</hi> that
our Saviour affords us any means, especially so rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
and so grateful ones, of demonstrating our
sense of his <hi>Love,</hi> and our gratitude for his <hi>Benefactions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(3.) The compassionate <hi>Iesus</hi> is not only our
Benefactor, but our <hi>Deliverer</hi> too, and has rescued us
from the most intolerable Evils that human Nature
could groan under; from the tyranny of <hi>sin,</hi> the
<hi>wrath</hi> of God, and everlasting <hi>death.</hi> This is indeed
one of his Benefactions, but I mention it <hi>distinctly,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
our sense of <hi>Evil</hi> is much more quick and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
than that of <hi>Good,</hi> and deliverance from what
hurts or torments us, does infinitely more oblige than
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42084:11"/>
additions made to our happiness; kindnesses and good
turns that are done us in our <hi>prosperity,</hi> very often
lose their price with us; our <hi>negligence</hi> overlooks them,
or our <hi>pride</hi> undervalues them, or reckons them as due.
But the Evils we lye under convince us of our <hi>frailty,</hi>
and emptiness, and represent our deliverers as fraught
with <hi>favour</hi> and <hi>obligations.</hi> How do we respect those
who restore us to our <hi>health,</hi> from a painful or a tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
sickness! How do we honour them who deliver
us out of <hi>captivity</hi> or imprisonment, and bless them
for the sweets of that <hi>liberty,</hi> which we regain by their
help! And how do we magnifie that conduct, and
that courage, which rescues us from a <hi>Tyranny</hi> on
our Consciences, or <hi>oppression</hi> in our Rights or Estates!
No Honour, no Zeal, no Service is thought enough;
and truly scarce any is enough, to shew the inward
feeling we have of such <hi>benefits.</hi> Now would we but
apply this Argument to the <hi>present</hi> case, it would have
more weight than it can in any other instance. No
<hi>Deliverer</hi> can free us from such Evils as our Saviour has
done; no <hi>Physitian</hi> can heal us like that Physitian of
our Souls; no Conqueror can retrieve us from such a
Captivity as that we were under to <hi>sin,</hi> or from such
a Tyranny as that we were opprest with by <hi>Satan,</hi>
who <hi>led us away captive at his will.</hi> And then the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
result must be, that all that we can do to testifie
our acknowledgment is here most <hi>justly</hi> applyed, that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:42084:11"/>
whatever we can return is still too <hi>little,</hi> and our mind
must always owe, what our actions cannot <hi>sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
express; and this should make us <hi>desirous</hi> of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
for our Charity, <hi>ready</hi> in embracing 'em, and
<hi>zealous</hi> in promoting the end of them. We should
think we could never do <hi>good</hi> enough, to express our
thankfulness to him who has deliver'd us from so
much <hi>Evil;</hi> nor could we reckon our selves worthy
of the Happiness we enjoy, while we could see any
poor Members of our Saviour in misery, calling for
our aid, and yet <hi>unreliev'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(4.) But there is one further reflexion, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
all that has been yet said; and <hi>that</hi> is, that
our Saviour rescued us from misery, <hi>by undergoing it
himself,</hi> and became our Deliverer by becoming our
<hi>Sacrifice.</hi> And this raises the Obligation to its full
<hi>heighth,</hi> and must put the Soul upon its utmost <hi>stretch</hi>
to answer it. All the other <hi>Topicks</hi> of gratitude car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
along with them some <hi>invitation</hi> to the person that
obliges us. To <hi>love</hi> even the unworthy, is the exercise
of the most <hi>beautiful</hi> and charming quality of the
mind; to <hi>do kindnesses</hi> to those about us, is a very
pleasant way of being kind to <hi>our selves; to succour</hi>
those who want it, and to <hi>relieve</hi> the oppressed, is to
succour our own persons, and to relieve those <hi>yearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi>
which the misery of others creates in us, by a
kind of <hi>sympathy</hi> in human Nature. But <hi>suffering</hi> has
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:42084:12"/>
nothing in it to make it <hi>agreeable,</hi> humanity shrinks
at it, and cannot be reconciled to it; no resolution
or courage embraces it <hi>for it self,</hi> and therefore he
that suffers for us, cannot do it for his <hi>own,</hi> but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for <hi>our sakes,</hi> and so lays on us the <hi>purest</hi> and most
<hi>improv'd</hi> obligation. But <hi>this</hi> our Saviour has done,
and has <hi>suffer'd</hi> for us beyond what we can <hi>conceive,</hi>
because we cannot comprehend the <hi>dignity</hi> of <hi>him</hi> that
suffered, nor the <hi>weight</hi> of that <hi>wrath</hi> of God which he
bare for us, and had a perfect sense of; in one word, he
laid down his life, and underwent a <hi>painful</hi> and <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious</hi>
death for us, upon the <hi>accursed</hi> Tree; and
should we not account then that <hi>he has bought us
with a price,</hi> and that our <hi>Life,</hi> our Bodies, and Souls
are his? And if he may justly call us, to lay down
even our <hi>lives</hi> for his sake, shall we be backward
when he calls but for a <hi>small</hi> portion of what we can well
<hi>spare,</hi> to his poor Family that <hi>wants</hi> it? Should any
Man have so wonderful a love for another, as to lay
down his own Head to save him from <hi>Execution,</hi> and
should the <hi>Relations</hi> or <hi>Children</hi> of that very person
fall to <hi>poverty</hi> and want, would not he that was sav'd
by him from Death, reckon all that he had <hi>due</hi> to
their relief? Now our Charity is dispensed not to the
<hi>Relations</hi> or <hi>Family,</hi> but the very <hi>Members</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
nay to <hi>himself,</hi> for he alone still lives after
Death, and is sensible of this return. And let <hi>this</hi> be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:42084:12"/>
considered, and I think the obligation cannot be <hi>further</hi>
improv'd: Let a Man but reflect that the merciful
<hi>Iesus</hi> was Scourged, and Pierc'd, and Crucifi'd for
<hi>him;</hi> and let him but fancy that the hungry, the
blind, and the Lame, in one word, all the <hi>miserable</hi>
are the <hi>Members,</hi> the <hi>body</hi> of this bleeding and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
Saviour, and then let him be hard-hearted
and cruel if he can.</p>
            <p>I have been the longer upon this Topick for our
Charity, <hi>the gratitude we owe to our Saviour,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
I think it is the most <hi>moving</hi> one to a <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi>
disposition, and Charity should always flow
from a disposition that is generous, and above the
<hi>narrow</hi> designs of interest and <hi>self-love;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we cannot have too many tyes to so excellent a
Virtue, and so great an <hi>ornament</hi> of our Nature, I
must pass on to those which may work even upon them,
who have some tincture of the <hi>Mercenary</hi> and <hi>Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi>
For,</p>
            <p>II. The second motive to Charity contained in the
Text, is an Argument of interest <hi>viz. The Reward it
shall meet with in the Resurrection,</hi> expressed in these
words, <hi>inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the
Foundation of the World.</hi> Now this is an expression that
hints to us both the <hi>greatness</hi> and the <hi>continuance</hi> of that
Happiness which the Charitable Man is encouraged to
expect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:42084:13"/>The World has nothing greater than a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> at
least nothing that men generally <hi>think</hi> greater, or <hi>covet</hi>
more; and therefore since our conceptions of a <hi>future</hi>
state, must be framed by <hi>notions</hi> taken up in <hi>this,</hi> there
is no other way to describe it, but by an allusion to
those things which are <hi>here</hi> the object of our desires or
enjoyments. And for this Reason eternal Happiness is
call'd a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> a <hi>Crown,</hi> a <hi>Throne,</hi> and the like; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
men who are in possession of <hi>these</hi> are supposed
(how truly they best know who have them) to be in
possession of all that is <hi>desirable</hi> in this Life; but since
these are expressions suited to our <hi>conceptions,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them must be, that the Joys of Heaven shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
not what these things are in <hi>reality,</hi> (for perhaps
that would not be worth our wishes,) but what our
<hi>imaginations</hi> fancy they are; or that the ambitious can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
promise himself such charms in a Crown, as the
charitable Man shall <hi>find</hi> in Heaven. But then, that
<hi>Heaven</hi> may not lose its value with those men who
judge best, that is, those who see the vanity of <hi>all,</hi> even
the <hi>greatest</hi> things on Earth, the Scripture often sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
the defect of such similitudes as these by plainer
Language; and assures us, that <hi>eye has not seen, nor
ear heard, neither hath it enter'd into the heart of man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the things that God has laid up for them that love him.</hi>
And we may add, for them who love their <hi>Brethren</hi>
too.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:42084:13"/>Such is the weight of the glory that shall one day
be revealed in the Charitable Man, and 'tis not the
least Article in it, that it is a Glory which shall <hi>not be
done away;</hi> for 'tis a Kingdom <hi>prepared from the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the World.</hi> 'Tis true, these Words seem at first
sight only to denote the <hi>Certainty</hi> of this Reward, as
that which the eternal purpose of God, which cannot fail,
has prepared for good men; but they very well imply
the <hi>Eternity</hi> of that state, and intimate that it is a part
of that blessedness which <hi>God</hi> himself enjoys, which
was <hi>before</hi> the World, and for that reason must be <hi>after</hi>
it. They are <hi>created</hi> things only that are <hi>mortal,</hi> and
what was from Eternity before this World was <hi>made,</hi>
must be to Eternity when it is <hi>dissolved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that these <hi>two</hi> Considerations seem to involve all
that can possibly be desired in any state, that it is <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>
Happiness, and that it will <hi>always</hi> be so; and if
this be the Reward of the Charitable Man, then I think
these <hi>three</hi> things are very plain.</p>
            <p>1. That what we give away in Charity, <hi>is not lost;</hi>
it is not a <hi>waste</hi> made of the good things we enjoy, as
the <hi>selfish</hi> Man is apt to imagine, who thinks that <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished,</hi>
which is <hi>remov'd</hi> from himself; 'tis but <hi>lent,</hi> and
will be repaid in due time; for he that <hi>pityeth the poor,
lendeth unto the Lord, and look what he layeth out, it shall
be paid him again.</hi> A little expectation will re-imburse
us, and we may <hi>throw our bread upon the waters, and it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:42084:14"/>
will return to us after many days.</hi> It will probably enough
find us on <hi>this</hi> side the Grave, but if not, it will make
a sure return <hi>beyond</hi> it. The <hi>poor</hi> whom we relieve
may never be in a capacity to recompense us, but
their <hi>surety</hi> always is, and he <hi>will recompense us at the
Resurrection of the just.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What we bestow in Charity, is <hi>better preserved
for us,</hi> than it can possibly be by any other method.
All the Matter of our Charity is subject to <hi>decay,</hi> and
is corruptible in it self; 'tis Charity only that can <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve</hi>
it for ever. The Bread we deal to the hungry,
and the Drink we reach to the thirsty, would but <hi>mould</hi>
and <hi>sour</hi> if we kept them by us. The Garments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
we Cloath the naked, would be eaten up by <hi>Moths</hi>
and <hi>Rottenness,</hi> if they were not employ'd. And even
our Silver and Gold is exposed to <hi>Rust</hi> and <hi>Rapine,</hi> and
at best can serve us no further than this <hi>present</hi> Life.
Now this is but an insignificant <hi>moment</hi> of the great
duration of man, which is to all <hi>Eternity.</hi> And for this
reason that <hi>Virtue</hi> must be of wonderful <hi>Advantage</hi> to
us, that can render these <hi>immortal,</hi> and make them use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in another Life. And yet this is certainly done by
<hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>pity.</hi> He therefore is the <hi>wise</hi> Man, who does
<hi>not lay up for himself treasure upon earth, where rust and
moth doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and
steal, but lays up for himself treasure in heaven, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rust nor moth doth corrupt, and where thieves do not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:42084:14"/>
break through and steal.</hi> And he is the best <hi>friend</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
who is a kind friend and Benefactor to others,
who <hi>makes to himself friends of the mammon of unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
who, when it fails, will receive him into everlasting
habitations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. What we bestow in Charity is <hi>more improv'd, and
brings us in greater advantage,</hi> than all our <hi>policy</hi> and
<hi>success</hi> can produce by any other means. And this is the
Argument that generally works upon an <hi>avaricious</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per;
the Covetous Man does not love barely to have
his Gold <hi>kept,</hi> but to have it <hi>increase</hi> and multiply;
and will be willing to place it, where he may be sure
to <hi>receive his own again with usury.</hi> Now the encrease
<hi>here</hi> is too visible to want illustration: We give a small
<hi>Alms,</hi> and receive a <hi>Kingdom;</hi> a <hi>short</hi> repast, and have
a <hi>continual</hi> feast for it: We Administer some of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts</hi>
of this Life, and are paid with the <hi>Ioys</hi> of a future;
or we keep our Brother a <hi>little</hi> longer alive on Earth,
and for it we live for <hi>ever</hi> with our Father which is in
Heaven. Charity then does but sow for a wonderful
Crop, and in due time it must reap above a thousand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
if it faint not.</p>
            <p>And what other way have we to bestow our wealth
with such <hi>wisdom,</hi> in such <hi>security,</hi> and to such <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?</hi>
Would we lock it up, and do no body <hi>good;</hi> or
spend it in Luxury, and do our selves <hi>mischief</hi> by it?
Would we throw it away vainly and prodigally, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:42084:15"/>
be <hi>laught</hi> at; or make it an Instrument of Oppression,
and be <hi>hated?</hi> Would we render our Riches Baits to
raise the Desires of the <hi>strong,</hi> and provoke them to <hi>rob</hi>
us; or to move the Envy of the <hi>malicious,</hi> and tempt
them to <hi>destroy</hi> us? Or which is yet worse, would we
lay up our <hi>Rest</hi> in them, make them our <hi>dependance,</hi>
and place our Confidence in our Wealth; and so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
Almighty God, and call down his <hi>Vengeance</hi> to
dissipate our Fortunes, to plague our Bodies, and to
damn our Souls? All other ways do but make what
God <hi>design'd for our Comfort, to be to us an occasion of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
And who would not then take <hi>Charity</hi> for his
<hi>Director</hi> in distributing his Worldly Goods, to please his
<hi>God,</hi> to oblige his <hi>Saviour,</hi> to give his Brethren <hi>Support,</hi>
and himself <hi>Immortality?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. We come now to consider our third and last
Motive to Charity. <hi>The Distinction and peculiar degrees of
Glory which shall attend the Charitable Man in another Life.</hi>
This is indeed an Argument proper to work upon our
<hi>Ambition,</hi> and therefore may be thought to have no place
here, since we can hardly imagine that there is room
for Ambition in <hi>Heaven.</hi> The <hi>least</hi> Mansion in that
blessed State will sufficiently fill all our Desires, and
even surpass our Hopes; and to be a <hi>Door-keeper in the
House of our God,</hi> will be a more honourable and happy
Employment, than to <hi>govern</hi> in the Palaces of Princes.</p>
            <p>But yet God represents to us in Scripture, that there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:42084:15"/>
are <hi>degrees</hi> of Happiness in another Life; and God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
represents any thing in <hi>vain,</hi> but expects it should
have its <hi>influence</hi> upon us. If he reveals to us that there
are some Places in Heaven it self more <hi>desirable</hi> than
others, it is for this end, that we may more <hi>desire</hi> them,
and be more enflamed in our <hi>Affections,</hi> and more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
in our <hi>Pursuit</hi> of them: For there is the very same
reason for our more <hi>zealous</hi> prosecution of a <hi>greater</hi>
Good, as there is for our prosecuting of <hi>Good</hi> at all. So
that when greater degrees of Glory are proposed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
us to Charity, 'tis that we may particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in this Work, and promote it with more than
ordinary <hi>Zeal;</hi> 'tis that we may endeavour to excel
and be eminent in this Christian <hi>Duty</hi> here, as we would
excel and be eminent in the <hi>Triumphant Church</hi> of Christ
hereafter.</p>
            <p>We do not know wherein will consist the <hi>distinction</hi>
between Saints in Heaven, but whatever it is, it will
be something that is <hi>excellent</hi> and <hi>desirable,</hi> and an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession
to our Happiness; and we ought to believe it
is worth striving for; and 'tis <hi>commendable,</hi> and what
God expects from us, to <hi>aspire</hi> after it.</p>
            <p>If it consist in greater <hi>Perfection</hi> in our selves, a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
exaltation of our Nature, and improvement of our
Faculties; the common Principle of <hi>Self-love</hi> will carry
us to desire it; and besides, all Perfection bringing us
the nearer to God's Image, the <hi>Love of God</hi> too, which
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:42084:16"/>
we shall have in Heaven in the <hi>greatest</hi> degree, and
should have here in some <hi>proportion,</hi> should urge us to
covet it as far as <hi>possible,</hi> and to endeavour to be as
like him as we can.</p>
            <p>If it consist in being more <hi>esteemed</hi> by the <hi>Angels</hi> and
blessed Spirits, and more belov'd by the <hi>Saints,</hi> many
of whom the Charitable Man may have reliev'd in their
<hi>militant</hi> State; there is no good Man but would ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly
wish to approve himself to the <hi>Iudgment,</hi> and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
himself to the <hi>Affections</hi> of such glorious <hi>Beings</hi> as
far as possibly he could; especially, since they are to
be his <hi>Company</hi> to all Eternity; and the enjoyment of
their Society is one great part of his Happiness.</p>
            <p>Or if it consist in a greater share of the <hi>Love of God</hi>
and our <hi>Saviour,</hi> a nearer <hi>approach</hi> to them, or a
closer Insight into the glorious Excellencies of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Nature; we cannot desire too ardently to have all
possible Advantages for so delightful and ravishing a
<hi>Contemplation,</hi> to come as near as we can to our God, the
Fountain of all Perfection, to be as much as possible with
him, and as dear as possible to him. Sure there is nothing
more desireable than to <hi>follow the Lamb whither soever he
goeth,</hi> and to be <hi>the first Fruits unto God and to the Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There can be no question of this, that the greatest
degrees of Glory in Heaven are to be endeavour'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
with the greatest degrees of Affection and <hi>Earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi>
nor can it be doubted, but that our <hi>temporal</hi> Goods
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42084:16"/>
are most wisely dispensed in such acts of Pity and
Charity, as may give us an expectation of this <hi>exceeding
and eternal weight of Glory;</hi> all the difficulty is to find
out the <hi>reason</hi> of this Distinction; and to know upon
what <hi>grounds</hi> it is, that the Charitable Man is entitled
to this wonderful Advantage, and that an Alms on
Earth should find such acceptance in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Now though we ought always to be entirely satisfy'd
with the Justice and Reasonableness of God's Conduct,
and to conclude that it must be necessarily <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good,</hi>
though we cannot see distinctly the <hi>reasons</hi> of it; yet
because Man does not love an arbitrary Dealing, but
is desirous to have his Understanding go along with his
Will; and because it may perhaps be some further
Motive to <hi>quicken</hi> our <hi>Charity,</hi> I shall point out two or
three of those grounds, which we may probably guess
do give Occasion to this Procedure; and those I shall
but hint very briefly, and so conclude.</p>
            <p>1. Because the Charitable Man most resembles God,
in that Attribute which he professes himself most to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in, <hi>viz. his Mercy and Compassion.</hi> So that if there
be different degrees of <hi>Happiness</hi> in Heaven, and these
are to be attained by different degrees of <hi>Goodness</hi> on
Earth, and this Goodness be nothing else but the <hi>Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Divine Perfections; then it may reasonably
follow, that though the copying God's <hi>Iustice, Truth</hi> &amp;c.
may entitle us to a <hi>Reward,</hi> yet the copying of his <hi>Mercy</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:42084:17"/>
will entitle us to the <hi>noblest</hi> part of it; because this
mercy is what God is pleased himself to give the <hi>first</hi>
place to, and which he exalts above all the rest of his
Attributes.</p>
            <p>2. Because the Charitable Man gives the truest signs
both of the <hi>Love of God</hi> and of his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> which are
the two great springs of all our Duties. He shews he
loves <hi>God,</hi> because he will part with what men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
love best for his sake, and that is his <hi>worldly pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessions.</hi>
And he shews he loves his <hi>Neighbour,</hi> because
he cannot bear that he should be afflicted, but brings
him relief even without <hi>constraint.</hi> Now it seems but
fit and agreeable, that he that best approves his love to
<hi>God,</hi> should have distinguishing marks of God's love to
<hi>him;</hi> and that he that best loves Mankind, should
have the first place in the Happiness of Man.</p>
            <p>3. Because the Charitable Man is one who most truly
imitates our Saviour <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> all whose Life among
men was but one continued act of Charity to them. He
went about doing good, healing the Sick, restoring sight
to the blind, ears to the deaf, feet to the lame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
nay 'tis very observable, that those very <hi>miracles</hi> which
he did for the Confirmation of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which
was directed to the good of the <hi>Souls</hi> of men, were
generally such things as brought relief to their <hi>Bodies.</hi>
Now if God has highly exalted the Man Christ Jesus,
and <hi>given him a name above every name,</hi> and if our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42084:17"/>
our Saviour to <hi>Heaven,</hi> depends upon our tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in his steps <hi>here,</hi> the Charitable Man is prepared to
be the nearest him in his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> who most resembles
him in his <hi>Conduct.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. <hi>Lastly,</hi> Because the Charitable Man is most like
to be stored with all <hi>other</hi> Virtues and Graces that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn
a Christian; a generous <hi>contempt</hi> of this World, an
unshaken <hi>Faith</hi> in the Promises of God, a <hi>relyance</hi> on his
Providence, <hi>trust</hi> in his Protection, and <hi>obedience</hi> to his
Authority; so that the command of <hi>being merciful as
our heavenly father is merciful,</hi> very well Answers to the
other, <hi>be perfect as your father which is in heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi>
And then, if Charity do thus draw after it all the
rest of those Ornaments, which distinguish good Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
in a <hi>mortal</hi> state, 'tis no wonder if it appears in the
front of them in an <hi>immortal</hi> one, and that the Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men do <hi>shine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of their
Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavour'd to represent to you, as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as my short time would permit; the <hi>three</hi> moving
Arguments to <hi>Charity</hi> and Compassion, contained in my
<hi>Text.</hi> And what now remains, but earnestly to exhort all
that hear me, that they would duly and frequently <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect</hi>
on these things; that they may be convinced, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and persuaded by them? If God does give us such
encouragements as these, he does expect that they should
not be given in vain; but that we should carefully <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:42084:18"/>
to them, and be <hi>regulated</hi> by them, otherwise they
will be but an Article to encrease our <hi>condemnation;</hi> and
the <hi>three</hi> Sermons that this place yearly furnishes, will
be a triple <hi>Testimony</hi> that will rise up in <hi>Iudgment</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they do not soften our hearts, and melt
us into <hi>Compassion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But God be thanked, it may be truly said to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of his great <hi>Name,</hi> and to the Reputation of this
great <hi>City,</hi> that there is a plentiful spring of Charity
flowing among us, and abundance of good men are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to give, if they did but know how to give wisely
and <hi>discreetly;</hi> but shoals of vicious and idle <hi>Beggars</hi>
fill our Streets, and call louder for the <hi>Correction</hi> of the
Magistrate, than the <hi>Compassion</hi> of the people, and even
the Charitable are afraid (and they have reason for it)
that they shall Encourage <hi>Vice</hi> while they relieve the
<hi>importunate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Assembly</hi> furnishes such good men with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suspected</hi>
Objects for the most <hi>abundant</hi> Charity, and
with the most rational methods of <hi>dispensing</hi> it. The <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi>
and <hi>prudence</hi> of the <hi>Managers</hi> of the several <hi>Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi>
here before you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of which so much <hi>experience</hi>
has been had, give a sufficient <hi>security,</hi> that what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed
here, will be certainly laid out, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
<hi>discretion,</hi> and to the greatest <hi>Advantage;</hi> and the
<hi>variety</hi> of poor Creatures under their several care,
gives us opportunity of gratifying the most different
<hi>humours</hi> and <hi>inclinations.</hi>

<hi>Orphans;</hi> would we preserve their <hi>Lives,</hi> and make those
Lives <hi>comfortable;</hi> would we bring them up in the Fear of
<hi>God,</hi> and render them useful to the <hi>World,</hi> here is a Place, and
Methods, and Objects; and nothing wanting but our <hi>Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do we pity the <hi>wounded,</hi> the <hi>sick,</hi> and the <hi>maimed,</hi> and
would we administer <hi>Balm</hi> to their Comfort; here we may
at present enliven their <hi>Hearts,</hi> by the <hi>sight</hi> of our Bounty;
and in God's due time restore their <hi>Limbs</hi> or their <hi>Health</hi> by
the <hi>application</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>Have we an hospitable Care of the <hi>Stranger,</hi> and of those
whom <hi>Necessity</hi> or <hi>Misfortune</hi> hath remov'd from their Friends
and Relations; here we may act the part of <hi>Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
our selves; relieve their Wants, and conduct them <hi>home;</hi>
and may at the same time exercise, though a <hi>harsher,</hi> yet as
necessary and <hi>wholesome</hi> a piece of Charity, in contributing to
the Correction and Confinement of the <hi>loose</hi> and <hi>vagrant,</hi> whose
Example would be <hi>contagious,</hi> and their Impunity a <hi>snare</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Men.</p>
            <p>Are we truly sensible of the pityable Condition of those poor
<hi>distracted</hi> Persons, who have not sense enough to pity them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
our Charity may here give them, I do not say <hi>Meat</hi>
and <hi>Drink,</hi> but by the Blessing of Heaven, even <hi>Sense</hi> and <hi>sound
Iudgment</hi> too; and we may raise up, from a kind of <hi>Death,</hi> our
lost Brethren to a <hi>rational</hi> Life, who will be sure to sing the
Praises of <hi>God,</hi> and of their <hi>Benefactors</hi> too, with their reviv'd
Understandings.</p>
            <p>Or have we in the last place a just Indignation at that <hi>Sloth</hi>
and <hi>Beggary,</hi> into which Naughtiness and want of Discipline
leads our poor Families; would we bring them to a sense of
their <hi>Duty,</hi> and a love of honest <hi>Industry;</hi> would we prevent
their being <hi>Vagabonds,</hi> or <hi>Thieves,</hi> or any thing that is worse,
and make them <hi>useful</hi> Members of the Publick; here are the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42084:19"/>
Instruments ready, and they want but our <hi>Assistance</hi> to perfect
so glorious an Undertaking. And we have great reason not
only to be <hi>exemplary</hi> in this sort of Charity, but to be diligent
in <hi>persuading</hi> others to it, and earnest in our Prayers to God,
that he would propagate the Example of this <hi>City</hi> through the
Nation, and that he would open the <hi>Eyes</hi> of the whole <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi>
and move their <hi>Hearts,</hi> to joyn both Hands and Purses to
this <hi>Reformation</hi> of the Poor; since it is the truest Compassion
to their <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies,</hi> and I may say, to the <hi>Publick</hi> it self,
which groans under the Evil of their <hi>disorderly</hi> Lives, and will
be never well reform'd, without such a <hi>Remedy:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very <hi>Circumstances</hi> of all these plead for them more than
any Arguments of <hi>human</hi> Eloquence, but not so much as the
<hi>divine</hi> Rhetorick of the <hi>Text;</hi> we owe them <hi>Love,</hi> as they are
<hi>Men;</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> as they are <hi>miserable;</hi> but we owe them the
most grateful and tender <hi>Returns,</hi> as they are <hi>Members of our
Saviour.</hi> 'Tis <hi>him</hi> we comfort, 'tis the blessed <hi>Iesus</hi> himself we
relieve, in these distressed Objects: For so we must believe,
since he tells us himself, <hi>Verily I say unto you, in as much as ye have
done it to one of the least of these my Brethren, you have done it unto
me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, when all is done, the greatest Comfort is to <hi>our own
Souls,</hi> and our Alms return into our own Bosom. What we <hi>sow
in corruption, is raised in incorruption.</hi> and while we give to the
poor and miserable on <hi>Earth,</hi> we do but purchase a glorious
Inheritance in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Let us therefore go on vigorously in
this Duty, and <hi>abound</hi> plenteously in this <hi>work of the Lord,</hi> and
<hi>persevere</hi> in it; as knowing that <hi>our Labour shall not be in vain in
the Lord;</hi> and if ever <hi>Coldness</hi> or <hi>Selfishness</hi> should obstruct our
Progress, let us but bring before our Eyes the Sentence in the
Text; he will hardly be <hi>backward</hi> who reads this Invitation,
<hi>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you
from the Foundation of the World. To which may God of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
Mercy bring us all.</hi> Amen.</p>
