            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

tended to the Kings Death. And at <hi>Rome</hi> I asked Father <hi>Anderton,</hi> and Father <hi>Lodge,</hi> two Jesuits, What would the Duke do with his Brother when he was King? And they answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, They would find a means for that: they would give him no trouble about it. Then I told them, I believed the Duke loved his Brother so well, he would suffer no Violence to be done to Him. They said, No: If the Duke could be brought to that, as he had bin Religiously to every thing else, they might do their work: their other busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was ready; and they might do it presently. But they knew they could not bring him to that Point: but they would take care for that themselves. They had not begun with him, to leave him in such scruples as that. But they would set him into his Throne; and there he should Reign blindfold three or four days: for they had settled some they should pitch the Action upon, should clear their Party. And then he should flie upon them with the Sword of Revenge.</p>

            <head>THE NARRATIVE OF Sir <hi>FRANCIS NORTH</hi> Lord Chief Justice OF THE COMMON-PLEAS, At the <hi>COVNCIL BOARD.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T my first coming to Mr. <hi>Rumseys</hi> house, where I was to Lodge at <hi>Bristol,</hi> upon <hi>Munday</hi> the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>August</hi> in the Afternoon, being the First day of the Assises, Sir <hi>John Knight</hi> came to me, and said, That Mr. <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> lay dangerously ill of a Feaver, and had little hopes of Life; and desired that I would give him a Visit, that he might Impart something of great Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to me before his Death. I told
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:55667:4"/>
him I would give him a Visit that night after Supper, about Nine a Clock, if I might be satisfied of two things: First, That there was no Infection in his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper: Secondly, That the time would not be inconvenient, but he might Discourse to me without prejudice to his Condition. After a little while, two Physicians came to me, and assured me, that there was no danger of Infection, and that the time I had appointed would be most proper; for commonly he took his repose in the Afternoon, and at Nine a Clock he would in all probability be refreshed, and fit to Discourse with me. Thereupon I declared my Resolution of going, and desired the Company of the Two Sheriffs, and my brother <hi>Roger North,</hi> and appointed my Marshal <hi>William Janes</hi> to go with me. As we were upon the way, Mr. <hi>Crossman,</hi> a Minister in that City, told me Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> had desired him to come with me to him: I said, It was very well, and I should be glad of his Company. Whereupon we went all together; and being come into the Room where Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> lay, I saluted him, and said, I was extreme sorry to find him so ill. I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:55667:5"/>
came to Visit him upon his own desires. I did imagine he had something to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to me as a Privy-Councellor; and therefore if he thought fit, the Company might withdraw. He told me, That needed not yet, for he had much to say, which was proper for the Company to hear: And having saluted the Sheriffs, and Mr. <hi>Crossman,</hi> he discoursed to this purpose.</p>
            <p>That he looked upon himself as a dying man, and found within himself that he could not last long, but must shortly appear before the Lord of Hosts, to give an account of all his Actions. And because many Persons had made it their business to baffle and deride the Plot, he did, for the satisfaction of the World, there declare upon the Faith of a dying Man, and as he hoped for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, That whatever he had Testified concerning the Plot, was True. And that he had wronged no Man by his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony, but had Testified rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than over what was Truth. That he had nothing lay upon his Conscience upon that Account. That he should appear cheerfully before the Lord of Hosts: which he did verily believe he
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:55667:5"/>
must do in a short time. He said, He had many Witnesses to produce, who would make the Plot as clear as the Sun: and he had other things to Discover, which were of great Importance to the King, and the Countrey. Hereupon he making some pause, I told him, The Plot was so evidently made out, that no reasonable man, no Protestant, I was sure, could doubt of the Truth of it: But he ought not to have Concealed any thing that concerned the King so highly. He ought to Discover his whole know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in matters of Treason, that Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors may be Apprehended and Secured; who otherwise may have opportunity to Execute their Treasonable Designs. To this he replied, That much of that which he had not Discovered was to Corroborate his former Testimony: That he had Concealed nothing that was absolutely necessary to the Kings Preservation. That he thought it not fit to Accuse more Persons, till he had ended with those whom he had already Accused. He expressed great grief and trouble at the Condition of his poor King and Countrey (so he termed them) whom he knew at that time to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:55667:6"/>
be in Eminent danger from the Jesuits, who had Resolved the Kings Death: and he was sure they would spare him no longer then he continued to be kind to them. He said, He was privy to their Consultations at <hi>Salamanca</hi> and <hi>Valla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolid,</hi> where they used to observe the favourable Conjuncture they had to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce their Religion into <hi>England:</hi> which consisted in their having a Head, who must be set up whatever came of it: and, If they let slip that opportunity, they should never have such another: For without a Head they could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He said further, He knew the Wickedness and Resolution of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suits: they stuck at nothing to compass their own ends. They had attempted to Poison him, but he had escaped.</p>
            <p>When he had finished this Discourse, (which lasted about a quarter of an hour) I asked him, If the Company should now withdraw? And he said, Yes: and Ordered his Nurses to go out, and only his Wife to stay to tend him. And thereupon all went out, saving Mrs. <hi>Bedlow,</hi> my self, and my servant <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Janes.</hi> Then I told him, I thought it convenient that what he should then
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:55667:6"/>
say unto me; should be upon Oath. He replied, That it was necessary it should be so: and called for a Bible. But my Servant having brought a Book with him, Administred the Oath to him; and laying his Paper upon a Chair by the Bedside, writ down his Deposition as he delivered it.</p>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> had concluded, and said, That was all he had to Inform me of, I took the Paper, and Read it over distinctly to him, and he approved it, and Signed it, laying the Paper up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Pillow.</p>
            <p>I thought it not fit, considering his Condition, to perplex him with Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, but took his Information as he offered it, and held no Discourse with him when the Company was withdrawn, but concerning the true setting down his Depositions: and when he seemed to be weary, to mind him of taking Cordials, which his Wife reached to him as he desired them.</p>
            <p>The next day Mr <hi>Bedlows</hi> Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to me, and told me that his Brother desired a Copy of the Depositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he made before me. But I told him, I had well considered it, and could not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:55667:7"/>
give him a Copy without the Kings leave. But I would move the King in it: and if He gave leave, I would take care to send one to him. And Mr <hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows</hi> Brother then told me, That it was his Brothers desire that I should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present to His Majesty his Condition; and that his Sickness was very Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: and move His Majesty on his behalf for some Supply of money for his Subsistence; which I promised to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This is all that I can recollect of what passed upon this Occasion, and is in Substance true: but the very Words, or the Order, I cannot positively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</hi>
