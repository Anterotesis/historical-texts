            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>TIS now about 14 years
ſince I laboured under an
extraordinary pain in
both my knees and feet,
not knowing whither to
turn my ſelf for pain, having uſed in
vain all thoſe means by which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
had found ſome eaſe. After I had
paſſed five or ſix weeks in thoſe exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
pains, which ſometimes, in ſpight of
my teeth, extorted tears from my eyes,
and conſumed my fleſh as well as my
ſtrength, keeping me in a manner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
ſleepleſs; I was perſwaded to
ſuffer an <hi>Indian</hi> Doctreſs to come to
me, which was of <hi>Quinam,</hi> (whom my
Wife commonly employed for the curing
of our ſlaves, and who alſo had been
very ſuccesful in recovering my only
<pb facs="tcp:50778:4"/>
daughter from a certain difficulty of
breathing ſhe had been troubled with
for two years together). This <hi>Indian</hi>
woman being demanded, whether ſhe
knew how to cure that painful diſeaſe
which I was moleſted with; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
ſhe did. But to tell you the
truth, it was done by a way of Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
Which means being by me reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out of an apprehenſion I had of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> pain that muſt needs accompany
ſuch a remedy; ſhe ſaid, that then ſhe
would prepare ſomething to <hi>mitigate</hi>
the pains I ſuffered, and bring me ſuch
a medicine in the afternoon; repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill, that if I would endure the
Cauſtick or Burning remedy, the pain
ſhould ever after ſtay away: But, for
all that, I could not then reſolve upon
it.</p>
            <p>The woman being gone, upon further
conſideration, I began to repent that I
had refuſed the uſe of her Cauſtick;
and thought with my ſelf, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
this propoſed remedy ſhould ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
I could feel but one pain at a
time, either that of the Gout, or that
<pb facs="tcp:50778:4"/>
of the Cauſtick; longing to ſee my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctreſs
again; who being returned, and
asked, whether ſhe had ready her mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
for the Cauſtick, anſwered ſmiling,
ſhe had: At the ſame time drawing
it forth out of her pocket, and deſiring
me that I would ſuffer her to try her
art and skill upon me; which having
at laſt agreed unto, ſhe went preſently
to work; having demanded a lighted
candle, and ſolicitouſly ſearch'd for
that part of the place affected where
the greateſt pain was: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſhe burned with her <hi>Moxa</hi> (of
which hereafter) on my feet and knees,
(to my beſt remembrance) about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
little Eſcars, which looked like lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
gray ſpecks, without raiſing any
bliſters, or cauſing any after-pain;
whereupon alſo all the pain of the Gout
vaniſh'd. All this operation was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
within leſs than half an hour,
without any bodies hearing me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
of pain. And I herewith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare,
that even whilſt the burning
laſted, I found my ſelf much inclined
to ſleep; and that in ſuch a manner,
<pb facs="tcp:50778:5"/>
that after the operation was over, I
was ſo overcome by ſleep, that I ſlept
very quietly near 24 hours together,
without ever waking; whereas afore,
by reaſon of the cruel pains. I had not
been able to ſleep at all for ſeveral
days and nights together. Being awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened,
I found, 'tis true, my feet and
knees yet much ſwelled; but in a few
days after I was alſo freed from thoſe
tumifying humours, by the little open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
made by the ſame Cauſtick, ſo that
I was able to return to the work of
my vocation; moſt heartily thanking
God Almighty for his goodneſs to me,
and duly acknowledging the operation
of this <hi>Indian</hi> woman, admiring withal
the powerfulneſs of this remedy againſt
ſo contumacious an evil, as is the
Gout. There near paſſed full 27 months
e're I heard any thing of a Gouty pain,
and I began to be full of hope it would
for ever have forgot and quitted me,
according to the promiſe of my Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctreſs;
which not long after, to my great
ſorrow, died. True it is, that after
the time named, I had once, or at moſt
<pb facs="tcp:50778:5"/>
twice in one year ſome grudgings of
that diſeaſe; but never any ſore fit:
Only about four years ago, when I
fell into a very hot Fever of nine days
continuance, without hope of life, that
Fever changed, and ended in the Gout;
all the pains of which, in a very ſhort
time, I freed my ſelf from, by means of
the ſaid Cauſtick; ſo that I proteſt can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly,
that being now in a Fever again,
I long as much and more for a fit of the
Gout, as I formerly was wont to dread
it; knowing it to be an argument of
the ſtrength of the heart, when a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
determines in the Gout: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon
which ſcore the famous <hi>Crato,</hi> Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
to three Emperors, and the
learned <hi>Sennertus,</hi> were wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
Gouty men, by telling them that
this evil tended to health.</p>
            <p>Now, from the day that I was ſo
ſoon and with ſo ſlight pains cured of
the Gout, I have given my thoughts
liberty to expatiate upon the nature of
the Gout: And firſt of all, to call in
queſtion, whether Phyſitians hitherto
have had a right notion, and given a
<pb facs="tcp:50778:6"/>
true account of the nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of this diſeaſe: And after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous
enquiry into the matter, and
upon the conſideration of this ſovereign
remedy, I concluded, that this diſeaſe
muſt needs have another immediate or
proximate cauſe, ſeat, &amp;c. than had
been hitherto by any man clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
and proved.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I thought good to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the world my thoughts of this
whole matter, although at firſt I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to have kept them only for my
beſt friends and neareſt relations. I
think, I have herein detected ſome
things for the improvement of Phyſick,
and for the relief of thoſe that are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to this diſeaſe, which elſe is by
moſt men exclaimed againſt as incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable;
and does ſo disfigure many a
comely perſon, that he ſeems not to be
the ſame he was before. In the doing
whereof, my deſign is to do good to
my fellow-creatures, and to lay out
this talent for their eaſe and comfort;
as alſo to open a way for intelligent
and ſtudious men to ſearch into, and
<pb facs="tcp:50778:6"/>
find out the nature not only of the Gout,
but alſo of divers other diſeaſes that
have any affinity therewith; ſuch as
are <hi>Head-pains, Tooth-ach, Pleuriſies,
Colick,</hi> and even the <hi>Falling-ſickneſs</hi>
it ſelf. As I ſhall be able, in time,
if God vouchſafe me life, more clearly
to make out; eſpecially, if the truth here
delivered be embraced, and this ſmall
work encouraged, and the remedy here
recommended put in practice; which
I heartily wiſh may be done according
to my preſcript, before it be prejudged,
and rejected.</p>

                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Do you underſtand by the
name of <hi>Gout,</hi> all pain in the Limbs?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> No; but that pain which in
ſharpneſs and fierceneſs exceeds all
other, and that which I mean to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> To let paſs the name of the
<hi>Gout,</hi> pray give me a full and plain
deſcription of the Diſeaſe it ſelf?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The <hi>Gout</hi> is a preternatural,
inward, deep-lurking, and for the
moſt part inviſible little ſwelling
within in the <hi>perioſtium,</hi> that is,
the membrane that enwraps all
Bones; cauſed from a dry and cold
ill-natured damp or vapor, which out
of the arteries, by the expelling vertue
of the heart, is driven out into the
place that is between the bone and the
<hi>perioſtium,</hi> for the moſt part into ſuch
Limbs of the Body as are about the
Joints; in which this vapor being and
remaining impacted and incloſed, and
diſtending that moſt ſenſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane,
produces thoſe violent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50778:11"/>
pains, whereby the motion
of thoſe Limbs is incumbred and
diſpoiled, and many other grievous
accidents occaſioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth this deſcription differ
much from that which hath been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
delivered of this Diſeaſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> It doth: Whence it is, that
I exceedingly apprehend, I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur
ſharp cenſures from many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But let this paſs; let us weigh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
your deſcription in its principal
parts. And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> I do remember, that
you make the Gout to be a <hi>preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi>
ſwelling; whereby you doubtleſs
imply, that the Gout is a Diſeaſe
wherein violence is done to nature
in ſome part or other of the Body.
But this is a novelty to me, that you
add, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is an <hi>inward deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurking,</hi>
and <hi>for the moſt part inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
little ſwelling,</hi> and that that ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
is cauſed by a <hi>damp, &amp;c.</hi> intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
you, that you would vouchſafe
to expreſs this more plain, and to
render reaſons thereof. And firſt,
why you call it an <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurking</hi>
tumor?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:50778:11"/>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The better to diſtinguiſh it
from other windy ſwellings, in reſpect
of its ſeat: For, whereas <hi>thoſe</hi> other
lye between the fleſh and skin, <hi>this</hi> lies
deep, underneath the membrane that
covers the bone; as hereafter ſhall be
more largely proved.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But why do you add, that it
is a <hi>little</hi> and <hi>moſtly inviſible</hi> ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Becauſe it is ſo indeed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But pray, Sir, take care that
you run not againſt ſenſe, out of a
blind zeal of producing a novelty.
For, is not the tumor which manifeſts
it ſelf in the Gout, big and conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
enough?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> You do not diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Diſeaſe it ſelf and the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom,
which is the ſtumbling ſtone of
many even learn'd men. And the
want of this very diſtinction ſeems
to me to have been the main, if not
the only obſtacle, why they have not
lighted upon the true cauſe of the
Gout, and why they have taken <hi>quid
pro quo?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50778:12"/>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What then is to be done, not
to miſtake herein?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> You muſt ever make a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between the ſwelling, which is
cauſed by the morbific gouty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that which is conſequent
to the Gout; and this is to be laid as
a fundamental Truth, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd,
<hi>viz.</hi> That the humour, which
makes the external palpable and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſwelling in the Gout, is not the
Gout or dolorifique matter. Which
are not ſo much my words, as the
words of that famous Phyſitian of
<hi>Dort,</hi> called <hi>John Van Beverwyck,</hi>
deliver'd by him in his Book of the
Gout, and which he hath borrow'd
out of the deſcription of that diſeaſe,
which that learned and experienced
Profeſſor of Phyſick at <hi>Wittenberg,
Daniel Sennertus,</hi> left behind him.
Which alſo is the reaſon that I ſhall
place that aqueous and ſerous tumor
amongſt the ſymptoms of the Gout;
where alſo it is to be handled, and
not here, where we ſpeak of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:50778:12"/>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What, is not the humor, that
cauſes the outward and viſible ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
the Gout or dolorific matter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No, they differ very much from
one another, and may be ſufficiently
diſtinguiſht by thoſe that will atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively
conſider.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Wherein conſiſts this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> In this, that the one is the
<hi>cauſe</hi> of the Diſeaſe, the other a <hi>ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom;</hi>
which will be made very clear,
when we ſhall come to treat of this
ſymptom. But in part to ſatisfie your
curioſity, pray mark the ratiocination
of the lately named <hi>Beverwyck,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the quoted Book: <hi>That the
humour which makes the ſwelling, is
not properly the peccant matter, is
from hence evident; becauſe that in
the beginning, before the part ſwells,
the greateſt pain is felt, and the ſame
grows leſs, when the ſwelling appears.</hi>
'Tis true, that that learned man ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hereth
ſtill to the opinion of the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
<hi>Serum,</hi> affirming that it is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
humor, pervaded by a ſalin acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50778:13"/>
that cauſes the Gout. But
herein he, as well as the great <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nertus,</hi>
hath miſtaken. Mean time,
tis certain, that the external tumor
is not the morbid matter it ſelf, for
the reaſon given; and, which is more,
ſome podagrical perſons endure great
pain, without the appearance of any
viſible ſwelling.</p>

with the proof alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
until we come to the <hi>ſymptoms:</hi>
But, when this ſymptomatical or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
ſwelling of the Gout is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
do you then obſerve two ſorts
of ſwelling in this Diſeaſe, one <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi>
the other <hi>outward?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> I do ſo; of which two, the
firſt is that which I ſay in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be a ſwelling that is <hi>little,</hi> and
<hi>for the moſt part inviſible?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:50778:13"/>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Why do you ſay ſo?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Becauſe it is indeed ſmall, and
for the moſt part cannot be ſeen by
the ſharpeſt eye of the body, though
it be ſeen by the eye of reaſon. For,
although you outwardly perceive no
ſwelling, you may not thence infer,
that there lurks none within, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as the contrary is true in theſe
and other ſwellings. See the proof
hereof in a couple of obſervations of
the skilful Phyſitian and Chirurgian
<hi>Hildanus</hi> in his ſecond Part, the <hi>37<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi>
and <hi>38<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</hi> concerning dangerous and
deſperate tumors in the muſcles of
the ſtomach, in which nothing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
of ſwelling, or other diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
could be ſeen outwardly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> If this tumor cannot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the eye, whence do you
then know that there is an inward
one?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> From the violent, pungent,
beating, diſtending, and continual
pain, to be eaſily perceived by ones
finger.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But, it ſeems, by what you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50778:14"/>
in the deſcription of the Gout,
that ſometimes this tumor may be
ſeen?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Yes, it may; for at times it
appears plainly enough, though few
Artiſts take it for a gouty ſwelling,
miſled by the external appearance of
it, which is in the form of a ſmall
hard pimple on the place of the part
affected; of which you have a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
proof in <hi>Pareus,</hi> the French
Chirurgian, treating of a diſtemper
in a young woman at <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> that
had ſuch a tumor on her thigh;
though <hi>Pareus</hi> doth not record it for
ſuch.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> When may this tumor be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
by the eye?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Then chiefly, when the gouty
cauſe attacks the Patient, not about
the joints of the limbs, but in or about
the middle of thoſe places, with a
boyling pain, wherein nature labours
as much as ſhe can (though ſhe be not
ſtrong enough) to expel the peccant
matter. At which time, if you ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it carefully, ſome tumor appears,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:50778:14"/>
as was ſaid above. This I have found
not only in my ſelf, but very notably
in another, that was a young man,
employed here in the Foundery of
<hi>Batavia,</hi> called <hi>Martyn Smith</hi> of

unto you the various opinions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning

was that which placeth it in meer
winds, Now, among thoſe Doctors,
<hi>Sennertus</hi> reckons <hi>Guainerius</hi> and
<hi>Matthaeus de Gradibus,</hi> two eminent
Phyſitians; and, as far as I can find,
the <hi>Chineſe</hi> Doctors are all of that
mind. Beſides, that ancient Phyſitian,
<hi>Guido de Culiaca</hi> (though in the Gout
he follows the <hi>Humoriſts)</hi> relates, that
he had read in ſome preſcriptions of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50778:16"/>
health given to the Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that this diſeaſe did ariſe from <hi>winds;</hi>
and the Royal Chirurgian <hi>Pareus,
p.</hi> 534. aſſigns, for the certain cauſe
of the running Gout, <hi>a very thin
fuliginous matter,</hi> which is nothing
elſe but a ſubtile ſmoaky damp, or
ſpirituous ſubſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But <hi>Pareus</hi> doth not ſpeak

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> 'Tis true, that he affirms it
of the <hi>running Gout;</hi> but then I muſt
ſay, that that kind doth not at all
in its eſſence, or next cauſe, differ
from the other Gout, but only in ſome
qualities, relating to the thinneſs and
thickneſs of damps; thoſe, from
whence proceeds the running Gout,
thinner and ſubtler; and thoſe which
cauſe the other Gout, courſer and
thicker. And 'tis notorious, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all intelligent Phyſitians aſſign
<hi>damps</hi> for the next cauſe of Tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aches,
Head-aches, Pleuriſies (at leaſt
baſtard Pleuriſies), Colicks, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies:
Diſeaſes which in name in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
place, and ſome ſymptoms, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50778:17"/>
from the Gout, but not in their
true eſſence; they being ſo near a-kin
to one another, that they acknowledg
but one and ſame cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> 'Tis true, that ſome learned
men have affirmed, winds or damps
to be the next cauſe of the Gout; but
others have rejected that opinion,
and for their ground of doing ſo, I
ſhall produce but one argument for
all, which <hi>M. Beverwyck</hi> alledgeth
out of <hi>Sennertus</hi> in his Treatiſe of
the Gout, ſaying, <hi>All ſickneſſes which
ariſe from winds, do not laſt ſo long
as the Gout;</hi> and making uſe of this
reaſon for his denying the <hi>flatus</hi> or
winds to be the true Cauſe of the
Gout. And further in his <hi>Medicina,
p.</hi> 62. treating of Tumors in general,
he declares, <hi>That the windy ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
do vaniſh eaſieſt of all.</hi> What
you can ſay to this objection, I long
to hear.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thoſe great men ſpeak here
only in <hi>general</hi> of windy tumors;
and what they ſay is only true of ſuch
windy ſwellings as lurk under the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50778:17"/>
skin, or in fleſhy parts; not in thoſe
that lie in deep parts, and under firm
and thick membranes, as in the Gout,
and other hidden or manifeſt ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
raiſed from latent winds: See
the proof hereof in <hi>Hildanus, p.</hi> 6.
<hi>obſ.</hi> 40. in a <hi>Tympanites</hi> that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory
to all remedies.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What then is the true cauſe
why the Gout is ſo long a curing? Is
the gouty cauſe (the damp) ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to be with ſpeed removed and
evaporated?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> The gouty damp is eaſy
enough to be evacuated, and 'tis even
forward to be exhaled; but there is
a notable obſtacle which hinders the
ſpeedy performance of it. And that
is this; The impacted and incloſed
damp, which cauſeth the windy tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
in the Gout, ſeeks a paſſage to
iſſue out at, but finds none; partly
becauſe of the groſneſs of the damp;
partly and chiefly by reaſon of the
cloſe and firm membrane of the bone,
under which it lurks; eſpecially ſince
the place, in which this cold damp
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50778:18"/>
lodgeth, enjoys but little warmth, for
the attenuating of this groſs damp,
and expelling it through the ſmall
pores of that membrane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But, I pray, Sir, let me know
what is the chief motive that hath
induced you to make Damps the only
<hi>next</hi> cauſe of the Gout?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ. Firſt,</hi> This remedy which I
here offer, as that which ſuddenly
cures this diſeaſe: For, if it be true,
that the <hi>Medicine declares the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe,</hi>
as Phyſitians afirm with their
Maſter <hi>Hippocrates;</hi> I muſt then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that no humors, but only a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous
thing, is the cauſe of this
Diſeaſe. <hi>Secondly,</hi> obſerving the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
motion of the gouty matter,
ſometimes diſlodging in a very ſhort
time from one limb to another, from
the hand to the foot, from one foot
to the other, &amp;c. flying as 'twere with
ſwift wings from above to beneath,
and back again; I find my ſelf obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to judg, that theſe are not Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
but ſome Spirituous matter able
to do ſuch things.</p>

which for quality is always cold; ſo

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But with what reaſons can

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Irrefragably by the remedy
it ſelf; as alſo by the pruriency and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50778:19"/>
ſhivering which gouty perſons, upon
the motion of this cold damp, do
commonly feel, eſpecially in thoſe
parts through which it takes its
courſe; as alſo happens in <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſies,
Pleuriſies, Colick,</hi> and the like,
that come from cold damps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But ſoft and fair: Your laſt
proof taken from <hi>ſhivering</hi> doth not
hold, as <hi>Beverwyck</hi> objects; for then
ſhould the matter of hot Fevers be
alſo cold, which paſſing through parts
endowed with the ſenſe of feeling,
not only cauſe ſhivering, but alſo
claſhing of teeth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is not ſaid from well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded
knowledg; ſince it hath
never yet (that I know) been ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorily
proved, that <hi>Hot Fevers</hi> (as
they are called) muſt needs procced
from an hot cauſe; and upon a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough

be found, that they have been produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

which I think at leaſt to be half pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe ſometimes an hot Fever
ends in the Gout; as I have found;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:50778:19"/>
not to go far, in my ſelf, when I was
in the 50 <hi>th.</hi> year of my age. It ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
alſo comes to paſs, that the
Gout determines in an hot Fever; as
appears from what <hi>Beverwyck</hi> ſaith
in his Book of the Gout, <hi>p.</hi> 110. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the ways through which the
gouty matter takes its courſe. <hi>The
damp,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>turns back into the
veins, and aſcends up again to the
noble part</hi> (meaning the heart,) <hi>where
it raiſes hot Fevers, Anguiſh, and the
like evils; or ſhoots ſuddenly into
ſome other limb, whereby the pain that
is in the hand, is ſoon after felt in the

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But is not that notable inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
which is often ſeen and felt
in the Gout, ſufficient proof that
there is a ſort of Gout which comes
from heat?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is a Symptom or accident
in the Gout, which is not cauſed by
the next and always accompanying
cauſe of it, but by the violent pain;
as I ſhall more clearly make out, when
I come to ſpeak of this Symptom;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:50778:20"/>
But 'tis a Symptom, (not to paſs that
by in this place) which hath ſtrangely
miſled thoſe who have miſtaken it for
a mark of the Gout, as <hi>Sennertus</hi> and
others do ackuowledg.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Is this damp alſo ill-condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
and malignant?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> So 'tis judged by conſiderable
and experienced men, as well as by
my ſelf, and that from the intolerable
pain and other accidents. So doth that
old Maſter <hi>Guido de Culiaco;</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reus
in his 7th.</hi> Book, <hi>ch.</hi> 2. proves it
by two Examples; and our new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
confirms the ſame. Beſides,
the foetid damps of the Gout do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſpeak this malignity, which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
both at the time of the act of
burning, and after it; that being ſuch,
that ſometimes both the Patient, and
the Perſon that adminiſters the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick,
and dreſſes the part, are ready
to fall away. And this is moſt of all
found at the dreſſing of the little
wounds, when they begin to omit
good ſtore of moiſture. For as ſoon
as you ſhall in a morning open the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:50778:20"/>
little Plaiſters, you will be ſo ſtruck
with a ſtrange ſtinking ſmell, that it
will almoſt caſt you into a ſwound.
'Tis very probable, that this ſtuff is
already malign before it be caſt out
from the heart into the limbs; yet
remaining for a while wedged in the
limbs, from the evaporation obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
its malignity is heightned. Hence
it is not adviſable, to ſerve this burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or dreſſing upon any one that is
faſting; but 'tis beſt, that both the
Patient and the Agent ſhould firſt
breakfaſt, and take a cordial.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But, is it poſſible for Winds
to occaſion ſo much miſchief?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Very poſſible; and then eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,
when they are more peccant
by their quality than quantity: So
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his golden Tract of
<hi>Flatus's</hi> doth not without cauſe judg
of winds, that moſt of all the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous

their original to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But can Winds breed ſuch vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> They can; chiefly when the

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Thus, that never a gouty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Not at all; for their proof is
lame in all its parts. And, not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the irrefragable proof of <hi>Galen</hi>
againſt their opinion, the pain doth
<hi>not</hi> increaſe when the limb is but
touch'd and moved, becauſe, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth!
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:50778:23"/>
the gouty matter hath ouzed
through the ligaments and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes:
No; for, not theſe, but the
<hi>perioſtium</hi> is the part affected in this
evil, which being by the gouty damp
already diſtended, is upon the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or leaſt motion of the limb, irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
a new, and ſo cauſeth new pain.
Where I eſtabliſh this for a certain
truth, that never the gouty matter,
but only the accidental affluxed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
ouzeth through the ligaments, ſo
as to occaſion ſtretching and diſloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But againſt <hi>Galen</hi>'s proof, the

'tis no ſtrange thing, that the acrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious

through the ligaments of the joynts,
cauſeth no drawing in the limbs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<hi>ſay they,</hi> the nerves themſelves

when ſtrong repelling means are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily

the Patient is exceedingly prejudiced,

it ſelf from it; and there it cauſes Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,

ſhews (beſides what was juſt now ſaid

in the next foregoing anſwer,) that the
membranes of the parts have a ſtrict

a mutual ſympathy.</p>

as the Diſeaſe doth?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Not that the organs of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
are attacked, hurt or tormented,
but only that the <hi>perioſtium</hi> is put
out of its natural poſture; which is
manifeſt from hence, that as ſoon as
this membrane is reſtored to its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſtate, you cannot perceive the leaſt
defect in thoſe organs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Why then doth the pain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe,
and grow more violent upon
touching or moving the part affected?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> This comes not to paſs becauſe
that the organs of motion, or their
membranes do ſuffer; but becauſe that
the membrane being already diſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
by the touch or motion thereof
it comes to ſuffer, and to ſtretch a new;
whereupon new pain muſt follow.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Dr. <hi>Paul Barbette</hi> reckons
them all amongſt the effects of the

Symptoms of <hi>Wounds</hi> in his <hi>Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:50778:32"/>
p.</hi> 165. of his Dutch Edition.
Beſides that 'tis manifeſt, that moſt
of theſe do then firſt appear when
the pain grows violent, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
with the diminution and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the pain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Whence comes it, that theſe
Symptoms that are cauſed by the
Gout, not only in divers Patients, but
alſo in the ſame, ſhew themſelves at
one time more than another, and
differ ſo much from one another?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> It comes from the greater or leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
intenſneſs of the efficient cauſe, the
Pain; which receives its degrees from
the quality and quantity of the gouty
matter. For the more malign and
abounding the damps are, the more
grievous alſo are not only the <hi>proper</hi>
Symptoms, but alſo <hi>theſe</hi> Accidents
of the Gout.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Doth the raging pain excite
in all Gouty perſons theſe Symptoms
all together, and at once?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Not ſo; for in bodies that
have but little ſeroſity in the blood,
the firſt five Symptoms do appear;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:50778:33"/>
but not at all, or very ſeldom, the
ſixth and laſt, which is the afflux of
humors: In others, who abound in
that ſeroſity, the afflux of moiſture
will be perceived firſt of all, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
without inflammation. Again,
when the gouty matter lurks deep, as
in the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> and in the Gout of
the ſhoulders, you are not then to
reckon upon the change of colour,
and the afflux.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> That raging pains do cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations,
is eaſily underſtood; but
how do they produce Fevers, Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
Sleepineſs, and loſs of ſtrength?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The intolerable pain drawing

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 'Tis very neceſſary, becauſe

it from the <hi>Sickneſs</hi> it ſelf:
Whence, as from a fruitful ſoil, have
ſprung ſo many errors about the Gout,
and eſpecially about the proxime
Cauſe thereof. Yea this is the only
cauſe, that ſo many Phyſitians and
Chirurgians are ſo much wedded to
the Notion of <hi>Humors,</hi> that they dare
almoſt take it for granted, that the

and Afflux of Humors; inſomuch,
that if they meet with any Gouty
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:50778:34"/>
perſon, in whom they cannot find this
Swelling or change of Colour (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they find great pain,) they
will rather diſcard them out of the
number of the Gouty, than acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
that ſometimes there are no <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors</hi>
at all accompanying the Gout.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But ſince the Affluxed humor,
which breeds the external ſwelling, is
neither in whole nor in part the Cauſe

that tumor and its matter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> It is a Symptom, which is no
inſeparable companion of the Gout;
yea never begins, and ſeldom ends

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> Does then this ſerous Swelling
not always accompany the Gout as an
inſeparable Symptom?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> No; for, beſides that ſome
Gouty perſons ſeldom or never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
this Tumor (cauſed by affluxed
humors,) as I have experienced, and
many Writers muſt witneſs; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:50778:34"/>
there is no affluxed Humor

               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But does this Swelling never
<hi>begin</hi> with the Gout?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> 'Tis never perceived in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the Gout; for, though in
many Patients this Tumor very ſoon
follows upon the Gout; yet, if it be
well obſerved, it is never of the ſame
age with the Gouty tumor, which in
order of time always precedes it: Yea,
if care be had, its birth may ſometimes
be altogether prevented, by being
timely ready to evaporate this dolori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
damp by a ſpeedy application of
my matchleſs diſcharging Remedy;
as I have often experimented on my

               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> No: This Symptom alone
<hi>ſurvives</hi> the Gout; yea the cauſe
whence it riſes ends not with it. For,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:50778:35"/>
as for the moſt part it firſt appears
when the ſickneſs is at its height, and
the pain rageth; ſo it is often ſeen a

diſpelled.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> It ſeems then, that the pain,
which is the cauſe of this Symptom,
ceaſing, the outward tumor doth not
vaniſh at the ſame time?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> No; for very often the limbs
remain ſwelled as before, and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
ſome days, and ſome trouble,
before this Swelling can be removed;
yea, if you do not take care, it not
only lames the Patient, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms

and hath deceived ſo many Learned
men?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> It is a Preternatural ſwelling
in the Fleſhy parts, conſiſting of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

1. In reſpect of the <hi>Name,</hi> which they

receive from their ſeveral Cauſes; for
the Gouty tumor coming from Winds,
takes the name of <hi>Windy</hi> tumor; the
other, coming from a ſerous humor,
is called the <hi>Serous</hi> tumor. 2. In
reſpect of the <hi>Part</hi> or <hi>Place affected;</hi>
for, whereas the Windy tumor diſtends
the Membranes of the bones, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
fill the Carncous parts, as water
a ſpunge, and render the Fleſh very
ſpungy. 3. In regard of the <hi>Signs;</hi>
for, whereas the <hi>Inward</hi> ſwelling ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
grievous and intolerable pain,
the <hi>Serous</hi> none or little. 4. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
ſwelling is a proper diſeaſe; the
other is raiſed by the pain, and is a
Symptom bred by Conſent of parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But ſince that the <hi>Serous</hi> tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor
in the Gout is not produced by
any External cauſe, but by an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
what is this Cauſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> The violent pain, as hath been
often ſaid, which is here the cauſe of
the Afflux of humors, it being known
by Artiſts, that Pain draws humors
after it; which therefore is by them
aſſigned to be one of the principal
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:50778:36"/>
cauſes of the Afflux of humors.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But are theſe humors, of which
this kind of Swelling conſiſts, drawn
into the ſuffering parts by the Pain
alone?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Artiſts are wont to add, that
ſympathizing Nature, as a kind Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſuccours the ſuffering part by
ſending moiſture to it; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
this Swelling ſhould be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by Sympathy of Conſent of the
parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What benefit or eaſe doth the
part affected receive from ſympathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
nature by her ſending thoſe hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
thither?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> That the raging pain is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
mitigated, and rendred more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> In what manner is that done,
or how doth the conveyed humor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwage
the enraged pain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Though this be difficult to
explain; yet I cannot agree to the
common opinion, importing, that the
Pain-breeding matter by means of the
conveyed humors is driven outward,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:50778:37"/>
and diſperſed thorough the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
fleſh, and ſo the ſuffering
member for a great part freed of the
pain-cauſing matter: For, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
humors can by no means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
or come to the dolorifick mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
much leſs fotch it out of its deep
ſeat, and diſlodge it, becauſe 'tis ſo faſt
impacted and included under ſo firm
and cloſe a Bone-membrane.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> What is then, in your opinion,
the reaſon why the ſharp pain is often
diminiſhed upon the afflux of moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
not only in the Gout, but alſo in
the Tooth-ach? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Methinks 'tis probable, that
'tis done after this manner: The muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
fleſhy parts being by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed
humors rendred ſofter, plumper,
and more ſpongious, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
gentler, do not, in the firſt place,
preſs againſt, or rather reſiſt ſo much
the ſenſible and diſtended <hi>periostium,</hi>
as before, when the carneous parts
had but their own native and proper
moiſture. Secondly, the <hi>periostium</hi>
being by the conveyed moiſture from
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:50778:37"/>
without made gentler, may with leſs
pain be ſtretch'd; and it may alſo come
to paſs, that by that little warmth,
which this ſerous matter hath in it
at firſt, it being now come near the
<hi>periostium</hi> doth ſomewhat attenuate
the included groſs damp, and ſo the
better diſpoſe it to evaporate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Qu.</hi> But doth the affluxed humor
occaſion no miſchief?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>An.</hi> Very much, and ſometimes
more than the Gout it ſelf; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
care it cauſeth Diſlocation of the
ſuffering members, and the Nodes.</p>

               <p>

by conveying, bring ſuch a quantity of
humors to the ſuffering part (for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,

and ſo harden and render incurable

uſe moderately warm mollifying re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They make between their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
a little pellet of this woolly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
which is ſcarce of the bigneſs
of a ſmall white pea, at one end ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The moiſture which by this

ſuffering place; of which moiſture
indeed the greateſt part flies away in
fume, but yet ſome of it draws into

that it cannot all be converted into

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> None at all; it only cauſes a

the fire here raiſeth no bliſters?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> None other, but that the pellet
burns not quite thorough to the skin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Doth not this Burning cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The pain is very tolerable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the matter is woolly and ſoft,

places, if need be, ſo often till the pain
be removed, although you ſhould (for

the part burnt to eaſe the after-pain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I told you juſt now, there is no
ſuch thing as after pain: But yet you
muſt not leave weak nature to her
ſelf alone, but you ought to aid her,
and to uſe means to ſeparate the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is to be done herein?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Lay a little beaten Leek upon
the ſaid <hi>Eſcar,</hi> and over that, one of
the outermoſt coats of the ſame Leek,
a little moiſtned in the mouth; the
which, like a plaiſter, keeps the beaten
Leek faſt upon the <hi>Eſcar.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
taken off together, ſome 24 hours
after, more or leſs, you'l ſee the little
Eſcar diſpoſed to ſeparation, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to have round about it a circle
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:50778:48"/>
of clear skin, which ſometimes alſo
riſes to a wound or bliſter, which may
with ſciſſers be opened to give it
vent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is not this little <hi>Eſcar</hi> to be
treated with inciſion, and to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
away with little pincers or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cets,
that ſo the ill which may lurk
there may evaporate? Or is it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to leave it for nature further to
open the <hi>Eſcar,</hi> and to throw it off?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Beware to uſe any ſevere means
(from ill-grounded conſiderations) or
any force; for great pain may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
be occaſioned: And therefore uſe
only warm Plantin-leaves to make the
<hi>Eſcars</hi> fall off, patiently ſtaying till
they fall off by that means, and the
part heal up; the which is effected
by provident Nature her ſelf, if it be
good for the part affected.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But when the Eſcar ſeems to
be already looſe, and even to hang
doubled in the little wound, is it not
then to be taken away?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If the Eſcar is ſever'd, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50778:48"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> You are not ſo much as to
touch it, bur leave it to Nature to
diſpoſe thereof,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Muſt you not do your beſt with
the greateſt ſpeed to heal up the
burnt places?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> No; but rather you are to
keep them open as long as you can,
yet without changing them into Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues
by putting peas or pellets into
them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> How is that to be done?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By laying upon them warm
Plantin-leaves, with the <hi>rough</hi> ſide to
the skin. I ſay, they muſt be laid on
warm, not cold: And this is to be
done not by holding the leaves in
warm water, but by laying them on
glowing wood-coals; where they
muſt lie until you ſee them begin to
fall-in; and then they are to be taken
off and rolled ſtiff together betwixt
the palms of the hands, and then to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:50778:49"/>
be unrolled and diſplaid again, being
yet warm and moiſt, and ſo laid on
the Eſcar: Continuing this until it
be time to heal up the wound; when
the leaf, being prepar'd again after
the former manner, is to be laid on
with the <hi>ſmooth</hi> ſide to the skin; by
which means it will heal up without
leaving a mark upon the part, and
much better than if you had employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the beſt plaiſters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Why muſt theſe Leaf-plaiſters
lie a great while upon the part with
the <hi>rough</hi> ſide, and at laſt only with
the <hi>ſmooth</hi> ſide?</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are to be kept from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

               <p>

keep the Leaf upon the Eſcar.</p>
               <p>

be had, may not other leaves ſerve?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> In that caſe you may uſe red
Cabbage or Colts-foot-leaves; and,

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis probable, that upon the
acquiſition of the true knowledg of
this diſeaſe, they will not deviate ſo
far as before from the way of curing
it, and that in all probability they
will eſchew many errors and miſtakes;
but they will never find out any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

               <p>
                  <pb n="88" facs="tcp:50778:52"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> May not the encloſed wind,
which you ſay cauſeth all the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
be drawn out by Sudorificks,
Cupping-glaſſes, Iſſues, Leeches, or
common Cauſticks?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By <hi>Sudorificks</hi> poſſibly there
might be effected the greateſt eaſe,
but the evil would not be fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
ſeeing that thereby only
the ſubtileſt of the gourty damps
would be exhaled. And for <hi>Cupping-glaſſes,
Iſſues, Leeches,</hi> and <hi>Cauſticks,</hi>
none of them is able to fetch out this
evil from its deep-lurking hole, which
is under the cloſe and firm membrane
which inveſts the bones.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is it not adviſable to employ

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> By no means, becauſe the pain
is thereby not removed, but only pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated
and dulled; but is afterwards
raiſed up into greater rage.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Is not <hi>Letting of Blood</hi> bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,
as many would maintain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Letting of blood is better omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
for theſe reaſons: <hi>Firſt,</hi> becauſe,
according to the opinion of the beſt,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:50778:52"/>
'tis not adviſable, when the pain is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
to open a vein. <hi>Secondly,</hi> 'tis
not the Blood that's peccant or faulty,
but the ill-conditioned Damps, which
indeed <hi>run together</hi> with the blood
and ſpirits in the veſſels, but do never
ſo <hi>mix with</hi> the blood, as to make
one body, but may eaſily be ſever'd:
Whereas 'tis otherwiſe with the Blood
and Spirits, they two making up one
body; as the heat and water conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
hot water, or as wine and the
ſpirits thereof make one body of wine.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> by Blood-letting the noxious
Damps are drawn inwards to the
Heart, and there occaſion much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief,
and the benefit you look for
from it will not countervail the harm.
<hi>Fourthly,</hi> the forces of the Patient
are thereby diminiſhed, and Nature is
enervated in her conſlict with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe;
whereas a good Artiſt ought
always to befriend Nature by
ſtrengthning her againſt her enemy;
and a wiſe Phyſitian will not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

the treaſure of life: And as a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:50778:53"/>
in a tempeſt will not throw his
Bread over board, but rather ſuch
commodities as he can be without;
ſo a good Phyſitian will keep the
blood of his Patient, and drive out
ill Damps.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> They are means which are apt
to mitigate, yea ſometimes to remove

ſlowly, nor radically.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Would not an <hi>Hot iron</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
to make this damp exhale, as
was practiſed in the <hi>Sciatica</hi> upon
<hi>Jacobus Vincus,</hi> Ambaſſador of the

<hi>Nicolaus Tulpius,</hi> Burgemaſter of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam,</hi>
in his <hi>Obſervations, ch.</hi> 26.
<hi>p.</hi> 228; by which means that Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was freed from his trouble?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:50778:53"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> 'Tis too ſierce, and withal too
dangerous a remedy; practicable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
(notwithſtanding the contrary
judgment of <hi>Fabrit. Hildanus</hi> in his
<hi>6th part, p.</hi> 501;) but 'tis better to
uſe our gentle way of Burning, which,
by far, cauſes no ſuch pain, and is
more beneficial without putting na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſo hard to it. To confirm this,
I ſhall now only add, what <hi>Herls</hi> ſaith
in his <hi>Examen of Chirurgery,</hi> p. 364.
viz. <hi>The burning with a red-hot Iron
is too violent a way for Chirurgions,
and too painful for Patients, and can
ſeldom be uſed without hurting the
fleſh and muſcles.</hi> And doubtleſs all
Phyſitians and Chirurgions will be of
the ſame mind, as ſoon as this way
of Burning with <hi>Moxa</hi> ſhall come to
their knowledg; my opinion being,
that they will never make uſe more
of an <hi>hot Iron</hi> but in ſuch caſes,
wherein the ſaid Burning is not
powerful enough, as, for example, in
the Rottenneſs of bones, and the
like.</p>
               <p>Q. What think you of <hi>Spaniſh
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:50778:54"/>
Flies,</hi> now of ſo frequent uſe; of
which <hi>Jobus van Mekeren</hi> writes in
his Obſervations, that he hath uſed
them with much benefit againſt the
Gout, following the adviſe of Dr.
<hi>Vopiſus Fortunatus P. lempius?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I eſteem, that all intelligent
Phyſitians and Chirurgions will much
rather make uſe of our <hi>Moxa</hi> for the
good of their Patients, they knowing
ſufficiently the venemouſneſs of thoſe
<hi>Spaniſh Flies,</hi> and how hurtful they
are to the Bladder and other <hi>viſcera;</hi>
and having uſed them long enough
of neceſſity, becauſe they knew
no better means. And 'tis remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
what <hi>Aquapendente</hi> warns of the
qualities of Spaniſh Flies in his <hi>Art
of Chirurgery,</hi> ch. 3. p. 246. conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
with theſe words, That <hi>'tis mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to uſe this deadly remedy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. Is the Burning with <hi>Moxa</hi> leſs
painful than that with an Iron?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Incomparably leſs; nor is it ſo
Dangerous, according to the golden
rule of <hi>Hippocrates, lib. 2. Aph.</hi> 12.
That to heat much, and ſuddenly, is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:50778:54"/>
dangerous; but to do it by little and
little, and ſlowly, is without danger.
And this is it, what the expert Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian
<hi>Guilandin</hi> confeſſeth in <hi>Proſper
Alpinus de Medic. Aegyptiorum,</hi> ch.
12. in that remarkable practice of
the Burning in <hi>Cairo,</hi> and thereabout:
Which <hi>Chapter</hi> highly deſerves to be
conſidered.</p>
               <p>Q. But, <hi>Sir,</hi> do you not apprehend,
that the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> manner of Burning
will go beyond that with your <hi>Moxa?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not at all, being well aſſured,
that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> will be very glad
to exchange their Cotton and Strami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
linnen with our <hi>Moxa,</hi> as ſoon
as they ſhall know the admirable ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and effect thereof. Nor is the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with <hi>Moxa</hi> by far ſo painful, as
all the world will judg, when they
ſhall ſee and compare both.</p>
               <p>Q. Then, I pray, Sir, be pleaſed to
repeat in ſhort, what remedy it muſt
be, that ſhall free a man from this
diſeaſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The genuine Cure of this Evil,
which attacks ſuddenly, and will not
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:50778:55"/>
bear delay without great injury to the
Patient, conſiſts in the removal of the
Cauſe, and requires a remedy, having
theſe following proprieties. <hi>Firſt,</hi> it
muſt powerfully open not only the
Pores of the Skin, but thoſe alſo of the
Membranes of Bones. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it muſt
attenuate the cold thick damps, and
reſiſt their malignity. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> it
muſt ſtrengthen the innate heat, and
the expulſive force of the part affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
thereby the better to maſter
and remove the Evil. Now the Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with <hi>Moxa</hi> performs all this: It
ſtrongly draws out from the deep, and
reſiſts all malignity; it attenuates
the cold and craſſe vapors lurking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the membranes, conſuming or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
them, and ſo disburthening
nature of her enemy; laſtly, it ſo
corroborates the weak ſuffering par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

that it will not ſo eaſily receive and
lodge again Damps of that nature.</p>

                  <hi>A.</hi> If they be ſo delicate as not

For then the Inflammation directs ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly

will be incumbent on the Maſter to be
very coutious in finding out the true
ſeat of the pain, that ſo he may not
put the Patient to unneceſſary tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And therefore he muſt with
his fore-finger feel ſo long upon or

they do not cure the Gout but by

have been taught indeed to burn in
very many, but yet in certain deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined

the pain ſhould require it. If then

it chanceth, that the Gout ſits juſt in

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> If the pain with three pellets
be quite removed, as commonly it is,

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is to be imputed to the

Chirurgion, <hi>Francis de Ray,</hi> a very
skilful Maſter, who in his Art had
ſerv'd our <hi>Eaſt-India Company</hi> near
30 years. He was exceedingly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by the Gout, and got a <hi>Schir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi>
upon the fore-part on his right
hand, which though it took not quite
away the Uſe of the hand, yet did
very much diſable and weaken it by
a notable intumeſcence; which being
by my advice burnt and ſo opened,
was in a little time perfectly cured;
the matter of the <hi>Schirrus,</hi> thence
diſcharged, white like mixed chalk,
which the Patient himſelf took up
with a <hi>Spatula,</hi> and having laid it on
a paper, ſhew'd it me, being dried;
whereupon his hand was ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that he could uſe it at pleaſure.

well, can you preſerve the place thus
weakned from a new afflux of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I think, I can and that after this
manner: If the <hi>Schirrus</hi> were, for
example, upon the knuckle of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:50778:65"/>
I would then duly burn the
limb under it on the hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
intercept all ill humors, and ſo
keep them from flowing to the weak
part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> But what, if that ſhould fail
you, and the Gout ſurpriſe the limb
with a new afflux of humors?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Then ſhould I reſolve to hinder
thoſe humors from coagulation and
induration by the advantage of our
Bruning remedy; by which means
you may at leaſt take away the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figurements,
which theſe nodes cauſe
in the limbs, if you cannot reſtore the
uſe of the limbs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> It ſeems, you have ſome hopes
even of the laſt?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> I have, becauſe I know, that
the nodes do lodg not <hi>in</hi> the very
Joynts, but <hi>about</hi> them; and being
diſcharged one way or another, 'tis
found that the Joynts are free, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
only that the veins and arteries,
yea the nerves too, be not ſo obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
by the bigneſs, hardneſs and
diuturnity of this ſtony tumor, that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:50778:66"/>
the pervaſion of the Blood and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal

in which caſe the limb muſt

great and violent commotions of the

<hi>Thirdly,</hi> neither muſt you put your

<hi>Fourthly,</hi> you muſt take con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
care to keep your body ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and to prevent coſtiveneſs, nor to
remove the ſame too ſuddenly.
<hi>Fifthly,</hi> 'tis beneficial, to take a gentle
Vomitive after your meal, once a week.
<hi>Sixthly,</hi> as ſoon as you perceive any
ſigns of a Fever (the mother of the
Gout,) then is it proper to take a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorifick,
by the advice of ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
Phyſitian, to open the pores,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:50778:67"/>

ſince that many of the chief Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians

               <head type="sub">Of the Tooth-ach or the Gout of the
Teeth, and the Cure thereof</head>
               <p>Q. IS there alſo a <hi>Gout</hi> of the <hi>teeth;</hi>
for I have been inform'd by
Dr. <hi>Wilhelmus de Ryne,</hi> who lately
is arriv'd here, that there is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſht
a treatiſe in <hi>Europe,</hi> entituled, <hi>of
the Gout of the Teeth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Thus is very properly expreſt
that kind of tooth-ach, which hath
the ſame proximate Cauſe with the
Gout, and ariſeth from cold Damps,
as the Gout doth, which otherwiſe,
according to the common opinion is
bred from Deſluxions.</p>
               <p>Q. But ſeriouſly, do you think,
that the Gout and Tooth-ach come
from the ſame Cauſe?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Ti's certain to me (whatever
ſome may alledg to the contrary,)
that the next cauſe, the part afflected,
the ſeat, the ways, the ſignes and
ſymptoms are the ſame in theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:50778:68"/>
and do agree together.</p>
               <p>Q. Is then the Cure of the Tooth-ach
to be perform'd after the ſame
manner as of the Gout?</p>
               <p>A. By no means, the Tooth-ach is
to be cured in another place, becauſe
that the place, where the pain hath
its ſeat here, is within the mouth and
the teeth, where you cannot come to
burn with our <hi>Moxa?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. Would you then have the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Artery</hi> open'd with a lancet,
(this ſeeming to be the way by which
the evil damp may be expelled out of
the teeth;) as ſome hath ventur'd to
do, to the great eaſe of the pain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This means is too dangerous,
becauſe it is very ſubject to occaſion
an <hi>Aneuriſma,</hi> and ſpends too much
of the vital ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Q. What do you ſay then of ſcari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in the neck or upon the
ſhoulders; or of purging, or of blood-letting?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Theſe and the like remedies
ſeldom give eaſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Would you have then the ach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tooth pulled out?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:50778:69"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Not at all; that way being a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate
one, and not only accompanied
with great pain &amp; miſchief to the poor
Patient, but alſo occaſioning many
evils, and even death it ſelf. But take
me right, I pray; for I here only ſpeak
of that kind of Tooth-ach, which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
deſcribed, not of that which
comes from the <hi>Rottenneſs</hi> of teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. What then, may we follow
<hi>Spigelius,</hi> whole manual operation
<hi>Scultetus</hi> mentions in the 18th of his
<hi>Chirurgical Obſervations;</hi> who with
his knife, heated red-hot, did cut off
that little branch of the temporal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery
which runs through the Ear to the
teeth; by which means the pain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently
vaniſhed and never return'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Tis true, that <hi>Scultetus</hi> ſpeaks
with great commendation of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
calling it a Chirurgical reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of wonderful vertue; which
the Author hath firſt practiſed upon
himſelf, and afterwards, in <hi>Scultetus</hi>
his preſence, upon others (always
with good ſucceſs:) And this hath
been further improved by others:
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:50778:69"/>
For whereas <hi>Spigelius</hi> made uſe of a
red-hot knife, to cut off the ſaid little
branch on the outſide of the Ear;
others have uſed a little flat caute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing
Iron, in a ſilver caſe, that they
might go ſafely, and not burn dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
than was fit; and therewith they
have burnt off and ſear'd <hi>within</hi> the
Ear, the ſame ramification of the
<hi>Carotid Artery,</hi> with the like happy
ſucceſs: As I my ſelf have experienced
26. or 28. years ago at <hi>Arnheim,</hi>
where Dr. N. <hi>Coets</hi> did, by this means,
immediatly free me from an intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
tooth-ach. I have alſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
here in <hi>India</hi> from very credible
Perſons, that D. <hi>Godefridus Dellius,</hi>
Miniſter at <hi>Kooten</hi> near <hi>Wyck</hi> of
<hi>Durſtede,</hi> hath cured many of that
pain by this very means.</p>
               <p>Q. Since this is ſo excellent and
effectual a remedy, ſhall we then ſtand
by it, or is there ſomething to be ſaid
againſt it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> So there is; and to deal plainly
with you, it ought to yield to a better
remedy, <hi>viz.</hi> to our burning with
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:50778:70"/>
                  <hi>Moxa,</hi> the which in the Gout of the
Teeth ſerves not only for a diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but alſo for a revulſive intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
remedy, which always produces
good (if uſed according to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript)
and never the leaſt evil. For,
whereas by the former way, of uſing the
red-hot knife and the cautery, the
body loſes one of the neceſſary and the
nobler kind of blood-veſſels, to the
detriment and ſpoiling of the teeth;
by our way thoſe veſels are preſerved
entire and unhurt. T'is true indeed,
that the pain of the teeth by the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
art is ſo removed as that it never
returns (in caſe that whole branch
be burnt off;) but this is alſo true,
that by ſuch a cauteriſing operation
there is for ever cut off that afflux of
the blood and vital ſpirits, through this
ſear'd artery, to the teeth; whereupon
at laſt muſt follow an exiccation and
mortification of the teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. Since then you prefer your burning
with <hi>Moxa</hi> before all other remedies
in the Tooth-ache alſo, pray, teach
me, where it is to be applyed?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="tcp:50778:70"/>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Juſt upon the <hi>temporal artery,</hi>
where the ſame in the Temples, not
far from the Ear, beats ſtrongeſt in
a violent Tooth-ache; which is that
place where Chirurgians are wont to
apply their Maſtick-plaiſters, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Q. But is the burning with <hi>Moxa</hi>
upon the <hi>temporal</hi> arteries not too
dangerous?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Not at all, if your work be done
carefully; yea it is a means very bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial,
and hath been practiſed by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Phyſitians, of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Q. After what manner then is this
Burning to be performed; muſt it be
done as in the caſe of the Gout?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Juſt ſo; only you muſt in this caſe
Kindle leſſer pellets, and theſe to the
number of three upon one place, and
no more; though it be not forbidden,
at ſome little diſtance from the burned
place to perform anew the like burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
which may be done not only
without fearing the leaſt miſchief
from it, but alſo with an expectation
of more eaſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Is this Burning followed by a
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:50778:71"/>
Mitigation or by a Removal of the
pain?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It performs both, in an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
manner, and that inſtantly, or
preſently after, without fail; unleſs,
unknown to the Patient and Operator,
the Tooth-ach ſhould proceed from a
hidden rottenneſs of the Teeth.</p>
               <p>Q. But, Sir, how will you make it
out, that this is a revulſive and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
remedy, and withal diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
the part affected from the evil
which afflicts it?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This is as clear as the Sun at
noon-day, and that from the effects: For
the Damps, which were already by the
expelling power of the Heart driven
out into the place that is between the
membrane and the teeth, and there
produced ſo great pain by the expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the ſenſible membrane, are by
this our Burning drawn back to the
place where the Burning is made, and
other Damps intercepted that were
on the way, and ſo the body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to wiſh, disburthen'd from both,
and the blood purified.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:50778:71"/>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Mean time the learned <hi>Senner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
ſaith, that the true means duly to
purge the blood hath not yet been
found out: Is that true?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> It is; for the ways hitherto
found out to purify the blood do not
deſerve that name. For, the matter
being well conſidered, they do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe than diſcharge the blood of
its impurities: And I am of opinion,
that unto this very time there hath
been found out no better means for
that purpoſe than what we here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
foraſmuch as thereby the Blood
is ſuddenly and moſt ſafely purged of
all noxious damps.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What is to be done after the
Burning for the Tooth-ach?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> After this ſlight Burning there
remains only a little gray ſpeck, which
needs not to be look'd after, becauſe
it dries and heals up of it ſelf, and
ſerves till then for a vent to the eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating
damps.</p>

               <head type="sub">About the Removal of the Falling-Sickneſs

with Moxa.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>IAcobus Jonas,</hi> about 13 years of
age, Son of <hi>Jonas Aertz,</hi> who
was chief Chirurgion in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpital
of the Noble Company in
<hi>Batavia,</hi> having taken a fancy (againſt
his Fathers command) to ſee the ſad
and diſmal agonies of dying perſons
in a place where deſperate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable
perſons were lodged, did upon
a Sunday morning ſee one of thoſe
give up the ghoſt in ſo affrightful a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:50778:73"/>
manner under ſuch terrible convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that being more than uſually
terrified therewith, he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to ſpeak of it at Table with
amazement: At which relation his
Father being much troubled, did ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely
rebuke him for ſo dangerous a
curioſity, ſtrictly commanding him,
never to repair to that place again,
from an apprehenſion, leaſt one time
or other he ſhould rue ſuch a curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.
But behold! The boy laying
himſelf down upon a bench after
dinner, to take (as 'tis common in
that place) a nap in the afternoon,
there appear'd to him (as he related
afterwards) in a dream that fearful
departure of the dead, ſo lively to
his fancy, that in a fright he awaken'd,
crying out a loud, and, ſeiſed on with
a terrible fit of the <hi>Epilepſy.</hi> To
which diſtemper he remained a great
while ſubject, and in ſuch a manner,
that upon the leaſt diſturbance he
fell into new fits, of which his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was not able by any of the
means by him employed to free him.
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:50778:73"/>
This did ſo grieve the good old man,
that in all likelihood it contributed
not a little to his haſty death.</p>
               <p>It hapned, that upon occaſion I vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited
the widow of this Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where ſeeing this Youth halting, I
asked what the cauſe of it was. He
ſhewing me a ſwelling above his left
knee, accompanied with grievous
pains; I was apt to conclude that it
was a Gouty diſtemper, and reſolved,
thereupon, with the conſent of the
parties concerned, to treat it as ſuch;
employing my way of burning, which
I did with three pellets conſumed on
one place: whereupon all pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
vaniſhed, the youth inſtantly
walked without any inconvenience.
I put upon it a Coridons plaiſter, and
order'd him to renew it twice in 24
hours. And ſince that time he never
had any fit of the Falling-ſickneſs;
doubtleſs becauſe that the venemous
Damps, which cauſed this grievous
diſtemper, had been evaporated our
of the body, or rather had been thence
drawn out by the <hi>Moxa.</hi> And 'tis
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:50778:74"/>
obſervable, that (according to the
relation made me by the Lad's Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,)
this Damp never cauſed in him a
fit of the Falling Sickneſs, till it had
firſt for a while tormented the place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned,
no otherwiſe as if it
had been the Gout. Now, when this
peccant matter did aſcend from the
knee to the Head (which uſually fell
out every ſixth or eighth day,) it was
attended with a ſenſible Cold in the
paſſage of this Damp, yet acting
ſo ſlowly, that the Youth had time
enough to give warning to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of a new ſit, that ſo ſhe might
take the better care of him.</p>

fiſh for our family, and come to the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:50778:74"/>
place where the Fiſher-men uſe to be
with their boats, and having ſeen one
of them arrived with fiſh, ſhe ſtept
over ſeveral of thoſe boats to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that, where ſhe might buy. Which
having done, and ſtepping back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
over thoſe boats to ſhore, ſhe
was frighted at the ſudden and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
ſight of a drowned Humane
body, ſhe had ſtept over, that had
been brought up to be viewed by
the appointed Officer. Which fright
did ſo ſeize her, that ſhe fell down
and quite fainted away. But being
ſomewhat recovered, ſhe was brought
home with the fiſh in her hand, but
out of her wits; which the ſame
night was follow'd by ſuch a fit of
<hi>Madneſs,</hi> that at firſt we knew not
what to do. But having recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
our ſelves, we reſolved to ſend for
the <hi>Guinam-Doctreſs,</hi> to hear her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
ſince ſhe had ſo ſuccesfully cured
me of the Gout. She came the next
morning, and being well inform'd of
the circumſtances of this eaſe, and
demanded whether ſhe knew any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:50778:75"/>
for it, ſhe anſwer'd, That ſhe
would uſe her Art, and hoped God
would bleſs her operation. What
doth ſhe? She bids the other ſlaves
that were preſent to hold this poor
ſhe-ſlave faſt, and binds the hair of
her head cloſe together, into a knot;
which done, ſhe makes one of the moſt
robuſt ſlaves to hold that hair-knot
with his hand, and to turn the
Patient's head which way ſhe,
(the Doctreſs) would have it. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
ſhe began to burn with her
<hi>Moxa</hi> cloſe under the hair, from the
fore-part of the head unto the neck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and from the neck again to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part,
round about; performing this
ſo artificially and gently, that hardly
any mark could be perceived: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
this poor mad creature, to the
admiration of us all, fell into a ſweet
ſleep, of which ſhe awaken'd towards
evening in very good health and in
her right wits, without ever after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing
into that grievous fit of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
again; it being now about Ten
years ſince her recovery.</p>

               <p>ONe of our ſhe-ſlaves, which my
Wife had lent to our chief Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<hi>William Perſant</hi> (who a little
while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before had married one of my
daughters,) was about evening, as ſhe
was at work without doors upon the
wall, ſuddenly ſurpriſed with this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
ſo that in a trice ſhe became
as ſtiff as a ſtatue, without any hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſeeing, ſpeaking, or moving any
limb. The ſaid Chirurgion having
tried upon her the utmoſt of his skill
to no purpoſe, and I being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the condition of this
wretched ſlave, my Wife and Son,
upon my deſire, went immediately
to her, and according to my directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
burned her upon the Arteries of
her temples: Which was no ſooner
done, but ſhe recover'd the uſe of her
ſenſes and the Motion of all her limbs,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:50778:76"/>
and ſhe enjoys to this very day a
good ſtate of health.</p>
               <p>I conclude with the advice of the
