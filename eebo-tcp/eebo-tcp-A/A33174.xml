            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

injury, kept all degrees of men by exact Rules of Justice within the bounds of Equity, so that Kings and Laws had the same Origin; for equal Right was that which all men sought, and if they obtained it from a just and good man they were content, but failing of it, they then invented Laws which spoke with the same voice to all Persons. It is therefore most evident, that such only were chosen to command, of whose Justice the People had great opinion; and from them alone (if they likewise were prudent) they believed all good to be derived to them.</p>

               <p>BUt these disaffected to Monarchy, would not pretend a total exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Obedience, but not alwayes to be subject to one; it therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a Great and Wise Prince, by his Studies of the best Arts and Learning,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48543:8"/>
to render himself such in this high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as nothing may seem wanting to compleat him for Government, which of all Arts is the most difficult.</p>
               <p>The Foundations and parts of it, which a Prince must preserve and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, even with the hazard of his Life, are Religion, the Power of Magistrates, the Authority of Senates, Laws, Ancient Customes, Justice, Publick Faith, his Provinces, Allies, the Dignity of his Crown, Militia, and Treasury.</p>
               <p>Yet are there two Things by which all Requisite to Government in a State may be secured, <hi>viz.</hi> Knowledge how to Govern, and exact Discipline in the Administration of the Laws.</p>
               <p>The first of these (of great Advantage and absolutely necessary to a Prince) containeth in it knowledge of Armies, Camps, Battles, Sieges, Provisions for Troops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with all things pertaining to War.</p>
               <p>The other of no less necessity, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of greater Utility (its subject Matter considered) is understanding Civil Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, the Authority of the Publick Laws,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48543:8"/>
Records, and Examples of Antiquity, and whatsoever else may advance and conduce to the Benefit of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>But although these things are set down in Precepts, yet is it too difficult to be conformable to them in all parts of a Politick Life, because what is in the hands of Fortune is to be govern'd (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Accidents) by time, and so to be provided for by Council, which was the custome of our Ancestors, who to all new Emergencies of Time, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways accommodate new Resolves.</p>
               <p>So that this knowledge in Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs (which we here mention) is acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by the daily affected talking of any particular Minister, nor Formal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Schools, or Republicks painted out in Books, but a diligent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of greatest Actions, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of many, and practice of more, by a continual exercise and serious use of such things as are daily observed to have been of Advantage or disadvantage to the Commonwealth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 4. Of the Office of a Prince in General what he ought to know, do and consider.</head>
               <p>IN the administration of Matters of greatest moment, there are Various Acts of Councils and Times which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend wholly upon the Prince, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore require his greatest care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
               <p>For the Publick being to be formed and governed by Councils, and honest and profitable Actions, it is necessary the Princes Judgment and Virtue should appear most eminent.</p>
               <p>And that his Empire may be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Prudence (which is to be seen in his Choice of Good or Evil Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters) is to be quickned by his calling of Councils, continuing or dismissing them, in requiring, giving, taking, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating, changing, and rejecting advice; as likewise in Actions, by undertaking, executing, or laying aside designs.</p>
               <p>All which, as they concern the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:48543:9"/>
the chief is, perfectly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the Military Force, what Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, what Allies, what Confederates, what Stipendaries, and by what Tyes of Amity, Conditions, and Leagues they are obliged; To maintain a constant custom of determining Causes, to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Examples of Ancestors, the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of their Power, Publick Laws, the Intent, Manners, and Discipline of the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>For as a Pilot purposeth to himself a safe Course, a Physician the Recovery of his Patient, and the General of an Army Victory; so the Design of a Prince should be the Happiness of his people, that they may be strong in Power, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in plenty; Great and Glorious in Virtue and Honor, and to effect this work, the best Princes should be most industrious.</p>
               <p>Yet is it not to be expected they should haue their eyes upon all things; but if knowingly they omit any thing, it is a great Crime, and they contract something of anothers guilt, if their care could have prevented it; but if any thing
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48543:10"/>
happen which they could not obviate, the fault is not theirs. And this hath often befaln the wisest men, who (as the best Pilot cannot withstand the Fury of a Tempest) could not overcome the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and insult of Fortune; yet this, few rightly consider, all things being expected from Him, to whom nothing ought (at least) to be refused, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all things conducing to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good.</p>
               <p>I will not reflect on the miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Provinces in their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein Diligence is Faction, Neglect Dishonor, Severity dangerous, Bounty unacceptable, common conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation treacherous, compliance pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; every man seems chearful, while most are discontented, Malice secret, Dissimulation open, obsequiously obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their new Governors, honoring them when present, and deserting when absent.</p>
               <p>Many of these things happen to the best of Princes, but they (like valiant men) should trust so much to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as not to fear any assault of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48543:10"/>
by performing all things with Wisdom, Courage, and Justice.</p>
               <p>For though many men weigh Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils by Events, and conclude that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath had Success, he foresaw much, and who was not so Fortunate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood little; it was always my judgment to value every mans Virtue or Fortune by his Actions, not by events: Who can promise to perpetuate happiness to his Country? or who so hold the Helm of Government in all weathers, as not to be shaken in a violent Storm? Let it be your endeavor to keep the Ship steddy and in a safe Course, and when the Windes rise, it is sufficient if your Art and care be not wanting, for that is all that Virtue can perform.</p>
               <p>Be sure always (whether busied in Publick Affairs, or diverted by Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) to consider the Tenure of your Power, by what Virtue, Care, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of your Ancestors it was acquired, augmented and preserved, and how it is to be maintained, governed and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your Own.</p>

               <p>BUt that you may proceed on Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples well-weigh'd, and diligently explored: First deliberately consider the Thing to be put in execution, how Just and Honest, and if you haue Power to effect it.

               <p>Let the better Opinion always take place, act nothing but on probable (good) grounds, for nothing is in it self honorable wherein there is not a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Judgment; and therefore you shall do well maturely to consider that, which once put in execution, cannot be revoked or repressed. I had rather many should judge you to have acted unwari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then a few dishonestly; and in all your Actions be guided more by consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the matter then the witness, that you may be esteemed as a light shin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in darkness, and an imitator of our Senate, who never separated their Profit from their Honor.</p>

for Equity shines by it self, but Doubt signifieth some apprehension of injury. Think not it becomes a King to let his Will be the Rule of his Life, nor that they are happy that live as they will; for to desire that which is not seemly, is a degree of Misery, nor are you so unhappy in not obtaining your Will, as in enjoying what you ought not to desire.</p>
               <p>You are the Chief in great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands and Provinces, bear therefore a Minde as Great and Honorable, that you may appear, not only to be above all men, but above their Vices; to contemne all libidinous desires, to judge freely, to consult more for the peoples profit then their pleasure, to provide for the safty of all men against powerful and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous persons; and in these things to give way to none, but excel all.</p>
               <p>Keep it always in your Memory, that the Actions of a Prince are naked to Censure, therefore consider your Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
               <p>Let nothing be done that may leave a dangerous imitation of your example

to posterity, for many think what they do by example is of Right, and often add something, nay much of their own, but it becomes a great Prince to do that, which may be, not only of greatest pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent advantage, but for future example.</p>

               <p>PRinces and Magistrates in their Command, ought so to deport themselves towards their Subjects and Allies, as Parents towards their children, or the Soul over the Body; for the Office of the Soul is to a make right use of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and as the Minde of a Wise man, so that of a Prince should always be dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to make the best of his Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which should render him Moderate, Modest, Temperate, Constant, and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent. We sometimes referre these Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets to the sole term of Frugality as to their Head, because Virtues seem to be comprehended under that Title through the use of a Proverb, that, <hi>The Frugal man do's all things well.</hi> But, I know, Princes are not to be commended with this attribute, that a King should be a Frugal man, is not much for his Honor;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48543:19"/>
to be Valiant, Just, Severe, Grave, Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous, Munificent, Bountiful, Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, are the praises of a Prince, the other of a private Man; let others take it, as they please, I judge Frugality (that is, Modesty and Temperance) to be a very great Virtue, though not so allowed by <hi>Xerxes,</hi> who abounding in the benefits and gifts of Fortune, not content with his great Forces both of Horse and Foot, his multitude of Ships, and infinite Treasure of Gold, proposed a Reward to him who should find out a new Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which when invented, could not content him; for, Lust is never satisfied, which made <hi>Diogenes</hi> dispute, how much he was Superior to the King of <hi>Persia</hi> in his Life and Fortune; for that he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing, and the King never had enough.

               <p>We find in Story, that those Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Kings of <hi>Persia</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> had many Wives, to whom they gave several Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; to one a City to find the Attire of

               <p>BY all which it appeareth, how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious they are to the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth who err in this kind, since the Vices which they practise are diffused among the people, although even among them who follow the example, the esteem of Princes is more easily lost, then their life reproved; for though we may in this hold them immoderate, yet must we not therefore alledge it, as a Crime. Nay it is the sense of all sober men, and a fixed principle, not only to conceal the faults of Princes, as of our Parents, but patiently to bear them.</p>
               <p>Yet it is their part to give Rules of Moderation to themselves, and Laws

to others; for if they look back to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, they may see that as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations were of the Governors of any City, such was the City; and the people always followed the change of their Princes manners.</p>
               <p>There is therefore much in Example, and most men studiously imitate the Actions of the Prince; so that his desires and Vices infect his Dominions, and by his Continency they are correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and amended.

               <head>CHAP. 11. Of the Preparation of Things Necessary; Lenity and Continence preserve, Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, Cruelty and Avarice destroy both Prince and People.</head>
               <p>BUt principally endeavor to avoid (that to which our Ancestors were often necessitated through the want of Treasure and continuance of Wars) the Levying of Taxes; and that this neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity may not fall upon you, make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion long before (for even good men are deaf to the sound of Taxes) and when you attempt any thing, lose no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage by expectation or delay of time; a short time is long to the unprepared, for a Day or an hour, without Providence, oft produceth great mischief; but a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain time (for the execution of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions is not like that of Sacrifice) to be prefixed.</p>
               <p>If necessity shall at any time impose upon you, be careful to make all men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, they must yield to it for the common safty; and whosoever would be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48543:21"/>
and Govern well, must have his stores filled with all necessaries for his defence. What those things are, and how to be provided, the nature of the Times, and situation of your Kingdom will make ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to your reason.</p>
               <p>Let it be your Maxim always to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to Lenity and Equity, that your own people in your troubles may be as willing as able to assist you; for if once their Affections be alienated from you, you will soon find them animated against you.</p>
               <p>When I led our Army into <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and the King of <hi>Partha</hi>'s Son had past over <hi>Euphrates</hi> with great Forces, I found the affections of our Allies wavering and in suspence, through expectation of Innovation. For their Auxiliaries, through the oppression and injuries of our Governors, were either rendred weak and could not much assist us, or were so alienated from us, that we could neither expect any thing from them, nor trust them.</p>
               <p>But in the execution of all publick affairs, even the least suspicion of Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48543:22"/>
is chiefly to be avoided. I could wish (said <hi>Pontius Samnis</hi>) that I had been born, and Fortune had reserved me for those times, when <hi>Rome</hi> began first to accept Bribes; for I should then soon have stopt their progress to the Empire. He needed not to expect many Ages, for that mischief hath now seised on the Commonwealth, and therefore I could more easily admit <hi>Pontius</hi> to have had that power at that time then now.</p>
               <p>No Vice therefore is more destructive to Government, then Avarice in Princes; for to make their power mercenary, is not only Vile, but Impious; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what <hi>Apollo Pythius</hi> gave as Oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar (that <hi>Sparta</hi> could not be ruined by any force but Avarice) seems to be a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, not only to the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> but to all opulent people; nor can Princes acquire the good-will of their people by any means more easily, then by Continence and abstaining from this Vice.</p>
               <p>Such as would preserve the Weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick must be far from that kind of Munificence, which takes from some, to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48543:22"/>
bestow on others; for this sort of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bounty, the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Lysander</hi> (one of their <hi>Ephori</hi>) and (which put never before hapned among them) to death <hi>Agis</hi> their King; and from that time, such dissentions follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Tyrants started up, extirpated the Nobility, and that so famously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Republick fell to ruine; nor did it fall alone, but the Contagion of their miseries diffusing it self, destroyed all <hi>Greece.</hi>

               <p>King <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> notably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends his son <hi>Alexander,</hi> for insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himself into the affections of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48543:23"/>
                  <hi>Macedonians</hi> by his excessive bounty. What (a mischief said he) can induce thee to believe, that those will prove Faithful to thee, whom thou corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test with Mony? Do you intend the <hi>Macedonians</hi> should account you not their King but Purs-bearer and Servant. (He said well, that the title of Servant and Purs-bearer did ill become a King, but better, that such a sort of bounty was Corruption) For he is made worse who receives it, and is still more ready to expect it. This to his son, but it may be a precept to All; for it is a great mischief when that which should be effected by Virtue, is attempted by mony.</p>
               <p>Yet did not <hi>Philip</hi> deal so with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rainers, for he forced open the Gates of Cities, and overthrew Kings (his Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators) with Bribes; alledging that all Strong Holds might be taken, into which an Ass laden with Gold could enter. <hi>Aristotle</hi> gravely and justly reprehends that profusion which is made to captate the multitude with vast loss and infinite cost, especially when neither necessity
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48543:23"/>
requires it, nor Honor is encreased; nor doth this sort of daubing last long, but so soon as the satisfaction of it is vanish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the memory of the Pleasure dyes with it; and (as he likewise well col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects) this may be grateful to women, children, and servants, but when weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by sober and serious men, it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be approved.</p>
               <p>The expences on Walls, Ships, Ports, Aquaducts, and such things as tend to Publick benefit, are much more honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; as likewise to redeem Captives, and assist necessitous persons, which to have been done frequently by our Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, copiously appears by the Oration of <hi>Crassus.</hi> I therefore prefer this Custom of Bounty before that profusion of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natives: This becomes great and wise men, that flatterers of the people, and such as caress the Levity of the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with pleasures, but you must not always be alike affected in different oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions; for his case who is oppressed by calamity, differs from anothers who seeks your bounty, not urged by necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Let your Liberality incline more to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48543:24"/>
those in distress, unless they appear to deserve their misery.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cyrus</hi> is worthy your imitation, who bestowed honors and rewards on such as designed things great and honorable, by which he raised an ardor of Glory in the minds of All, every man being studious and industrious to excell in such things as the Prince approved.</p>
               <p>To excel in this kind of Liberality is Kingly, though not to be admired in <hi>Cyrus</hi> for that he was very wealthy, but that in these Offices the Prince should contend with the subject with so much honor and civility was no small wonder to <hi>Xenophon.</hi> But this he practised from his Grandfathers Discipline and advice, that neither his Treasure should be exhausted by extravagant gifts, nor incitements to Virtue and Obedience be wanting, because it is not an easie thing to be always giving; neither would he that the Honors which the King confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (as Bracelets, Collars, and Bridles of Gold, which among the <hi>Persians</hi> none could wear, but such as received them from the King) should be made common.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:48543:24"/>It certainly mainly concerns you to preserve the Rewards of Virtue and service, Sacred and unsullied; not to be conferred on Vitious and loose Persons, or made cheap by men of mean deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings; for men will be less studious of Virtue when the Rewards of it are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>based, and such as have received Honor for their brave Actions when they see unworthy men alike honored, think themselves lesned.</p>
               <p>Keep always a Memory and esteem of good services; nor at any time discover in your self either a want of will, or not to have the Power to reward, for you ought not only to have a value for the well-deserving, but not to suffer them to be necessitated to sue for their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, difficulty in that kind being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable; nor is it just to confine the memory of a benefit to a time or a day, or to defer the acknowledgment, but rather hasten it, lest you lose the fruit of your Bounty and the thanks; and this is chiefly to be observed, if you are to bestow any thing on the less impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate and modest persons; for it is
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48543:25"/>
grievous to a modest man to be put to importune him of whom he hath well deserved, lest he may rather seem to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act then desire it, as the Hire rather, not the Reward of his service.</p>
               <p>If those who have well merited, are of that Quality, that their Memory should be transmitted to posterity, to such you must not be ingrateful; for all mankind detest those who forget bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits received, and you will have use not only of the esteem and judgments of men now alive, but of those who shall come after, although their judgments will be more sincere, as free from malice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction.</p>
               <p>Be courteous, not only to those who may seem to deserve it, but to others, that All, according to their quality may have respect.</p>
               <p>Give no countenance to men too co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous of Mony or Honors, and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate in their desires, which no prey, unjustly gotten, can allay, but rather augment and inflame; so that they should rather be punished then admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</p>

               <p>TO all Arts we are to add that, which we call common Prudence, of which every man who is to govern any design is to have his share. In a Prince is requisite the knowledge of opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties proper for Action, for all affairs are managed by Authority, Judgment, and Counsel, which is to be taken from the Matter, Person, and Time, and to be governed (like a Ship in its steerage and course) after the condition of the Commonwealth, since you are not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to adhere to the same Opinion and Reason, but such as the State of Things, Inclination of the Times, and Rule of Concord will admit. In great Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Revolution of Affairs and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48543:26"/>
yield rather to the Times then Customes; yet still have an eye to the main end, <hi>viz.</hi> Religion and the safty of the people.</p>
               <p>This is <hi>Plato</hi>

                  </gap>s Rule (whom, I confess, I zealously follow) Contend for so much in the Republick as may be justified to your Countrimen; for you must not impose violently either on your Parents or your Country, and this he professeth to be the cause why he would never be concerned in the Commonwealth; for finding the <hi>Athenian</hi> State almost doat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their long continuance, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they would neither be perswaded, nor compelled to any better Rule of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and when they could not be perswaded, he did not conceive it Just they should be compelled.</p>
               <p>By this you may perceive the Power of Times, the great Variety of Things, how incertain their events, and how flexible the will of men; ponder there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with your self the snares and Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties incident to Life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cato,</hi> though of excellent inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and greatest integrity, did some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48543:27"/>
hurt the Commonwealth; for he always gave his Opinion, not as in the corrupt constitution of <hi>Romulus,</hi> but in the polite Commonwealth of <hi>Plato,</hi> and pleading too pertinaciously, for the (too parcimonious) expence and Institutions of our Ancestors, alienated the Equestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Order, and the most eminent persons from the Senate.</p>
               <p>It is the duty of every Senator, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor (as much as in him lies) that no eminent or powerful person be displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with the Prince or his Counsel; and though he be an enemy in the highest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to any particular man, yet this ought to be observed for the common good.</p>
               <p>Concerning Priviledges and Honors it is mainly to be considered, that they be not injuriously impaired; it hath been ruinous to many, who have disgusted such as have been eminent in Wisdom, Power, or Military Virtue. For it is more grievous to be divested of Honors, then not to be advanced in dignity, and the sting of lost liberty wounds deeper then perpetual servitude. A man unacquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>MAke it your care never to let your Ears be open to Flatterers; it was <hi>Pompey's</hi> error, who, though he saw all our dangers involved with his own, adhered to the Counsels of certain inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced and imprudent men.</p>
               <p>Do nothing that may create opinion that you hate Truth, or will exercise your displeasure and malice on such as advise Honestly; for this is poison to faithful Counsellors, nourisheth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites the wicked and perfidious, gives temptation to obsequious Humor, which indulging to error, precipitates many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ruine.</p>
               <p>But the greatest Mischief to such as despise Truth, and are drawn into snares
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48543:32"/>
by compliance, is, that they are most commonly apt to flatter themselves and most delighted with it. Virtue indeed is a Lover of her self, and as she is Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, so she knows best and understands her self. But I speak not here of Virtue, but of the Opinion of Virtue; for many men would rather seem Virtuous, then be really endued with Virtue, and these are pleased with Flattery, and a speech composed to their inclinations, makes them believe that vain Oratory to be a real testimony of their Worth; this therefore is rather pernicious then duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, when the one is neither willing to hear Truth, nor the other prepared to speak it.</p>
               <p>But this is certain, when a Princes Ears are so shut up against Truth, that they cannot hear it, his ruine is hardly to be avoided.</p>

               <p>LEt your deportment be constant and Grave, which not only resists Flattery, but removes the suspition.</p>
               <p>For you are to imitate a wise Judge, who avoids offence by the Equity of his Decrees, and acquires the good will of all men by his patience in hearing, and care to give just satisfaction. Briefly, be so circumspect both in your life and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that there remain not the lest suspition of Sloth or Levity; commit no Act may make you seem Timorous or Effeminate.</p>
               <p>If any thing happen worthy of your Fear, dissemble it; use present cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Counsel, and quit not your Reason. This was a Maxim frequently practised in our Republick, most emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently in the second Punick War; when after the misfortune at <hi>Cannae,</hi> they as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed greater Courage then before that
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48543:33"/>
Victory of the enemy; no signs of Fear, no mention of Peace, for it is dishonor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a Prince to submit his Courage to any danger.</p>
               <p>As in the steps of a Ladder, if you take away some, cut other, and leave the rest, ill put together, you prepare an instrument to fall down and not to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend; so in the distresses of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, if you desert her, when dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted, nor shew your self Active to confirm your peoples safty, and resolve to remove the danger, you will be so far from recovering what is lost, as you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate a total ruine.</p>
               <p>Be careful in all things that may be foreseen by Counsel, and when there is an error of Judgment, amend it by your diligence. I saw <hi>Pompey</hi> on the 14 of the Calends of <hi>Febr.</hi> full of fear; on that day I foresaw his ruine, after that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pleased me, but perpetually commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted errors; he neither had Courage nor Counsel, Forces nor Conduct. Not to mention that base Flight from the Citie, timorous Orations to the people, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance not only of his Adversaries, but
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48543:33"/>
of his own Forces; to be short, he had nothing good left to him but the Cause, which was that only wanting on <hi>Caesars</hi> side, who excelled in all other things, as vigilancy, expedition, diligence, of which had our General made use, we had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Commonwealth.</p>
               <p>As (if placed in this degree of Honor) I would not be of a low dejected spirit in adversity; so neither would I want the common sense of Nature. For this hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the minde is (like that of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which when burn'd, grows insensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) rather stupidity then courage or Magnanimity.

               <p>For when by the Authority of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate I was enjoyned to have a care of the safty and preservation of that <note n="*" place="margin">King of <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> whose father was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by his subjects.</note> King, with this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that his welfare was of great concern to the people and Senate (which was never before decreed by our order concerning a King) I car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Senates Decree to him, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the conspiracies, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be on foot against his life and Authority; I advised him to use all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to preserve himself, and withall encouraged those who where tryed friends to his Father, whose sad mis-for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, was a Document to them, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him with all their strength and care; and I gave him this Rule, that he should begin to govern by securing his own life and power, such as he found engaged in designs against him, on them to exercise the Authority of a King, to punish some when he saw a necessity, and to free the rest from the fear of it;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48543:35"/>
that he should make use of the Force of my Army rather to terrifie, then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with the guilty, and by these means I freed him from those conspiracies, and so not only rendred him safe, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that he should reign with Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>The safty of the Prince is the peoples safty, and commonly on his single life depends the preservation of All.</p>
               <p>Nothing therefore is more necessary, then to have good stores of Armes, by which you may secure your self, defie the insolent, and be revenged when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked; as likewise to have ships in your harbors, to secure your Coasts in the Provinces.

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48543:38"/>
by tranquillity you may with an equal Temper keep your Dignity; for nothing more becomes a Great man, then Gentleness and Clemency.</p>
               <p>It is hard to express how much Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and Affability gaines on mens affections; there are extant <hi>Philips</hi> Epistles to <hi>Alexander, Antipaters</hi> to <hi>Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander,</hi> and those of <hi>Antigonus</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi> (three of the most prudent, we read of in <hi>Greece</hi>) wherein they advise to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the minds of the multitude by cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and civil language, and speaking kindly to the souldiery.</p>
               <p>And this ought to be your practice, if you will remember how considerable a thing it is to preserve in Publick the Person of a Prince, which must not only satisfie the minds, but the eyes and ears of his subjects, That his Nature may not seem harsh, his Access difficult, his countenance severe, his answers insolent, and his deportment proud.</p>
               <p>Keep up the greatness of your minde with Gentleness and civility; and if your passion be moved by such as intrude into your presence, unseasonably, or petition
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48543:38"/>
impudently, suffer not your self to be transported into an odious and useless Morosity, and at length to be perswad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into better humor, through the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of recovering your good Temper by such as never read of <hi>Xenophons Cyrus,</hi> or <hi>Agesilaus</hi>; from which Kings, no man ever heard an harsh word; contrary to the practice of other barbarous Princes, who give their commands thus, Observe and obey my Orders, and if you ask a question, return these Threats, If I see you here again you die for it, which things as they are abhorred in the very reading, so much more in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
               <p>Avoid all sudden Passion, ill Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and contumely, which as they are abhorrent from common civility, so are they altogether disagreeable to the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power of a Prince; for if your Anger be implacable, it degenerates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cruelty, if you quickly relent, it's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Levity, which notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is to be preferred to the other. What can appear more ugly then <hi>Homers Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi> or <hi>Agamemnons</hi> quarrels? For <hi>Ajax</hi>

               <p>Nothing appears so ugly as cruelty joyned with power, neither doth any thing more incense or scandalize the minds of men, then when Revenge is equalled to injuries; for dishonor hath a kinde of sting, which modest and good men can ill endure, much less the Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Insolent, of a proud and mutable disposition.</p>

               <head>CHAP. 21. Of the Charge, Duties and Studies of a Prince, and wherein they consist.</head>
               <p>ALL Governors ought to observe two precepts given by <hi>Plato.</hi> First so to be careful of the Publick benefit, that all their Actions may have respect to that, without thought of their own
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48543:39"/>
commodity. Next that they so consider the whole body of the Kingdom, as not to protect one part and neglect the rest. For while they consult for the benefit of one party, and regard not the other, Discord (which is destruction to both) ensueth. Hence springeth not only se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, but the Plague of Civil War, which a wise and worthy Prince will flie and detest, and wholly apply himself to the good of all. His first care will be to preserve every one in his right by Law, Justice, not to suffer those of a low condition (for that reason) to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; nor with envy to disturb the rich in the possession of their wealth. To me it seems most reasonable, that such as are in Authority, should endeavor to make all happy who are under their command, to suppress seditions, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, oppressions and murthers; to remove that cruel Minister of Avarice and Ambition, Calumny from the Fame, Fortune, and Quiet of the Wealthy. To be careful that Taxes and publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions be equally born. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide that the Publick suffer not by debts.
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48543:40"/>
To be easie of Access, and ready to hear all Complaints. Not to suffer that any mans Poverty or want of Friends should exclude him, not only from a Publick but private Address; and lastly that in the whole Kingdom nothing seem cruel or grievous, but all full of clemency, mildeness, and humanity.</p>
               <p>Make this your Rule, that whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you come men may believe that light and happiness appears with you. Nor let this be your sole Act, but see it be done by all your Ministers and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, for what can be more to your Honor, or more desirable, then not to see the people terrified in your Progress, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted by your expence, or troubled at your presence, but rather a Publick and Private Joy wheresoever you come, and when every Town seems to entertain a Guardian, not a Tyrant; not an Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor, but a welcome Guest.</p>

               <p>NOthing contributes more to the establishment and preservation of a King, then to be beloved; nothing more to his destruction, then to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as <hi>Ennius</hi> said very well, whom men fear they hate, and whom they hate they desire to destroy; but an universal ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred no power can resist, a Maxime lately made manifest, if not formerly known.</p>
               <p>Fear is a very ill maintainer of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, but goodwill a faithful guard to perpetuity: And how happy they are that desire to be feared, <hi>Dionysius</hi> the Tyrant is a famous example, for when one of his Flatterers in discourse, cryed up the strength, power, and Majesty of his Kingdom; the abundance of his wealth, and Magnificence of his Palaces, denying any man to have been more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py.
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48543:41"/>
Wilt thou then <hi>Damocles</hi> (said he) since this sort of life is so pleasing to thee, once taste it &amp; try my Fortune? To which <hi>Damocles</hi> assenting, he was placed in a rich Chair of State, upon the most costly and magnificent Carpets, and many Cupboards filled with the statliest and richest Gold and Silver Plate, and round the Table Boys of the choicest Beauty commanded to wait, and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently to observe his Nod; nor were there wanting Crowns, richest Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guents and sweetest Odours, with all variety of dainties on the Table. <hi>Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> hitherto thinking himself very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, till looking upward he saw a bright sword let down from the Ceiling, and hanging only by a horses hair directly over his head, so that terrified with this apparition, he neither looked more on his beautiful Attendants, nor the furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Plate; nor moved his hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Table, and now even his Crown was too heavy, till at length he begged of the Tyrant that he might be released, for that he had no desire, now, to be happy. By this it appears that <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysius</hi>
                  <pb n="73" facs="tcp:48543:41"/>
thought no man happy, who had any thing of terror hanging over him; nor was it at all safe for him to return to Justice and restore their Laws and liberty to his people; for he so far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled himself in errors in his youth, that he could never be secure if once he began to be sober; in his latter time he wanted all necessaries, lived with Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and barbarous people, believed no man to be his friend, who was either worthy of liberty or did affect it, but feared all; for such as desire to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must of necessity fear those to whom they are a terror; neither can any pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Empire be so great, as to be dure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, when surrounded with fear; of this we our selves are presidents, who having oppressed and ruined Forain Nations, were invaded by Civil Wars, by which the Walls only of our City are left standing, and even those in apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of extreamest mischief; but having almost lost the name of a Republick, we fell into these miseries, while we chose rather to be feared then to be desired or beloved.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:48543:42"/>But nothing confers more to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, then to provide that the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Prince may not be violated, or his Authority brought into common hatred; for the very name of Empire is of great weight, and in light persons is a terror; for that being put into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they abuse their Masters name, and mix their sordidness with the splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Prince.</p>
               <p>Let the person whom you place in Authority, be a Minister, not of his own but your Clemency, and let him always carry his Axes and Rods as greater En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of his Dignity then Power. Make it appear to your whole Kingdom, that the common Safty, their Children, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and Fortune are dearest to you.</p>
               <p>Lastly take this as a Maxim, That not only those who receive any thing basely, but such as give it shall be odious to you when it comes to your know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; for then no man will receive or give a Bribe, when it is known that the Ministers of a Prince, and the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates are so concern'd for their Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and that this Law cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed,

Be likewise careful not to permit any thing injurious, or of a sordid nature to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated from you by such as pretend to have power about you; but this is not offered as an Advice that you should be harsh to your servants or suspitious; but cautious in believing, and diligent in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving what they possess, be honestly gotten without the imputation of odious or dishonest gain, and let them rather make use of your Liberality then their own Liberty. Neither is it advised (since these inclinations now tend only to too much levity, and less dangerous ambition) that you should be too scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous into all miscarriages, and so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly shake off every man, but to trust nothing to such as follow all ways of mony, and do all things for monies sake.</p>

care that not only those who are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Honors, Command, and Power, but such as have the Government of your Forts and Garrisons, should wholly and immediately depend on you; and let this be a Maxim in State, to meet all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, and break all hopes (of Insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection) for prevention of their Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, who either design or aspire to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent power or Force.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By taking Progress at certain times about your Provinces, you may suppress injuries, insolencies, wicked designs, and give timely relief to those parts of your Empire, which are prompt to lapse into distempers, by which you may make your Remedy stronger then the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease; for those parts which are remotest from the Princes eye, are to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with greater care, secured with stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Guards, and looked into with clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er lights, because all things may fall into change, before they can (by reason of distance) be well heard. But in the seat of the Empire, in view of the Prince nothing can subsist which may not be extinguished and suppressed soon as it
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48543:44"/>
springs up or appears; nor can the great ones and prime Ministers so easily violate their inferiors, or spoil the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, as in remoter Provinces, where commonly such as are oppressed are in that condition, that they cannot so much complain of their Grievances.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the mean time since the people hold all their Benefits, Rights and Safty by the Laws, be so just and careful, as not to recede from them. For all things should be governed and administred by Law, as by the soul (of a Kingdom.)

               <head>CHAP. 24. Of Prudence in extreme affairs; several cautions concerning Forainers.</head>
               <p n="1">1. BUt you are not wholly to apply your self to Domestick Affairs; the State, Inclinations, Force, Leagues, Contracts and Counsels of Forainers, are likewise to be considered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be chiefly circumspect, that none about you be corrupted by them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray their Trust and your Counsel to them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That no impressions of Disaffecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards you be made in your Allies.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That their Forces raised upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretences, be not suddenly turned against you.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It will much confer to your Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur to understand what esteem other Kings or Nations, your enemies or Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies have of your Person, Government, State and Power. For that in matters of that high nature, men either despise or fear, hate or love, and are moved no
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48543:45"/>
less by opinion of Fame, then by certain reason.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Keep a strict Amity with such as either by ancient friendship, good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, dangers, or leagues have been allyed to you.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Be Just, not only to these, but to others; suffer not your people to do any rude, barbarous, or injurious Act to Forainers, lest something should be done contrary to the Laws of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Leave what belongs to Dogs, to fawn on Domestickes, and bark at Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p n="9">9. They are very unadvised, who exclude Forainers from their Cities, for it injures the common Society of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde.</p>
               <p n="10">10. By no means admit those (to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity) who come as spies, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise decline their duty, which is only to follow their own private affairs, or to be little curious in another Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p n="11">11. As little as may be, mix not your interest with the quarrels of your neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48543:45"/>
but consult for the Peace of your Successors.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Trouble not the Foundation of their Quiet, lest you raise in them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to seek your Ruine and destroy your friends. For those things which perhaps we little apprehend to be of consequence; as that in peace we make use of the most wealthy Citizens (that they have neighboring and remote, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plantations, to which they can make easie voyages, wherein they chearfully follow their business, whence they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn partly with supplies of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and honest gain; partly with other negotiations of setling their Seats and Families) are of no small Advantage to the Prince and people, to have so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable numbers of their Country to be imployed abroad in so honest and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial affairs.</p>
               <p n="13">13. If any offence be given by your Subjects, whether through the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or perversness of Allies, shew all readiness to expiate the injury, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiously observe on your part, all that relates to you.</p>
               <p n="14">
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:48543:46"/>14. Be careful to keep the Seas free from Pirats, and safe for Navigation.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The Forts and Garrisons of your Kingdom always in good condition.</p>
               <p n="16">16. Your Navy in good order.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Preserve your Merchants and Husbandmen, not only from Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but even from the fear of it.</p>
               <p n="18">18. For in other things when any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity happens, there is (indeed) a loss received, but in Husbandry and Imposts not only what mischief happens, but even the apprehension of it, brings ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity. For when the enemies forces are not far off, though they make no ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, yet they leave their Cattle, quit their Tillage, all Traffick ceaseth, and by the sole rumor of danger, and fear of a War, a whole years profit is lost.</p>
               <p n="19">19. Never suffer Forainers to abuse your Merchants, whose Estates and Fortunes should be in your strictest care to preserve. For the destruction of a number of Citizens cannot be separate from the whole Republick; for when in a City, Province, or Kingdom, many
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48543:46"/>
suffer in their Estates, and Fortunes, they must of necessity draw with them many more into the same misfortune.</p>
               <p n="20">20. From this danger the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is to be secur'd, and you are to use all study and industry, by which your own and your Kingdoms honor, the safty of your subjects, with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, may be preserved, defended and augmented.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Add to this, that nothing more becomes a Prince, nothing more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nothing more munificent then to aide the oppressed, to restore them to safty, and free them from danger (though I confess it a difficult part to assume the care of other mens concerns) it being not only very profitable, but may be (if you expect any thing of advantage) the means to obtain it.</p>
               <p n="22">22. Let nothing seem too much in time of danger; but it is not then to be cautious in words. For most men are more apt to fear then to be mindful of their duty, and I know not whether they appear not more easily kind in their fear, then grateful after Victory.</p>
               <p n="23">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48543:47"/>23. If according to League, aid is to be desired, their Defence and your Duty in that particular must not be omitted, for Leagues are things Sacred, and a Kingdoms chief support is its honor and the kindness of its Allies; upon which Maxim (not provoked by any injurie to themselves) our Ancestors made war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Antiochus, Philip,</hi> the <hi>Etolians</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> for their Allies. Nothing therefore can be a greater blemish to your Honor, then when you (who have the esteem of being able to defend, even those who are almost strangers to your Friendship) shall not be capable to assist your Confederates.</p>
               <p n="24">24. If your necessities force you to seek aid from Allies, let it not appear that your people are to be secured, rather by the benefit of their Aid, then your own Valour and Power.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Beware lest among other mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, either Auxiliary Soldiers or your enemies think your troubles to be their opportunitie, as the <hi>Roman</hi> people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the defence of their Allies, pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed themselves of all their lands, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48543:47"/>
when Conquerors gave and took from Kings and Confederates what they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
               <p n="26">26. A Prince ought chiefly to look to the conservation of the Rules of War; for since there are two kinds of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one by Dispute (in Treaty) and another by Force; and the first proper to Mankind, the last likewise common to Beasts; if you cannot make right use of the first, you must have recourse to the second.</p>
               <p n="27">27. Wherefore War is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to the end you may live in Peace, and after Victory such are to be preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as have not been cruel or barbarous in the War; and you are not only to provide for those whom you have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered by force; but likewise for those who laying down Arms, flie to your Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, even when you have stormed their Walls.
