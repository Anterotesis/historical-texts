         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord and Gentlemen,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAving ſpent ſome time in looking over the hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of Nations, our own Records, and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, with ſeverall other works of Statiſts, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litians Lawyers, I found that ſaying truly verified of <hi>Solomon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In much wiſdome is much grief, and he that increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth knowledge increaſeth ſorrow</hi>; and what he afterward concludes of all his own works and labour, I obſerved to be moſt true in them, touching Polities and civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <hi>Behold all was vanity and vexation of ſpirit, and there was no profit under the ſun.</hi> For indeed men have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and written either in reference to Princes, to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor and pleaſe their luſts and will, or like the unwiſe builder (the blind leading the blind) have built upon the ſand, upon unſound bottomes and falſe principles. And therefore as Chriſt in the controverſie betweene him and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> touching divorce, ſends them back to the originall and firſt inſtitution of marriage, and to the Fathers of the firſt age of the world, as being the firſt and beſt pattern; and <hi>Paul</hi> to reform the abuſes in the Lords Supper, cals them <hi>Corinthians</hi> to the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. So there is no better way to have a Common-wealth
<pb facs="tcp:56574:3"/>
ſetled in peace and righteouſneſſe, then to look back at the beginning, when men walked by the exact and even rules of equity, juſtice, conſcience, and kept the clear and plain principles of reaſon and nature: this is the <hi>Land-meaſure</hi> and <hi>Standard</hi> whereby the faulty meaſures coming after are to be corrected and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>How this light firſt came to be leſſ'ned, and then by degrees afterwards upon the matter quite extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſome Kingdomes, and darkneſſe to break in, as Soveraignities, Monarchies, Kings prerogatives, arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power, regal immunities, Crownes hereditary and ſucceſſive, &amp;c. (all bloody and black Characters of Tyrants and conqueſt) it is eaſie to be ſeen, and I ſhall ſhortly (by the good hand of God aſſiſting me) give you and the whole Nation good ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>In the mean time I have thought good to publiſh this ſmall <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> and howſoever I queſtion not, but your preſent work and way is clear to you, yet to the nation generally it may ſerve in ſome good ſtead, as to ſatisfie the weaker, confirm the ſtronger, informe the ignorant, and leave the wilfull and obſtinate without excuſe.</p>
            <p>For the man with whom I deal, I have nothing here to ſay, neither indeed would I have ſayd any thing to his work, conſidering what for a man he is, but that I perceived it was in the mouth of ſome, much cried up, people it ſeemes, that are not able to put a diſtinction between wind and words, nor know any difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween rayling and reaſon.</p>
            <p>And now my <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> upon you at the preſent is the eye of the nation: you are as a city ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a hil, all Kingdoms about us, are looking on you, and
<pb facs="tcp:56574:3"/>
great things are hoped for, and exſpected from you, and this I muſt needs tell you, the cauſe of Chriſt lies much now upon your actings, if you doe the worke of the Lord negligently, unfaithfully, fearfully, oh my bowels doe yearn, and I tremble to think what diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor will come to Gods great name, what ſcandal and proach to the glorious Goſpel, what ſadnes and ſorrow too the ſoules of the righteous, and what tryumph and joy there will be in the tents of wicked men. But I hope better things of you, though I thus ſpeak, I need not tell you how much you have ſeen of God, and how his powerfull preſence hath gone all along with you to this preſent time, neither need I tell you by what a ſtrong arm and a ſtrange providence you have beene brought up to this work. But if you ſhould now ask of me (as the young man did of Chriſt) what lack we yet? I would ſay, conſtancy and faithfulneſſe to the end will crown, not only this, but all your former actions.</p>
            <p>Methinks I could ſay more to you, then <hi>Mordecai</hi> did to <hi>Heſter, Who knowes whether thou art come to the Kingdom for ſuch a time as this</hi>? We know, (and bleſſed be God for it) the Lord hath made you his <hi>Iſraels</hi> Saviours, and by you hath wrought deliverance for his people, he hath put much glory already upon you, now therfore ſtand faſt, quit your ſelves like men, you have the prayers of the Saints with you and for you; and for the enemies their defence is departed from them; and the Lord is with you, fear them not.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is ſhort, I ſhall not make too large a foreſpeech: I well remember your expreſſion in the <hi>Remonſtrance, calling upon every man to contribute what help he can</hi>; and truly there is all the reaſon in the world for it, that every one now ſhould lay himſelf out to
<pb facs="tcp:56574:4"/>
further ſo honorable and good a work. And for my part according to the ſmall portion I have received I ſhall not be wanting in your vindication, but for the things by you propoſed, and your proſecuting of them; to wit, that the King may be brought to his tryal, the enemies of our peace puniſhed, hurtfull Laws nullified the peoples grievances and oppreſſions removed, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and liberty of conſcience (without danger to the State) granted, &amp; a better form of Government ſetled, as I ſhall undertake the juſt defence thereof, ſo I ſhall ſhortly make it more manifeſt to the whole nation, that there is nothing in all things deſired of you, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by you, but what is according to juſtice, reaſon, nature conſcience, and what the Lord himſelf doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and call for: In the mean time my prayer ſhall be for the bleſſing of God to be upon your labor, and his powerfull protection over your Perſons: Sirs I am</p>

            <p>Oh that Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> could take notice of the viſible and ſenceable reproof of God upon him, <hi>that blindneſſe hath happened to him in part, and profeſſing himſelf to be wiſe becomes a fool,</hi> if the thoughts of the ſnare which he is fallen into, lay upon his heart, he would give glory to God, and with <hi>Iob</hi> humbly ſay, <hi>behold

            <p>The <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> is as the reſt of the <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> invective and ſlanderous: Thus he begins, <hi>You drive furiouſly over the necks of KING and Parliament, Laws Covenants, Loyalty, Priviledges, and no humane thing can ſtand before you.</hi> Here <hi>Solomons</hi> words are verified, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 10.13. <hi>The beginning of the words of his mouth as fooliſhneſſe, and the end of his talke is miſchievous madneſſe.</hi> You found not any thing in the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> looking this way, but expreſſions often to the contrary, and were you as charitably minded towards His <hi>EXCELLENCY, and the Generall COUNCEL of WAR,</hi> as you are to the <hi>Malignant Party,</hi> you had ground ſufficient to judge otherwiſe: But howſoever God will ere long clear their innocency, and <hi>bring forth their righteouſneſſe as the light, and their judgement as the noon day,</hi> when by his gracious hand aſſiſting them, our Lawes, Liberties, and Priviledges ſhall be recovered, the which by <hi>KING</hi> and <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi> have been trodden under foot.</p>
            <p>But he tels them, <hi>The Lord is here upbraiding your unbelief</hi>: and after pag. 13. <hi>The Holy GOD will no longer ſuffer you to wear the name of Saints and godly, but will diſcover you to be white ſepulchres, and cauſe your rottenneſſe to come forth.</hi> But how may we know that the Lord hath called Mr. <hi>Will Sedgwick</hi> to this work, and that it is the ſpirit of Chriſt ſpeaking in him, and he the man appointed <hi>to poure contempt upon the Army,</hi> and <hi>to trample upon them as morter</hi>: Muſt we take it as granted, becauſe he ſayes it: What if the Army ſhould ſay in the words of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, And lo I perceived that God had not ſent him, but that he pronounced this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie againſt me, for</hi> Tobiah <hi>and</hi> Sanballat <hi>had hired him. Therefore was he hired that I ſhould be afrayd, and doe ſo, and ſin, and that they might have matter for an evill report, that they might reproach me. My God think thou upon</hi> Tobiah <hi>and</hi> Sanballat <hi>according to theſe their works, and on the Propheteſſe</hi> Noadiah <hi>and the reſt of the</hi> Prophets <hi>that would have put me in fear.</hi> Neh 6.12, 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Is there no ground for them to think, that the <hi>Malignant ſpirit</hi> drives on his old deſigne here in Mr. <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> namely, to have the <hi>Army disbanded</hi>: this hath been a long time ſought after, and ſeverall wayes attempted to effect it: But it ſeemes ſeeing all other meanes failes him, he now ſtudies to make the <hi>Army flye</hi> by a falſe propheſie, as if our <hi>worthy Nehemiah</hi> and the reſt, would give over the building through a needleſſe and fooliſh fear.</p>
            <p>And indeed they have all the reaſon in the world to think that God hath not ſent him: for the ſtatutes of the Lord are perfect, right, pure, clean, true, and righteous altogether: <hi>Out of the mouth of the moſt high proceedeth not evill and good.</hi> Where we find (as in his writing is abundance) contradiction, falſhood, flattery, the wicked juſtified, the righteous condemned, evill called good, and good evil, darkneſſe put for light, and light for darkneſſe, bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter, Goſple Truths and Ordinances are ſcorned and derided, &amp;c. there we may groundedly conclude, that ſuch a one was never thereto called of God.</p>
            <p>But it ſeemes here to be Mr. <hi>Sedgwicks</hi> caſe, as it once happined to <hi>Antonius,</hi> when he angled ſome dived under water, &amp; put fiſh upon his hook, which he caſt up and thought he had taken them. If I ſhould lay his fiſh together in a heap, a man would ſoon perceive by the kind who put them upon the hook. For inſtance, look
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56574:6"/>
here good Reader, out of what water is this fiſh taken, and what fiſh is it? ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to His <hi>EXCELLENCY</hi> and the <hi>Generall CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NCEL of WAR,</hi> he tels them, <hi>It pleaſes me to pour contempt upon you, to be ſhod with ſcorn and indignation, and ſo trample upon Princes as morter</hi>: If this be not the ſpirit of Antichriſt, then was it never in any man. But let us ſee how <hi>Pope-like</hi> he ſets his foot upon the neck of Princes: <hi>Deſtruction your practice, tis your work, tis your end, you cannot ſee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it, your faith underſtanding, God</hi> (may I uſe your own words pag. 22. you lie groſly) <hi>is ſunk into your bellyes, and your rule your ſtrength, your confidence is only in ſenſuall and brutiſh things, you act againſt God, and God againſt you, your ſoules loath him, and his ſoul loaths you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And of the whole Army he ſaith,
<q>Never were men caught in ſuch a ſnare of the devil as you are: you are true to nothing, neither God nor man: your wayes are beaſtly, cruel, abſurd, monſtrous: you continue in armes againſt command of God and men, you are a company of deceivers and mountebancks, that talke of curing, ſaving, delivering, but all waſt, ſpoyl and deſtroy the people. You are gone from all principles of goodneſſe, from the Lord to the world: you are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come through blindneſſe and ignorance enemies to the ſpirit, you love not the life of Chriſt, you know not the mind of God, neither have any communion with God: Amongſt you is the greateſt enmity and malignity to the ſpirit of God, and the greateſt pride, hypocriſie, ſelf confidence, and ſpirituall wickedneſſe: you are manifeſtly guilty of the preſent oppreſſion upon the poor people, and the intollerable burden of Free-quarter, and unreaſonable taxes, you exſpect the King ſhould turn, not to God, but to your form of Religion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and cannot count any thing a change, but yeelding to your way, which if he ſhould, he ſhould be ſeven times more the childe of the devil. You are tugging and pulling down the Kingdom in pieces to ſatisfie your ſelf with dominion: you hope for nothing, but for deceit, falſhood and treacherie: you ſpeak evill, but cannot ſpeak good: you never ſpake any good of the King or any other but in ſcorn.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here is ſome of the fiſh which Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> hath caſt up: we need not to deſcribe them, they ſhew themſelves what they are, and the <hi>black lake</hi> out which they are taken. But is this Mr: <hi>Sedgwicks</hi> voice, oh poor man, truly I pitty thee; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever no <hi>Rabſhekeh, Iſhmaelite,</hi> or <hi>Shimei,</hi> could hardly have uttered greater ſlander and more falſhood, yet conſidering the temptation thou lyeſt under, and what a depth of deluſion God hath ſuffered thee to fall into, thou art rather to be pittied then puniſhed. <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangel durſt not bring againſt the devil a rayling accuſation; but you durſt raile at the people of God, and charge them with notorious untruths, but take heed, leſt the ſtrength of that prayer reach you. "Let the lying lips be put to ſilence which ſpeaks grievous things proudly and "contemptuouſly againſt the righteous. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.18. Becauſe I am willing that the Army ſhould take notice what Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> writes, as well for them, as againſt them: Thus he charitably expreſſeth himſelf at firſt: <hi>Your eternall ſtate is ſure, tis your preſent wandrings that are here condemned.</hi> Here is ſome comfort for you ſouldiers: but will he ſtand to this? not all, for preſently with the ſame mouth (not minding what he had ſaid) he puts them all out of Heaven, and out of all hope of ſalvation, and ſhuts them up in the bottomleſſe pit; and this with as much
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56574:7"/>
confidence and certainty, as if God had revealed to him what their future ſtate ſhould be: lets hear the ſentence againſt the Army. <hi>The Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points you a portion with hypocrites and unbeleevers, where ſhall be weeping &amp; kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing of teeth.</hi> Again, pag. 11. <hi>If you adhere to that you have propoſed, you forſake your own intereſt, and eſpouſe the devil, the God of this world, the deſtroyer, and will periſh with him.</hi> What their eternall ſalvation ſure, and yet may periſh with the devil? this is no true light, the Spirit of God witneſſeth otherwiſe. But again, pag. 18. <hi>You are curſing, dividing, and ſo are in the kingdome of darkneſſe, and of the devil</hi>: and often, <hi>You are no Saints.</hi> pag. 23.24. And in pag. 35. he paſſeth a finall doom, where he ſaith; "You are reſerved to be puniſht from the preſence of "the Lord, this is your ſecond death. As this vain and raſh judging of his, ſhewes by what ſpirit he is led, ſo it is not worth the anſwering; only it bewrayes great weakneſſe and darkneſſe in him, and that he is not himſelfe: For who but Mr. <hi>Sedg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> or a man under ſuch diſtempers, would write ſo vehemently as he hath don, againſt the Army (of which more in its place) for raſh judging of others, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as I dare clearly affirm, there is hardly a precedent of any one man that fell ſo fouly and groſly in this very thing as he himſelf hath done.</p>
            <q>Turpe est doctori cum culpa redarguat ipſi.</q>
            <p>For his perverting of the Scripture <hi>Phil</hi> 3.18.19. ſcandalouſly applying it to the Army, I mind it a thing in him neither new nor ſtrange: for the reſt of his works ſhew what a proper gift he hath to wreſt and abuſe the ſacred word of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet not to paſſe over the place altogether ſilent, there ſeemes to be ſomething here which is cloſe and hid: wherefore is <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.18 19. quoted, and commented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? it is to make the Army contemptible and odious: <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith <hi>many are enemies to the croſſe of Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> ergo, the Army. It was a cunning deviſe of <hi>Nero</hi> when he hurled the Chriſtians to dogs, ſeeing the maſtives would not touch them, to clad them in beares skin, to kindle the fury of the dogs that they might take them to be beaſts and not men. I will not ſay it is a ſtudied plot of Mr. <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> but outwardly he doth <hi>Nero like</hi>: he ſees there are no ſwords drawn againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Gods former power and preſence with them (howſoever he often jeeres at it) hath by this time convinced the enemie, ſo that he hath no minde unto any new ingagement: But what doth he now? ſeeing the maſtives will not touch them, he will clad them in beares skins, make them vile and odious, ſay, they are rebels, traitors, theeves, murderers, even the vileſt and worſt of men; and thus he will kindle the fury of the dogs, that is, have the Army to be taken not for men, but beaſts, and ſo they ſhall doe God good ſervice, whoſoever deſtroyes them. But this will not do it, nor help to bring about your propheſie.

            <p>Let us hear what followes. <hi>Tis not only men that ſuffer from your violence, but the Lord: You are gon ſo far in diſſolving the foundations of government that you reach to the Lord. Theſe miſerable broken powers are now the Lord.</hi> A man that wants diſtinction, thruſts all things confuſedly together.</p>
            <p>But to anſwer, Firſt, Is the puniſhing of bad Governours a diſſolving the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Government? doth a Phiſitian deſtroy the body by removing of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and filthy humors from it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:56574:7"/>Secondly, Howſoever there is no power but of God, yet may people change the kind of powers, nullifie ſome Lawes and Ordinances, and take others up; and not come neer the bowels of the Lord, neither act any thing that is unlawfull. It is an unqueſtionable truth, that <hi>Monarchy, Democratie,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocratie,</hi> are the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of God, each in is ſelf a lawfull form of Goverment: and it is as unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, that ſo the caſe may be, as the uſe of one may be laid aſide, and another ſet up, and God much ſeen and honoured in the change. In ſaying, theſe broken po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers are now the <hi>Lord:</hi> not the Lords power: we underſtand your phraſe, and your godding of all things, but it is a matter out of our way, and therefore I will not turn to it.</p>
            <p>Howſoever Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> in ſpeaking againſt the Army, his teeth are ſpeares, and arrowes, and his tongue a ſharp ſword, yet for the King and his party, th words of his mouth are ſmoother then butter, and ſofter then oyle: oh, he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to deal gently with the young man, and no marvail, he ſees much beauty in <hi>Abſolom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King and Parliament</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>cry unto God in their diſtreſſe</hi>: and quotes <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.16. to be the words of their prayer, and preſuming that he knowes the mind of God, peremptory concludes, that <hi>The Lord ownes them,</hi> and will hear "their cry and deliver them.</p>
            <p>Here Reader thou art given to underſtand, that by the Parliament he meanes ſuch Members as are now in the hand of Iuſtice for rayſing a new war, and other treacherous plots tending to the ruin of the whole Kingdome: the owning of the King and them, is as much to ſay, that God will countenance and juſtify all their falſhood, unfaithfulneſſe, murders, or what elſe it be that the Army hath to object and prove againſt them. But Mr. <hi>Sedgwicks propheſies</hi> are not yet received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us above Scripture. We beleeve in our hearts, and confeſſe with our mouths,
<q>Thou art of purer eyes then to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity. Thou art not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſſe, neither ſhall evil dwel with thee. Vain glorious fooles ſhall not ſtand in thy ſight, thou hateſt all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity: Thou wilt bring to perdition them that ſpeak a lye: The man of bloods and of deceits Iehovah doth abhor.</q>
What you lay to the <hi>Armies</hi> charge pag. 1. I know no man to whome the words more truly may be applyed then to your ſelf.
<q>In this work you manifeſtly ſhew, that you have deeply revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that after you had eſcaped the pollutions of the world, you are again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled therein and overcome: and with the dog returned to your own vomit: you have been exalted to heaven, and are brought down to hel.</q>
Doth it not bewray a man greatly fallen from God, and what he had is taken from him, even his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, largeneſſe, goodneſſe: having been formerly zealouſly earneſt againſt ſin, and a profeſſed enemy to all unrighteouſneſſe of men, ſhould afterward undertake to defend the groſſeſt and vileſt wickedneſſe, plead for it, yea, rail at ſuch, and reproach them as do appear againſt the ſame, that it may have a juſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign puniſhment. I hope the Lord by this meanes will open their eyes, whom you have bewitched, giving out that your ſelf is ſome great one, <hi>The great power of God.</hi> Truly unleſſe there be a ſtrong deluſion <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>the ſtrength of deluſion,</hi> or <hi>ſtrongeſt impreſſions of error</hi> faſtened upon their mindes: if there be not (I ſay) an infatuation and beſottedneſſe upon them, joyned with ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinacy
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56574:8"/>
and ſtiffeneſſe, that howſoever Mr. <hi>Sedgwicks</hi> doctrines are palpable er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and ſuch as may be felt, yet they will adhere to him, there is enough in this (we will not mention his other good works) to let them ſee, what he cals light, is darkneſſe it ſelf, and ſpeakes againſt the mind of God, as clear as the ſunne that ſhines at noon day: for that bold aſſertion <hi>God will deliver them,</hi> the time ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will ſhew it, but howſoever for you to be found an untrue ſpeaker, it is a thing now ſo common and uſuall with you, as it is not admired at, ſuch is the hand of God now againſt you.</p>
            <p>Having ended with the <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> we come now to the book, which hardly admits of any diviſion, or laying out into parts, becauſe the whole contains little elſe but bitter invectives and grievous accuſations againſt the <hi>Army</hi>; and howſoever there is ſcarce a leaf but ſome charges or other againſt the <hi>Army</hi> are in it, yet all is one thing often repeated.</p>
            <p>The matter of charge in one word is <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> that His <hi>EXCELLENCY</hi> and the <hi>General Councel of War</hi> in their preſent acting are deeply revolted, with this he begins <hi>pag</hi> 1. But let us ſee the ground work upon which he builds, the reaſon wherefore he chargeth them with backſſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ding; it is becauſe the <hi>Army Remonſtrance</hi> cals for juſtice and judgment, to have the land purged of innocent blood, and that there may be ſuch a peace ſetled on earth amongſt men, as may be to the glory of God on high: at theſe propoſals he takes exception, blots much paper with foule aſperſions againſt the <hi>Army</hi> for framing them, ſeeks with great ſwelling words to affright them, and to hinder them from proſecuting ſo juſt and neceſſary a work. I confeſſe if the <hi>Army</hi> were turned <hi>Royaliſts,</hi> ſo baſely revolted as he acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf to be <hi>pag.</hi> 31. and were caſt back into ſuch blindneſſe, as to make "the "King glad with their wickedneſſe, and the Princes with their lies, as he doth, (to his ſhame be it ſpoken) they had no need (following ſuch a curſed principle) to carry forth the worke of the Lord any farther: but they dare not ſhew themſelves ſuch broken reedes, <hi>wandring ſtarres,</hi> light and unconſtant, neither frame their tongues to ſuch flattery, might they gain the whole world. Beſides it appeares by his writing, that outwardly he can be any thing, and every thing, apply himſelf e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very way, and ſo cares not what oppreſſions be laid upon mens perſons, ſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, nothing can reach him:
<q>But others truly fearing God, abhor ſuch crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wayes, and know that by the Law of God, nature, and nations, they are bound to ſeek freedome in a juſt and fair way for their bodies and ſouls: and therfore the <hi>apoſtacy</hi> fals on himſelf, and he is become like one of the foxes, in the Prophet, who hath ſeen a vain viſion, a lying divination, ſaying, the Lord ſaith, albeit he hath not ſpoken: with lies making ſad the hearts of the righteous, whom the Lord hath not made ſad; and ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way, promiſing him life.</q>
But mark, Mr. <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> what the Lord ſpeaketh concerning ſuch Prophets.
<q>My hand ſhall be upon the Prophets that ſee vanity &amp; divine lies, they ſhall not be in the aſſembly of my people, neither ſhal they be written in the writing of the houſe of Iſrael, neither ſhall they enter into the land of Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In pag. 2. having laid ſome diſgrace upon the <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> he proceedeth to <hi>ſhew them the evil, and folly of their principles, and with ſuch plainneſſe as the wiſe and ſoberer ſort of them ſhall be convinced, the reſt condemned in themſelves</hi>; and to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:56574:8"/>
ſatisfie the Readers expectation, he takes in hand, the firſt part of their preamble (as he cals it) which is the <hi>Armies tender regard to the freedome and liberty of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi>: his anſwer to it is this, <hi>that they deal deceitfully with the world, conceale their own principle, which is, that the powers of the world are to be broken, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is one of the powers of the world, and that they are called to break it in ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and upon this ground they know they act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Cocks feeding on garlick overcome others; but how? with rankneſſe of breath not ſtrength, If a man ſhould here fly, it muſt be for the ſmell, not the matter:</p>
            <p>For Firſt, It is untrue that they hold ſuch a Principle, neither do they act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the ground he mentioneth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Their former practiſe is a cleer proof to juſtify what they ſay, for had they not been tender this way, they might have prevented a great deal of their own ſufferings, and not been ſo long under ſeverall grievances.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, At this time there lay a neceſſity upon them to move, for otherwiſe they had not been faithfull to God for the power put into their hands, neither had anſwered the truſt of the people, who continually beſought them in all parts of the land to prevent their ſlavery and bondage which was ready to break in, and ſo all their former expences of blood and goods, vainly ſpent and waſted.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is ſo far from their thoughtt to break the power of Parliament, or to think they are called thereto, as their greateſt ſtudie and endeavour is, how the Parliaments Power may be beſt improved for the common good of the people, and every ones intereſt.</p>
            <p>Whereas in the Remonſtrance it is declared, that things are brought to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt <hi>Criſis</hi> of danger, and alſo ſhewed how, and by whom: his anſwer is, <hi>tis true but you make an ill uſe of it.</hi>
For the reſt, he tels us his dream of <q>two in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the one our life, and a wicked one, which is wrath.</q>
As there is nothing in it, ſo there needs no anſwer, onely becauſe I gueſſe what he would have ſaid, a word thus: The more we depend upon a wiſe Phiſitian, the more will we obſerve his directions, and be the carefuller to uſe what he preſcribeth: ſo every godly man the more his truſt and dependance is upon God, the more he will ſerve Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in the uſe of meanes, and not only the ordinary, but as the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> well notes it, upon Publike neceſſity or extremity goe further, yet ſo, as good cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be duly obſerved. This point is excellently ſet forth in the <hi>Remonſtrance, pag.</hi> 4.5.6. and Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> was ſo wiſe as ſeeing the ſtrength thereof, to let it alone.</p>
            <p>Next, he chargeth the <hi>Arme,</hi> with <hi>wofull feares,</hi> and why? becauſe they ſay the <hi>publick affaires cals upon every man to contribute what help he can.</hi> It doth not not alwayes argue fear to call for help in danger, neither is all fear ſimply unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. But his anſwer indeed is wofull. <q>Vain is the help of man: it is to offer help to a wicked world, ceaſe ye fooliſh men, &amp;c.</q> We have not onely precepts for the lawfulneſſe to call for others help, but the Saints in all ages have practiſed it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us: for howſoever mans help is vain reſted in, yet God gives in Power to the creature, whereby ſuccour and deliverance is obtained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Again the worſe the world is, the more need there is of help, that enormities and abuſes may redreſſed, and righteouſneſſe, truth, and peace reſtored. But Mr. <hi>Sedgwicke</hi> councell is if a man ſee his houſe a fire, not to move or ſeek to quench it, but leave it alone till
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56574:9"/>
it be burnt down to the ground: becauſe they ſay in the <hi>Remonſtrance, and ſeeing no effectuall help from elſe where to appear,</hi> he takes them ſharply up, <hi>your curſe is not to ſee when good comes, we ſee ſalvation is nigh, God a preſent help, &amp;c.</hi> and afterward (but ſomewhat cloſely) we have the ſalvation and help told us, what it is, to wit the <hi>Treaty.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, That which he cals <hi>good</hi> we know to be evil: it was as the <hi>forbidden fruit,</hi> pleaſant to the eye of ſome, and a thing to be deſired, but death went along with it: for the <hi>Treaty,</hi> we know the bottome of it, and its riſe, in what ſhop is was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the dependences upon it, the drift and ſcope thereof, namely to bring about a malignant plot, to deſtroy the uſefull power of Parliament, the right and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of the Subject, to exempt the Grand Incendiaties from puniſhment, to ſuppreſſe the free exerciſe of true Religion and power of Godlineſſe, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject mens conſciences to humane Ordinances. For the <hi>good</hi> therefore of the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> its only extended to him, and ſuch Royalliſts as ſhould enſlave themſelves to the will and luſt of Princes, as for conſciencious of men, it was to deprive them of peace, comfort, and ſafety.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Whereas he ſaith, <hi>You are blind and cannot ſee the Lord an effectuall Saviour.</hi> This is not ſo, for they doe ſee God to goe all along with them, and in every undertaking have large experience of his power and preſence.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, For the <hi>curſe</hi> you may take it home, it is <hi>yours</hi> not <hi>theirs,</hi> for were you not blind, you would ſee God, where he appeares, and powerfully ſhewes himſelf in his adminiſtrations, and not publiſh ſuch vain and ridiculous viſions concerning the King, as gives occaſion to ſome of laughter, to others of teares, and to all, of pit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying and bewayling your folly and blindneſſe: But I ſpare you.</p>
            <p>It followes in the Remonſtrance, <hi>In conſcience and duty to God and men, we hold our ſelves obliged, &amp;c.</hi> In anſwer to this he ſaith many words, the ſumme in ſhort is this, that <hi>they are not upon a ſure foundation, nor dare they come to a ſtrict examination of their own ground: kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w not which of theſe two to take, for their principal God or man,</hi> with ſeverall other reproaches.</p>
            <p>The beaſt <hi>Bonoſus</hi> not being able to defend himſelf with his horn, poyſoneth the dogs with his dung. Nothing have we yet met withall in his writing, but either unſavory meat, or ſwelling words, and large accuſations without proof.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Firſt, They are upon a ſound foundation, and for the ground of their undertaking this work, they did examine it, and find it to have a ſound bottome: not hurried blindly upon weak paſſions of fear, jealouſie, neceſſity, &amp;c. but grounded on a clear call from God and men. <hi>Have ye not read what</hi> David <hi>did when he was an hungred, and they that were with him</hi>? If <hi>David</hi> and his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in neceſſity, and to ſave their lives, did that which was not according to the letter of the Law. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.32.33. <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24.9. yet according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Law: for the Ceremoniall rites were to give place to moral precepts. Without all doubt, then in greater neceſſity and extremity, as when it is not only to ſave mens lives, liberties, priviledges, but Religion and the true worſhip of God: if men act not in ſome things according to the letter of humane law, yet the intent of the law is obſerved, which is the ſafety and good of the people. If a man have maliciouſly ſet his houſe on fire, I may lawfully break in and quench it, if I can; if not caſt it down: duty and conſcience puts me upon it (yea, though I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56574:9"/>
have no leave or permiſſion) if my ſelf and others otherwiſe ſhould ſuffer.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As we are <hi>to do good to them that hate us, love our enemies &amp;c.</hi> So alſo to endeavour that juſtice and judgment may be executed on evil doers, and ſo doing we are not the leſſe godly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What ſome of the Army have told him it comes not here into conſideration: nevertheleſſe, if nothing were told him but what he relates, there is nothing in it to the matter he brings it for.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is his miſtake to think that it is to <hi>decline the perfect way of Chriſt to go the waies of the Heathen</hi>: for ſo far as the Gentiles were righteous, juſt, ſober, faithful, we may and ought to walk the ſame way with them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Though we muſt live under law, ſubmit to Governours and be ſubject to them, nevertheleſſe we know that all Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours likewiſe are under the ſame law, and ſome lawes of men are prejudicial and hurtful to the people, and therefore when God by providence, puts in a fair opportunity for the ſuppreſſing of evil Magiſtrates, and redreſſe of bad laws, the mercie ſhould be improved with thankfulneſſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. For the example of <hi>Phinehas,</hi> you did well only to name it and let it paſſe: for indeed 'tis beyond your meaſure to take off the ſtrength of it. This we learn from it. 1. Zeal of juſtice in the cauſe of God, is a means to procure Gods mercy to man. 2. The Lord juſtifieth and rewards men, for the zeal of his glory, though in the carying on of the work there be ſome breach of rule or order: <hi>Phinehas</hi> was but a Prieſt's ſon, no ordinary Magiſtrate, nor proceeded he with the Malefactors judicially, neverthelſſe (carried forth by the mighty power and preſence of God) thruſt them through ſuddenly, and becauſe this might ſeem blame-worthy in the eyes of men, and might procure much il will, conſidering the perſons whom he killed, the man being a Prince in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the other a Princes daughter of <hi>Median:</hi> therefore God himſelf gives witneſſe, ſaying <hi>Phinehas hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my wrath away from the children of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>while he was zealous for my ſake among them, that I conſumed not the children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>in my jealouſie.</hi>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56574:10"/>In the laſt place, Reader thou art to take notice how Mr <hi>Sedgwick</hi> hath not yet forgotten his <hi>mother Romiſh tongue</hi>; I pray thee ask of him where he learn'd to ſay <hi>Saint Paul,</hi> what! Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> to ſpeak <hi>in the ſpeach of Aſhdod,</hi> not the Names of <hi>Baalim</hi> yet out of his mouth; I verily thought the power of God in the new Covenant had taught him to ſay <hi>Iſhi,</hi> no more <hi>Baali</hi>; we will therefore only leave out the word <hi>Saint,</hi> and <hi>Paul's</hi> words may wel be applied to him, <hi>you walk as a man,</hi> are you not carnal? Speaking in the <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> how that rule of, <hi>Salus populi ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma lex, is of all others moſt apt to be abuſed</hi>: he puts it off with a few bad words, calling them, <hi>a company of deceivers, and mountebanks,</hi> adding <hi>God is only the ſalvation of the people,</hi> the which thing how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever true, yet impertinatly brought in: unleſs he means that men ſhould neither eat, drink, labour, &amp;c. becauſe the Lord is their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Next he finds fault with them for <hi>two or three pages,</hi> telling them, <hi>you are triming your way to ſeek love</hi>; his anſwer to theſe 2. or 3. pages is, abuſing the words of <hi>Solomon Pro.</hi> 30.19, 20. to vent out a great deal of wrath and rage againſt the Army, <hi>you are gone from all ſolid principles of goodneſs</hi>: fly from one <hi>ſecret place to another to hide your ſelves from ſhame: you eat up King, Parliament and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſatisfie your carnal love of ſafety; while you think to make your ſelves more vendible, you make your ſelves more abominable</hi>: this is all, and what thinkeſt Reader, hath he not reached home to theſe otht other <hi>pages?</hi> A thing look'd upon under water, howbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it ſtreight, ſmooth and fair, yet ſtanding ſo it, ſeems crooked, rough, and deformed: So when a man looks upon another through the water of ill-wil and prejudice, his wiſdom ſhall be taken for folly, zeal for madneſs, ſincerity for hypocriſie, juſtice in him called cruelty, in a word, whatſoever he ſaies or does, <hi>ſpider-like</hi> it is turn'd to poiſon.</p>
            <p>Now follows <hi>No more Addreſſes to the King,</hi> and how the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament turn'd to the courſe of a <hi>Perſonal Treaty.</hi> Concerning this, Firſt he ſaith, <hi>You do in favour to your ſelves, abuſe the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in moſt things accuſe others of thoſe things that you your ſelves are guilty of</hi>: It is a full Charge; but where is his proof for this? how doth he make it good?

of falſe accuſers, <hi>but I ſhall leave that to ſome other pen</hi>: and why not the falſhood as wel?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas in the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> the inſtability of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſhewed, and the evil practices of the King's partie: Here he ſaith, they are <hi>too harſh and without any molifying oyl, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, 'tis cleer to every man that hath ſence, that Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> is not ſometimes at home to take an account of his own ſoul; he taxes the Army as <hi>over harſh</hi> &amp; <hi>too large</hi> in opening the faults of others, whereas, he (pitiful man) hath written ſix or ſeven ſheets and all for the moſt part are accuſations againſt the Army, and the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt and vileſt that can be, aggravated to the higheſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Parliament for their ſins are ſcattered and broken</hi>: This in part is true, <hi>to wit,</hi> ſuch Members as turned aſide to their croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked waies; the Lord hath led them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace ſhall be upon the reſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>the whol Kingdom is full of diſcontent againſt them.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve tis ſo, and more diſcontented will they be when they ſhall more cleerly underſtand, their particular treaſons, and bloody deſigns, in joyning with Malignants, &amp; their under-hand plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings to raiſe up farraign and domeſtick forces to deſtroy the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and the wel-affected through the Kingdom.</p>

            <p n="5">5.

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56574:11"/>We have next, his <hi>Story,</hi> and 'tis a wofull one. Firſt he ſaith, <hi>Once our King and Parliament, or people, lived quietly and lovingly together, imbraced in the arms of Divine Goodneſs, proſpered together as husband and wife.</hi> When was this <hi>once</hi>? It is ſo known an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth what he ſpeaks, as I need not ſay any thing to it, onely wiſh him hereafter to pray with <hi>David, ſet a watch (O Lord) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my mouth, keep the door of my lips.</hi> I could multiply inſtances of the continual diſſentions and differences between King and Parliament, from the beginning of his Reign down al along to this preſent Parliament: and for the People, ſuch as were moſt ſincere and pious lived not quietly and lovingly together with him, but ſuffered extremly under him, even to the ſpoiling of their goods, impriſonment, baniſhment, and ſome loſſe of life: and this only for the truth ſake.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In calling the King <hi>husband,</hi> and the Parliament <hi>wife:</hi> as the former was falſe, ſo this is fooliſh.</p>
            <p>And 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> Is that true, that <hi>the Army have alwaies luſted after the royal bed</hi>: What? <hi>alwaies,</hi> how are they then deeply revolted and turn'd back to the world? In pag. 43. you ſay, <hi>they have been led up into the high things of God, and did all things in the Spirit of God.</hi> But I ſhall not preſſe it further.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I perceive you are a ſtranger to the ground-work of the Treaty, <hi>'tis too wonderful for you,</hi> and therefore have ſtated the thing amiſſe; it was to advance the King's party, ſtop the courſe of Juſtice againſt Capital offenders, that ſuch as had notorioſly cheated the Kingdome might not be queſtioned, the people brought again into their former bondage, ſuch as would not, nor could in conſcience ſubmit to their Church-government and other forms might be ſuppreſſed, and under the name of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries baniſhed the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Laſtly you ſay, <hi>There is a bleſſing in this Treaty, deſtroy it not</hi>: &amp; tell us how <hi>the Lord will come in as a thief in the night, and ſteal away the evil.</hi> I anſwer, You may ſee the Lord is already come in, not in the night, but at noon-day, and hath diſcovered the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of it, the ſnare is broken and we are eſcaped, and bleſſed be the Lord who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> is now come to examin their <hi>Reaſons</hi> given in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56574:11"/>
the Treaty, and here he finds ſundry faults; Firſt, Becauſe they would <hi>make their own and the puplick intereſt to be one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Howſoever ſuch as have engaged for the publick, are in ſome things to be conſidered apart, and ſo their particular ſafety to be provided for: yet doth it not follow that they have therefore no intereſt in the publick, or what is offered to us by them is not the publick, but their own particular intereſt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do not well know what he means by <hi>generally the people of the Land</hi>; if he intends the King's party, all Papiſts and other malignants, I confeſs they go not with the <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire rather to ſee all things in the condition they were in before theſe wars began: but for others (and this is properly the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick intereſt) they are one with the Army, holding faſt to their firſt principles, namely, To be free from all arbitrary and tyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical power, whether in King or Parliament, to enjoy all their rights, priviledges, and liberties, to have all hurtful laws and cuſtoms removed, not to have their conſciences lorded over by any; to have juſtice done impartially upon offenders, and ſuch a Government to be eſtabliſhed as moſt tends to a publick peace and ſafety: And therefore whereas he ſaith, <hi>Theſe deviſed things you propoſe, the people know them not, affect them leſs than they know them</hi>: Unleſs by <hi>people</hi> he mean Royalliſts, Delinquents, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants, and other treacherous plotters and their adherents, it is not true: for the publick doe deſire them, call for them, and have a long time contributed their eſtates and engaged their perſons in hope that theſe things would at laſt be procured.</p>
            <p>His Second Exception is, Becauſe the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> propounds, <hi>That all power ſhould be in the hands of the Parliament, and that to be certain and in the hands of a ſubordinate officer to call &amp;c.</hi> There is a great deal here left out, which makes the matter more full and cleer, but I let it paſſe, let us conſider his reaſons againſt this:
<q>It is to throw down a King and lords, and to ſet up the people.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The exorbitances and abuſes of Kings and Lords may be taken off, and yet their perſons remain, and as much power left them as is their due. 2. The rights and liberties of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are above the places of Princes: for Kings (if duly choſen) were ſet by the people for the better enjoying of their rights &amp;c.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56574:12"/>
and therefore there is ſtill in the people a ſtanding power to alter their former choiſe, and courſe of chuſing if they ſe another way to be better for them. 3. If <hi>by ſetting up of the people,</hi> he mean the exerciſing of that power which God hath given them, in chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging one kind of government and ſetting another more ſafe and profitable for them, it is well propoſed: As he that helps a man (being unjuſtly thruſt out of his poſſeſſions) to ſet him into his own again, is no way blame-worthy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>ſhould you not rather propoſe, that all power, dominion and reign ſhould be given to the Lord?</hi> I muſt ingeniouſly profeſſe here is a riddle, and I underſtand it not: But good Sir, in your next, tell us what power or dominion is taken from the Lord, in ſeeking to have good laws eſtabliſhed, righteous judgment exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, enormities removed, righteouſneſs and peace practiſed amongſt men. We have nothing more in his anſwer, but much harſh and bitter language. It is ſaid of <hi>Lewes</hi> the Eleventh, he had a conceit, that every thing did ſtink about him, all the odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riferous perfumes and fragrant ſavours they could get could not eaſe him, but ſtill he ſmell'd a filthy ſtinch. It much grieves me, that Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> hath ſo ill an opinion of the Army, that how precious and ſweet ſoever their Propoſals are, yet all to his thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is dung and traſh.</p>
            <p>A Third Exception is, and a <hi>fault</hi> which he finds in them, <hi>That they all along carry the intereſt of the publick in oppoſition to the King's.</hi> Here he makes a tedious and long diſcourſe, and multiplieth words without knowledge: Firſt he ſaith, <hi>The publick hath its intereſt in the King, and the King his intereſt in the publick.</hi> There is ſo much ſaid in the <hi>Remonſtrance,</hi> from page 16. to 35. that if he had duly weighed and conſidered the ſame, he would not have written as he doth. It is not the Army as <hi>Sword-men</hi> that have cut the knot in pieces and divided them, but indeed (as it is there abundantly proved) the King's il courſes, it is of himſelf that the union is diſſolved, and he wholly loſt his intereſt in the publick: for further ſatisfaction herein, I refer the Reader to the Book; and Mr. <hi>Prin's Charge againſt the King</hi>: and the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Remonſtrances and Declarations of Parliament to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To omit his <hi>godding</hi> again of the creature, he tels us, how
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:56574:12"/>
               <hi>God is the God of Kings more than of common men, aſſuming their titles: kinglineſs agrees with all Chriſtians: It is a baſtardly religion that is inconſiſtant with the majeſtie and greatneſs of the moſt abſolute Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Take notice <hi>Reader</hi> that in all this, there is not one word which relates to the matter in hand. 2. As the Lord ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noreth good Kings, ſo he is terrible to wicked ones, cuts them off and powres out cuntempt upon them. 3. Howſoever we grant that true religion is not inconſiſtant with monarchie, yet we know, and experienee ſhews it, that there is no kind of civil government more averſe and oppoſite to the Kingdom of Chriſt and leſſe helpful to it than Monarchie. For the reſt, which is the gathering <hi>all into one God and man into one perſon, God and the King into one perſon</hi>: to mention it, is conviction enough.</p>
            <p>A Fourth <hi>fault</hi> which he finds with them is, <hi>In putting all the enmity againſt godlineſs and the power of it on the King's part, and charging it upon him as his intereſt, and aſſuming all religion and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to themſelves.</hi> Here firſt of all, he makes a large diſcourſe in praiſe of himſelf, and ſpeaks much in his own behalf as the like I never obſerved in a man truly fearing God: It is perſonal and therefore I paſſe it over: yet ſo, as I wiſh him hereafter to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that counſel of <hi>Solomon, Let another man praiſe thee, and not thine own mouth, a ſtranger and not thine own lips.</hi> It was their cuſtom at the <hi>Olimpick</hi> games, that the winner ſhould not put the garland on himſelf, but ſome other was to do it for him.</p>
            <p>Now to the Anſwer, which is very large, but ſummarily thus: A juſtifying of the wicked, and condemning the righteous. Touching the Army he ſaith, <hi>Their wayes are dark and ſlippery,</hi> crying up the <hi>Lord</hi> the <hi>Lord, when they do the works of the Devil, they have not the power of godlineſs</hi>: And for the King's party, <hi>They do not oppoſe them for purity, and are in their principles more righteous than they, and many of their perſons more ſober, patient, loving, gentle, yea, more knowing in the things of God than they.</hi> He further tels them they are <hi>led to the deſtroying of others, as righteous as themſelves, and are kept off from the ſight of their own iniquity</hi>: Next he mentioneth <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.1, 2. and <hi>Matt.</hi> 7.1. and hereupon ſharply reproves them for accuſing of others, and whileſt he is ſpeaking it, accuſeth them to go beſides all law and right, to ſet up will and power,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56574:13"/>
that they ſhed the true innocent blood of Chriſt, ſpoil the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, harden their hearts to pride, malice, and wicked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting over their brethren, and much more to this purpoſe: then ſpeaking of the King, he ſaith, <hi>They perſecute him whom the Lord hath ſmitten,</hi> and he is the <hi>apple of Gods eye,</hi> and that God hath declared (and ſo much they know) rich mercie to the King and his partie in his book called <hi>The Leaves of the Tree of life.</hi> Thus Reader I have in brief given thee a true accompt of all that he hath written from page 12. to page the 20. I ſhall here only in ſhort take ſome few obſervations and ſo go on.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What a bold challenge that is, page 12. where he <hi>Chalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth the whol earth to accuſe him of any injuſtice to God or man</hi>: Now can there be greater injuſtice, than to charge Gods people with manifeſt falſhood and untruth: <hi>Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I, yea, thine own lips teſtifie againſt thee.</hi> I hope I may without exception or offence uſe his own words, page 50. <hi>You may reade your deſcription excellently pen'd long ago,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. <hi>ſpeaking lyes in hypocriſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it not alſo great injuſtice to God (if not to prefer, yet) to equalize Satans working in wicked men, with the Spirits working upon the ſouls of the Saints.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What ſober, conſiderate, or wiſe man, as he is reproving another for raſh judging and uncharitableneſs, would at the ſame time ſhew himſelf ſo uncharitable and raſh in the very ſame thing, as there is ſcarce a preſident or example before of the like.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is this Mr. <hi>Sedgwick's Juſtice upon the Armies Remonſtrance</hi>; when there is a true report made of the King's grievous crimes and miſcarriages with his partie, not having any thing at all to gainſay the truth of the relation, to vilifie and reproach the reporters?</p>
            <p n="5">5. In ſending us to his book, we take good notic of it, and what he there ſaith of <hi>the rich mercy to the King and his party</hi>: and from it do obſerve, how extremly he is carried away with vain fancies, and publiſhing idle dreams to the world: <hi>The Spirit ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth expreſly clearly</hi> and with <hi>fulneſs of certainty,</hi> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently demonſtrates that in theſe things he ſpeaks not by the Spirit of God, ſeeing his words fall to the ground. In page 19.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:56574:13"/>
he begins to take into conſideration ſome grounds laid down in the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> why the King is not to be received again to peace, nor reſtored to his Office and dignity, and promiſeth to let them ſee how much their injuſtice is againſt God and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that which they profeſs for juſtice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Saith he, <hi>you inſiſt upon this pag.</hi> 24. <hi>God hath given him ſo cleerly into your hands to do juſtice, and afterward God hath given a double judgment againſt him &amp;c.</hi> and pag. 5. <hi>God makes haſt to judgment and hath appeared at a ſevere avendger.</hi> To this his anſwer is,
<q>The King is the greateſt ſufferer in the kingdom; hath God judged him? and why wil you not ſubmit to his judgement? will ye take it out of Gods hand? when did God chaſten or judge men, then give him to men to chaſten again? or when did Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple fall upon puniſhing after God hath done it? is God weary or remiſſe, that you would have men take it into their hands?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1 It is a bad conſequence becauſe a man hath bin a great ſufferer, therefore, no more ſhould be inflicted: God puniſhed <hi>Phaeraoh</hi> many wayes and greatly too, yet he hardening his heart had afterward, heavier ſorer and deeper plagues.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men in the execution of juſtice upon offenders, take not judgment out of Gods hand, but rather indeed are Gods hand in the work.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When God gave in a witneſs againſt <hi>Acan,</hi> that he had <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Iſrael,</hi> howſoever that was a Divine puniſhment upon him, yet did the people afterwards ſtone him to death, and <hi>ſo the Lord turned from the fierceneſs of his anger.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. What wearineſs or remiſneſs in executing judgement do men impute to God, who having by his providence caſt into their hands a principal offender, if they according to his deſert pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to juſtice againſt him. The truth is, in his Anſwer there is not one word that comes directly home to the matter for which he brings it.</p>
            <p>Secondly (he ſaith) <hi>You argue</hi> page 24. <hi>no remorſe appearing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the offence: if that could be ſeen, you would regard it with a proportionable tenderneſs towards him. Again you ſay, There is no change of heart, no repentance, no free nor full yeelding to all the parts of a publick and religious intereſt.</hi> This he refutes thus,
<q>Herein you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56574:14"/>
deſtroy and deny that free mercy of God upon which you have lived a long while, manifeſt that your profeſſion of the Goſpel was indeed but in letter, not in power: God loves firſt before we can, but you muſt receive good before you can give, you know not the heart, nor can you judge of the Kings principles, they are too high for you, If he ſhould turn to you he ſhould be but ſeven times more the child of the Devil.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Howſoever Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> for his own turn, takes ſome broken pieces of the Remonſtrance and toucheth not the ſtrength of the matter, yet ſo much he takes out as he cannot anſwer. But to the point, 1. It is agreeable to Goſpel truth, and walking in the power thereof, for Saints upon juſt occaſion to lay open the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs of men, and to endeavour that puniſhment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be inflicted, whether it be in an ecleſiaſtical or civil way. 2. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the looſneſs of his arguing, <hi>God loves firſt.</hi> What's the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference? therefore offenders, as murderers, thieves &amp;c. ought not to be puniſhed. 3. If I ſee and taſt the fruit I can eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what the tree is, without digging to the root. He tells us page 31. <hi>The ſpeech ſheweth what is within,</hi> and cites <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.34, 35. hence we may undoubtedly conclude, that men apparently and viſibly wicked, are corrupt and unfound within. 4. What the King's principles are, which are ſo myſterious and deep we ſearch not after them, his known principles are known to be dangerous and deſtructive to the Nation, &amp; he holds them without change or amendment. 5. Is Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> in good earneſt and ſpeaks as he thinks; that the King ſhould be ſeven times more the child of the Devil if he ſhould turn to the Army? What! in a condition better than they? yea, ſeven times better: ſurely then they are very bad. In pag. 12. he ſaith, <hi>He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not the utmoſt of the religion they walk in.</hi> This ſeems to make the accuſation the more probable, but many others leſſe preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt the Army, and better principled in religion, know 'tis falſe, and that they are as holy and pure in converſation as he himſelf, howbeit, with leſſe noiſe, ſound not a trumpet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them as the hypocrits do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, He brings in the <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> arguing againſt the accomodation, <hi>becauſe there is no equal ballance of affairs,</hi> page 24. <hi>your meaning is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as you often expreſs, the King's forces are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56574:14"/>
wholly ſubdued.</hi> Here he is ſhort, <hi>Noble enemies require no more but to get their enemies into their power, then they ſhew mercy</hi>; for this he brings <hi>Eliſha's</hi> example, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.22. and add how the Lord never brings us down, but that he might reſtore us and lift us up again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. It is ſometimes ſo far from commendation, to ſpare an enemy gotten into our hands, as that not to do juſtice upon him, exeedingly diſpleaſeth God. To omit many inſtances, 'tis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable in <hi>Ahab's</hi> caſe, what ſad tydings the Prophet brought him for letting <hi>Benhadad</hi> to eſcape, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Becauſe thou haſt let go out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: therefore thy life ſhall go for his life, and thy people for his people:</hi> 1 <hi>King,</hi> 20.24. So <hi>Saul,</hi> his ſparing of <hi>Agag</hi> when he was in his hands, was one cauſe that the Lord did rend the Kingdom of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> from him. Again, what hath been more frequently practiſed by <hi>noble enemies</hi> than ſeverity and juſtice upon ſuch as they have gotten into their power? who of all the Kings of <hi>Canaan</hi> taken in war by <hi>Joſhua,</hi> were not afterwards by his appointment put to death? So <hi>Samuel</hi> did <hi>Agag</hi>: and <hi>Jehu Ahaziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah.</hi> 3. Touching <hi>Eliſha's</hi> example in ſparing the <hi>Syrians,</hi> it teacheth us thus much, that in our own cauſe we muſt <hi>render good for evil,</hi> and <hi>if our enemy hunger, feed him</hi>: and from his words to the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> we may gather, that men uſed not to kill ſuch as in the field were taken captives, and ſtood not out in hoſtility: But there is nothing from the place to be collected, that juſtice may not be executed upon ſome offenders for ſpecial and notorious crimes, whether ſubdued in war or taken any other way.</p>
            <p>Fourthly. <hi>The often cauſed war to maintain his intereſt againſt the publick intereſt this conſtantly and unweariedly</hi>; So the <hi>Remonſtrance.</hi> At this Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> grows angry, and fals into paſſion: <hi>You lye groſly</hi> ſaith he: But wherein? <hi>Theſe things which you propound were never thought of in the begining of the quarrel.</hi> The Parliament al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies profeſſed never to alter the Government, to protect the King's <hi>Perſon</hi> &amp;c. Afterwards we have ſomething ſaid in ſcorn of their preſent <hi>form of government,</hi> with his fiction and dream tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Touching the time when ſome things are to be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it is the neceſſary occaſion which muſt alwaies be conſidered:
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56574:15"/>
In civil affairs we ſee what at one time may be born, others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards upon juſt and good ground may aboliſh and take away; or otherwiſe we ſhould deny men the uſe of their ſenſe and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We know it is no <hi>Parliament principle</hi> that their votes and agreement ſhould be taken as the Lawes of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> which altereth not: their conſtant practiſe is to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and change as they ſee reaſon for it, and therefore it is the weakeſt reaſoning that can be, to argue the Parliament voted ſo and ſo, therefore it muſt ſtand: For inſtance, the Prelates with their courts, cannons, ſervice-book, and other dependances are aboliſhed, and that by vote of Parliament, now put caſe they ſhould be (which God forbid) again re-eſtabliſhed, aske of a Royalliſt if there might not be enough ſaid to juſtify the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament in this latter act. Thirdly, For the odium and diſgrace which he puts upon their preſent form of government, calling it <hi>a headleſſe monſter, a hoddy-doddy, an all-breach, able to affright ſolid and ſerious men to their armes,</hi> and if he ſhould fight againſt any thing, he ſhould fight againſt it, and <hi>pag.</hi> 12. <hi>brats of their own brain.</hi> Jn reading this, it makes me thinke how <hi>Nichomachus</hi> in <hi>Plutarch</hi> very fitly anſwered an ideot, that could ſee no beauty in the famous <hi>Helena</hi> painted by <hi>Zeuxis,</hi> take my eyes ſaid <hi>Nicho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macus</hi> and you ſhall thinke her to be a goddeſſe. J will not here ſpeak how treaſonable his words are, as moving ſtrongly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, and to raiſe a new war, and to cauſe commotions again in the land: But J ſee tis true, <hi>In the multitude of words there want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſin, and he that refraineth his lips is wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, He ſhould have cleared the King of the things laid to his charge, as to have been the author and contriver of a moſt unjuſt war, and is conſequently guilty of all the innocent blood rapine, ſpoyl, and miſchief to the Kingdome, as in the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, pag.</hi> 24. adde the loſſe of <hi>Rochel</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> by his lending ſhips to the <hi>French King</hi>; and the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Ree</hi> and <hi>Cales</hi> voyage, and the ground and reaſon of the quarrel. How he endevoured to ſtir up factions and differences between the honeſt party in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> that he might take advantage by ſuch diviſion: his open declaring in Parliament, that he owes no account of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to none, but to God alone. What hath beene reported a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56574:15"/>
his <hi>Fathers death,</hi> and Marquis <hi>Hambleton,</hi> his deſigne in bringing up the <hi>Northern Army,</hi> and his large offers to the <hi>Scots</hi> Army to be brought up to <hi>London</hi> to awe the Parliament, his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall breaking of his promiſes, proteſtations, oathes, as in many particulars might be named, his ſending over the Jewels of the crown to be pawned by the <hi>Queen</hi> for powder and ammunition, to fight againſt the Parliament, and the Priviledges, rights, and liberties of the ſubject. How he made 1500 widdows in one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as Mr. <hi>Henderſon</hi> told him. And concerning <hi>Ireland,</hi> how clear it is by many ſeverall paſſages, and by the examination of <hi>Mar-carte,</hi> and <hi>Macquire,</hi> &amp;c. that the pretence of men for the King of <hi>Spaines</hi> ſervice a year or two before the rebellion in <hi>Jre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was but a colour to keep ſome in armes for a foundation of that rebellion: how the <hi>Jriſh rebels</hi> call themſelves, the kings and Queens Army, the firſt clauſe in the oath injoyned by the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream catholick councell at <hi>Kelkenny</hi> in <hi>Jreland,</hi> was to maintain his royall prerogative againſt the puritants in the Parliament of England. Jn one of his letters taken at <hi>Nazeby</hi> he commanded the Earle of <hi>Ormond</hi> to give particular thanks to <hi>Muſtarre</hi> and <hi>Planket</hi> the two Arch-rebels in <hi>Jreland:</hi> ſo divers of the Jriſh rebels had private paſſes from the King for the heading of the rebels there. J Iet paſſe loans, ſhipmony, monopolies, Knighthood, inlarging of forreſts, incloſing of commons, ingroſſing of gunpowder, his unparrell uxoriouſneſſe and affections to the <hi>Queen,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the <hi>Pope,</hi> &amp;c. Now all theſe things Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> ſhould firſt have anſwered, before he ſhould have affirmed, <hi>Jf there be any, reaſon for a Prince to take up armes againſt his ſubject:</hi> he hath, and why ſo? becauſe there attempt is <hi>to deſtroy the King, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the very foundations of Government,</hi> and a little before, <hi>the life of the King and his poſterity is aymed at.</hi> Anſw. The premiſes granted to put him by, is a thing lawful and neceſſary (of which more hereafter.) And this may be done without deſtroying the very foundations of government, unleſſe by <hi>foundations</hi> he means ſome particular form or kind of government, but that is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ſay, for the <hi>foundations of government,</hi> is indeed that abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute entire and independant power reſiding alwayes in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this foundation cannot be deſtroyed, J meane the right and habit of it: though the uſe and exerciſe may be wrung'd
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56574:16"/>
from them: ſo that to change and alter in reſpect of the forme or kinde of governments by vertue of the ſaid power it is in the peoples liberty whenſoever they ſee juſt cauſe and reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, For the reſt, which is, firſt reproaching the Army, as to be their deſigne <hi>only</hi> to attain their end, malice, ambition, and revenge. And ſecondly, That the King ſhall put all into Gods hand, and ſhall receive it again in the life and glory of God. This is capable of no other anſwer but reproof and pitty.</p>
            <p>To follow Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> in his own order, next he comes to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer <hi>pag</hi> 26.27. &amp;c. which is the ſecond part of the queſtion, and a ſecond reaſon againſt accommodation: <hi>The ſafety of an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> here he takes ſome words out of the <hi>Remonſtrance, That the King hath forfeited all his power into your hands; that the people are free to make the beſt advantages,</hi> and pag. 27. <hi>having him and his party cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and in their power.</hi> Reader, I profeſſe unto thee in the word of truth, here I have read over ſome leaves, and have done my beſt to ſee what is in his anſwer, but for ſeverall pages together, as 23, 24, 25, 26, &amp;c. I finde nothing therein, for I eſteeme not his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniations, raſh-judging, ſelf-prayſe as any thing; and for this be thou thy ſelf a witneſſe.</p>
            <p>Saith he, <hi>We have all this while to juſtify our ſelves in this war,</hi> ſaid, <hi>that our war was but defenſive, and if it prove otherwiſe, we muſt repent of it. Anſw.</hi> It is not alwayes a fault to change from a defenſive to an offenſive way and courſe. A man being ſet upon by a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-robber, or pirate at ſea, may at firſt reſolve only his owne ſafety, and yet afterward ſeek to wound and kill the enemy, and juſtly too<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To apply this, when the war firſt began betweene the King and Parliament it was unknown to us, what murders, maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres, and ſpoyles, he would commit, in and upon the land, and people. Again his former perfidiouſneſſe, treacheries, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying plots, were not then ſo publickly and clearly underſtood as ſince; and therefore no marvail there is a change from <hi>defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> to <hi>offenſive,</hi> ſeeing he hath given the cauſe, and ſo no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of lightneſſe, hypocriſie, ſelf-ends, in perſons thus chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He is large in giving out what was in their mindes when they began the war, <hi>That the King and His party were wicked men, not fit for the places and power they had, they were Saints, and no
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:56574:16"/>
body fit to rule but they: glad when the Parliment tooke armes, thinke themſelves the onely true Lords, and except the King would become one of their Saints, &amp;c. Anſw.</hi> It was a reaſon which <hi>Elias</hi> layd down, why he was willing to die, <hi>I am no better then my fathers</hi>; for men eminent in grace, gifts, office, &amp;c. to have things laid to their charge, which they never knew it, hath been practiſed in all ages, Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> is not the firſt, that hath bent his tongue like a bow againſt the godly this way. <hi>Tiberius</hi> on a time hearing certaine perſons ſpeaking unreverently of <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> acquainted him ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, to whom <hi>Auguſtus</hi> anſwered, let it not trouble you <hi>Tiberius</hi> that any man ſpeaketh ill of us, it is ſufficient that no man is able to hurt us: Gods preſence with and protection for the Army is ſuch, as bad tongues cannot hurt them, neither darken their ſplendor and beauty in the eyes of honeſt and godly people.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Next he blames them in ſaying, <hi>This miſerable inconvenience of a Treaty, this inſnaring Treaty,</hi> and becauſe they call it <hi>a prepoſterous and ſelf-deſerting way.</hi> pag. 27. And hence he takes occaſion to tel them that they have defiled their cauſe, count all their owne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have fought for it, they are no Saints, yet he ſcornes that cauſe that is ſubject to ruin and deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. What is ſaid in the Remonſtrance touching this laſt Perſonall Treaty, is true enough, for who but Malignants and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts were the firſt contrivers and abetters thereof. The Lord <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> in his former intercepted letters could tell us ſo much, that if the King could cudgel the Parliament into a Treaty the King had brought his deſigne to perfection: and tis reported of the King Himſelf that he ſhould ſay, if ſuch a thing could be brought about, then it ſhould not be in the power of men or devils to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from bringing all his deſignes to his own hearts deſire.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For men to act for publick rights, and to hinder wicked deſignes is no baſe and accurſed way, but an approved path, walked in by the Saints in all former ages.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, It is not faith but fancie, when God gives in meanes and wayes of preſervation and ſafety, not to obſerve the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the carefull uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He chargeth them to be of a baſe and poor ſpirit, and unbecomming Chriſtian Souldiers, to ſpeak of <hi>perſons ingaged, the party adhering,</hi> and to think <hi>the King will be revenged on them, for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:56574:17"/>
their eminent activity againſt him. It is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a principle very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to continue the diſturbance of a nation, to ſave our lives</hi>: after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward he ſhewes what he would doe himſelf in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It is eaſily obſerved what is the main drift and ſcope of his whole dicourſe in many <hi>pages</hi> here together, namely a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect croſſing and contradiction of Chriſts counſel, <hi>Be ye wiſe as ſerpents and harmeleſſe as doves</hi>: but according to his principle, a man cannot be a ſheep, unleſſe he runne himſelfe into the lyons mouth: nor a dove, without falling purpoſely into the ſnare. Becauſe the Army, to the doves innocency joyn the ſerpents pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that is, ſeek to avoyd danger ſo far as lawfully they may, hence he cryes out, <hi>Feare a ſnare, and the pit have taken hold of you. I laugh at your deſtruction, and mock when your fear comes, you are no Saints, you live not in God, &amp;c.</hi> as if a provident care of ſafety, ſtood not with the fear of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Demoſthenis</hi> upbraiding the <hi>Athenians</hi> with improvidence and incircumſpection, preſented to them an innocent fool, who being ſtruck on the one cheek, laid his hand on the place where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the blow, and being ſmitten on the other did the like, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver uſing either of his hands to defend himſelf from further blowes. Such ideots and blocks Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> would perſwade men to be, take blows and ſtand ſtill, and never ſeek to avoid the ſtroke, though God have put means into their hands, and may lawfully eſcape the danger.</p>
            <p>But Secondly, It is a great miſtake of Mr. <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> to think that continuance of the Army is deſtructive to the Kingdom, and that their disbanding would be for the peoples peace, good wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, he harps often upon this ſtring, whereas there is nothing more cleer than the contrary.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For the reſt of the anſwer, 'tis only what he hath, and what he can do, propounded in four heads: and I paſſe it over, if any man can make uſe of it much good may it do him.</p>
            <p>From <hi>pag.</hi> 27. <hi>to</hi> 37. we have a tyreſome diſcourſe of two things, The Armies badneſs, and his goodneſs: their fear, his faith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Whereas it is in the Remonſtrance, <hi>We might chalenge all ſtory for one inſtance in the like caſe</hi>: howſoever he grants a good uſe of ſtory, <hi>yet in them it is a dull thing &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. I never obſerved this principle before, Becauſe men pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs

the Kingdom of Chriſt, and have a light of truth and juſtice, that therefore they ſhould be uncapable of the uſe of former ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: doth Religion take off from a Chriſtian, becauſe a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an? what is proper to every man, as a man moral, civil, natural? 2. If there be <hi>a good uſe of ſtory</hi> as he grants, then might they at this time well challenge it reaſoning the greater to the leſſe, as thus: If all Nations keeping their intereſt, and proceeding ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to equity and juſtice, have upon fewer and leſſer crimes refuſed perſonal treaties with their Kings, and called them to an accompt and done juſtice upon them according to their facts: there is all the reaſon in the world, that the like be done to this King whoſe exorbitances and enormities are beyond moſt parrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel inſtances:</p>
            <p>Enquire (ſaith <hi>Bildad) of the former age, and prepare thy ſelf to the ſearch of the fathers; for we are but of yeſterday.</hi> Sundry Hiſtories and Authors might be produced to manifeſt that Emperours and Kings not only have been reſtrained for their Tyranny and miſgovernment, yea, for not committing the evil which this king hath done: Take for inſtance (his name ſake) <hi>Charles</hi> the Ninth King of <hi>France</hi> four or five ſeveral concluſions of Peace were ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly made and ratified between the King and the Proteſtants, but no ſooner made and proclaimed, but preſently violated of the King and the popiſh party, by maſſacres and and new treacherous plots to extirpate the Proteſtant party; ſo that every accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation proved but a ſeminary of a new and more bloody war al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to the utter ruin of <hi>France.</hi> In the year 1592. when a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick peace was made, and all differences to outward appearences, buried in eternal oblivion, the King contrary to his faith and Oath cauſed the <hi>Admiral</hi> of <hi>France</hi> (the Proteſtants cheefe piller) as he departed from the Counſel to dinner, to he ſhot with a Harquebuze, which carried away the forefinger of his right hand and wounded him in the left arm. The King to colour his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, <hi>ſwears with an excreation</hi> to the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and others who complained of this outrage, <hi>to take ſuch exemplary juſtice on the offenders, as the</hi> Admiral <hi>and his friends ſhould have cauſe to reſt ſatisfied, command them to be purſued, appoints three of the Parliament to make Information againſt them, proteſts after this again and again, to be exeedingly ſorry, that this Act touching His Honor, that He will be

revenged for it, ſo as the memory of it ſhould remain for ever, writes to Governors of the provinces, chief towns, and Magiſtrates, that He would take ſuch order as the Authors of ſo wicked an Act ſhould be known and puniſhed. And to His Ambaſſadors to forreign Princes, That they ſhould make it known to all the world, that this Outrage did diſpleaſe Him. And for the</hi> Admiral's <hi>ſafety He commands the Captains of His Guard to give him as many of His Guard as he pleaſed; to ſuffer no Papiſts to enter his lodging; and adviſeth all the Gentlemen Proteſtants then in</hi> Paris <hi>to lodge about the</hi> Admirals <hi>lodging.</hi> But all this <hi>Court Holy-water</hi> was only to keep every bird within his own neſt, and a pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fal to entrap the chief of the Proteſtants: for <hi>the ſame day after dinner, the King and Queen mother, the Duke of</hi> Guize, <hi>and others, take counſel to murder the Admiral, and all the chief Proteſtants, the night enſuing, not only in</hi> Paris, <hi>but thorow out all</hi> France, <hi>whileſt they were ſleeping in their beds.</hi> Which moſt tyranical barbarous Tradge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was accordingly acted, the <hi>Admiral</hi> ſlain in his lodging, and his head cut off, carried to the King and Queen mother, who cauſing it to be embalm'd, ſent it to the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> for an aſſurance of the death of their moſt capital ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my: all the Proteſtants, Noblemen and Gentlemen, lodging in the Admirals quarters undergo the like Butchery, the ſtreets of <hi>Paris</hi> are ſtrewed with Carkeiſes, the pavements, market-places, and river dyed with Proteſtant blood, about ten thouſand of them being thus treacherouſly maſſacred in their beds, at ſuch a ſeaſon when they thought themſelves moſt ſafe, and that on the Lords own ſacred Day, a very unſutabe time for ſuch a bloody prophane, infernal ſacrifice. No ſooner was this matchleſſe treachery of this King againſt his own natural ſubjects executed, but <hi>He avowes and juſtifies that which he but the day before ſo ſolemnly and openly diſclaimed,</hi> as a means to cut off al commotions for time to come: of which we ſhall ſay more in its proper place.</p>

for who knows not that it hath been the continual practice, of all ſuch Kings when they have quieted the people by an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical and feigned yeilding to their propoſals, and gotten themſelves into the Throne again, to pick quarels, make breaches and commit greater outrage and inſolencies, than ever they did before, without regard of faith or oath.</p>
            <p>Hear what Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> ſaith to this thing in his <hi>Soveraign power of Parliaments.</hi> Part 2. page 34.

            <p>Again, This ſame Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> in the <hi>Appendix pag,</hi> 74.

            <p>Thirdly, For the reſt, 'tis only his Propheſie touching the reſtitution of the King to His antient rights. How his ſuffering hath made him a <hi>Royaliſt that never cared for him,</hi> (mark it Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der who taught him that) the poor ſuffering oppreſſed King and His Partie ſhall have his compaſſion, and for the Army they are <hi>upon fooliſh wayes, hope for nothing but deceit and falſhood and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: fear compaſſeth them about on every ſide like</hi> Cain: <hi>ſafety flyes from them, God looked upon them every way with ſadneſs and wrath</hi>: and much more of this language. But I have metwithit ſo often as I am now quite tyred out: I am glad that His <hi>Excellency</hi> and the Councel of Warre can ſo patiently bear it, tis a great adition
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56574:19"/>
to their goodneſs and largenes of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>The Eagle being provoked by the night-crow with her clamo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous noiſe and ſcreeching to fight yet will not ſtir up to battle, howſoever the crow be too weak for her.</p>
            <p>And ti is attributed to a Horſe as his praiſe and acting argueth great courage and mettle to him, when dogs bark at him and run after him, he will not turn againſt them but runs forward as if he neither ſaw them nor heard them, although he can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly trample them under his feet·</p>
            <p>For the other particular which is a large praiſing of himſelfe, I ſhall ſay very little to it, ſeeing it relates not to the publicke cauſe for which I have ingaged: neither is it materiall to ſet down his words, for howſoever they are a heape, and a huge one too. (ſee <hi>page</hi> 32, 33, 34, 35.) yet in ſhort it all amounts to this much: <hi>He dwels in that mountaine where there is no hurtfull thing, feares no ſurprizes being in a ſtate not apprehenſive of danger, ſees no evil, knowes no evil, he lives where there is no more curſe, death, nor ſorrow, &amp;c. He can binde Kings, yea, the devil, and caſt him into the bottomleſſe pit, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve all his works, and ſecure him within his own bounds, that he ſhall no longer deſtroy the earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If I bear witneſſe of my ſelfe my witneſſe is not true.</hi> But leaving that queſtion whither he ſpeaks the truth: this is a truth without queſtion, that in this boaſting practiſe, he walkes contrary to all ſober, meeke, humble, and ſelf-denying Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans both paſt and preſent. If this doe not argue a man to be a <hi>boaſter, proud, heady, high-minded,</hi> then I know not what doth: we judge the emptineſſe of the veſſel by the lowdneſſe of the ſound, braſſe tinckleth more then gold, and a bladder is ſoon blown up, but when it is moſt ſwoln there is nothing in it, but a little ayre. The tree <hi>Alpina</hi> brings forth the faireſt bloſſomes of all trees, but the bee ſuſpects it to be venemous, becauſe it is ſo glorious, and therefore neither taſteth it, nor commeth neer it. If ſelf prayſing may be admitted as a ground or reaſon to ſuſpect a perſon ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not to be ſound, Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> ſurely more then any man I know, gives cauſe of ſuch a ſuſpition, in making himſelf ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with his own mouth.</p>
            <p>Two things I ſhall here commend to the Readers obſervation. 1. <hi>In page</hi> 49. ſpeaking of the Army, he ſaith, <hi>Your condition is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56574:19"/>
well-expreſſed,</hi> Eſay. 65.4, 5. <hi>which ſay, ſtand by thy ſelf, come not neere me, for I am holier then thou</hi>: and often he taxeth them for count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves Saints, righteous, holy, &amp;c. and judging the King and his party otherwiſe: whereas in the mean time, in 8 or 9. <hi>pages</hi> together, he hath little elſe but calling the Army, <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>devils,</hi> and himſelf a Saint; they in Satan, darkneſſe, hel; he in God, light, heaven; they all fear, himſelf all faith; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers, hypocrites, lyars, but he righteous, ſincere, true; ſpeake out Reader, haſt thou ever ſeen more palpable groſneſſe?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Jn <hi>pag.</hi> 34. he expreſſeth himſelf thus: <hi>if you find any world in me, you ſhall doe me right to afflict it, break it, let it ſuffer, &amp;c.</hi> Tis the beſt thing J find in all his book, and it gives me the more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to ſpeak to him of his error and fayling, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hope I have of his amendment: now if the tree may be known by the fruit, and the ſpeech ſhewes what he is within, as a ſtinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath argues rotten lungs, and filthy inwards, then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt this followes, to wit, that there is a great deale <hi>of world in you,</hi> many ſinfull luſts, and vile affections, which need afflicting and breaking: look upon theſe words, they are your owne, <hi>page</hi> 36. and ſpecially applyed to his <hi>Excellency</hi> and the <hi>Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of War, You are caſt out and gone out, and live out the bleſſed and glorous preſence of God, and ſo are</hi> Dogs <hi>rated by God into a filthy ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of baſe things, and are as fearful as dogs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not ſet this down as if in other places there were not the like words, but to lay it before you (as a glaſſe) that you may ſee there is <hi>world in you,</hi> and what an unruly tongue you have to powre out evil things. <hi>If any man ſeem religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that mans religion is vain.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe your boaſting and glorying, it is a thing altogether unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a Child of God: The Saints have ſcorn'd and loathed it, 'tis no ſong of Zion; Paradiſe excludes it, in the new Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem are no ſelf-praiſers, but all prayſers of God: 'tis the ſpirit of Antichriſt to ſay, <hi>I am, &amp; none elſe beſides me</hi>: the dialect and tongue of a Phariſie and hypocrite, to ſay, <hi>I am not as other men.</hi> But ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially I muſt tell you of a world and wickedneſs in you, (I ſay not a word of wickedneſs) which is your idle fancies and dreams, Lord, what a deal of froth and foolery is there forth in the world under the name of <hi>William Sedgwick</hi>: and that late <hi>Non-ſenſe, The

Spiritual madman,</hi> ſhews how more &amp; more Satan beguiles you and carries you on with ſtronger deluſions. Now the good God for his Chriſts ſake heal your errour and reſtore you to ſobriety, truth, and the ſpirit of meekneſs.</p>
            <p>Having ended with his Anſwer to the Armies exceptions againſt the Treaty: next he leads it unto <hi>two Objections</hi> mentioned in the Remonſtrance</p>
            <p n="1">1. Their former declaring for the King and compliance with Him, And here he repeates ſome of their words, 1. <hi>Partly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitating us for the preſent prevention of that miſchief to the publick they were running into in that kind as we apprehended.</hi> 2. <hi>That mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration was but hypocritical.</hi> 3. <hi>We aim'd not at the ſtrengthening our ſelves to the ruin of any perſon, but to prevent &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>afterwards you repeat and ſay, 'Twas error, unbelief and carnal counſels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To let paſſe how he ſaies, <hi>There's no kind of men can be ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and neat knaves as a Jeſuit, a Phariſie, an old well-ſtudied-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor of religion</hi>: And alſo his bold ſpeech, <hi>That he knows their waies and hearts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His anſwer contains a threatning, to ſhame them for iniquity of holy things, and to ſhew the abomination of their Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſaith, "It was not their ſin to carry out principles of "goodneſs and tenderneſs to all.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, It was <hi>Jehoſhaphat's</hi> failing, and the Lord blames him for it, ſaying, <hi>Should'ſt thou help the ungodly?</hi> Which ſhews that aid and aſſiſtance yeelded to ſome may be unwarrantable as the caſe ſtands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For his ſaying, <hi>In your turning, now you turn not to God.</hi> The anſwer is, If God juſtifie, who can condemn? His heaping up reproachful words proves nothing, only argues an il govern'd tongue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is the fight of ſin and godly ſorrow for it, <hi>a miſerable and dark principle and a very wicked practice?</hi> We know better: The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and the truth is not in us.</hi> And therefore in the Remonſtrance, they ſpeak as Saints and true Chriſtians, when they ſay, <hi>Wee find matter of acknowledgement before the Lord concerning our error, frailty, unbeleef.</hi> For indeed, the dayes of faith, are as the dayes of the year, ſome
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56574:20"/>
fair ſometimes foule, one while a ſunſhine ſummer, another while a long and tedious winter: A Chriſtian ſoul between faith and fear, is like a piece of Iron between two Loadſtones the one dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing one way the other drawing another way. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. As a valiant man may ſtartle at the ſudden diſcharge of a peece of Ordnance behinde his back, who otherwiſe having time to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and ſummon his ſpirits would not fear to ſtand at the mouth of a charged Cannon in a good cauſe: Thus it is with the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſo it ſeems to be the Armies caſe, a ſudden guſt or ſtorme comming unawares ſtartled them: But ſince the Lord having drawn up their ſpirits, filled what was empty, and laid in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes on their hearts of his preſence and protection: Now they fear not what man can do, but in the ſtrength of God are reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to break through all difficulties, go forward in ſpight of all oppoſition, hold their own, and ſtand faſt in the work, making this uſe and advantage of their former ſlip, to look the better to their ſteps and walkings, and ſeek <hi>in their actings Gods glory the more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Second thing is, The Covenant, which oblieges to the preſervation of the Kings Perſon and Authority. Here (as his manner is) he takes out of the Remonſtrance ſome pieces and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſentences, as that clauſe page 55. <hi>In the preſeruation of true Religion and Liberty of the Kingdom</hi>: ſo page 57. <hi>If it have an evil ſenſe it cals for repentance</hi>: 'twas betwixt <hi>man and man.</hi> Page 59. <hi>And after</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you would exclude God from being any thing but a witneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before I come to his anſwer, I ſhal propound ſome few things to the Readers conſideration:</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Covenant though lawfully made, yet if afterwards it cannot be performed without ſin, in ſuch caſe it binds not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may it be kept: For it is a truth without diſpute, we may not do evil that good may come thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That Covenant is not binding where the condition or thing is not performed upon which the promiſe or tye was made. For inſtance, the people oblieging themſelves, to <hi>preſerve the Perſon of the King and His Authority,</hi> intended withall their own Safety, Liberties, Rights: upon this ground, I ſay, they Covenanted, namely, the <hi>publick ſafety</hi>: ſeeing therefore the publick good is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56574:21"/>
inconſiſtant with the <hi>preſervation of his perſon and authority,</hi> that co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant binds not, <hi>for when ſomething is promiſed for ſuch a cauſe, and afterward is found not to be, that promiſe is void.</hi> ſo <hi>Ameſius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. If men either implicitely or knowingly bind themſelves to breake any Law of God or rule of juſtice, in ſuch a caſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement holds not; ſpecially in that particular, and ſo farre as that clauſe extendeth. To apply it, if men oblige themſelves to preſerve the <hi>Kings Perſon and Authority,</hi> &amp;c. and God in the mean time cals for juſtice, their obligation muſt give place to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</p>
            <p>But it will be objected how <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Elders of the Jews, kept covenant with the <hi>Gibeonites, Joſhua</hi> 9. howſoever devoted to deſtruction. I anſwer, that covenant was lawfull: ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.26. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 11.19, 23. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.12.14. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.1, 2.29, 14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 20.10. By all which places it appeareth that they onely of the <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> were devoted to deſtruction, who did not ſeek for peace; for if they would ſue for it upon theſe conditions, to wit, abjure their idolatry, embrace the true religion of the Jews, and ſubmit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their land, good, and all they had to their dominion it was to be granted them.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It is no binding oath when either there wants po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and right in the adminiſtrator, or the perſons taking it are not capable of the thing put upon them: and here to ſpeake my minde freely, I have not yet ſeen a cleer ground either for the one or other touching that covenant.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Take notiſe when perſons enter into covenant about things, out of their power and right, ſuch covenants are neither lawfull nor to be kept. I would willingly know what was meant by <hi>the preſervation of the Kings perſon and authority</hi>; whether not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the tyranny and oppreſſion he ſhould commit, it was yet intended to preſerve him from juſtice, and to keep him in his place of government; if ſo, then it was an unlawfull co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, proteſtation, oath, becauſe they had no right or power to doe ſuch a thing: it being a thing againſt the Law of God, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and nations, and ſo went beyond their bounds. But if in taking it, it was intended, <hi>by preſerving the perſon of the King, his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, &amp;c.</hi> ſo far as it ſhould be agreeable to juſtice, law, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, it was tolerable, and no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:56574:21"/>Theſe things premiſed, the leſſe will ſerve in reply to his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. 1. To that he ſaith, <hi>God put the preſervation of the Kings life and authority into the covenant on purpoſe to ſave him after all his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings. Anſw.</hi> 1. This is onely his ſaying, and we may deny it with as much reaſon, truth and authority.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If God ſave him not (he means a temporall ſalvation, or elſe ſpeaks impertinently) then he put him not into the covenant for ſuch a purpoſe; for Gods counſel and purpoſe ſhall ſtand.</p>
            <p>But 3. Charity thinks no evil; it is the rule of love when ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches or actions are doubtfull in themſelves, and in their report; and may be taken either well or ill, alwayes to interpret them in the beſt part. <hi>The preſervation of the Kings perſon</hi> is in the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but how? if we will judge charitably (ſeeing nothing is explained) it is thus, the <hi>covenanters</hi> intended the glory of God in the Kings preſervation, that is, oblieged themſelves ſo far as it be lawfull and honorable.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That oaths and covenants ſhould be the main pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of humane ſocieties, we grant, but there is one thing which you ſtill want, and that makes you to erre, namely diſtinctions: doe you mean all covenants and oaths, I deſire to think better of you; and that your meaning is onely juſt ones; but howſoever hereafter learn to make diſtinction, and it will prevent much ſtumbling in you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That theſe are the laſt and perillous times ſpoken of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3 1. we will take it ſo; and doe obſerve your Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>accuſers,</hi> you ſpeak alſo of applying that text; you need not goe farre to make application: for certaine, if your pamphlet were divided into ten parts nine of the ten would be found vile ſlanders, and falſe accuſations. It may be the Lord will ſmite you, and make your heart tender for it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> by this time is neer come to the propoſals, that the Perſon of the King may be brought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to juſtice: but before he takes of that, he tels us, <hi>This is a ſtrange remedy againſt civill wars, to lay aſide treating. Anſw.</hi> 1. We may well deſire to have that laid aſide, which we aſſuredly know was deviſed and carried on to the prejudice and hurt of the publick, and ſo a <hi>remedy worſe then the diſeaſe.</hi> 2. You miſtake your ſelf to ſay, <hi>treating is laid aſide,</hi> for tis neither ſo nor ſo: unleſſe you will ſay, that a ſick man
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:56574:22"/>
layes aſide the meanes and remedy of health, when he refuſeth bloody and murderous mountebancks and quackſalvers, and make choiſe of honeſt able and faithfull phiſitians.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Speaking to the Army, you ſay of the King, <hi>pag.</hi> 41. <hi>Jf he were in power you would ſhrinke out of the Kingdom. Anſw.</hi> 1. Jn this you ſhew much lightneſſe and contradiction, ſay and unſay, and indeed know not what you ſay: ſometimes in your prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall fooleries you cry up the King, that when he comes again to be in power, he ſhall be meek, mercifull, full of divine goodneſſe, and in particular doe aſſure the ſoldiers that he will forget the wrong they have done him; and here you threaten them, <hi>if he were in power they would ſhrinke out of the kingdome.</hi> But 2. J verily beleeve (howſoever like <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> probably he knew not what he ſaid, yet) in this he ſpeaks the very truth, that is, <hi>if he were in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,</hi> honeſt men would ſhrinke out of the Kingdome. For as a Lyon at liberty, after ſome reſtraint, is more fierce, cruel, bloody then he was before; ſo he, following the ſteps of former tyrants, would exerciſe more cruelty outrage and oppreſſion then ever he did before he was hunted, taken, and ſhut up. That is a remarke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſage in the ſeventh book of the <hi>Remembrances of Monluc</hi> one of the Marſhals of <hi>France,</hi> and a profeſt Papiſt, ſpeaking of the <hi>maſſacre at</hi> Paris, <hi>The King,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>never forgot the chaſe that the Admiral gave him from</hi> Meaux <hi>to</hi> Paris, <hi>ſwifter then ordinary, kings ſooner forget a good piece of ſervice then any offence.</hi> Afterwards he ſaith, <hi>J wonder how a man ſo wiſe as the Admirall in worldly matters, could truſt the King, but he paid well for it, for it coſt him his life and many more.</hi> This witneſſe is true, and this thing well to be thought of by his <hi>Excellency,</hi> Lieut. Gen. <hi>Cromwell,</hi> and ſuch men: for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident J am, were this King againe in his power, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his promiſes, proteſtations, oathes, he would not forget how they chaſed him in ſuch a place, made him run for it at ſuch a time; and they ſhould be ſerved juſt as the <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of France</hi> was, if he could not be revenged on them ſome other way.</p>

               <hi>George Bucanan</hi> (King <hi>James</hi> his own tutor) records a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtory to ſhew the falſhood and diſſimulation of Princes in their treaties with the people. <hi>Durſtus the eleventh king of Scotland,</hi> giving himſelf to all deboiſtneſſe, firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> baniſhed his
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56574:22"/>
fathers friends from him, as the troubleſome reprehenders of his pleaſures, and ſending for the moſt vicious young men to be his companions, gave himſelf to luxury and venery; he proſtituted his wife (daughter to the King of <hi>Britain</hi>) to his companions, and baniſhed her. At laſt the Nobles conſpiring againſt him, he awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king as it were out of ſleep, conſidering that he ſhould find no place of ſafety, neither at home nor abroad, being equally hated of ſtrangers and ſubjects, thought beſt to counterfeit repentance of his former life, for ſo he might retain his Crown, and afflict puniſhments on his enemies. Wherefore recalling his wife from exile, he firſt of all endeavored to reconcile himſelf to the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>: then calling the chiefeſt of his ſubjects to him, he ratified with a moſt ſolemn oath the oblivion of his former courſes, he committed every moſt wicked perſon to priſon, as if he reſerved them for puniſhment, and religiouſly promiſed, that he would <hi>do nothing hereafter, but by the advice of his Nobles.</hi> When by theſe things he had given aſſurance of his ſincere mind, he celebrated the agreement with paſtimes, banquets, and other ſignes of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick gladneſſe: and now all mens minds being taken up with joy, he called moſt of the Nobility to a Supper; where, when he had ſhut them up (improvident and unarmed) in one room, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his aſſaſnates, he ſlew them every one. But what follwed, this inhumane action ſo incenſed and exaſperated the reſt with new flames of wrath and revenge, as (<hi>ad muiſum portentum tollen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, eonjurantibus</hi>) all agreeing together to take away this dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted monſter; gathered a great army and ſlew him in battle with his wicked confederates.</p>
            <p>The like falſhood and diſſimulation he ſets down of <hi>James</hi> the <hi>Third King of Scotland,</hi> upon promiſe of reformation, the Nobles diſmiſſed him, but he immediatly falſified his oath, &amp; thought upon nothing but revenge, blood, and ſlaughter: whereupon, knowing him to be ſo falſe and perfideous, they would yeild to no terms of peace, but ſlew him in battle as a common enemy. I ſhall cloſe this point with <hi>Bodins</hi> Obſervation, <hi>If a Tyrant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>he but ſhaken and not quite overthrown, he will commit horrible murders of the beſt Citizens, to ſatisfie and ſettle his tyrrany: For a tyrant that hath eſaped the hands of ſuch as had conſpired againſt him, he becomes mad and furious like a wild beaſt, that ſees his own blood.

Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> took away the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood which <hi>Joab ſhed</hi> from him and the houſe of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Thus the fierce wrath and anger of the Lord was turned away from Iſrael when they took the heads of the people and hanged them up before the Lord againſt the ſun, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.4.

Thus we ſee what Gods will is to appeaſe wrath, and what the people of God have formerly done, and therein pleaſed the Lord. To ſay therefore as he doth, <hi>'Tis ſuch u ſacrifice as was never yet by the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt heathens invented.</hi> It ſhews his ignorance, not only in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane hiſtory, but his great contradiction and oppoſition to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred truth, and his ſeeking to have the land remain defiled and full of blood and other pollutions, that God may yet plague us yet ſeven times more: Beſides, there is nothing here propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and deſired by the Army, but what the Parliament hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved long ſince in the <hi>Declaration of Auguſt</hi> 18. 1642. in theſe poſitive words: <hi>The Lords and Commons Aſſembled in Parliament, do declare, That all ſuch perſons as ſhall upon any pretence whatſoever, aſſiſt His Majeſtie in this Warre with Horſe, Arms, Plate, or Money are Traytors to His Majeſtie, the Parliament, and Kingdom, and ſhall be brought to condigne puniſhment for ſo great an Offence.</hi> And this they have ſince ſeconded in ſundry other Declarations and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachments. Fourthly. For that moſt notorious falſhood of his (becauſe his <hi>Excellency</hi> and the Councel

of war crave that juſtice may be done) to ſay, <hi>It is the foule and black deſign of a few unbeleeving people.</hi> I let it paſſe, the Lord I know will rebuke him for it, For as in this, ſo in all the reſt he manifeſts himſelf to be one of that number, <hi>who have ſaid with our tongue, we will prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> But for the perſons upon whom you have laid ſo grievous an aſperſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, this is their comfort and rejoycing in the Lord, that as God knowes their hearts ſo he knowes the ſincerity and ſingleneſſe of them, that they look at his glory in ſeeking after the publick good. As the clouds can neither leſſen the light of the ſun, nor let the courſe thereof, becauſe at the laſt they are ſcattered by the heat of the ſun which ſhineth out moſt comfortable: So the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency of their perſons and juſtneſſe of their cauſe, ſhal diſperſe and drive away all black clouds of calumniations, and <hi>the mouth of him that ſpeaketh lies ſhall be ſtopt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we come to the great work propounded in the <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, That that Capitall and grand author of our troubles, the Perſon of the King may be brought to Juſtice, for the Treaſon, Blood, and Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, he is there guilty of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I find Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> in his anſwer to ſay very little to it. But 1. <hi>That no Law takes hold of the King.</hi> 2. <hi>The crown is his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right and inheritance</hi>: for the reſt it is either a juſtification of the King, as to be better then they: or bitter reproaches.</p>
            <p>Becauſe this is a high ſubject, and a buſineſſe a foote, I ſhall therefore ſpeak the more largely to it, not <hi>de facto</hi> but <hi>de jure</hi>: for the <hi>Treaſon, Blood, &amp;c.</hi> laid to the King: I ſhall leave that charge to others more concerned in it, only I ſhall ſhew what juſtly and lawfully may be done in ſuch a caſe.</p>
            <p>And for the Readers clearer information and better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the point, I ſhall here aſſert 5. things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, That there is a ſupream and Soveraigne power alwayes reſiding in the people above Kings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That all Kings, in all places, and at all times, have been, and ſtill are ſubject to, and under Law.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, That the people have the power, not onely to call their Kings to an account, but to cenſure and remove them for their tyranny and miſgovernment.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, That no nation is ſo tied to any form of civill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56574:24"/>
but that it is lawfull for the people to alter it into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother form or kind upon occaſion.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, That amongſt all the formes of civil Government, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtocraticall or popular is beſt and ſafeſt for the people.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, That every Magiſtrate, (be he Emperor or King) is inferior to the whole Kingdome and people, it may plainly be demonſtrated.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe he is not only their ſervant, but creature too, being originally created by, and for them: now as every creator is of greater power and authority then its creature, and every cauſe greater then its effect, ſo the authority and power of the people, which creates the Prince and his princely power, and enlargeth, limits, or reſtrains it, as there is cauſe, muſt needs be greater then the Prince or royal power. And though Principallities, (as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally conſidered) be of God, yet the conſtitution of Princes and their ſeverall degrees of power are meerly from men: hence it is that <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaking of Kings and their ſupremacy, cals them <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> every <hi>creature</hi> or <hi>ordinance of man.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. becauſe originally inſtituted, limitted, and continued, by, and for the uſe and ſervice of the people, whoſe creatures (as we ſaid) miniſters and ſervants they are, and ought to be, and from them receive their whole juriſdiction, power, and authority.</p>
            <p>Beſides howbeit principallities as generally conſidered, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of God, yet the conſtitution of all Princes and their ſeverall degrees of power are meerly from men: and this cannot with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhew of reaſon be denied. For if the regall authority of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were meerly from the Law of God and nature, it ſhould be the ſame, and like it ſelf in all Kingdomes; but tis not the ſame and like it ſelf in all kingdomes, but as every people pleaſe and make a free choiſe of: nevertheleſſe every form and kinde of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is equally lawfull, and good in it ſelf (whether Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, Ariſtocratie or Democratie) as all, on all ſides doe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. It is a thing neither probable nor credible, that any free people, when they voluntarily incorporated themſelves into Kingdomes, of their own accord ſet up an elective King over them, that there was ſuch ſtupidity and madneſſe in them, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to reſigne up their ſoveraign and popular power, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56574:24"/>
&amp; right to Kings and their heires for ever, &amp; to give them an entire, full, and incontroulable ſupremacie over them, and ſo to make the creature inferior to the creator, the derivative grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the primative, the ſervants more potent then themſelves, and thus of free men to make themſelves ſlaves, and for their more ſafety to be more enſlaved. But the contrary appears by the peoples conſtant practiſe in all ages, as we ſhall manifeſt hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>But admit (which with ſence cannot be imagined) that ſuch a thing had been ſo, yet the Fathers could not take in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity with them: neither oblige them any way in point of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and conſcience, to confirm and obſerve what they fooliſhly had done: but their children afterwards might lawfully; yea, and ought to ſtand faſt in the liberty which the law of God, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and nations had made them free, and not be entangled in the ſlaviſh yoke and bondage of their fore-fathers. Hence <hi>Ameſius</hi> in his <hi>caſes of Conſcience,</hi> lib 5. cap. 22. Qu. 2. reſolves, that <hi>all fatherly power is in procuring the good of children,</hi> and ſhewes in the next cha. <hi>That liberty in naturall eſtimation is next to life it ſelf, and of many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Common reaſon, Law, and experience manifeſts that the whole or greateſt part in all publick or naturall bodies is of greater excellency, power, and juriſdiction then any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culer member. Thus in all corporations the court of Aldermen and common-councel is of greater power then the <hi>Major</hi> alone, though the chief officer: ſo the whole bench then the Lord chief Juſtice; and the whole Councel then the Preſident. And it is <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtotles</hi> expreſſe determination, <hi>Polit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. what forme of government ſoever it be; <hi>whatſoever ſeemes good to the major part of the people, that is more excellent, and to be preferred before any part or member thereof; and that it is unfit the part ſhould be before the whole</hi>: and he gives for it his reaſon thus, <hi>The people know what is profitable, neceſſary, and good for them, better then their Kings, who are their publick miniſters</hi>: and thus conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, <hi>itaque majorum rerum poteſtas jure populo tribuitur.</hi> Therefore power of the greater things is by right the peoples.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This may alſo appear by the hiſtories and records of all Kingdoms in the world, where Tyrants forc't not in by conqueſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56574:25"/>
and held not poſſeſſion afterwards by force. In the Romane ſtate both under their Kings and Emperors, the chief power in all things of higheſt concernment, was alwayes in the Senate and people; and ſo much <hi>Bodin</hi> grants, <hi>That the people hadt he chief So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign power of enacting and confirming Lawes, the Senates decrees being of no validity, unleſſe the people ratified them, and if any of their Kings, Conſuls, Emperors, or Generals did things without their conſent (as making war, concluding peace, &amp;c.) it did not bind but was meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly voyd, unleſſe the Senate and people together in a great aſsembly ratified the ſame by a publick Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to let paſſe forreign examples, our anceſtors in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, (which ſhewes what power was inveſted in the whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the people) have not only conſtrained our Kings by threats yea, force of armes to ſummon and continue Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe compelled them to give their royal aſſents to <hi>Magna Charta, Charta de Foreſta, Confirmatio Chartarum, Articuli ſuper Chart as,</hi> with ſundry other publick ſtatutes of right and juſtice for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, and the ſubjects ſafety; and to ratify them with their hands, ſeales, oathes, proclamations, againſt their will and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, which forced aſſents have been afterward juſtified, and held good in law, to bind theſe kings and their followers to the due obſervation thereof; for where the lawes are convenient, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or eſſentiall for the Kingdomes welfare, the Subjects juſt liberty, and ſafety, and ſuch as the King by duty and oath is bound to aſſent to, there if they compel the King to give his aſſent in caſe of denyal the aſſent is binding, and ſhall not be voyd by <hi>Dureſse,</hi> becauſe the King doth no more then he is obliged by oath law and duty to condiſcend unto, and the people (whoſe power is above him) may juſtly require.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And now in anſwer to Mr. <hi>Sedgwick</hi> affirming the <hi>Crown to be the Kings birth-right,</hi> a thing which I utterly deny, and have clear reaſons againſt it.</p>
            <p>For 1. Howſoever here in England the Crown hath gon often by diſcent, yet never was it granted abſolute ſucceſſive, and hereta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry but arbitrary and elective. Hence many of our Kings have come to the crown without any hereditary title by the peoples free election, and afterward obeyed as lawful Kings.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Anno.</hi> 975. after <hi>Edgars</hi> diſeaſe not <hi>Ethelred</hi> the heir to the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56574:25"/>
former King but <hi>Edward</hi> crowned. So <hi>Edmund</hi> heir to King <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelred</hi> refuſed, and <hi>Canutus</hi> a ſtranger elected, and crowned. So <hi>Edmund</hi> and <hi>Alfred</hi> both heirs, ſet a ſide, and <hi>Harald</hi> and <hi>Hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knute</hi> elected and crowned Kings. I might alſo ſhew how upon the death of King <hi>Harald</hi> it was enacted by the Engliſh Nobility That <hi>none of the Daniſh blood ſhould any more reign after them.</hi> So after <hi>William the firſt,</hi> not <hi>Robert</hi> the elder brother but <hi>Rufus</hi> the younger brother choſen: So after the deſeaſe of <hi>Richard the firſt, John Earl of Morton</hi> was crowned and <hi>Arthur</hi> the right heir refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
            <p>The like might be manifeſted of other nations how their kings did not reign heretarily and by ſucceſſion from father to ſonne, but thoſe were choſen Kings amongſt them which were held worthy, which election was made by the people, and revoka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by them at any time: and whenſoever the Crown went now and then by ſucceſſion, it was by uſurpation rather than right. From humane Hiſtories we might come to the holy Scriptures, and ſhew that the original creation and conſtitution of the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> Kingdoms proceeded only from the authority and power of the people, and that ſolely by Divine permiſſion rather than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, as is apparant by <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.14, 15.</p>
            <p>And howſoever the Lord did ſomtimes immediatly nominate the perſons of thoſe that ſhould reign over them, as <hi>Saul, David, Jehu, Jeroboam &amp;c.</hi> yet the people did conſtantly confirme and make them Kings, and gave them their royal authority, none being made Kings by Divine appointment, but ſuch as they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly accepted, approved, and confirmed to be kings; Gods previous deſignation being but a preparative to their voluntary and free election.</p>
            <p>Moreover, It is very cleer that the kings of Judah and Iſrael were ſubordinate in power to the people, and not only counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but uſually over-rul'd by them, in al matters of publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment; for though they asked a king, yet they reſerved ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authority to themſelves, to reſtrain him, and to order and diſpoſe of the publick affairs as they thought good. But theſe things we have reſerved to a larger treatiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Howſoever, <hi>Bodin</hi> contrary to <hi>Ariſtotle, Tacitus, Lipſius, Toloſo, Machavel, Kirchnerus</hi> and the greateſt Polititions prefers
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56574:26"/>
ſucceſſion before election of Kings and inſtanceth ſeveral nations to be heretary; yet this I ſay, <hi>quo jure?</hi> from the beginning it was not ſo, for every heretary Crown, is through cuſtom not of right, howſoever people have let it paſſe, and admitted them in ſuch a way, yet this hath been ſtill in the people a free act, and it was in their liberty and power to have choſen any other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Whereas ſome Kings require an oath of their ſubjects, that their heirs and ſucceſſors ſhall enjoy the Crown after them, and the grounds of taking this oath, is, upon an opinion that the Crown goes by ſucceſſion from father to child (ſo that in their underſtanding they give not any thing away from themſelves, but only acknowledg what they conceive the perſon already is) Now this oath being given, and taken upon a falſe ground can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bind in point of conſcience, becauſe if they knew it was not the others right they would not ſwear, neither meant they in the leaſt to paſs away any thing of their own right, for they thought it was the others properly before.</p>
            <p>And here by the way, obſerve how vain and groundleſſe that common queſtion <hi>(pro and con)</hi> is amongſt Polititians, Statiſts, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilians, and ſome Divines, whether ſucceſſion or election be the better, as if truly and rightly there were ſome ſuch thing as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, whereas it is neither ſo nor ſo. I confeſſe after a Kings deſeaſe, the people may elect and crown the ſon and his ſons ſon, but that any ſuch thing can be claimed or chalenged as a <hi>birth-right,</hi> it is altogether untrue, there is no Kingdom in the world where the crown deſcends from the father to the ſon by any true and proper ſucceſſion: the moſt that can be is not <hi>ſimple</hi> ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but a ſucceſſion limitable and conditional, that is a promiſe on the peoples part (for ſome conſiderable cauſes) that the ſon ſhall be crowned after the fathers death if he be fit to govern, and they ſee it is for their good. But that any people ſhould abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely bind themſelves to have the ſon reign over them after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death ſhould he be a fool, a knave, a madman, a tyrant, either ſuch a thing was never meant, or if it were ever ſo, ſuch people therein ſhewed themſelves either to be fools, knaves, madmen, or children, as doing a thing againſt all reaſon, all right, the manifeſt law of God, and very light of nature.</p>
            <p>And this we further add, That whatſoever covenants or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:56574:26"/>
have been between former Kings and our Anceſtors about ſucceſſion, and what acts of Parliament, laws, ſtatutes they have made about it, they are no way binding to us, neither are we thereto related or concern'd in the ſame. If two men make a contract together, that the ſon of the one ſhall marry the others daughter, if theſe children be under age, they have liberty and power (eſpecially their fathers being dead) to do as they think good being come to age, neither doth that pre-contract binde them, but they are ſtill free, and may diſpoſe of themſelves as they ſee good, that is, they have liberty and power to marry any other if they ſee it more convenient and neceſſary. So I confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently affirm, whatſoerer <hi>Crown Contract</hi> hath been made by our forefathers in our non-age, pitch where you will touching this ſucceſſion, we have our liberty to take or refuſe and are in point of conſcience no more bound to crown the heir of <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerer, Henry</hi> the <hi>Eight, James the Sixt of Scotland,</hi> or this King <hi>Charles</hi> than any other man: but if we will (to be like other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) ſtill have a King, ſuch then is our liberty and freedome now, that we may (yea and ought) to elect and crown ſuch a one whom we ſhall find to be beſt qualified and fitteſt for us.</p>
            <p>Now we come to the next general Head, That Kings are, and ought to be bound by Lawes, and are not to be exempted from them. I ſhall not at this time ſhew the flattery and vanity of ſome Sycophants and Paraſites, who affirm, that <hi>people may not preſcribe any law to their Prince:</hi> that <hi>Kings are above law</hi>: Now touching that ſenſeleſſe diſtinction of <hi>Bodin</hi> and others, who hold that the Supream Magiſtrate, howſoever bound to the laws of God, of Nature, and Nations, yet are free from all Civil laws preſcribed by themſelves: nor that Court deſtinction between <hi>Law directive, and coactive,</hi> what Kings ſhould doe; and what Kings may do: This I ſay with <hi>Pareus, Superior Magiſtratus eſt ſubjectus legibus divinis &amp; ſuae</hi> republicae: <hi>The ſupream Magiſtrate is ſubject to Gods laws, and to the lawes of his own Common-wealth. Comment: in Rom. C.</hi> 13. <hi>dub.</hi> 6. yea, more ſtrictly obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his own lawes than ſubjects, and departing from the law becomes a Tyrant: and therefore the whole kingdom which is above the King, may not only bind him by laws, but queſtion
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56574:27"/>
him, and puniſh him for the breach of them: And this is a moſt certain truth (howſoever by ſome ſlaviſh pens oppoſed) that all Kings are ſo far bound to the laws and cuſtoms of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, that if they violate and alter them at their pleaſure, they may truly be called Tyrants according to <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in abſolve their people from their aleagence which they have made unto them. Take for inſtance, the <hi>united Netherland Provences,</hi> who for this very cauſe did declare <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> to have fallen and cut himſelfe off from the Seignorie of the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and cauſed a new form of an oath to be drawn in manner of an abjuration of the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> every one ſwearing duty and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience unto the Eſtates by the publick officers and magiſtrates of every town and province, the which thing was, and ſtill is by all Proteſtants and reformed Churches juſtified and approved lawful.</p>
            <p>I could here ſet down many ſuch examples of other Nations, who by their lawes required their Kings to be ſubject to their lawes aſwell as any other, yea all nations (except where tyrants have reigned) have alwaies had ſome lawe to reſtrain their kings from exceſſes and abuſive courſes. Beſides all good Emperours and Kings in all ages have profeſſed and practiſed the ſame. <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> acknowledged that the <hi>Prince was not above law</hi>: and giving the Sword to any Praetor or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander, he would ſay, <hi>Hoc gladio contra me utitur, ſi in rempublicam peccavero.</hi> The like ſaid <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> and <hi>Valentinian,</hi> Emperours: <hi>Digna eſt vox Majeſtate reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantis in legibus alligatum ſe Principem profiteri. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap. d. leg. prin.</hi> So <hi>Antiochus the Third,</hi> King of <hi>Aſia,</hi> is, commended that he writ to all the Cities of his kingdom, <hi>If there ſhould be any thing in his letters which ſhould ſeem contrary to the Laws they ſhould not obey them.</hi> Theſe men knew it is God only that may do in heaven and in earth what he pleaſeth, as for man (whether Emperour or King) he is under law and therefore muſt do nothing but what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, juſt, and right.</p>
            <p>And for more authentick proofe we could produce the Kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> who had no arbitrary power to do what they pleaſed nor exempted from laws, but inferiour too and obliged by them as well as ſubjects: this is evident by ſundry impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble texts, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.18, 19. <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.1.8. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.11. <hi>to</hi> 19. and 12.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56574:27"/>
14, 15.20 &amp;c. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.18. The Jewiſh Doctors from theſe words <hi>I will viſit their tranſgreſſion with the rod of men, and with the ſtripes of the children of men.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. write that it was a cuſtom in Iſrael, <hi>If their Kings tranſgreſſed againſt the law of the King, they were to be ſcourged for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the queſtion is not ſo much, whether Kings are under law (for this now begins now to be generally granted) but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, If Kings do break law, what's their puniſhment, and who ſhal do it. The anſwer to this belongs properly to the next point yet ſomething I ſhall ſay to it in this place. For my part I have not yet ſeen in any mans writing, new or old (though never ſo great a <hi>Kingſ-man</hi>) any cleer and convincing reaſon, that ſeeing Kings are ſubject to laws, both the law of God and of men, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould have any immunity or be priviledged from pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment appointed by law to ſuch and ſuch offences more than other men. Plainly thus, If King or Prince be a Murderer, a Traytor, a Pirate, an Adulterer, perjured &amp;c. why the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to other murderers, traytors &amp;c. and for the like crimes inflicted upon them ſhould not be executed upon the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, King, or Prince, what the cuſtom hath been, or what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial laws fooliſh &amp; ignorant men have made, I count as nothing let reaſon, juſtice, &amp; Divine precepts be conſidered. Hence let us take light and information. Firſt, as for the law of God, it goes generally and takes all in, <hi>quiſquis, ſiquis quicunque: whoſoever, if any man, what manſoever,</hi> if a murderer, an adulterer &amp;c. let him die the death: Kings and Princes are not here exempted.</p>
            <p>And Secondly, In the point of Juſtice, 'tis without any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. For <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is <hi>Juſtice</hi> of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>to part,</hi> or <hi>divide in two.</hi> Hence <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Judge,</hi> (as it were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) becauſe he cuts a thing in two equal parts. So in the definition, Juſtice is <hi>Perpetua conſtanſque voluntas jusſuam unicuique tribuens.</hi> And for diſtributive juſtice which according to Logicians is, either rewarding or puniſhing this later Judicatory Juſtice is, <hi>qua Paenis debitas aequalitur unicui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que diſtribuit,</hi> which diſtributeth due Puniſhment equally to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. Again, If the offender becauſe he is great, (as a king or prince) ſhould therefore be ſpared, it were directly to depart from <hi>Juſtice</hi> both in propriety of ſpeech &amp; true definition <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is a right judgment not reſpecting the perſon, to wit
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56574:28"/>
for his greatneſſe, power, place, wealth &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For Reaſons I have this to ſay, Wherefore Kings ſhould be puniſhed according to law if not more yet as much as other men. 1 Becauſe by their ill example they do more hurt than other men. 2. Their ſins do more provoke God and draw down Divine wrath upon a nation and therfore there is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reaſon that the Land ſhould be purged of ſuch pollutions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The taking of this courſe would be very much for the publick good and ſafety: for if princes knew they ſhould be puniſhed as other men for their crimes according to law, they would be as careful as other men to obſerve and keep the ſame.</p>
            <q>Oderunt peccare mali formidine paenae.</q>
            <p n="4">4. The practiſe of this would be a very helpfull means to ſave their ſouls; for whence comes it to paſs, that they care not what they doe, but becauſe whatſoever they doe, they know no man will puniſh them for it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If this courſe were taken, there would not be ſuch horrid and execrable wayes uſed to get Crowns, as poyſning and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of fathers, brethren, &amp;c. but conſcience then, and a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to do good, would be the chiefeſt motives leading men ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In conſtitution of a Prince, whatſoever is confirmed upon a man in reſpect of office and authority, it doth not any way make a change upon his Perſon, neither puts him at any diſtance touching ſubjection to the Law more then he was before; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates only to a qualification, that is, the people judging him to be fit, he is inveſted with a power and right to adminiſter juſtice; but for his perſonall eſtate that remaines the ſame as formerly, neither is he by this exempted from Law either directive or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, more then when a man is made a Judge, Juſtice of peace, or the like.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, Civil Magiſtrates, and Church officers are alike; what office or function ſoever a man hath in the Church of God, he is ſtill under the power of the Church, and for his perſon, the <hi>Church-cenſure</hi> can reach him ſtill as it did before. For the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Paſtors, Teachers, or Elders, doth not in the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt or priviledge ſuch ecleſiaſticall officers, from the higheſt cenſure of the Church more then any other member, if there be
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56574:28"/>
juſt cauſe to proceed againſt them. And there is ſomething to this purpoſe in the <hi>Popiſh Cannon Law, how in caſe of hereſie the</hi> Pope <hi>ceaſeth</hi> ipſo facto <hi>to be</hi> Pope, <hi>looſeth his ſpirituall juriſdiction and authority, and deſerveth juſtly to be really depoſed.</hi> Can. ſi. papa 40. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer. Azorius Antonine 3. part: ſhewing that the office of a Pope adds nothing to the perſon of the man, for howſoever he is above the reſt for his place, yet he is ſtill ſubject to the Law, and under cenſure; yea, to be deprived of juriſdiction and Papacie, in caſe he prove an heretick.</p>
            <p>For concluſion then, this I poſitively affirm, and will ſtand to it, <hi>Where Kings are under Law, and receive their Crownes from the people upon proteſtation and oath to keep the Laws, and where the ſupream Soveraign power of a nation is inveſted in the Senate and people, there Kings for their Tyranny and miſgovernment may be convented, judged, and puniſhed: neither are they more exempted from the higheſt civill pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment then Ecleſiaſticall officers are from the</hi> higheſt Church-cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>their perſons are ſtill in the ſame conſideration as other mens perſons are, and therefore for their tranſgreſſions (as other men) may be judged and puniſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to come to the third particular, which is, <hi>That the people have power not only to convent, but to cenſure, depoſe, and puniſh their Kings for their Tyranny and miſgovernment.</hi> For the confirmation of this, I ſhall deſire the Reader to take notiſe: 1. What reaſons there are for it. 2. What Law. 3. What Scripture proof. 4. What prefidents and examples both of other nations, and Kingdomes, as likewiſe of our own. 5. And laſtly, what the judgment is of learned men touching this thing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1. It is an undoubted rule of divinity and policie, that it is more expedient that one man die (though a Prince or King) then the whole nation ſhould periſh. <hi>John</hi> 11.50. &amp; 18.14. If the right eye, or right hand offend, it muſt be pluckt out and cut off: as in the naturall body if a member be ſo corrupt and putrified, that unleſſe it be taken away the whole body is in danger to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, in ſuch a caſe for prevention and health ſake, every one wil allow the cutting it off: ſo in the politick body, when the ſafety of the whole lies in the removing of one or more unfound and bad members, it muſt be don, and it is neceſſary it ſhould be ſo: for it is a <hi>maxime</hi> in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> that <hi>totum non ſubjicitur parti, ſed
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56574:29"/>
pars toti</hi>; ſo again, <hi>totum non regitur motu partis, ſed pars totius,</hi> to which that is agreeable in the <hi>Poet:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>— immedicabile vulnus</l>
                  <l>En ſe recidendum eſt, ne pars ſincera trahetur.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2. Kings being the people officers, miniſters, creatures (as we ſaid) it muſt needs follow that they are reſponſable to their maſters and makers, and being found unfaithfull ſtewards, they have power to diſplace them of their truſt and office. If the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of a city or caſtle be committed to a man, and he betrayes the ſame to the enemy, or diſmantles the wals and fortifications, to expoſe it unto danger, is it queſtionable in ſuch a caſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the State putting him into that truſt, may not call him to an account, and puniſh him juſtly for it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3. When two men contract and covenant together upon certain conditions and termes, if one party break the agreement, the other is ſet free, and no further bound to him either in point of Law or conſcience. When Kings break their coronation oaths and promiſes, keep not the conditions and termes upon which they were elected and crowned, but become tyrants, the bond and knot between ſubjects and them is eſſentially broken, neither is there any tribute, duty, cuſtome, or alleagance, &amp;c. from the people any further due unto them.</p>
            <p>I know no faſter bond or knot between any two parties, then man and wife; the relation between Kings and ſubjects I am ſure is not neerer, nevertheleſſe all grant <hi>adulterium etiam vinculum ipſum matrimonii ſolvit,</hi> adultery in either perſon breaks even that very bond and knot of marriage: why therefore a ſubject breaking his covenant with the King, in being a traitor, ſhould be puniſhed for it, and the King breaking his covenant with the people in proving a tyrant or traitor to the people ſhould not be puniſhed likewiſe: I am ſure there is no man living able to give a juſt reaſon for it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. If men by Law may be puniſhed; yea, and great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment is inflicted upon them, who are onely as inſtruments u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by Princes, to accompliſh their wicked deſignes and meerely act to pleaſe them; ſurely it is againſt juſtice, reaſon, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that the firſt mover and grand author ſhould eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed; Gods example teacheth otherwiſe, who in all ages
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56574:29"/>
hath puniſhed the author of ſinne more ſeverely and extreamly then the inſtrument; we ſee many times the adulterous mother puniſhed for her whoredome, yet the baſtard ſpared, but that the baſtard ſhould ſuffer and the mother eſcape it is an example un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Howſoever men may remit the wrong or injury, as it it in reference to themſelves and their own intereſt, nevertheleſſe as the tranſgreſſion reſpecteth Gods Law, and ſo far as God cals for judgment and puniſhment, it is not in their power to ſpare or pardon, though they may doe with their own what they will, yet what is the Lords they may not alter, mitigate, qualifie, &amp;c. but they ought to proceed according to the directions and rules which he hath preſcribed to them, I ſay, without addition, or dimunition, ſtrictly, punctually and preciſely. I ſhall end this point with the words of <hi>Bodin: I am of opinion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that no Soveraign Prince, neither yet any man alive can pardon the puniſhment due unto the offence which is by the Law of God death, no more then he can diſpenſe with the Law of God, whereunto he is himſelf ſubject: And if it be ſo, that the Magiſtrate deſerve capitall puniſhment, which deſpenſeth with the Law of his King, how ſhall it be lawfull for a Soveraign Prince to diſpenſe with his ſubjects from the Law of God? And further, if the Prince himſelf cannot give away the leaſt civil intereſt of his ſubjects, or pardon the wrong don to another man, how can he pardon the</hi> wrong don unto ALMIGHTY GOD, <hi>or murder wilfully committed, which by the Law is death, for all the pardon he can give.</hi> vide lib. 1. de Reip. cap. 10.</p>
            <p>Secondly, As for Lawyers law, it is juſt like Mr. <hi>William Prin,</hi> it ſpeaks every thing, and any thing, and nothing: Thus their law and he, are like the <hi>Dutch mans hoſe,</hi> you may wear them how you will, put them up or down, for they are made to ſerve both wayes: but for that whirligig and <hi>buſie body</hi> I do but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him by the way, for there is an <hi>Independant piece</hi> comming forth <hi>to ſhew</hi> his lightneſſe, contradiction, extreme pride and malice.</p>
            <p>What puniſhment by law is due unto a <hi>Traytor,</hi> it is ſo obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well known, as to cite Statutes for it, would be, but as a vain repetition: Now the Law cleerly reſolves 28. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>C.</hi> 7 That. <hi>if the King become an open enemy to the kingdom and ſubjects, to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:56574:30"/>
waſt or ruin them, or ſhall ſeek to betray them to a forraign nation he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a traytor to the realm, and hereupon doth forfeit his very title to the Crown. Bracton</hi> ſaith the King, <hi>is the higheſt Juſtiticiar in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: Licet in juſtitia recipienda minimo de regno ſuo comparitur, but as low as any in receiving juſtice. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. <hi>fol.</hi> 167. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This indeed is law, for what is law (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) according to the ſtrict Etimologie a proper ſignification, but an equal diſtributing to every one his own, whether it be reward or puniſhment; and therefore whenſoever any thing hath been enacted to priviledge kings and princes from perſonal puniſhment, in caſe they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed againſt God and men, and ſhould prove Tyrants, Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, Murderers, Pirates, Witches and what not, I do avouch, it was no law, to ſpeak truly and properly, it was not <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as contrary to the law of God, and nature as light is to darkneſſe; and theſe were right <hi>Antinomians,</hi> as oppoſing and denying <hi>law</hi> to eſtabliſh their own wicked and lawleſſe decree: <hi>Law,</hi> is <hi>ratio naturalis,</hi> natural reaſon, but it is no principle in nature, to puniſh the leſſer, theft, murder, treaſon, tyranny &amp;c. and ſpare the greater theeves, murderers, &amp;c. to execute the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard and quit the mother as we ſaid before.</p>
            <p>Again, 'Tis without diſpute, when Princes prove Tyrants, their depoſition is juſtificable by law. Now to know a Tyrant King <hi>James</hi> deſcribes him thus: <hi>A King governing in a ſetled king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ceaſeth to he a King and degenerates into a Tyrant ſo ſoon as hee leaves to rule by his own laws.</hi> If this be true, (as it is moſt true:) then it is the higheſt degree of Tyranny, condemned and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by God and all good men, when the King begins to invade his ſubjects perſons, rights, liberties &amp;c. to ſet up an arbitrary power impoſeth unlawful taxes, raiſes forces, plunders waſteth and ſpoils his kingdom, impriſons, kills, and baniſheth his moſt faithful &amp; beſt people in an hoſtile and wrathful manner, whom he ought to protect and rule in peace: and whether this King have not thus done, even our enemies themſelves being judges?</p>
            <p>There is one thing remarkable in the aforeſaid ſpeech, where he ſaies, <hi>He ceaſeth to be a King.</hi> Hence I gather, that a King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating into a Tyrant, hath no benefit, nor any thing to help himſelf in point of law, by any Statute containing an immunity or exemption of the Kings perſon from puniſhment, as death it
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56574:30"/>
ſelf: for whatſoever is provided in ſuch a caſe it is only in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to a King, but when <hi>he ceaſeth to be a King,</hi> he loſeth the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of all ſuch <hi>acts of Parliament,</hi> neither is there any Statute bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken if he perſonally ſuffer for his crimes.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, For Scripture proof or preſidents, <hi>Zuinglius</hi> poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirms, that the Iſraelites might not only reſiſt but alſo depoſe their <hi>kings</hi> for wickednes &amp; idolatrie, yea, that al the people were juſtly puniſhed by the Lord becauſe they removed not their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Kings out of their places, and brings ſundry inſtances for it. <hi>Explinat. Aut.</hi> 42. That God did puniſh the people for their kings enormities, tis evident by <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.1, 2, 3, 4. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.11, 12. &amp; <hi>Chap.</hi> 23.26. &amp; 24.3. and the hiſtory of the Kings and Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in ſundry other places clearly ſhew ſo much: the which thing ſurely God in juſtice would not have done, had not the people power to hinder, cenſure and depoſe them for their ſins.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid of <hi>Amaziah King of Judah,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 14.19. That they <hi>made a conſpiracie againſt him in Jeruſalem and he fled to Lachiſh, but they ſent after him to Lachiſh and ſlew him there</hi>: not privatly but openly, as acted by publick authority for his great impiety, as having broken his oath and covenant; whereupon we reade not of any complaint, inquiſition proceeding or puniſhment inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on thoſe that ſlew him after his death, either by the people or his children as there was upon thoſe that ſlew king <hi>Ammnon,</hi> but being ſlaine, <hi>they</hi> (to wit the perſons who had put him to death) <hi>brought him on horſes, and he was buried in Jeruſalem, and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Judah made</hi> Ahaziah <hi>King in his ſtead.</hi> Which plainly ſhews that what was formerly done by the greater part of <hi>the States at Jeruſalem</hi> was afterwards confirmed by common conſent, and executed by command of thoſe which might lawfully do it.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, For examples, all hiſtories are full, nothing more frequent than to reade, how people having the ſupream power would judiciouſly convent, cenſure, depoſe, yea and judge their kings to death for their evil and wicked courſes. Thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Senate and people together proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Nero, Julianus, Vitellius, Maximinius, Heliogabulus &amp;c.</hi> I ſpeak not of <hi>Traquin</hi> the proud expelled the kingdome by the people. So other Emperours likewiſe, being found unfit &amp; una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to govern the kingdom, have been depoſed and others e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56574:31"/>
and crowned in their ſtead: as <hi>Cbilderiek, Charles the third, Juſtinus the ſecond, Wenceſlaus,</hi> all put off: and <hi>Pepin, Arnolph, Fiberius, and Rupert Count Palatine</hi> of <hi>Rhine</hi> choſen and ſet in the Empire. The <hi>Cumaen State</hi> uſually arraigned and puniſhed their Kings juditially if they ſaw cauſe.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>French</hi> by authority of a publick Councel &amp; through the prudent care of the officers of the Realm, depoſed <hi>Childerick the firſt, Sigebert, Theodorick,</hi> and <hi>Childerick the third</hi>: So <hi>Gyl,</hi> for his grievous taxes and other miſcarriages they chaſed into <hi>Soy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: Theoduricus</hi> becauſe he vexed and oppreſſed the people, was by the auth ority of the State deprived of all dignity.</p>
            <p>Touching the Kings of <hi>Spain,</hi> we ſhall finde in Hiſtories and good Authors, that frequently for their tyrranny and miſgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment they were depoſed by their ſubjects: as <hi>Theo-diſcle</hi> the tenth, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ttiza,</hi> and other <hi>Gotiſh Kings,</hi> as infamous monſters were chaſed from their thrones. So <hi>Don Pedro the firſt, Ordogno, Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo</hi> the great Aſtronomer, kings of <hi>Caſtile</hi> for their cruelties, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and treacheries, all rejected and deprived of their Realms. <hi>Ramir of Leon</hi> and <hi>Garcia King of Gallieia</hi> both depoſed for their vitious and baſe doings.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Hungaria, Peter the ſecond,</hi> and <hi>Solomon the firſt</hi> (to omit ſome others) for their great inſolencies, and injuſtice were both depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the firſt afterwards baniſhed, and the other kept in priſon till he died. So the <hi>Bohemians</hi> depoſed and baniſhed <hi>Boleſlaus, Rufus, Berzinogius, Sobeiſlaus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi>: and <hi>twiſe</hi> impriſoned <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> for his drunkenneſſe, neglegence, and cruelty.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Poland</hi> the people have depoſed impriſoned or expelled out of the kingdom many of their Kings for their oppreſſions, and injuſtice, as (amongſt others) <hi>Mieſco</hi> their ſecond King, <hi>Boleſlaus</hi> his ſon, <hi>Myoſlaus, Henrie</hi> &amp;c. Neither have the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Kings been uſed otherwiſe, but for their cruelty, treachery, and tyranny have been thruſt out of their thrones and Realm by the people, as <hi>Halſten, Aminander, Burgerius, Magnus, Henry, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtierne the firſt and ſecond,</hi> and others elected and crowned in their ſtead.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Denmark, Humbus, Ericus, Chriſtierne,</hi> father and ſon, cenſured and depoſed by the State for their licenciouſneſſe and miſgovernment: Not to mention <hi>Canutus, Magnus, Suano,</hi> put
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56574:31"/>
to death by the people. I paſſe over <hi>Canades</hi> King of <hi>Perſia, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius</hi> the younger King of <hi>Sicile, Timocrates of Cyrene: Androni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus</hi> Emperour of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> by the people rejected upon juſt cauſe.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Scotland,</hi> If <hi>George Bucanan</hi> and others of their own Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians write truth as there hath ſeldom ever bin good King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo very few of them (begin with this mans father and ſo go up) that ever died an natural death. But touching the point in hand: how frequently the Parliaments and Nobles there have queſtioned their Kings, impriſoned, depoſed, yea judicially cenſured them, for their tyrannies, oppreſſions, whoredoms, murders, falſhood and evil adminſtration; you may ſee at large in the aforeſaid <hi>Bucanan</hi>: ſome I have taken out of him: as <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus</hi> and his ſons, ſo <hi>Dardan, Luctack, Conarus, Ramack, Fereu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard, Euginius, Conſtantine, Ethus, Donald, Lugrac, Megal, Edward, Baliol, James the third</hi>: all theſe have been ſentenced &amp; rejected. I mention not ſuch (though he doth many) whom the common people for their intollerable baſenes murdered and put to death. To which I might adde, this mans Grandmother, whom they impriſoned and cauſed to abjure and reſign her Intereſt in the Crown and kingdom to her Infant ſon; and at laſt was ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arraigned and condemned to death by the Parliament of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and beheaded at <hi>Fatheringham</hi> Caſtle, all which proceedings againſt her, as her Depoſition, Impriſonment, ahd Execution hath hitherto been juſtified as lawful.</p>
            <p>To come now to our own nation, many examples we have up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record in our Chronicles concerning the matter in hand: I ſhall at this time but only touch things in a brief way: King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigen</hi> after ſix years raign for his negligence and evil government was depoſed from his crown by his ſubjects, and his ſon <hi>Vortimer</hi> choſen and crowned in his ſtead. <hi>Speed Chron. pag.</hi> 207.266.267. <hi>Sigehert</hi> King of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> uſing exactions and cruelties up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſubjects was put by his place and <hi>Kenwolfe</hi> made King in his ſteed. <hi>Speed hiſt. pag.</hi> 229. So <hi>Ofred</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland</hi> for his ill government was expelled by his ſubjects and deprived of all Kingly authority. <hi>Speed pag.</hi> 245.246. <hi>Ethelred</hi> (the ſon of <hi>Mollo</hi>) ſo far offended his ſubjects that they tooke up armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him and ſlew him at <hi>Cobre. Beornerd</hi> King of <hi>Mercia, becauſe

The like was <hi>Edwins</hi> caſe <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Mercia</hi> and <hi>Northumberland, for his miſgovernment, tyranny and oppreſſion, and following vaine, baſe, and wicked Councellors</hi> was removed from all kingly dignity, in whoſe place <hi>Edgar</hi> was elected <hi>King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might have mentioned <hi>Archigallo</hi> one of our ancient <hi>Brittiſh Kings</hi> in times of Gentiliſme, for ſome miſorders was depoſed by the people, when he had reigned almoſt five yeers, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Elidurus</hi> choſen in his room.

            <p>Here I ſhall end this point with a few propoſals to the Reader. 1. Thou mayeſt obſerve when a <hi>King</hi> proves a Tyrant it is the peoples own fault, if they relieve not themſelves, and recover their ancient rights and liberties. 2. Note, what miſchiefs and miſeries, this Monarchy and <hi>King-craft</hi> brings with it, for it is no ſmall diſturbance and trouble to a nation to be forced to take up armes againſt a tyrant, and bring him to puniſhment. 3. (And mark it wel) according to the fact, ſo tyrants have been puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more or leſſe: that ſaying in former times hath been held for a maxime, <hi>fiat juſtitia, mundum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Here alſo thou mayſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, how falſe to their truſt, &amp; prejudicial to the kingdom, the late <hi>Treaty</hi> was, for what men, unleſſe ignorant in State matters, dul of action, ſlaviſhly minded, fearful &amp; unbelievers, or ſuch as have cozened and cheated the countrey, and ſo made account by
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56574:32"/>
a generall act of indempnity to eſcape puniſhment (<hi>hanging I ſhould have ſaid</hi>) would ever have moved in ſuch a way, as being free from a tyrant (with great expenſe, and much pretious blood) would ſeek to ſet him up again, and ſo by degree to be in great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſlavery then before.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, For the opinion of learned men whether <hi>Papiſts, Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> or <hi>Calviniſts</hi> they do unanimouſly hold that <hi>Kings</hi> for their tyranny and miſgovernment may be cenſured and depoſed by the people, becauſe I have propoſed to my ſelf to be briefe, I ſhall onely mention a perſon or two. There is a book entituled <hi>de Rege &amp; Regis Inſtitutione</hi> written by one <hi>Joannes Mariana</hi> a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuite, wherein I find his words thus, <hi>A Tyrannicall King continuing incorrigible after publick admonitions of the whole State, if there be no hopes of amendment, may not only be depoſed, but put to death and murdered by the whole State, or any particular perſons by their appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yea, without it, if he be declared a publick enemy by the whole State, and in caſe the whole State cannot publickly aſſemble by reaſon of ſuch a Princes known notorious Tyranny, then in ſuch a caſe it is lawfull for any private man to murder him to free the countrey and Kingdom from deſtruction.</hi> Lib. 1. c. 9. Howſoever I ſhall not ſtand to juſtify all that he ſayes, yet his book was dedicated to <hi>Philip</hi> the third <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> and publiſhed by his ſpeciall priviledge afterward reprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at <hi>Mentz</hi> in <hi>Germany, Cum privilegio ſacrae Caeſariae Majeſtatis, &amp; permiſſa Superiorem. Danaeus</hi> allows, not only ſubjects actual reſiſtance, but deprivation of <hi>Kings,</hi> where princes ſet themſelves to ſubvert Religion, Laws, Liberties. <hi>Polit. Chryſt. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. So <hi>Zuinglius, When princes ſhall deal perfideouſly and contrary to the rules of Chriſt, they may be depoſed by the conſent &amp; ſuffrages of the whol, or at leaſt the greateſt part of the people, God helping them therein. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plin. Art.</hi> 42. And howſoever <hi>Calvin</hi> pleads as much as a man can for Tyrants and wicked Magiſtrates, yet thus he ſaith, <hi>I alwaies ſpeak of private men, for if there be any popular Magiſtrates conſtituted in the behalf of the people to reſtrain the luſts of Kings, (ſuch as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were the Ephori who were oppoſed to the Lacedaemonian Kings, or Tribunes of the people againſt the Roman Senate, or the Demarchi againſt the Athenian Senate, the which power peradventure as things are now, the free Eſtates in all kingdoms enjoy when they aſſemble.) I am ſo far from inhibiting them to withſtand, the raging licenciouſneſſ of kings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56574:33"/>
to their duty, that if they connive and wink at Kings outragiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encroaching upon, and inſulting over the poor communality, I ſhall affirm that their diſſimulation is not without wicked breach of faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deceitfully betray the liberty of the people, of whom they know themſelves to be appointed protectors by the Ordinance of God.</hi> Inſtit. lib. 4. c. 20. Sect. 31.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>That no Nation is ſo ſtrictly tied to any form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Law, but it is lawfull for the people to alter the ſame into any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther form or kind upon occaſion.</hi> We prove, and for the firſt thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe all formes of Government were ordained for the peoples welfare, protection peace, &amp;c. and therefore in caſe any one becomes incompatible or inconſiſtent with the publick ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it may be changed without injuſtice, and grounded upon that firſt and chief Law of all common-wealths, <hi>Salus Populi ſuprema Lex eſto, the ſafety of the People let that be the laſt Law</hi>; grounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon that ſaying of Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.27. <hi>The ſabbath was made for man, and not man for the ſabbath.</hi> Whence I reaſon, look as man was before the ſabbath, and the day made as ſerving to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation and ſafety of him, and ſo his life to be preſerved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the obſervation of the ſabbath. So man being before the Goverment, and Government ordained for his ſafety, there is no form of Government, but he may omit the uſe of it, if it be for his peace, profit and welfare.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a received principle of nature and reaſon, <hi>eodem modo quid conſtituitur, diſſolvitur, in what manner a thing is conſtituted, it may be diſsolved</hi>: Again, <hi>Omnia quae jure contrahuntur contrario jure pereunt.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> (as we have already noted) cals kings and their ſupreamacy, <hi>a humane creature or ordinance of man,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame took its original and riſe from men, and therfore that form of Government is changable and revocable as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (whoſe creature the form is) ſhall ſee reaſon and cauſe for it. As the potter hath power over his pots, and the gold-ſmith may alter and change his veſſels and cups from one form to another: ſo here.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Howſoever all Government in general be of God, yet the kinds of it are left arbitrary to mens inſtitution and free election: here I ſay people have liberty, to take or leave, as to lay aſide one form and eſtabliſh another, when they ſee it is more to the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56574:33"/>
of humane ſociety, and the advancement of Gods glory. Thus <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and all Politicians hold, <hi>all forms of Government are changeable. Lambertus Danaeus Polit. Chriſt. l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>pag.</hi> 217. ſpeakes thus, <hi>When the Lawes of a Kingdom or Common-wealth are not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but manifeſtly and obſtinately violated by that Magiſtrate, to whom and whoſe family the ſupream Government is granted under certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, I ſay, that Kingdom or Government ſo granted and conferred on conditions, may by all godly and Chriſtian people with a ſafe conſcience be taken from him, and another form of Government erected by a publick E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict of the States gathered together; if the ſafety of the Common-wealth ſhall ſo require<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. This is manifeſt by the diverſe alterations of the Monarchy in this kingdom, which hath been ſometime divided into ſeven, ſometimes into five, otherwhile into three or two kingdoms; and at laſt all reduced into one. So by the great changes and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which have been made in forreign Realms: as ſometimes Monarchy quite aboliſhed and changed into Ariſtocraticall or popular eſtate. Thus the <hi>Switzers</hi> and <hi>Griſons</hi> departed from the <hi>Romane Empire,</hi> and became 18. common-wealths, every one hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their eſtate (divided from other) in Soveraignty. The <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian Common-wealth</hi> was at the beginning a Monarchy, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward changed into a popular Eſtate, and now by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle changed into Ariſtocratital, yet ſo tacitly, in ſuch a quiet ſort that the change can hardly be perceived. So the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> and people of <hi>Sicile</hi> threw of Monarchy, and had a Popular State. The <hi>Samians, Corcyraeans, Rhodians, Cnidians,</hi> and almoſt all the common-wealths of Greece after the victory of <hi>Lyſander</hi> were from Monarchy changed into Ariſtocraties.</p>
            <p>So again ſome nations have changed Ariſtocraticall into po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular government; as the <hi>Sabeans, Sabirites, Trezenians, Amphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lits, Chalcidians, Thurians, Chions,</hi> the <hi>Argives,</hi> the people of <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos, Tarentum,</hi> many more which I omit.</p>
            <p>And from <hi>Popular</hi> ſome have changed into <hi>Ariſtocratie,</hi> as the <hi>Venetians, Syracuſians, Lacedemonians, Thebans, Heracleans, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeans, Megarenſes,</hi> the <hi>Luques, Rhaguſes, Genes,</hi> and other.</p>
            <p>Sometimes alſo the frame of Ariſtocratical government hath been altered into Monarchy, and it is well to be noted, what <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din</hi> notes as to be the cauſe and reaſon of ſuch a change, namely,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56574:34"/>
               <hi>conqueſt</hi> and <hi>Tyranny</hi>: and ſets down many examples for it. <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de rep: c.</hi> 1. The Jewes indeed deſired ſuch a thing, but how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly they offended God therein, the ſacred hiſtory ſhews, who for <hi>asking a King</hi> gave them a King in his wrath. And thus much for the firſt particular. Now we come to the other, <hi>viz. That ſuch Lawes and ancient cuſtomes as people find to be hurtfull, unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or inconvenient, they may remove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. Many things which were convenient and neceſſary in former times, and therefore eſtabliſhed in after ages are found unuſeful, becauſe there is not the ſame reaſon and cauſe for them as then there was.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is no man of ſuch parts and gifts, or ſo qualified, as to foreſee in all things, what will be ſafeſt and beſt for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations after him; and therefore as many things muſt be left to every age, ſo the people in every age muſt look to their own ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and preſervation, as to have ſuch Laws in uſe, as are for the preſent publick good, and what is otherwiſe to take off the force and ſtop the execution of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Seeing the will of man (and that often) without reaſon, is the ground of Law, according to his ſaying:
<q>Sic volo, ſic jubeo, ſtat pro ratione voluntas.</q>
It is therefore the more neceſſary to conſider what the Laws are, and how they are grounded; for we know, mans will is full of darkneſſe, deceit, ſelf-end, and what pleaſeth one, is to another hurtfull and unprofitable.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What skilfull and prudent phiſitians will not change their way and courſe of phyſick, if they ſee the ſame proves dangerous and deſtructive to their patients, and follow ſome other &amp; better rules of art. <hi>Stateſmen</hi> are the peoples phyſitians, and therefore they ought to lay aſide al ſuch old Laws <hi>&amp;</hi> cuſtoms as are unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable and unuſefull, and ordain wholeſome and good ones in the room thereof.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We ſee that men change in condition, and one age is not like another: our anceſtors ſome generations paſt, were ſo and ſo, but their poſterity now are otherwiſe in condition, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great care ſhould be taken, that we have ſuch Laws, as are beſt and fitteſt for the time; and to ſay the truth, herein conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much true policy: men chuſe not a garment by the largenes,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56574:34"/>
neither of the fineneſs of the cloath, but by the fitneſſe, and how well it will ſerve the perſon that muſt wear it: I do take notice what a number there are, now (<hi>Taylor-like</hi>) in London and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, making garments for the Nation and to clothe the people with new lawes; now howſoever I profeſſe not my ſelfe to be one of that trade, yet I wiſh wel to the work and humbly deſire, that they do not ſo much mind <hi>largneſs &amp; fineneſs,</hi> as to have things fit and to come well home to the Nation, in a good accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a general ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Howſoever it cannot be denied, but we have many good laws amongſt us, nevertheleſſe, ſuch is our burden and miſery, that they are like good mettel in a pot or veſſel, ſo covered over with droſſe and ſcum as the beauty and brightneſſe of them ſhines not forth: Now here is <hi>State wiſdome</hi> which diſcovers a man to be verſ'd in <hi>Politicks,</hi> who ſtudieth and labours how to remove the droſſe, rather than promiſcuouſly and without any deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction or difference to throw al away, as the ſcum ſo the precious and pure ſilver alſo. <hi>Whoſo breaketh a hedge, a ſerpent ſhall bite him.</hi> I know it is an ancient maxime of ſome Polititians, <hi>That we muſt not change any thing in the Laws of a Common-wealth which hath long maintained it ſelf in a good eſtate whatſoever apparent profit may be ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by pretended.</hi> Again, <hi>Legum mutatio omnium erat peri culoſa.</hi> But I have formerly proved it lawful, yea neceſſary to alter and chang the laws of a kingdom. Yet ſo, as I ſhall deſire all ſuch as are ſpecially concerned in this great work, to obſerve theſe cautions or rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it be done with mature deliberation, good fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughts, not hand over head, as to thruſt in mens ſudden and preſent conceits. Men in their ſleep, imagine they eat, drink, walk &amp;c. and queſtion not but it is all real and true: but being awake they perceive it was only a dream. It is not enough that a man is confident, and perſwades himſelf it is ſo, but it is needful to enquire whether it be ſleeping or waking, examine well how it is bottomed and grounded. My <hi>Antigoniſt</hi> (I dare ſay) thinks he propheſieth right things, whereas poor man, he only dreams, and when the Lord ſhall awake him of this ſleep he will ſee and confeſſe ſo much.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whatſoever law or cuſtom ſhall be taken away, yet it muſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56574:35"/>
not be, till after due examination, and finding upon proof ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe and reaſon for it. Otherwiſe it may happen, as it did to <hi>Alexander,</hi> killing <hi>Parmenio</hi> in haſt, afterwards he repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and found the miſſe of him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It muſt be minded, that the publick Intereſt be eſpecially provided for, and not to profit a few to the preiudice of many.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a principal maxime in Sate-policy, when any law or cuſtom is to be abrogated, To conſider how far it is hurtful and in what regard and what ſenſe or liking the people have thereof, and ſo to proceed either ſpeedily, or to come thereunto by little and little without forcing of any thing. Phiſitians obſerve, that violent medicines in ſome caſes raiſes up the humors and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h them ſo through the whol body, as the party becomes more diſtempered, and made the more uncapeable of health, and ſo the leſſe hope of recovery: Nevertheles, in ſome other caſes, quick and ſtrong phiſick doth wel and ſafe. <hi>Gal. de ſimp. me. facult. c.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This alſo muſt be looked to, What ſhall be next and come into the place, when ſuch and ſuch things ſhall be taken away: a man may pull down both ſides of a houſe, who hath not the skill and art to lay one ſtone orderly and as it ſhould be to build a new and better. I do ingeniouſly profeſſe there are many thnigs yet in Church and Common-wealth which I wiſh were taken away, and to me they do appear faulty: but (<hi>hic labor, hoc opus)</hi> if they were removed, what ſhould come in their room? that needs ſome conſideration, both what, and how? In <hi>The Peoples Agreement,</hi> I obſerve they are much for pulling downe, and it is ſoon ſaid there needs, not many heads or hands for ſuch work: now I could heartily wiſh, that theſe men or ſome other, would ſatisfie the Land, if every particular by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be granted, how we might have their rooms and places fil'd again. It is an eaſie thing to tell where the ſore is, and to ſhew it, but to make a ſalve to heal it is more difficult.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I do find in ſundry Hiſtories, when the laws and cuſtoms of a nation hath been changed, howſoever the thing was good in it ſelf, and ſome men had therein what they deſired, yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards great troubles and miſeries have enſued, becauſe the greater part ſaw no ground or cauſe of ſuch changes, neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended the benefit and uſefulneſſe thereof. And therefore it
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56574:35"/>
is the judgment of the wiſeſt Polititians, whenſoever a State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to alter the form of Government or Laws, to let the people ſee beforehand, upon what ground and juſt cauſe they will do it, and what conveniency, ſafety, and profit the publick ſhall have thereby. This will not only ſo take with the people, as to make them willing and deſirous of the thing, but to contribute to the work what they are able that it may be well e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ected. Now to the laſt point, what form of Government is beſt.</p>
            <p>This is a great queſtion among Polititians, largely debated, and diverſe men are diverſly minded; for my own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udgement herein it is this, <hi>Monarchie is the worſt.</hi> And my Reaſons for it are theſe:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe a great Part of the land is unneceſſarily deteined, and kept away from the publick uſe and profit of the people, to maintain an <hi>unuſeful creature.</hi> What a number of <hi>Courts, Pallaces, Mannours, Parks, Forreſts</hi> beſides other Rents, Revenues, Cuſtoms &amp;c. there goes to maintain this <hi>King-ſhip,</hi> 'tis hardly credible; and how it is imployed it's worth the noting. Now what more abſurd and inconſiderate than for a people to be at ſuch unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable expence and charge to keep one of whom they have no need or uſe at all, but can do much better without him. We read how the Prince of <hi>Crange</hi> gave money to one <hi>Bellazar Gerard</hi> (who named himſelf <hi>Frances Guyon</hi>) to buy him proviſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he bought piſtols, powder, and ſhot and killed the prince. And what elſe do Kings many times with the great treaſury allowed them by their ſubjects, but procure ammunition &amp; raiſe up forces to murder and deſtroy them.</p>
            <p>The children alſo of Kings, are no ſmall burden and unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary charge to a nation, conſidering their exceſſive riot, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. We ſpeak not of doweries and other portions: and what ſerve they for, or what profit have the people by them? the truth is, there is little or no good expected, if they prove not a curſe and plague to the kingdom, we think it is well and take it as a great mercy: Would it not therefore be better, what is needleſly waſted on them to be converted to ſome pious and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable uſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Look upon Monarchie and compare them with other forms of government, and this you ſhall certainly find, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56574:36"/>
corruptions and abuſes break forth in a State they are not ſo eaſily, ſuddenly, and thorowly ſuppreſſed in the former as in the latter: and no marvail: for 1. As they have their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and riſe uſually from the Court, ſo the King will labour what he can to uphold and defend the ſame. Hence it comes to paſſe (as many ſad examples in this land ſhew) that enormities, have ſo long continued and grown to ſuch a height as the people have been forced to make war againſt the Prince, and with the loſſe of much blood and other charges to reform the ſame which otherwiſe would never have been don. But where there is a <hi>free State</hi> you have no ſuch inconvenience; neither indeed are ſuch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes and corruptions ever ſeen, but if they did appear the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would not be ſo difficult to ſuppreſſe them there. 2. Put caſe the King hath no hand in theſe abuſes (which would be a ſtrange thing) yet are they not eaſily reformed, becauſe what he heares and ſees it is by other mens ears: whereas in the other Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, magiſtrates are abroad to ſee and hear what is amiſſe with their own eyes and ears.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If things be compared together, this we ſhall find in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, the officers and miniſters of State are uſually (as the King) corrupt men, abuſers oppreſſors of the people, and little or no help is to be had of relief and ſatisfaction. But in the other Government, places are not open for ſuch men, or ſhould they once appear to be ſuch, the people know a way ſoon to right themſelves. Beſides where the people chuſe their own Magiſtrats they muſt needs be the beſt: For Princes do not uſe to put men into office ſo much for the publick good, as how to carry forth their own private intereſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This miſery and miſchief ordinarily goes along with Monarchies a ſlaughtering and murdering of the people by ſome deviliſh plot or other, preſſing them forth to ſo me unneceſſary war, to ſatisfie their luſt and pride, or impoſing intollerable taxes upon them, having ſome treacherous deſigne in hand: But in a free State theres no fear of ſuch things neither indeed can they happen.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If one form of Government may be held better then another for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the goſpels ſake: then our poſition is certainly true, that <hi>Monarchy is the worſt,</hi> for by experience in all ages, under the Kings of the earth the truth hath had leaſt favour, and greateſt oppoſition, and moſt have ſuffered death for the witneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt; and therefore theſe powers of the world ſhall be firſt broken in pieces and conſumed by the ſtone cut out of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56574:36"/>
the mountain without hands, when the God of heaven ſhall ſet up a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which ſhall never be deſtroyed. Moreover it is remarkable, what fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent changes and alterations of Religion there are, where Kings do reign, as from Papiſts to Proteſtants, from Proteſtants back to papiſts, from them again to proteſtants; as it was in <hi>Henry the eight, Edward the ſixth, queen Mary,</hi> and <hi>queen Elizabeths</hi> days: but in the other the courſe of Religion hath no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption by the diſeaſe of Magiſtrates, though they change, yet Religion alters not.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Where the Government is a Free State, there men are encouraged to the ſtudy of wiſdom, truth, juſtice, &amp;c. becauſe not titles there, but good parts make men capable of honor, authority, and place; neither is there a door open for them to come in by bribery and flattery, but choſen by their fitneſſe, gifts, and abilities. In Monarchies much preferment goes by ſucceſſion, the <hi>Kings coſins</hi> though fools or knaves by birth challenge great authority.</p>
            <p n="8">8. According to the proverb <hi>new Kings new Laws:</hi> hear what <hi>Bodin</hi> ſpeaks (I mention him the oftner becauſe he is a great kingſman) <hi>We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the changing of Princes, new deſigns, new Laws, new officers, new friends, new enemies, new habits, and a new form of living: for moſt commonly Princes take delight to change and alter all things, that they may be ſpoken of, the which doth many times cauſe great inconveniences not only to the ſubjects in particular but alſo to the whole body of the State.</hi> de Rep. lib. 6. c. 4. But no ſuch prejudice or peril is incident to the other form of Government, whatſoever things are publickly altered, it is maturely don, and upon good ground, and for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral profit and welfare of the people.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This form of Government for which I ſtand, muſt needs be the beſt, being the mediocrity or <hi>mean</hi> between the two extreams, <hi>Monarchy</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi>; that one ſhould rule alone, is againſt that common maxime, <hi>plus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent oculi quam oculus,</hi> two eyes ſee more then one; or that none ſhould govern or al: tis ſo abſurd and ſenceleſſe as no man pleads for it, onely a malignant ſcandal rayſed up againſt ſome honeſt men.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If men would not be blind they might cleerly behold a ſenceable and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible hand of God againſt this throning of Kings (ſpecially taking in one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another by ſuccesſion) <hi>is Saul alſo àmong the Prophets, but who is their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> what greater ſhame and diſhonor can a nation lie under, then to take the ſon of a known and apparent adultreſſe, and make him their King? what this mans wife is, and what his own mother was, and his fathers mother, to go no higher, it is fit it ſhould be conſidered of, no marvail God hath puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed us by ſuch a race, where no zeal of God nor juſtice of law hath beene ſhewed againſt ſuch open whordoms from one generation to another, only talkt and laught at whereas by the Law of God open adulterers ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p n="11">11. It is worthy of remembrance, what marks of Soveraignty ſome do reckon up, as being the <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>prerogatives</hi> proper to <hi>Monarchs,</hi> I have not the time to name them now, onely from them this followes undeniably, that <hi>Monarchy is Tyranny,</hi> I will not adde <hi>tollerable</hi> to it; for granting unto Kings
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56574:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuch <hi>Soveraignties,</hi> there is nothing left the people but meer ſlavery, and therefore people ſhould be leſſe ſenceable then beaſts, if they would remain in bondage under Monarchy, being able to free themſelves in a juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable way, and to ſet up ſuch a form of government, whereby they might enjoy more liberty, a thing not only good in it ſelf, but naturally deſired by all men, and deemed by the wiſeſt more pretious then gold or pearls, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Tityrus</hi> in <hi>Virgil</hi>:
<q>
                  <l>Libertas, quae ſera tamen reſpexit inertem,</l>
                  <l>Candidor poſt quam tondendi barba cadebat,</l>
                  <l>Reſpexit amen, &amp; longo poſt tempore venit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But here I wonder how men giving ſuch ſoveraignty to Kings, ſhould prefer Monarchy before all other forms of government it is as plain contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, groſſe ignorance, and baſe flatery as a thing can be.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I deſire alſo the Reader to take notice, that for the Reaſons which are brought in favour of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> they may be thus anſwered. 1. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is ſaid for the uſefulneſſe of it, not only may be the very ſame be ſaid of the other, but much more and better, as tending to the publick good and profit. 2. Touching their ſimilitudes taken from God, the body a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, bees, cranes, &amp;c. there is nothing can be more gathered from them, as applyed to the matter in hand, but that the Commonwealth ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked unto. 3. For the antiquity of <hi>Monarchies,</hi> I grant them to be of a long ſtanding (though later then the other) <hi>Joſephus</hi> makes <hi>Cain</hi> to be the author, but it is generally held that <hi>Nemrod</hi> was the firſt man, and by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tyrants after him held up with great violence, rapine, and bloodſhed. And whereas it hath enlarged it ſelf far and neer, and laſted long; this I mind to be a judgment of God layd upon the nations of the earth, to ſcourge them for their impieties, and great wickedneſſe againſt the King of Kings.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Touching the things objected againſt the form of Government, which I plead for, they are either taken upon miſunderſtanding, or very frivolous, and not worth the anſwering: nevertheleſſe we shall shortly ſpeak ſomthing thereto. But for the preſent this shall ſuffice. Onely let me acquaint thee <hi>Reader,</hi> before I break off, which is, <hi>That all ſuch as prefer Monarchy before the other kind of Government, do it with diſtinction, for though they hold the former in the nature of the thing to be more excellent then the later; yet in this they all agree, that as certain conditions may be, in reſpect of times, places, and perſons, the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here defended is more neceſſary and uſefull.</hi> Now what reaſon and cauſe there is, for us to change Monarchy into a free State, in reference to this preſent time, the place, our perſons, and condition, I leave the ſame to the two great Counſels of the Land to conſider of.</p>
