            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

James <hi>the 7th. how far we are now tyed by our Allegiance, what Limits ought to beſet to the Prerogative,</hi> &amp;c. Which you ſay are at preſent, the great Subjects of Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, ſince theſe things are ſo much talk't of by every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the <hi>Itch</hi> of Writing is ſo Univerſal, but you will ſee ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things on theſe Heads from much Abler Pens: And from ſuch

who not only are better qualified for the undertaking, but alſo by hearing and perhaps, (being perſonally preſent,) by ſeeing the practices and methods of <hi>England</hi> in the ſame caſe, are better furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with helps for the performance; So that any thing I can ſay to you will be ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>Yet in obedience to your deſire, and to teſtify my ſincere and unbiaſſed Affection to the good of my Country, and withall to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you, that it is not from any fond Principle of <hi>Bigotted Loyalty,</hi> nor from a ſtupid unconcern'dneſs in the great Concerns of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I decline coming to Town at this time, when as you ſay, it is expected that the greateſt part of the Gentry will be preſent during this <hi>Aſſembly of the States:</hi> I ſhall freely give you my rude thoughts of what appears to me, to be the proper Work and neceſſary duty of this Meeting, in the preſent extraordinary Conjuncture, and leave it to you to make what uſe thereof you ſhall think fit.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt point you mention, tho you know I am neither <hi>Divine</hi> nor <hi>Caſuiſt,</hi> yet I muſt ſay that I think 'tis very evident to any thinking man, <hi>That Heaven it ſelf has very fully looſ'd the Nation from their Allegiance,</hi> and by remarkable providences granted a clear Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation from their Oaths to K. <hi>James</hi> the <hi>7th.</hi> We need not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute what was the genuine ſenſe of theſe Oaths, whether they allow'd this implicite Reſervation, That if the King ſhould ſubvert the Foundations of our Government, Our Laws, Religion, Liberties and Properties; The People ſhould in that caſe be free, to aſſert and aſſume their Native Rights: Neither need we enter upon the Invidious task of Examining how farr the King advanced in theſe unjuſt Practices and Deſigns. Heaven it ſelf, I ſay, ſeems moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly to have ſuperſeeded all ſuch Debates and Enquiries, and to have laid it upon this <hi>Meeting of the States</hi> to ſettle and eſtabliſh juſt and ſolid Foundations for the Government of the Nation in all time coming.</p>
            <p>'Tis acknowledged by all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that no Oath can bind, when either <hi>their Superveens a Phyſical Impoſſibility of performing it; Or when the performance becomes morally unlawful.</hi> And every conſidering Man muſt acknowledge that Providence hath caſt both theſe Impediments in the way of this Aſſembly, to divert them from their Allegiance to

K. <hi>James.</hi> For now <hi>England</hi> has Dethron'd him, and their Action is applauded, (as proceeding upon juſt and valid grounds, moſt of which are common to us with them) by the greateſt part of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; So that it is obvious to every one, that it would be Impoſſible for this Aſſembly of our <hi>States</hi> to maintain and ſupport him, in the exerciſe of his <hi>Royal Dignity</hi> here, againſt the unqueſtionable Attempts, that we muſt expect <hi>Englands</hi> Jealouſies of ſuch an irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Neighbour, would provoke them to ſet about for his overthrow. And theſe Attempts could not miſs of Succeſs, having, as unqueſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onably, a great, If not the far greateſt part of this Nation for their Abettors. Thus what a Scene of Blood, War and Confuſion ſhould theſe Nations become? And what a feeble diſtracted Government might we expect in ſuch Circumſtances?</p>
            <p>But if any ſhall plead that there's no <hi>Phyſical Impoſſibility</hi> in the caſe, and that the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of paſt Ages teach us, that this Nation, when unanimous in their Allegiance may maintain their King againſt all the Efforts of <hi>England;</hi> Eſpecially ſince we may now expect more Aſſiſtance then ever from our old <hi>Allies the French.</hi> Yet this at leaſt, I am ſure, every <hi>Proteſtant</hi> muſt conſeſs is moral<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y unlawfull for him to concur in; Since ſuch a Conjunction were utterly inconſiſtent with his indiſpenſible Moral Duty of preſerving, or at leaſt doing nothing that evidently tends to the ruine of the true <hi>Reformed Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> Now any man that is capable of the leaſt ſerious Reflection upon the preſent ſtate of Affairs, muſt plainly ſee that the Intereſt of His preſent <hi>Majeſty of England</hi> and his party, are ſo intervoven with that of the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> that the one cannot ſuffer loſs or overthrow without the notable dammage or apparent ruine of the other, not only in this <hi>Iſland,</hi> but all <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> over. He muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſee no leſs clearly, that it were a meer dream to imagine it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſupport and preſerve K. <hi>James</hi> in his power here, without wronging the K. of <hi>England</hi> and his Intereſt. For to be ſure, either of them would imploy his whole Art and might for the others ruine; Such different Intereſts (beſide the particular quarrels of the late Revolution) being now altogether incompatible in this <hi>Iſland.</hi> Neither is it to be thought that K. <hi>James</hi> would value this Crown further then that he might thereby be enabled to recover that of <hi>England</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52071:4"/>
Thus 'tis plain that we can never fancy to preferve K. <hi>James's</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer here, without reſolving to aſſiſt and ſecond him in his attempts; to the great prejudice, if not the Total Ruine (ſo far as men are able) of the Reformed Religion over all <hi>Europe.</hi> But I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded no Proteſtant of Common Senſe, can ever think his Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance will warrant or in the leaſt Juſtify him in any ſuch practice. For whatever has been ſaid to Evince that Allegiance did bind Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> tho ſecrued to the higheſt pitch: Yet none was ever ſo impudent as to aſſert that it oblidg'd them to an Active concurrence with their King, in methods directly tending to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion or Extirpation of the true Religion. Here <hi>Chriſtians of all Perſwaſions</hi> will own. <hi>That it is better to obey God then Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it being thus Irrefragably evident that <hi>God</hi> in <hi>his</hi> wiſe Over Ruling Providence, has ordered things ſo, that it is both Impoſſible for this Meeting of the States to preſerve the Crown to K. <hi>James,</hi> or at leaſt not to be undertaken without expoſing this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all the lamentable evils, that a weak, unlettled Government, conſtant Warrs and confuſions can bring upon it; And that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo unlawful for us <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to aim at it; ſince he cannot now be Re eſtabliſhed but upon the Ruines of the whole Reformed Intereſt in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> Let all therefore awfully obſerve the hand of GOD; and chearfully ſubmit to his will, and without attempting to ſtrugle againſt Heaven, leave K. <hi>James</hi> to the diſpoſal of Providence. Let every Man in his Station contribute, what in him lyes, to re<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

Nor let any thoughts of the Right of Succeſſion ſtop their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, For beſides that there can be no Heir to a living Man; the former Arguments are as part againſt the <hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> true or Suppoſititious as againſt <hi>King James</hi> the 7. But now when God has ſo wonderfully put this opportunity in their hands, let them be as honeſt

and upright hearted <hi>Patriots,</hi> ſet themſelves ſeriouſly to conſider, what is fit to be done, for ſettling a Government in this Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on juſt and ſolid Foundations; whereby the true Religion and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace may be eſtabliſhed and ſecured, the juſt property and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the Subject clearly aſſerted, and the <hi>high-ſtretched Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> of the <hi>Crown</hi> brought to an equal frame.</p>
            <p>I am perſwaded, that as it is the <hi>Genius,</hi> ſo it is the <hi>Intereſt</hi> of this Nation <hi>to have a Monarchy ſtill eſtabliſhed,</hi> for any other Form muſt unavoidably evert the whole bulk of our Laws and Cuſtoms, which might be of fatal Conſequence: Nor could any other Model be long liv'd here conſidering the natural bent of <hi>Scotsmen</hi> to this. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſince experience has diſcovered to us the worſt diſeaſes, that can attend <hi>Monarchy,</hi> I think if we be wiſe, we may now apply ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, as may ſecure us, for the future, againſt them; And ſo we may be ſafer under it, then any other kind of Government, the inconvenieneies whereof (in this Nation at leaſt) we can only diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by a tract of time.</p>
            <p>As to the choice of a <hi>Monarch,</hi> I think the beſt method is, <hi>to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the example</hi> England <hi>has ſet us.</hi> For beſides the juſt and ſolid Reaſons that determined their choice, which are all as pregnant and applicable to us; We have further this cogent Reaſon, that <hi>England</hi> having already declared the <hi>Prince of Orange their King,</hi> out of a due ſenſe of the Great Deliverance he has been Inſtrumental in working for them; We muſt do the ſame, unleſs we will declare our ſelves the moſt ingrate of Mankind, ſince we are delivered from a far greater Bondage then ever <hi>England</hi> felt: And unleſs we will reſolve to break with <hi>England</hi> and their King, which how fatal it might ſoon prove, every Body can ſee, more then is fit for the Honour of this Nation to expreſs. This I ſhall only ſay, that it were certainly very unkind to the <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> to divert, and weaken by ſuch a breach, the K. of <hi>Englands</hi> hands, who is now, under GOD, the chief ſupport of it.</p>
            <p>But ſeeing the Fondneſs of this Nation, for the Reſtoration of K. <hi>Charles the Second,</hi> did hurry them from one extream to another; from having abandoned the King and Royal Family, to give too much; and lay the Foundations of an unbounded Prerogative; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52071:5"/>
which an Aſpiring Court (deſigning to Copy after the Perfid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cruel <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It therefore nearly concerns and highly becomes the Wiſdom of the States of the Kingdom; Yea it is their Duty to the Nation, whom they Repreſent, and what they owe to their poſterity in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Ages; before they give the Crown out of their hands, to ſmooth and purge it of every thing that may be hard and grievous to the People; And to leave it only Adorned, with ſuch Jewels, as can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be firm and ſhining, when by Juſtice and Mercy they attract the Peoples hearts; but will prove brittle and dim when put to gall their Necks.</p>
            <p>I would therefore humbly offer to the Conſideration of this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſueing Meeting, ſome things, that to me ſeem neceſſary and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent for them to do, for retrieving this Nation from the intoller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Thraldom we have been brought under; And for vindicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and aſſerting the Peoples Juſt Right and Freedom, without robbing the Crown of any Jewel, that's fit for the Hononr of a <hi>King,</hi> who is to Rule by Law; Or without diminiſhing any part of the <hi>Kingly Power,</hi> that is neceſſary for enabling out Kings, to perform the great duties of their High Charge.</p>
            <p>Let our Kings be Veſted with Power to be <hi>Nurſing Fathers</hi> to the Church, to be <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> vigorous Aſterters and Defenders of the Honour and Well of the Nation, againſt Attempts from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, or Seditions at Home; Let them have Power to be <hi>Terrors to Evil doers, and Encouragers of theſe that do Well;</hi> Let them have Power to preſerve to all their Subjects, their Reſpective Properties and Liberties from all Inſolence and Injuſtice; to ſee all our Laws vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, Executed and all Tranſgreſſors impartially puniſhed. Theſe are the only true Jewels of the Crown, and every beyond this, that's fixed to it ought to be cleanſed and wiped off, as noiſom duſt and ruſt, that will throughly corrupt it. It is then the unqueſtiouable
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52071:5"/>
Duty of this Meeting of the <hi>States,</hi> to cut off from the Crown, all ſuch <hi>Excreſſences</hi> as are uſeleſs to a Juſt King, and to our ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, are Pernicious and of moſt dangerous conſequence to the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then, it has been often Aſſerted and maintained, <hi>That the King derives his Crown and Dignity immediately from GOD, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not, nor cannot give any Right or Title to it; That all power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is Originally and Eminently Inherent in the Crown, and that therefore the Parliament can give no Prerogative to the King.</hi> This has been long <hi>Currant Coyn at Court,</hi> and amongſt <hi>Court paraſites,</hi> and of late has had the boldneſs to appear <hi>Bare-fac'd</hi> in our <hi>Parliaments,</hi> where it ſeems to have given riſe to yea dictated ſome of our <hi>Acts about the prerogative.</hi> But it is obvious, that this is a <hi>Mother Evil,</hi> and may be broody of all the miſchiefs that can be dreaded from <hi>Arbitrary Power or Tyranny;</hi> For if this <hi>Maxime</hi> hold good, what ſecurity for our Religion, Laws, Property, or any thing that's dear to Free men or Chriſtians? Sure none, but the <hi>Princes</hi> pleaſure. Why then ſhould we complain of the late <hi>Court ſtile,</hi> which makes the <hi>Prerogative Royal,</hi> and a <hi>Supreme Abſolute Power to be obeyed without Reſerve,</hi> to ſignifie the ſame thing! Me thinks the <hi>Stile</hi> is very Juſt and Congtuous and goes very well on the Foot of this <hi>Maxime.</hi> Wherefore, as we would deliver our ſelves and our Poſterity from the evident hazard of <hi>Abſolute Slavery,</hi> this Pernicious <hi>Principle</hi> muſt be <hi>Abſolutely Eradicated.</hi> It will be fit the <hi>States</hi> ſeriouſly reviſe all our Acts about the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> &amp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever any thing is found to look this way, it muſt either be explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a harmleſs meaning, or if it will not bear a Tolerable ſenſe, it muſt be cancelled; <hi>For a little Leven may ſoure the whole Lump.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It will alſo be neceſſary, that the Aſſerting of this Principle by Word or Writ, be declared an High-Crime, againſt the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Conſtitution of our Government, puniſhable as Treaſon and unpardonable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It has taken deep root, and will need a ſevere ſteady hand over it, to keep it from ſpringing up again in its ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>from which God deliver us.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The late aſſumed <hi>Prerngative of diſabling, Suſpending or Diſpenſing with ſtanding Laws,</hi> muſt be declared Illegal, and againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a free Nation. I need not inſiſt to lay open the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief

I ſhall only ſay, it will be fit to declare that all Judges or others, to whom the Execution of the Law is committed, ſhall upon their higheſt Peril be obliged, to put the Laws of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to due Execution, notwithſtanding of any Command, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, or Diſpenſation they may get to the contrary, from any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons whatſoever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I humbly conceive it will be much the Nations advantage, if the <hi>Power of Pardoning</hi> be reſtrained, as to <hi>Aſſertors or Propagators of any Principles againſt the Freedom of the Nation and Parliaments, in favour of any pretended Prerogative.</hi> As alſo, <hi>as to all Judges, Officers or Miniſters of State and others having the King's Commiſſion, for Malverſing in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Offices.</hi> Becauſe if ever it be the ill-fate of this Nation, to come under a Deſigning and Aſpiring Prince, ſo long as he has the Power of Pardoning ſuch, he will never want Inſtruments to ſet up and eſtabliſh his <hi>Prerogative</hi> as high as ever: Neither will he want Judges and others, who will palpably pervert Juſtice, wreſt and trample on our Laws and Freedom, and with all their Might Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice them and us to his Ambition, or other ill Deſigns. And I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to every Man, that will make but any Reflection on our late Government, if he is not convinc'd, that many who ſerv'd it, durſt never have made ſuch ſteps as they did, if they had not reſted ſecure on that Pillow; That however <hi>Criminal</hi> they became, by ſuch meaſures, <hi>They being for the Kings ſervice,</hi> could get his Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on demand; Since there is, and will ever be a perverſe Crew of ill men, whom neither Honour nor Conſcience can bind, to be Faithful and Juſt to their Country; but who ſtill upon any hopes of Impunity, will be.

               </gap>able to the Princc. Let the Terror of ſevere Laws be ſet before them, to Over-awe them and ſtrip them of all hopes of Impunity by a Princes Favour.

            <p n="4">
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:52071:6"/>
4. It muſt be declared <hi>illegal, and not in the Kings power, to conſtitute any Judge or Judicature, Eccleſiaſtick, Civil or Criminal, except ſuch as are Authorized by the Laws of the Nation.</hi> As alſo that it is Illegal for the King to give wa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rand to any Judge to proceed otherwiſe in Judgement, then by the Forms and Rules; the Law and Practice of the Kingdom has ſet, for the ſeveral Judicatures and Caſes therein cognoſcible, and that all who accept and proceed, conform to any ſuch commiſſions or Warrands ſhall be ſeverely puniſhed.</p>
            <p>The experience of the Grievous oppreſſions the <hi>Weſtern, Southern,</hi> and ſome other ſhires of this Kingdom, have ſuffered, and the much Blood that hath been ſhed in them very ſummarly (to ſay no worſe) by vertue of ſuch Commiſſions and Proceedings, will I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Evince the neceſſity of this. For certainly ſo long as ſuch a power is left to the Crown no Man or Partie can reckon themſelves ſecure of their Liberties or Eſtates, no not of their very Lives longer, then they eſcape being Obnoxious to the Court, for then packt Judges and Arbitrary Forms and Rules of proceeding, may make ſharp Work, and havock enough, I confeſs I have often been ſurpriſed to ſee ſeveral Sober and Rational men ſatisfied with, and Applaud ſuch methods when uſed againſt theſe, they wiſhed to ſee undone. For being blinded with a Paſſion to have ſuch a party Ruined, they did not conſider that if the Cannon were turned a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ainſt themſelves, they might ſoon find the fatal Effects of ſuch methods, and be thereby ſummarly expoſed to ſome ſevere puniſhment in their Bodies or Goods, or perhaps both without hopes of Reddreſs. So it is every Man's Intereſt that every Subject have a Fair and Legal Tryal, and that all his concerns be Judged by the ordinary Judges; and conform to the known Laws and Practice of the Realm. And that any ſuch power be quite exploded, for which there can be no pretence, unleſs you will grant the King a Prerogative above all Laws.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it will be alledged that ſuch Commiſſions have been very uſeful in our <hi>High-Lands and Borders,</hi> and that it is impoſſible to bring the Theeves there to condign puniſhment, or prevent their ruining theſe Countries, unleſs it be allowed that they be Judged without the Ordinary Rules and Forms of Law. I humbly think it may be worth the ſerious conſideration of our firſt <hi>Parliament</hi> to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52071:7"/>
give their ſpecial Orders and Inſtructions for this caſe. But by no means, on this account, ought the leaſt twigg of any ſuch <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant Power</hi> above the Laws be left to the King. For if it ſhould be allowed, That the King by an <hi>Inherent power in the Crown</hi> may by his Commiſſion warrand the Judging of Theeves, without obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Ordinary Law in the Nation: Why may he not, by the ſame <hi>Inberent power?</hi> give ſuch Commiſſions for trying all alledged Guilty of every kind of Treaſon, or other Crimes and Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of any <hi>Penal Laws?</hi> Then, pray, what ſecurity has any Subject of a Legal Tryal for any guilt he ma<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> be charged with? Or what availeth the Laws and Judicatures eſtabliſhed for the ſafety of the Innocent, as well as the Puniſhment of the Guilty.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It will be fit it be declared; <hi>That all the Miniſters of State, Lords of Seſſion and Juſticiary, and other Inferiour Judges, who receive their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions from the King, ſhall always get them, ad Vitam aut Culpam:</hi> and not <hi>Durante Beneplacito.</hi> For when Men hold theſe places at pleaſure, it is certainly a great temptation to them who are not of a very firm Honeſty, to comply with any Deſigns of the Court, and humours of the preſent chief Favourites. And when an honeſt Man ſtands his ground, and refuſes ſuch a Servile Complyance againſt his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Conſcience, Then (as we have ſeen) he is preſently to be turned out and ſome plyable Tool (that will receive any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from theſe hands) put in his place; and ſo our Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, filled with Men who will give themſelves up to a blind Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the Dictates from Court. And what Juſtice can the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expect from ſuch Judges? I do not ſay, the aboliſhing Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions <hi>Durante Beneplacito</hi> will aſcertain us of Juſt Judges: But, to be ſure, it will free them, whom we ſhall have, from many Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to be unjuſt, and ſecure to us more firmly theſe that are juſt and honeſt: So it is well worth the while. There is one thing I cannot paſs about our Judges, tho it be not <hi>hujus loci.</hi> I think it would be much our intereſt to have <hi>Crimen Ambitus</hi> in force amongſt us; as to Seſſion and Juſticiarie eſpecially. Many wiſe People have thought that a Man's ſueing and Soliciting for ſuch Offices, was a juſt Ground to make him Suſpected, as unworthy of the Truſt. This is certain, if ſuch Methods were ſtrictly diſcharged and every one, at his admiſſion to theſe Offices, oblidged to purge himſelf
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52071:7"/>
of them; we might juſtly expect, they ſhould go more by Merit, then they can do while men are allowed to Brigue and Intrigue for them. For commonly Cunning and Falſe Men are moſt Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous, and Dexterous at Inſinuating into a Court.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>I think the Kings Eccleſiaſtick Supremacy, as it ſtands now Aſſerted by Acts of Parliament ought to be Abrogated.</hi> I will not enter on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, what power is allowable to a Chriſtian Magiſtrate in or about <hi>Eccl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſiaſtical Matters:</hi> but leaving this as unneceſſary to be diſcuſſed here; I ſhall prove the Aſſertion from theſe two conſiderations, firſt if there is any ſuch <hi>Supremacy</hi> allowable in a <hi>Chriſtian Nation</hi> to any Civil perſons or Judicature, it cannot with ſafety be truſted but where the <hi>Legiſlative power</hi> is Lodged. <hi>2dly.</hi> It appears uncharitable and unchriſtian to enact, or leave in Force any Laws Declaratorie of ſuch a <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Then conſider that by this <hi>Supremacy,</hi> the King has Power to turn off any Churchman Summary, without any Proceſs, (of this we have ſeen ſeveral inſtances) he hath alſo Power thereby at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to Cruſh any ſet of <hi>Clergy or Church Government</hi> he thinks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie to him, and advance any Party or Model, he hopes to be better ſerved by. He has by this <hi>Supremacy</hi> likewiſe Power (if not in expreſs terms, yet by very natural Conſequence,) to Suppreſs all Aſſemblies, Convocations of the Clergy, Synods, Presbyteries, Seſſions, or any other meetings of Churchmen neceſſary or conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, for preſerving Order in the Church. From conſideration of theſe things, it is evident and clear as Sun ſhine; That if ſuch a <hi>Supremacie</hi> be allowed to our Kings, then they ſhall have Power to introduce Corruptions in our Religion by a Corrupt Clergy, to raiſe conſtant Schiſms in our Church, to nouriſh and Foment a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Animoſitie and Perſecution by one party of Clergy againſt another, to the great reproach of our Religion, and danger of our State (as paſt experience may teach us) finally they ſhall have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to diſſolve and unhing our Church, by depriving Her of all means neceſſary, for eſtabliſhing and preſerving of Order and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline without which no Society can ſubſiſt. And ſurely, theſe things cannot happen in a <hi>Chriſtian Nation</hi> without bringing deadly Convulſions upon the <hi>Civil State.</hi> Now I am confident that after
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52071:8"/>
very little reflection on the whole, you and every Rational Man will Anticipate me in the Inference, and conclude that ſuch a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy is of the laſt Importance, both to the Religion and Civil Intereſt of the whole Nation, and not to be truſted to any, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament;</hi> if it is allowable to any Civil Power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable,</hi> to enact any Laws Declaratorie of ſuch a Supremacie, will evidently appear from this, that it gives great ſcandal to good Proteſtants, and p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aceable Subjects, and is no wayes neceſſary. Surely, then it is very unbecoming <hi>Chriſtian Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> and <hi>Moderation</hi> to give great Offence, and lay a ſtumbling block before ſuch, Officiouſly and Needleſly. Now all the World knows this Supremacy has been <hi>a ſt<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ne of ſtumbling both to Jew and Gentile,</hi> (if I may ſo ſpeak) for not only the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> have ſtill declaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, as an <hi>Antichriſtian inchroachment upon Chriſts prerogative;</hi> but many <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> have judged it an Invaſion and Diminution of the <hi>intrinſick power, conſigned by CHRIST to his Church;</hi> whereupon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall minent amongſt that Clergy reſuſed our Teſt. Thus as the Offenſive Nature of ſuch Laws is evident; So every conſidering Man muſt acknowledge, That they are uſeleſs, becauſe all Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Church Government</hi> ſhould only be founded on theſe Grounds; That, <hi>What is thereby injoyned is agreeable to the Word of GOD, moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the practiſe of the pureſt Churches, and moſt proper and conducing for the Advancement of Truth, Piety and good Order in this Church.</hi> Now on theſe Reaſons, onely let every thing in Relation to the <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>licy</hi> of the Church be Enacted in Parliament, without pretending or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring by any Act, what power they have in ſuch Matters. Thus I am ſute, King and Parliament may do their Duty in this Matter, from time to time, and a great Deal, if not All the Offenſe would be removed. For it cannot be denyed, That, the <hi>Legiſlative power be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, what Form of Government they apply their civil Sanction to, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Legal Government of the Nation;</hi> Which is all needs be claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their medling in ſuch Matters cannot be quarrelled, ſince all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> do not only approve, the Parliaments Ratifying of our very <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> but ordinarly plead that thereby we have greater <hi>priviledges and right for defence</hi> of it, than any <hi>principle of Religion</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:52071:8"/>
it ſelf gives us. The only hazard is, that they may Err in their choice, but I know no Remedy for this, (unleſs we go to <hi>Rome</hi> for Infallibility, and I fear we ſhould looſe our Labour) except, That no ſuch Laws be impoſed Rigorouſly, to be owned by all, but a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Toleration allowed to <hi>peaceable Diſſenters:</hi> Seeing then there is no uſe for ſuch <hi>Declaratory Laws</hi> of an <hi>Eceleſiaſtick Supremacy;</hi> Were it not very uncharitable to keep them on foot, for a ſnare and for ginn to ſo many of our <hi>Chriſtian Brethren</hi> of the ſame <hi>Religion.</hi> I may add further, it were very Dangerous to the <hi>publick peace,</hi> for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from this Fountain many of Our <hi>inteſtine commotions</hi> have ſprung, and theſe ſtreams are not yet dryed up.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And Laſtly, Having already far exceeded the due bounds of a Letter, and the brevitie I deſigned; I ſhall Croud all that occures to me further about the <hi>Prerogative</hi> into one Article. I think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary the <hi>Convention</hi> take to their ſerious conſideration, <hi>The Kings ſole power of Diſpoſal of Trade, his power of ſetting Valuation on current Money, his power of the Militia, of Peace and Warr, and raiſing the Nation in Arms;</hi> as they are declared in the reſpective Acts thereanent: As alſo the Practice of the <hi>Kings eſtabliſhing Inſtructions of Warr, and thereby exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Souldiers from the ordinary Laws and Judicatures.</hi> We have ſeen and felt grievous abuſes in the Nation from all theſe, as I could In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but that I haſte to a cloſe; and it is enough to my purpoſe, that every thinking Man upon a very little reflection will ſee ſuch powers may be the Foundation of Arbitrary proceedings in many caſes of high Importance to the whole Nation. I confeſs I do not think it adviſeable or ſafe; to diveſt the King wholly of theſe Powers, and reſerve them to a Parliament: For the exerciſe of all or moſt of them may be very neceſſary, much oftner then we can expect or de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire <hi>parliaments,</hi> &amp; may trvſt with the <hi>reaſonable intervals of parliaments;</hi> neither do I think it poſſible to lay down fixed Rules, that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue uſeful for any time, for the Kings managment of theſe Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſuch is the inconſtancie and viciſſitude of humane Affairs. The only <hi>Medium</hi> I can think on is, that the King ſhall be reſtricted, in the exerciſe of theſe Powers, to the Advice and Concurrence of a Council, or Councils to be named by the Parliament out of the

And this is certain that if once the Crown be ſettled, and a ſet of Officers of State, and Counſellours eſtabliſhed, (our Nobility and great Miniſters have unhappily been ſo accuſtomed, to carrie things here with ſo high a hand,) They will be ſure to uſe all their Intereſt to

                  <hi>I Have ſaid nothing of the</hi> Kings Negative Vote in Parliament, and his Power of Adjourning and Diſſolving them. <hi>Tho it is of the greateſt Importance, for if it ſtands, as it is now Aſſerted, all hopes of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of Griveances by a</hi> Parliament <hi>are cut off under an ill Government, when there is greateſt need of it. Wherefore it much concerns this Meeting to adjuſt in to an harmleſs Temper. Yet I muſt confeſs. I can hit upon no overture for this that pleaſes me. But I doubt not, The things is ſo Obvious and of ſuch vaſt Conſequence, you will hear of it from better hands.</hi>
