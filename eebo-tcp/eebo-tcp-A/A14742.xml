         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

with the whole Counsell of God:

Statutes and Proclamations wanting

was the scope of our Lords last so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
and vncouth action, of gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
himselfe with a Towell, rising
from his Magisteriall Seate, washing
and wiping his Disciples feete. Hee

of Regeneration so often, as wee
soile our feete in the mire of this

The other Morall, to set his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
a patterne of humility and loue,
stooping to the meanest Offices of
mutuall seruice, without emulation
or affectation of priority, which hee
foresaw, would else bee the bane of
their sacred function. But his third
and most principall ayme, was by
this his both verball and reall strange
kind of lesson, to learne them not so
much what they knew not, as the vse
of doing that they knew, else would
words onely haue serued the turne,
and not so much adoe haue needed,
but he first does the things, and then
expresses his intent, <hi>These things if
you doe, &amp;c.</hi> In this conditionall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction

which Happinesse is conferred, and
to which it is confined. <hi>These things:</hi>

Secondly, the 2. acts required hereto;
<hi>If you know: If you do:</hi> chiefely, the
chiefe of them is, <hi>If you do:</hi> to which
happinesse is foreannexed specially:
<hi>Happy are you, if you doe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>These things.</hi>] The knowledge
and practice of these things onely,
blesseth, these maine Arch-mysteries
of Faith, and these diuine &amp; cardinal
vertues of loue and humility, symbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized
in their ablution, and not the
doing or knowing of all the naturall,
morall, or manuall Sciences in the
world besides.</p>
            <p>If one knew all the Circle of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and knew, as was said of <hi>Berin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius,</hi>
all that was knowable, all the
rules of Policy, secrets of State, myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of trading, &amp; could execute them
all; yet in his such knowing and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
he might not blesse himselfe, were
not happy, nor so to bee reputed of
Christians. The right placing or
misplacing of Happinesse, is the Rud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of a mans life, the Fountain of his
well or ill doing; according to which,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20116:5"/>
men take their markes, and shoote
right or wrong, all the actions of their
liues. He that admireth in his heart,
and blesseth with his mouth, any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Idol of Good, in stead of this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true good, must needs misse of his
end, &amp; be a miserable man, grosly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
his markes, as silly country
people, that oftentimes giue termes
of Honours and Maiesties to meane
persons. So doe most people, when
they transferre this transcendent
word, and stately thing, <hi>Happinesse,</hi>
vnto any shadow of skill, saue of these
things, to which it is perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
in Scriptures, <hi>Psalme 1. Luke
11. Iames</hi> the 1. Insomuch that Christ
himselfe was displeased when they
bestowed it on the Paps &amp; Wombe
of his Mother, in comparison of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and keeping his Fathers will:
<hi>Heere then,</hi> and heere only is to bee
found the lost Iewell of Happinesse,
which well may we likened to a
Stake set vp in the middest of a
Field, which blinded men groape
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20116:6"/>
after, to make the beholders sport at
their wandrings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Augustine</hi> tels of a Mountebank, that
vndertooke in a City of great tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
to tell euery man his wish,
which was in his fallible coniecture,
to buy cheape, and sell deare. But
here, he who hath made, and knoweth
the hearts of all, tels euery man the
end of his desire; and that which is
more, shewes him the way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
them. <hi>Those things if you
know, and if you doe them, happy
are you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This first, If, prouidently premixed,
and cautelously presupposed by
Christ, intimates, that knowledge
must be the Pilote, Guide and Vsher
of Practice, else superstitious deedes
done by roat and randome, the blind
Whelpes of ignorant deuotion, God
regards not. Good workes, the fruits
of faith, &amp; children of a Beleeuer that
knowes what he does, such are only
pleasing in his sight. Christ diuinely
foresaw the diuelish policy of subtill
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:20116:6"/>
worldlings, that would cry vp practice,
to cry downe knowledge, as cunning
Papists wil extol S. <hi>Iames,</hi> to disparage
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> praise good meanings,
&amp; works, with an euill eye to hearing
Sermons, and reading good bookes,
and carnall Protestants be euer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending
reading, to disgrace
preaching; and another sort euer tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of a good heart, a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the power of Religion, euer
disliking all shew and profession of
it; which, if well obserued, are the
least and worst doers in a Conntry.
Which Satanicall Sophisme, Saint
<hi>Iames</hi> deepely preuents; who, though
the chiefe aime of his Epistle, was, to
vrge Hypocrites to bee Doers, and
vaine boasters of iustifying faith, to
iustifie their Faith by their workes:
yet forelaid this Caueat, <hi>Be swift to
heare;</hi> Needfull euen in these hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and knowing times, wherein
though knowledge couer the earth,
as waters the Sea, yet may the Lord
haue iustly a controuersie with the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20116:7"/>
Land, or a great number at least in
it, like <hi>dry Rocks in the middest</hi> of this
Sea, who haue not a dramme of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
and well grounded knowledge.
But this is but a pre-requisite to the
maine thing heere required, which
happinesse is intendedly fore-placed,
knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being but a step to this
turret of Happinesse: <hi>Happy are you,
if you doe them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here's the labour, here is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie,
here is the happinesse, in the
coniunction of doing with knowing,
to practise that wee know; to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the duties prescribed in the
Gospell; to beleeue the things to bee
beleeued, and to doe the things to be
done; the summe of Faith and Loue,
sweetly coupled in this significant ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
of his Disciples feete.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Three noble ends Diuinitie</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds
to her followers: the first and
greatest, Gods Glory; the second
next to that, mans owne content
heere, and saluation hereafter: the
last like to the former, the edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:20116:7"/>
and conuersion of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.
In the attainment of these, is a
Christians perfection, and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
none whereof, bare Theorie
shall euer more then come neere. All
three, practice ioyned thereto, fully
apprehends.</p>
            <p>Of these three that must needs be
the noblest, which God primarily
intended in the Reuelation of his
will to mankinde, and <hi>Moses</hi> oft tels
vs is, that wee might obserue to doe
them: For if (as <hi>Wolphius</hi> reasoneth
by a distribution) hee had giuen vs
his Lawes to preserue onely, he safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier

This being his chiefe honour to haue
his Throne and command not in the
Head, and Braines, but in the strong
holds of their hearts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and liues. For
what shall God reward thee, O man,
but for that which men praise God
for in thee? Now for admirable
gifts of Science and Learning, men
may admire thee, but they giue God
thankes onely for the good they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
from thee. The Sunne it selfe if
it did not shine &amp; giue warmth vnto
the creatures, were the glorious hiew
of it ten times more then it is none
would halfe so much blesse God for
it. The men for whom our heauenly
Father is glorified, are such vvhose
workes shine afore men, who warme
the loynes of the poore, and with
their knowledge are an eye to the
blinde. I can hardly beleeue, that
God euer made any creature only to
behold, neither Starre, Pearle,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20116:8"/>
Flower, or feathered fowle, onely to
shew their glorious outsides; but to
haue influence, vertues, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
beneficiall to mankinde: much
lesse a man to know onely, or an Art
onely to bee knowne, but all to his
glory, and mans seruice: which to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
is all the glory of men, and Arts.
Some Sciences, I know, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of others more operatiue, are
tearmed speculatiue: but not one of
these, whose speculation tends and
ends not in some operation, by
which man is profited, and God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured;
specially Diuinitie, vvhich
makes vs his workmanship, not to
knowledge, but to good workes, to
the praise of his grace. Who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
a Schoolemaster, vvhose
Schollers can say and vnderstand
their Rules, but speake not, and write
not any good stiles by them? A Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
vvhose Souldiers can skill of
Militarie termes and orders, vnlesse
their Acts and exploits of Warre be
sutable? Who praiseth an horse that
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20116:9"/>
feedes well, but is not deedy for the
race, or trauell; speed, or length. Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

of the Apostles, but much of their
Acts. These are the richest, and vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
stiles of commendation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

of men, and such men shall bee
blessed of God in their deeds: and as
the more knowing vvithout doing
shall procure the more stripes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
God for them is the more blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed:
So the more doing with
knowing, shall haue double honour,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:20116:9"/>
because God was doubly honoured
in them. <hi>Behold, I come quickly, and my

            <p>The second branch of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
vvherein doing hath the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage
of knowing, is in the perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
benefit, consisting in the present
sweetnesse, and future gaine accrew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereby: some luscious delight,
yea, a kinde of rauishing doucenesse
there is in studying good Bookes, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
on good notions, not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
that which is in tasting and
swallowing sweet meates, vvhich
made the <hi>Epicure</hi> in <hi>Aelian,</hi> wish
his throate as long as the <hi>Cranes,</hi> but
all the benefit is in the strength, and

For instance, thou findest

Were it not for the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
energie, and efficacie in the heart
and life, there might be well-neere
as much pleasure in reading the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
commendations of folly, or pride,
as in the sound Tractate of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,

said in the language of fooles, in
the reading of Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> as Saint
<hi>Peter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All discourses of Faith, and Hope,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20116:10"/>
are but dry things, in comparison of
the acts and practice of them, which
are delicate aboue the Hony and
the Hony-combe, sweeter then the
taste of any Nectar. Some say, the
study of the Law is cragged, that if
the gaine of practice did not swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
it, few would plot vpon <hi>Ployden.</hi>
But I beleeue, few would study Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> and preach as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did,
instantly in season, out of sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
(quaintly and rarely they might
for credit and preferment) but pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
and profitably, I hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
they would; feruently and fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
they cannot, except the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their practice driue and
constraine them. Of all men I hold
them fooles, that bend their studies
to Diuinitie, not intending to bee
Doers, as well as Students, and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers;
not much vviser, such as will
be professors of Religion, and not
practicioners. The Parables in
the <hi>Talmud</hi> fits their folly well, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling
them to such as plowe,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20116:11"/>
and sow all the yeere, and neuer

all the Summer, and wants in the
Winter: to vvomen euer conceiuing,
and euer making abortion, neuer

all, to that of Christ distinguishing
Hearers into foolish, that build on
the Sand of Hearing, and professing,
blowne downe vvith euery puffe of
Trouble; and the wise, that build on
the Rocke of Doing, vnshakeable.

Is not the ancient tenour of the

happinesse in this life, and that to
come, is conferred vpon the liuing
acts and exercises, not vpon the dead
habits of any grace whatsoeuer. In
all labour there is aboundance, but in
the conceits of the braine, and talke
of the lippes, nothing but emptinesse
and misery. If one could doe as
much as Master <hi>Stoughton</hi> prints, and
many credible witnesses report of the
young Gentlewoman of nine yeeres
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20116:12"/>

word of Gods Word. If one should
take paines to get together a great
number of songs, curiously set, artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
composed, yea, and knew how
to sing or play them, and yet neuer
heard them sung or plaid, what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

Verily, the Atheisme of the times
hath this for the principall fountaine

and repentance hardly comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
vvho often protested, that the
vicious and offensiue life of a great
learned man in the Towne where she
liued. occasioned those damned
doubts. This opens mens mouthes,
and giues the hint of all blasphemies,
scornes and scoffes of Religion. Such
as he broke vpon the Iesuites, whom

The old Apostles, indeed, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Either this is not Gods

know, and the lesse they doe, the
more doe they dishonour God.</p>
            <p>And vvhat are such themselues the
better for their knowledge, but as the
Preacher experimentally speakes:
Hee that increaseth such knowledge,
addeth sorrow. Their folly I cannot
better expresse, then <hi>Erasmus</hi> in his
Dialogue of a carnall Gospeller,
whom he cals <hi>Cyclops Euangeliophorus,</hi>

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:20116:17"/>
This man hee discouers by certaine
Interrogatories, to haue no inward
knowledge or affection to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
nor better proofe of his loue
thereto, then that hee carried it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies

the pate of a <hi>Franciscan,</hi> that had
railed on <hi>Erasmus,</hi> and the new <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers.</hi>
To conuince him; hee askes
him, What if he vvere tyed euer to
carry the bottle at his Girdle, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
to taste of it; or but to taste only,
and neuer to drinke it downe: His
answere is, that vvere but a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>Tantalus</hi>-like. But vvhat if hee
did, as his manner was, drinke deepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of it? He then answeres, It vvould
vvarme his heart, refresh his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
cheere his countenance: So
sayes he, would that little Booke, if

digest, and turne it into nutriment in

their memories or vnderstandings, as
Asses do dainty burdens, &amp; taste not
of them, haue no fruit of them them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.
Verily, a man knowes no more
rightly then he practises. It is said of
Christ, he knew no sinne, because hee
did no sinne; and in that sence, hee
knowes no good, that doth no good;
he that vvill obey, shall know my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
will; and such as vvill not doe
vvhat they know to bee good, shall
soone vnknow that which they know,
and become as if they neuer had
knowne any such matter: it beeing
iust with God to punish shipwracke
of a good conscience, with losse of the
fraught of knowledge; according to
that imprecation of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi>
that if they should abuse their skill in
musicke, their right hand might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
his cunning, and their tongue
cleaue to the roofe of their mouthes.
From which iust Iudgement I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
my selfe, it comes to passe, that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20116:18"/>
many become in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
meere skepticks, because
they vvould not bee practicks, and
that the commonest Religion of our
times, is <hi>Socrates</hi> his vncertainty.
Men know nothing now a dayes. It
is become a disputable probleme,
Whether the Pope be <hi>Antichrist,
Rome a good Church;</hi> whether a man
may worship God before pictures,
play vpon any part of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,
as well as vpon the Weeke
dayes; whether election be of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seene
faith; whether the True Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
may Apostatize? Shortly, I thinke,
whether the Scripture be Scripture;
and vvhether there bee a God, or
no? To conclude, a good vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
haue all they that doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
and cursed are all such as know
these things, and doe the cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
            <p>Cursed (I say) are they, because
they lay a stumbling blocke before
others both vveake ones within, and
bad ones vvithout, such I say, as
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:20116:18"/>
know God, and yet deny him in their
liues, and are reprobate to euery
good word and worke; such as buy
by one ballance, and sell by another,<note place="margin">Orig. in. Deut.</note>
haue a forme of knowledge, which
they prescribe to others, and liue
themselues by contrary Rules. Of
such I vvould I could speake with
as much detestation, as <hi>Paul</hi> writes
of them: friends in shew,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> but ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
in truth to the crosse of Christ.
Vncleane beasts, for all their chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the cud, repeating of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
because they diuide not the
hoofe; walke vvithout all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and iudgement; as if GOD
had giuen them their lights to tread
in puddles, and gutters withall, to
vvalke and wallow in the myre of
all filthinesse; vvhich makes men
mislike, not onely their persons, but
the very Religion which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
too: Some few wise &amp; groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
Christians vvill doe as they
say, and not as they doe: heare
them, because they sit in the chaire
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20116:19"/>
of <hi>Moses;</hi> but the greatest number
will loath their sayings, for their
doings; as men the good light of a
Candle, for the ill sauour the stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
tallow yeelds, resoluing as the
<hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
their Religion bee, they vvill
bee of the cleane contrary; if such
goe to Heauen, they will goe to
Hell. I wonder vvith vvhat face
such can call themselues Christians,<note place="margin">Greg. Nyssen. de nomine Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani.</note>
or vvith vvhat eares heare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
of called. Does any man
looke to bee called a Carpenter, that
neuer squared Timber, or erected
frames? What if neuer so skilfull?
I say of all such skill, as <hi>Cato</hi> of
superfluous vselesse trifles, They are
deare of a farthing, that are good
for nothing.</p>
            <p>Oh rather let vs al lay claime to that
honorable name, doe the workes of
Christians, and thereby approoue
our selues to God and man, as the
Angell to <hi>Manoah,</hi> who being asked
of his name, made answere, It was
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20116:19"/>
wonderfull, and did wonderfully, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
in the flame, and made good
his name by his action. Heere is the
labour, and heere lies all the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
the Maximes and Sanctions of
things to be done, and beleeued, are
but few, conteyned in briefe Summa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
but the incentiues, motiues, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections,
repoofes,<note place="margin">Sic Epicttetus de Philosophia.</note> and such like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenances
of practice: these make
volumes swell, these lengthen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and multiply bookes. The art
of doing, is that which requires stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
strength and diuine assistance. Do
the sinnes that swarme in our times,
proceede from ignorance, or inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
rather, and wilfulnesse? It were
happy if men had that Plea, if the
light were not so great, the times and
the Nation had not sinne. May wee
not vse the Apostles ordinary incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and exprobation? Know you
not, that Idolatry, Swearing, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking,
Drinking and Whoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
are sinnes? Know you not
that for these things comes the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20116:20"/>
of God? Is any so simple, that he
knowes not the tenne Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and the summe of the Gospell?
yet how desperatly do men rush vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
these Pikes, carelesly, wittingly,
and willingly, seeing the Gulfe, and
yet leaping into it? Many condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
themselues in <hi>Medeas</hi> termes, see
the better, and yet follow the worse,
hauing no heart to leaue that they see
to be euill: as if men thought that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
only should condemne, as if
God should onely come in flaming
fire, to render vengeance vpon poore
Pagans, Sauages, and Indians, or He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes,
that know not the truth, and
not much more vpon his owne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants,
that knew and refused to doe
his will.</p>
            <p>The Infidell disputes against the
faith,<note place="margin">Aug. lib. 4. contra Donat.</note> the impious liues against it; the
one denies it in termes, the other in
deedes; and therefore both shall bee
held as enemies to the faith, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
attaine saluation: of the two, it is
worst to kick against the prick; one
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20116:20"/>
sees, then to stumble in the darke at a
block, one sees not. But heere is the
chiefe cause of all impiety, illuminatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
is easie, sanctification is hard to flesh
and bloud, requires crossing and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
yea crucifying of our lusts, wils
and affections, which is not done
without much prayer and trauell; and
therfore men neglect that, &amp; content
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues with the easier and cheaper
worke. Vpon this therefore do I wish
Christians would set prices, &amp; spend
their studies, euen about the art of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
But how shall we attaine this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
and faculty of doing? I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere,
to wish it, and heartily to desire
it, is halfe; yea, and the best halfe of
the work, as <hi>Socrates</hi> was wont to say,
Hee that would bee an honest man,
shall soone bee one, and is past the
hardest part of the worke. To affect
goodnesse aboue cunning, is a good
signe, and a good helpe, and step to
be such an one, especially when this
desire breeds prayer for power to do,
knowing that without Christ, wee can
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20116:21"/>
doe iust nothing, but lye becalmed &amp;
vnable to moue or promoue, as a
Ship on the Sea, a Mill on the Land,
without the breath of his Spirit. And
this I commend as the best and first
generall helpe of practice, that euery
morning, and in the enterprize of all
thy affaires, thou acknowledge thine
owne disability, or rather deadnesse
to euery good worke, and commend
thy selfe to the worke of his grace,
for the will and the deede: for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenting,
and subsequent; operating,
and co-operating; perseuering, and
perfecting grace: intreating him not
onely to regenerate thee, and giue
thee new Principles of motion, but
to renew his inspiration vpon euery
new act of thine, that by Christ, or
rather Christ by and in thee, may doe
all things, pray as if thou hadst no
will, vow as if there were no grace,
that is seriously both.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in the vse of all meanes
of practice, when thou goest to heare,
reade or meditate, pray and desire,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20116:21"/>
thou maist light vpon profitable and
pertinent Themes, Bookes, and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
applicatory, and leuelling at
thy selfe and Orations, as if made for
thee rather then for any body else:
desire not to gather Flowers, but
Pot-herbes, and Fruite. Charmes
are said to haue no effect, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
one goe with a beliefe vnto
them, I am sure no meanes or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
will doe thee any good,
vnlesse thou goe with a mind to bee
bettered by them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, in the vse of these, attend
to thy selfe as well as to the matter,
haue one eye and eare fixed on what
is said, and another on thy selfe; lay
thy selfe to the rule, and say, What
is this to mee? how doe I and
that agree? Bee not as little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
who while they are loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in the Glasse, thinke onely
it is the babies face, and not their
owne: obserue not in hearing a
Sermon, the pleasing sound of the
Pipe, but how thou dancest thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20116:22"/>
in reading of the Scriptures, at
the end of euery period, aske thy
heart, How doe I practise this? or,
How does this reproofe taxe mee?
This promise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort me? When thou
art well perswaded to doe any thing,
resolue throughly to doe it; and when
resolued, dispatch, and execute it
speedily.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, after the Sermon is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
stay not, as the common manner
is, Now the Sermon is done: but
consider it is not done, till thou hast
done it; after reading and hearing,
do as men do after dinner; sit awhile,
con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oct it by pondering of it, digest
it, and after draw it out into action.
So doe such as learne Musike, or wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
they play ouer their Lesson,
write after the Coppy: this I thinke
<hi>Paul</hi> meant, when he saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise
my selfe to haue an inoffensiue
conscience, &amp;c. Most erre grosely in
the faile of this, thinking it enough
to retaine it in memory, to repeate it
ouer, seruing diuinity as absurdly, as
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:20116:22"/>
the country-man his Physike, who
being bidden to take his bill or receit,
tooke it home, and carried it in his
pocket, and after, finding no ease
vpon his complaint, being directed
to take it in posset-Ale, put the bill in
a Cup, but neuer tooke the ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
prescribed into his body: and
looke how much good his Physike
did him; so much good will diuinity
doe vs, taken into our memories, and
tongues, and no further.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, in all thy talke, discourses
and counsels to others, lick first thine
owne fingers: that wiseman is a foole,
that is not wise for himselfe; and yet
many such there bee, that can preach
and write good bookes, like <hi>Tusser,</hi>
that wrote well of Husbandry, and
was the most vnthrifty husband him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
that euer water wet.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, &amp; lastly, in all thy priuy rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>konings
with thy selfe, which must be
duely obserued at the cloze of euery
weeke, month and yeere, lesse and
more solemnely, obserue what thou
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20116:23"/>
hast done, consider if thou shouldst
keepe a Diary or Iournall, as many
thriuing Christians doe, what acts it
would record, when I goe out of the
world; what, shall the world say, hath
this man done singular, or memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?
Take such accounts of thy selfe
dayly, as Masters of their Iourni-men
and Apprentices: as <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Task<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>masters,
of the Israelites: Where
is the worke done this day? lest
thou bee as Huntsmen and Faulco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
that haue toyled all the
day, and haue no quarry
or roast at
night.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:20116:23"/>
               <head>A word of Application.</head>
               <p>IF now at the end of my Sermon,
my seuerall Hearers and Readers
would doe as Saint <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> did,
aske what shall I doe? and what shall
I doe? You haue said much in the
generall of Doing: What say you
in particular to this Nation, and to
the seuerall conditions of men in it?</p>
               <p>I answere: What can I say to
these knowing times, which hath not
beene said before me? What new
doctrine vnheard of before, is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for me to broach? I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
say no more, but, Do that which
you know you should doe. If you
know that <hi>Baal</hi> be god, if <hi>Rome</hi> be the
Church, let vs returne to it againe:
If you know that Swearing, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking,
and fashion-follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
be good things; let vs all fall to
doe these things. But if God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
vs the Truth, and the light, let
vs walke in it, and worke by it, while
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:20116:24"/>
it is to Day; lest if wee play Reuell
and ryot, by it the Candlesticke bee
remoued, and the light put out: if
purity, sanctitie, and sobrietie bee
knowne to you to bee good things,
and pleasing to God, <hi>Happy are you,
if you doe them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Certaine things there are knowne,
and acknowledged, at all hands, as
meet to be done, that an able Minister
might be prouided for euery Parish,
that Popery, swearing, &amp; drunkennes
would bee suppressed. But why are
they euer spoken of, and neuer done?
How did they in superstition main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
so many idle bellies? How was
the head of the beast cut off at the
first in this nation? Is it harder for vs
to cut off the friggling tayle of that
<hi>Hydra</hi> of <hi>Rome?</hi> How was the infinit
swarme of Rogues and Beggers sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by good Lawes? Verily, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is hard to industrious &amp; actiue
spirits, God assisting: and now it's
high time, and GOD lookes that
these things should be done.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:20116:24"/>
                  <hi>To the Reuerend Clergie,</hi> and such
as carry holinesse in their fronts. Let
such bee sure to haue <hi>Thummim,</hi> as
well as <hi>Vrim</hi> on their brests; their
right thumbs and feete anointed
with holy oyle, as vvell as their right
eares; their fruitfull Pomgranats on
their skirts, as well as their Bels to
ring and make a sound withall, lest
they bee as tinckling Cymbals to
Gods and mens eares. You know
better then I can tell you what should
be done: Happy are you if you doe
what you know.</p>
               <p>To Nobles and great Persons: It's
not your countenancing of Religion
will serue the turne, which yet were
vvell, if many of you would affoord
but your practizing of it, not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
of a Chaplaine to say and doe
you such seruice as <hi>Ahabs</hi> foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
did; but a faithfull <hi>Michaiah,</hi>

done, whom you may heare as
<hi>Cornelius</hi> did <hi>Peter,</hi> with an intent to

deliuers out of Gods Booke vnto
you.</p>
               <p>To Gentlemen: For Gods sake doe
something, besides Hawking and
Hunting, &amp; liuing vpon your Lands,
and Patrimonies. You haue better
meanes of knowing, and doing, then
meaner men. Happy if you do vvhat
you know.</p>
               <p>To Lawyers, and Souldiers: I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you to Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> counsel, which
vvill serue you both; and happy
should they and their Clyents be, if
they would practise it, bee content

               <p>To Merchants and Trades-men:
If you beleeue there bee a Country

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20116:25"/>
that vvill bring no gaine, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
diligently followed, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;
it's not a nimble head, but a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent

               <p>In a word, to all hearers and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to Sermons: Play not the fooles
as most doe: heare not, to heare:
goe not to Church as many now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes
doe to Vniuersities and Innes
of Court, neither to get Learning,
Law, nor money, for meere forme or

Reading is a wearinesse to the flesh, but

The generall complaint of the world is,
