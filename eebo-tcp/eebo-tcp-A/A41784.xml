            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Whereunto is prefixed An ANSWER to two QUESTIONS propounded by Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Church-memberſhip and Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>By THOMAS GRANTHAM.</p>
            <q>The Earth alſo is defiled under the Inhabitants thereof, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the Laws, changed the Ordinance, broken the everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant. <bibl>Iſa. 24. 5.</bibl>
            </q>
            <q>Now I praiſe you, Brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances, as I delivered them to you <bibl>1 Cor. 11. 2.</bibl>

            <head>To the READER.</head>
            <p>IT appears by Mr. <hi>Pett</hi>'s Epiſtle to the Reader, that he took hold of a very ſlight occaſion to write againſt the Baptized Believers; it was, becauſe one (without acquainting him with it) came over to their Communion.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh he had been more patient under ſo ſmall a trial, and thereby ſaved me this labour: which whether it will end here I know not; that may be as he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>I hold it no convenient time for <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to write one againſt another; Friendly Conferences might do much better. But I have found Men of Mr. <hi>Pett</hi>'s Principles very averſe to that, when it has been offered.</p>
            <p>I have not anſwered each particular Page in Mr. <hi>Pett</hi>'s Book, for that one and the ſame thing is very often repeated. I have chiefly dealt with his two main Arguments, on which his whole Diſcourſe depends.</p>
            <p>What he ſays about the mode of Sprinkling, I have not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled with, nor is it needful. For we ſee that generally, ſuch as are ſeriouſly convinced of their Duty in the caſe of Baptiſm, will not, if they might, receive it but in the way of Immerſion. They are preſently apprehenſive that no way can be ſo ſafe for them, as to follow Chriſt himſelf, who it's certain was baptiſed ſo: For it is granted by the Learned, that <hi>Mark 1. 9.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, may be truly read, <hi>And was dipped of John into Jordan.</hi> This account of our Saviour's Baptiſm is ſufficient to decide this Controverſy, about the manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, if the higheſt and moſt perfect Example that ever was be of any force at all.</p>
            <p>What I have offered on behalf of Infants Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, may perhaps ſeem too full of Charity in the
<pb facs="tcp:43974:3"/>
Judgment of Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> and ſome others. But if that offend thee, do but conſider from whom this Doctrine of <hi>Infants Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> has proceeded, it's either of God or Man. I have ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the Scriptures, but could never find his Word (that is Truth it ſelf) declare ſuch a dreadful Sentence againſt any one Infant, much leſs that the greateſt part of dying Infants are damn'd.</p>
            <p>Could Men be ſatisfied of the certainty of the Salvation of their dying Infants, the Controverſy about baptiſing them would come to an End; for as far as I could ever learn, it came into the World upon this Miſtake, that they could not be ſav'd without it.</p>
            <p>And tho Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> ſeems to diſlike <hi>Cyprian's</hi> Judgment here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet what does he ſay leſs himſelf in <hi>p. 1.</hi> where he inſinuates that thoſe <hi>who deny the Baptiſm of Infants, exclude millions out of the great Charter of Heaven.</hi> But this may perhaps be found their Fault, who exclude all but the Infants of ſuch as they count Believers, when the reckoning comes to be truly ſtated.</p>
            <p>I never ſaw Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> 's Book till I had anſwered Mr. <hi>Petto.</hi> And at the requeſt of ſome, as alſo for that his Queſtions may ſeem to be ſerious and conſiderable, I thought it needful to give a ſerious and Chriſtian Anſwer to them, which I hope I have done. And as I muſt commend Chriſtians in their Enquiry, what Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God's Love we have concerning Infants, and therein be an Enquirer as much as any, having Children of my own; ſo I think it needful to caution my ſelf and others, that we ſet not up our own Devices for ſuch Evidences, leſt our Hope be thereby leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened, ſeeing our impoſing that upon Infants which God has not required at our hands, is no ſign of his Love to them at all.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <head type="sub">Containing Brief Anſwers to two Queſtions, propounded by Mr. <hi>Giles Firmin,</hi> in his Book called, <hi>The Plea of the Children of believing Parents.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEcauſe Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s Queſtions bear date, four years before Mr. <hi>Petto</hi>'s Arguments, I will give them Precedence in my an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering them.</p>
            <p>Their Books are much of one quality, ſave that Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s abounds with more unhandſom Reflections upon many, in which kind of dealing it were eaſy to give Retaliation; but that is not commendable.</p>
            <p>What he writes againſt Mr. <hi>Danvers,</hi> I leave to him to vindicate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as he has done againſt others, and that very well, either by juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Authorities, or rectifying ſuch Over-fights, as might eaſily befal the moſt accurate Writer in ſuch a multitude of Quotations; and which I am perſuaded would much ſatisfy Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> himſelf, would he impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially read the Controverſies.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> being a wiſer Man than to engage cloſely in the Queſtion about the Divine Authority for Infant-Baptiſm, maintains his Fight at a great diſtance, ſave that he plays a little with ſome Arguments, rather of other Mens deviſing than his own. He at laſt comprehends the whole ſtrength of his Diſcourſe in two Queſtions; and ONLY deſires ſome Anſwer to them, from thoſe whom he is pleaſed conſtantly to call <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know no ſuch Creature, yet I know that he means thoſe Chriſtians who, according to God's Word, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. make Baptiſm the third (not the firſt) Principle of Chriſt's Doctrine. In which order the firſt and beſt of Goſpel-Churches received it, even that which was founded by Chriſt himſelf, in the exerciſe of his Miniſtry, and which is therefore the Mother of all Churches Chriſtian; in which Church, conſiſting of believing <hi>Jews,</hi> their Children had as clear an Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace as any can pretend to, and as great Priviledges in the Church Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian as was, or is needful for any; and yet whoever reads the Plantation and Progreſs of that Church, or the Epiſtle which was written to them
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:43974:4"/>
on the occaſion of ſome Decays, which afterward befel them, ſhall never find ſo much as one Infant baptiſed in that Church, nor indeed in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther during the Apoſtles Days; which Conſideration alone is enough to cauſe a modeſt Enquirer to queſtion the Legality of Infant-Baptiſm. Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> has got Infant-Baptiſm into a very little Corner, it belongs only <hi>to Children of believing Parents [in an Independent or Presbyterian Senſe]</hi> ſo that a great Part of the World called Chriſtendom, will have no Right to it. And he makes it very inſignificant to a great number of theſe two, for <hi>pag.</hi> 33. he does not make God to be INDEED their God, till <hi>with his Call he gives them Faith to anſwer his Call.</hi> And this is the reaſon (I ſuppoſe) why they deny theſe ſo pretendedly holy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, whom they ſprinkle, any Priviledg in their Church at the Lord's Table, till they covenant again, which is commonly 20, 30 or 40 years after they have ſprinkled them. For which ſtrange Practice they have not the leaſt Tittle in God's Word to warrant it; and where then they can find a Rule for this Practice I know not.</p>
            <p>I have been told that Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s Queſtions are taken by ſome to be <hi>unanſwerable:</hi> Let us therefore view them in his Words <hi>verbatim.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is thus.</p>
            <div n="1" type="question">
               <head>Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s Queſt. I.</head>
               <p>
                  <q>Since God was ſo gracious to make a Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, and it did then conſiſt with his Wiſdom to conſtitute his Church of Parents and Children, while the Parents did believe in the Meſſiah to come; Why may it not conſiſt with his Grace to continue that Covenant, and with his Wiſdom ſtill to conſtitute his Goſpel-Church of Parents and Children, the <hi>Jews</hi> now believing in Chriſt come?</q>
               </p>
            </div>
            <div type="response">
               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>You muſt allow that the Covenant of Grace was not reſtrained to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and his Seed, but did belong to many at that time both Parents and Children; many holy Patriarchs being then living, and ſome outlived <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf, and yet none of theſe were concerned in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion, as made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. but only in the Covenant of Grace as made with <hi>Adam and Noah,</hi> which had now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued more than 2000 years, during all which time no Infant was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned either in Circumciſion or Baptiſm, and yet were as much of the Church as was needful for their Salvation. And hence a Man may very well anſwer your Queſtion, by asking you another, Thus:</p>
               <p>Since God was ſo gracious to make a Covenant with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> and their Seed, and it did then conſiſt with his Wiſdom to conſtitute his Church of Parents to practiſe his Ordinances, and of their Children to
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:43974:4"/>
partake of the Grace of eternal Life, without being concerned in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Ordinances in their Infancy, for more than 2000 years before Chriſt came: Why may it not confiſt with his Grace to continue that Covenant of Grace made with <hi>Adam, Noah</hi> (and <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf 24 years before he was circumciſed)? and with his Wiſdom ſtill to conſtitute his Goſpel-Church of Parents to practiſe his Ordinances, and of their Children to partake of the Grace of eternal Life, without being concerned in the Practice of his Ordinances in their Infancy, ſince Chriſt is come; eſpecially conſidering that Chriſt himſelf did not appoint thoſe very In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants who were brought to him, to have his Ordinances impoſed upon them?</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> be not ſatisfied with this Reply, then let me tell him it becomes no Man, no not Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> himſelf, to propound ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned Queſtion, which is guilty of no more reaſon than this: Since God was ſo gracious, and it did conſiſt with his Wiſdom to give <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> a Command to offer up his beloved Son as a Sign of Chriſt to come, why may it not conſiſt with his Grace and Wiſdom, for us of our own Heads without any Command from God, to offer up every one his deareſt Child in remembrance that Chriſt is come?</p>
               <p>Sir, What may, or may not conſiſt with the Wiſdom of God in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Church-conſtitution, and our ſerving him in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, muſt not be concluded from the likeneſs which we fancy to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his former Inſtitutions, and our own, or others Inventions; but from ſuch Directions as he has given us by the Meſſiah, which was to teach us all things, <hi>John</hi> 4. both concerning our ſelves, and concerning our Infants.</p>
               <p>And we do therefore know that it was not conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God to conſtitute his Goſpel-Church, ſo as to impoſe Goſpel-Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces upon Infants (although he did impoſe Legal Ordinances upon them) Becauſe Chriſt (who is the Wiſdom of God) hath revealed no ſuch thing to his Apoſtles, nor they to us.</p>
               <p>And like as ye know it to be inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God, to bring little Children ſo into the Church, as to partake of the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe God hath required Faith and Humiliation in every one that comes to that holy Manducation: So we do know it to be inconſiſtent with the Wiſdom of God to bring Infants ſo into his Church, as to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of holy Baptiſm, becauſe Repentance, whereby Sin is forſaken, and Faith to believe God's Promiſes, is required by him of thoſe that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be baptized. You ſee then that we do not deny Infants to be of the Church, in ſuch ſort as to obtain Salvation, with them that ſhall be
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:43974:5"/>
ſaved; although we deny them to be in the Church in your ſence. But let us hear your ſecond Queſtion.</p>

                  <q>If God hath repealed his Covenant with the believing <hi>Jews</hi> Seed, turned their Children out of the Church, and deny them Baptiſm, tho the <hi>Jews</hi> truly believe in Chriſt come; what hath God left in the room of theſe, that carry any ſhew of his Bleſſing, or good Will towards their Children during their Infant-ſtate?</q>

               <p>The Words <hi>Covenant</hi> and <hi>Church,</hi> as uſed by Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous. I do not find that <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor <hi>Iſaac</hi> neither, were out of the Church till they were circumciſed. It's evident <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed was in Covenant before they were eight days old, even as it was a peculiar vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church-Covenant, elſe all that were uncircumciſed for forty years in the Wilderneſs were out of the Church and Covenant.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> himſelf believes that Infants are in the Covenant, and in the Church alſo, before they be ſprinkled by him. For this is the <hi>Minor</hi> of one of his Arguments, p. 103. <hi>But Children of believing Parents are Church members,</hi> and this before you ſprinkle them. Now, Sir, if your Doctrine be true; then it is not our waiting for a fit time to baptize our Children, which turns them out of the Church, nor does God for our ſo doing turn them out of the Church; any whit more than your waiting a fit time, (and you make it perhaps twenty, thirty, or forty years) for your bringing your Children to the Lord's Table, turns them out of the Church. Indeed if they live to years, and chuſe ſinful ways, they then turn themſelves out of that Relation they had to God and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in their Infancy, by virtue of God's gracious Covenant; and they thus turning his Mercy into Jndgment, ſhall periſh whether yours or ours. The Caſe is equal, I need ſay no more to a wiſe Man.</p>
               <p>Yet I add, That the believing Jews, and their Infants alſo, were now made free from the Jewiſh Church-ſtate, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 1. But neither they nor their Infants were deprived of any place in the Church, which was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them in their reſpective capacities; yet the Parents had many Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon them which the Infants had not, and of theſe the Baptiſm of Repentance was one; they had alſo Priviledges which the Infants had not, of which the Lord's Table was one. Yet the little Children had theſe Priviledges which the Children of Unbelievers had not. Firſt to be devoted to God by the Prayers of the Church, warranted therein by the Example of Chriſt, who when little Children were brought to him for Prayer, did not refuſe but perform it, and wills that little Children be
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:43974:5"/>
brought to him; and accordingly we do dedicate our Children to him from the Womb, according to our Capacity.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Little Children are alſo by this means <hi>(i. e.</hi> of their Parents Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion) under the Bleſſing of an early Education in the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; by which means (through God's Bleſſing) I have known ſome who were not ſprinkled in Infancy, attain to more true Knowledg of Chriſtianity, and Experience of the Work of Grace (ſo far as Man may judg) at 7 or 8 years of Age, than multitudes of thoſe who were ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in their Infancy, have attained at the Age of 70 or 80 years.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our gracious God by Jeſus Chriſt hath left us an open Declaration that the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to Infants, in which Declaration he has not excepted ſo much as one of them. This is more than Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and more clear than any thing before declared concerning Infants, tho there was evidence of God's Love to them before.</p>
               <p>From all which you may ſee, that God hath left us in the room of Circumciſion, a far more excellent Teſtimony of his ſaving pleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Infants than that was, or any legal Rite whatſoever.</p>
               <p>As for Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Argument which you borrow, 'tis anſwered in what is ſaid to your Queſtions. Howbeit, I have more particularly An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered it in my Examination of no leſs than five hundred Queries, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by one of his Admirers out of his voluminous Works; all which have been redargued by a proportionable number of <hi>Anti-Queries,</hi> in which all his Devices for Poedorantiſm, is in ſome meaſure diſcovered to be but the cunning craftineſs of human ſubtilty, or a copious Brain. Of whoſe Books on this Subject, and Dr. <hi>Hammonds</hi> alſo, take thus the Judgment of a Learned Doctor of the Church of <hi>England</hi> now living: <hi>I have ſeen what my learned and worthy Friend Dr.</hi> Hammond, <hi>Mr.</hi> Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>and others ſay in defence of [Infant Baptiſm]; and muſt confeſs I do not a little wonder that Men of ſo great Parts ſhould ſay ſo much to ſo little purpoſe; for I have not yet ſeen any thing like an Argument for it.</hi> Dr. <hi>Barlows</hi> Letter to Mr. <hi>Tombs.</hi>

               <p>One thing I take ſpecial notice of in your Diſcourſe of Infants. You tie up the Salvation of all Infants that ſhall be ſaved, to their <hi>having Faith ſome way;</hi> yea, you ſay, <hi>elſe they muſt all periſh.</hi> p. 90. And you allow Faith to no more Infants than are elected in your ſeme of Election.

               <p>
                  <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:43974:6"/>
Miſerable Infants! If there be none to plead your cauſe better than Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> has done, it's uncertain whether ſo much as one of you ſhall be ſaved out of a thouſand.</p>
               <p>And whilſt his Book may cauſe many weak Readers to think that Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion did, and that Infant-Baptiſm doth great things toward their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it's evident he can believe no ſuch thing himſelf. For if they be <hi>elect,</hi> ſaved they ſhall be tho they be not baptiſed: And for thoſe Infants which are reprobated, damned they muſt be tho they be baptiſed.</p>
               <p>He is ſo far from making Baptiſm of Infants to be of that Concernment which you may imagine from ſome Paſſages in him, that he plainly tells you, <hi>p.</hi> 20. <hi>That he does not think that a ſound Believer dying without Baptiſm ſhall be damned:</hi> And then how an innocent Infant dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Baptiſm ſhould be damned, is not eaſy to be imagined. But, by his favour, if ſuch a Believer had opportunity to be baptiſed, and neglected his Baptiſm, he will hardly paſs for a ſound Believer in the Day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; becauſe <hi>in this thing he believed not his Lord,</hi> who told him, <hi>Thus it becomes us to fulfil all Righteouſneſs, Mat.</hi> 3. 15. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 33. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 22, 23. And I muſt in Faithfulneſs tell Mr. <hi>Firmin,</hi> that ſuch a ſound Believer I take him to be, for after all the Improvement which he tells us he has made of his Fathers Covenant, (which would make a well Man ſick even to ſee what pittiful work he makes with it, <hi>pag.</hi> 68, 69, 70, 71.) for after all his ſhifting from Poſt to Pillar, he only gets Stomach to <hi>reject the Counſel of God againſt himſelf, being not baptiſed with the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> as ſome of the Learned have done before him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 30.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing it is the known Practice of Infant-ſprinklers to ſprinkle them when they are faſt aſleep, and it is odds but Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi> was aſleep when he was ſprinkled and croſſed, and therein theſe wonderful things done, which he talks of, without Scripture or Reaſon to warrant his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits. I deſire to know of him <hi>what Ground any Man hath, his Parents or himſelf, to baptiſe any Perſon when they are aſleep?</hi> This is no idle Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but calls for the Conſideration of all ſerious Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>In theſe and the following Pages you will find this to be Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s ſenſe: That the Covenant as it concerns Infants, hath two Parts, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the outward: That ſome Infants have the outward Part who are not concern'd in the inward Part, and that the firſt ſort of Infants cannot fall, but the reſt may and ſhall fall, becauſe they have not <hi>ſeminal</hi> Faith and Regeneration, but only reputative Faith. And yet ſure this was not the Infants Fault, for it could not chuſe of what Seed it ſhould be produced. And what the Seminal Faith is, I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:43974:6"/>
may know as much as thoſe Infants do whom he ſuppoſes to have it. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> was a great Man for Infant-ſprinkling, yet he rejects this Fable of Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s: For he tells us, he muſt confeſs that Faith is ſo neceſſarily founded in Underſtanding, <hi>that he which hath not <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot have Faith.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> confeſſes, whether Infants have Faith, is a Queſtion to be diſputed by thoſe who care not how <hi>much they affirm, and how little th<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I am aſhamed of the Doctrine of our <hi>Presbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> which, as I am informed, teach that Infants are yelling in Hell, yea that Infants of a Span long are yelling in Hell.</p>
               <p>I am alſo aſhamed of Mr. <hi>Firmin</hi>'s Conceit, <hi>pag.</hi> 90. where from Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> he would have us believe, <hi>that an Infant is as capable of a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Reception of Chriſt and Grace, as a Man.</hi> Now if this be true, that Men are no more capable to ſuffer the Grace of God to act upon their Souls than Infants, I am perſuaded they would fare better than they are like to do. For it is certain if Infants receive any thing of Chriſt or Grace, it is meerly by Miracle, as in the caſe of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> when he was in the Womb: and hence it muſt needs follow, that unleſs God will work a Miracle upon every one at the Beginning of his Converſion, he is excuſable; according to this Fancy of Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> and Mr. <hi>Firmin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this an Adulterous Generation, who without a Miracle will not admit that any Man can receive Chriſt more than an Infant, who it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cannot receive him without a Miracle?</p>
               <p>But let ſuch vain Diſputers know, that the Record which God hath given of his Son, concerning his Death and Reſurrection, will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to leave them without excuſe if they believe it not, and that it is their Duty (not the Duty of Infants) to receive Chriſt as made known to them in his Doctrine, which if they believe not, it ſhall judg them (not Infants) in the laſt Day.</p>
               <p>Some indeed do abuſe <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 19, 20. to uphold this falſe Opinion, that none can believe without ſuch a Power as by which Chriſt was rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead. Whereas it is evident, the Apoſtle only ſhews that the Faith of Chriſtians agrees with, or is according to the Power of God,
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:43974:7"/>
which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him up from the dead, <hi>i. e.</hi> they doubt not at all, but that the ſame God which had Power to raiſe up Chriſt from the dead, has Power to do whatſoever he pleaſes, and ſo to raiſe us up alſo by his Power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 14. For the Power by which Chriſt was raiſed from the dead, being irreſiſtable, all the Power of Men and Devils cannot reſiſt it. All that have true Faith, do believe that no Power ſhall be able to withſtand God in the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but that his People ſhall be raiſed from Death to Life, and ſet with Chriſt in Glory, maugre the Devil and all his Power.</p>
               <p>But the Power of God's Grace by which God works in Men in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way, is not irreſiſtable; <hi>Ye do always reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt, Act.</hi> 7. 51. and 13. 46. Chriſt marvelled at the Unbelief of the <hi>Jews, Mar.</hi> 6. 6. becauſe they had a ſufficiency of means by which to believe, otherwiſe he could not have marvelled at their Unbelief. But what needs many words? Unbelief ſhall be the condemning Sin, <hi>John</hi> 3. 18, 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. It follows therefore againſt all Contradiction, that Men periſh not for want of an Object of Faith, but becauſe they reject that Object, and neglect that great Salvation which God offers them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. otherwiſe it will follow that all which ſhall be damned, were created to be damned without any Remedy. And how unlike this is to that God whoſe tender Mercies are over all his Works, and to that Chriſt who wept for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of his Enemies, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 41, 42. let all Men of Reaſon judg, as they would judg in any caſe where Juſtice and Mercy muſt both ſtand inviolate.</p>
               <p>This ſtrange Doctrine of damning the greateſt Part of the World, and that before the World was, is ſo pernicious, that it makes God Author of all Sin for which Damnation is due. For if he have deſtin'd the greateſt Part of the World, Infants and grown Perſons, to a damned State, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Intention of their Salvation, or means to prevent their Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, becauſe it was his Pleaſure to damn them. He that was thus Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of their End, muſt alſo be Author of that which conduces to the end: but far be this from God.</p>
               <p>And let it be far from us to think thus hardly of God, that he ſhould be ſo unmerciful, as to ſend poor Infants to Hell-torments, who only had time in this World to cry and die, and ſometimes too to die before they could cry.</p>

               <p>MR. <hi>Petto</hi> entitles his Book, <hi>Infant-Baptiſm of Chriſt's Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,</hi> and lays down this Poſition, <hi>That it is the Will of Chriſt that ſome Infants ſhould be baptiſed:</hi> But why ſome, and not ſome? Are Infants ſo diverſified in the Will of Chriſt, as that he has excepted ſome of them? It had been fit that the Scripture which excludes ſome Infants from Baptiſm, and admits other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome had been produced. But alas, this is only Man's Invention, and none of Chriſt's Diſtinction: they are equally precious in his Sight, yet he requires none of them to be baptiſed.</p>
               <p>Two things you premiſe before you ſet down your Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You complain that ſome call <hi>for plain Scripture for Infant-baptiſm, and ſpeak ſlightly of Scripture Conſequences.</hi> But this is your Miſtake: if they be Scripture Conſequences rightly deduced (as you ſeem to allow they muſt be ſuch) then you have no Adverſary. But perhaps you are diſpleaſed that your Conſequences are not taken for ſuch as our Saviour's was, for you quote <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. 31, 32. but his Deductions are unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, yours are not, and why may not our Conſequences be equally va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable with yours?</p>
               <p n="2">2. You are pleaſed to tell us, <hi>There is no expreſs Scripture againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-baptiſm, therefore Infants may be baptiſed.</hi> And this Argument is ſufficiently anſwered, by ſaying,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:43974:8"/>
                  <hi>There is no expreſs Scripture for Infant-baptiſm, therefore Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm may be omitted.</hi> If you fly to Conſequences for it, 'tis odds but we ſhall find as good Conſequences againſt it.</p>
               <p>But I will deny the Conſequence of your Argument, and anſwer it by an <hi>Author</hi> of your own, who writes thus:</p>

               </p>
               <p>And truly by your Argument (as of all that's brought it is the beſt) you will never be able to withſtand any Innovation, which is not expreſly forbidden in Scripture.

                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Petto's <hi>firſt Argument for Infant-Diſcipleſhip.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <q>Some Infants are ſo diſcipled, as to have the Name of the Father, Son, and holy Spirit upon them. Therefore by the Will of Chriſt they are to be baptiſed.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> This Argument ſuppoſes that ſome Infants have the Name of Father, Son, and Spirit upon them before they be baptiſed. This I take to be the neweſt Piece of Doctrine in the World, and therefore muſt needs enquire what Infants theſe are? How Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> knows them from others? And at what time before their Baptiſm, and alſo by whom this Name is put upon them, and in what manner it is done? For all theſe things he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43974:8"/>
ought to know, before (according to his own Logick) he may baptiſe them.</p>
                  <p>Till he do this (and he muſt do it well too) I deny his Antecedent: Saying alſo, that no Infants are diſcipled at all, much leſs ſo as to have the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon them. My Reaſons are ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. God hath not made this diſtinction in Goſpel-times between ſome Infants and other ſome, ſo as to diſciple ſome of them, by putting the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon them. He has taken down the Wall of diſtinction between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> accounting the one as clean as the other, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 28. And has given the ſame Order for diſcipling to all Nations, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. but not a word in that Order to put his Name, <hi>of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit</hi> upon any Perſon before they be baptiſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No Man has Authority by the Word of God to make Infants Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at all, much leſs by putting the Name <hi>of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon them</hi> before Baptiſm. But the only Way aſſign'd by God to make Diſciples, is, firſt, by preaching the Goſpel to them, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15. <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> which ſhews the true Intent of our Saviour in the Verb, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, plainly evincing the Truth of this.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If it could be proved that the Name of the <hi>Trinity</hi> were upon the Infants of Chriſtians; yet this would not bear your Concluſion, that they muſt be baptiſed, any more than it will bear <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s Concluſion, that they ought to partake of the Lord's Table. Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low</hi> confeſs <hi>you may do both as well as either, and that the Wit of Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſhew a difference in the Sanctions.</hi> And indeed all your Arguments for Infants Church-Memberſhip and Baptiſm (if they were good) might be improved againſt you concerning the other Ordinance; for admit one Error, and another will follow. But let us examine your Scriptures by which you would prove your Antecedent.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You bring <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Diſciple ye all Nations.</hi> Now if theſe Words did oblige the Apoſtles to <hi>put the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon</hi> all Perſons or Nations before Baptiſm, it quite ſpoils your Argument, which would reſtrain it to ſome Infants only. Why do you thus abuſe the Word? Did the Apoſtles put the Name of the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon any one Infant?</hi> Is not the Scripture ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as to this? Or did they put the Name <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon any to whom they
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43974:9"/>
preached, till they received their Doctrine? Or did they do this before they baptiſed them? In that ſolemn Inſtitution they did put the Name of the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon all ſuch as gladly received the Word, Act.</hi> 2. 40. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. <hi>ult.</hi> And for this they had full Authority, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15, 16. even to preach to, and ſo to diſciple all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, baptiſing <hi>them,</hi> viz. <hi>Mathet as ſubintelligitur in verbum Mathetuſate,</hi> as the Practice of Chriſt had directed them. <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. <hi>Jeſus made and baptiſed more Diſciples than John.</hi> And <hi>Junius</hi> and <hi>Tremelius</hi> adds the Particle <hi>Et: Ite ergo, docete omnes populos, &amp; baptiſate eos,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>You tell us, they are Diſciples, not only who actually learn, but who are in the School of Chriſt his Church in order to their future Learning.</hi> This is not true: 1. Infants are not in the School or Church of Chriſt, as it is a School to learn any thing whilſt they are Infants. God has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bound his Miniſters to teach them whilſt ſuch, nor enabled them to learn as ſuch. If you ſay this future teaching reſpects not the time of their Infancy; then were you very fallacious in your Argument: for this will prove all the Infants in the World to be Diſciples, as well as any of them, ſeeing Chriſt's Church is the Light of the World, and all that come to Years of Diſcretion, having opportunity, are bound to learn of her. 2. But yet it does not follow that all who are under preſent means of Inſtruction, are therefore to be accounted Diſciples. For you know many heard Chriſt preach, who yet were none of his Diſciples, but his Perſecutors; many heard his Apoſtles teach, who yet were not their Diſciples, for they put the Word of God from them, and judged themſelves unworthy of eternal Life. I ſuppoſe alſo that all that hear Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> are not his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, how much leſs poor Infants that never heard him at all. And here I require Mr. <hi>P.</hi> to name one Infant that he ever made a Diſciple accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. and that will do more a great deal than his empty Dictates.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You bring <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 3. and 9. 1. which ſhews <hi>how Saul made havock of the Churches, entring into every Houſe, haling Men and Women to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that he breathed out Slaughter againſt the Diſciples.</hi> Sure you may bluſh to bring ſuch Texts to prove Infants Diſciples; nor will <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 10. bear your Inference. The falſe Apoſtles would indeed have had the Diſciples among the Gentiles to have been circumcis'd: but it does not follow at all, that every one were Diſciples whom they would have cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. This is juſt ſuch a Conſequence as this; You would have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be ſprinkled: <hi>Ergo,</hi> all are Infants whom ye would have ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. This Conſequence you will deny, becauſe you would have others alſo ſprinkled who are no Infants. And for the ſame reaſon I deny your
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43974:9"/>
Conſequence, for the falſe Apoſtles would have circumcis'd ſome who were no Diſciples, to wit, Infants.</p>
                  <p>You bring here <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. (but this we will conſider anon) and <hi>Acts</hi> 21. 4, 5.

Or, if there were any Infants, did they kneel down upon the Sea-ſhore and pray with <hi>Paul?</hi> And if not, to what purpoſe has he brought theſe Scriptures?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He brings a Cloud of other Scriptures in Figures, for had he read them his Folly would have been ſeen with more eaſe. Let us hear what theſe Scriptures ſay; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>As he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation. Heb.</hi> 7. 26. <hi>For ſuch an high Prieſt became us who is holy:</hi> What muſt theſe Places prove? I will ſet down your own Words: <hi>As to the Name of the Trinity that of being holy is attributed often to Father, Son and Holy Spirit. And this very Name of the Lord [holy] he hath impoſed upon the Children of Believers.</hi> But what a wretched Conſequence is here? as if it would follow that all for whom Chriſt offered up himſelf, or for whom he was God's High-Prieſt, has thereupon the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit on them? Why according to this Logick <hi>Saul</hi> had the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon him, when he perſecuted all that called on that Name. And the Scripture is very plain, <hi>that whilſt we were Enemies, Chriſt died for us:</hi> but we had not then the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit impoſed on us. And how follows it, that becauſe Chriſtians are exhorted to be holy in all manner of Converſation, that therefore Infants are diſcipled, ſo as to have the Name of <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon them.</hi> Might not a Man by this kind of reaſoning prove that all the Infants in the World have the Name of the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon them:</hi> I am ſure that God is the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, and that all Nations are in reſpect of his gracious Providence, his People, and Sheep of his Paſture, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to enter into his Ways with Praiſe and Thankſgiving, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 100.</p>
                  <p>The Places you bring from the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians, cap.</hi> 1. 13. and 4. 30. informs us that <hi>after Men believed, they were ſealed with the Holy Spirit;</hi> this ſhews theſe Perſons were no Infants. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. ſhews that an holy <hi>Root has holy Branches;</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 9. tells us <hi>Chriſtians are a choſen Generation, a royal Prieſt-hood, a holy Nation, a peculiar Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43974:10"/>
                     <hi>that you ſhould ſhew forth the Praiſes of him that hath called you out of Darkneſs into his marvellous Light.</hi> As for <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 16. it evidently refers to the great things which God will do when he calls the Jews, which were caſt off, and ſo it little concerns our Queſtion; otherwiſe it were eaſy to ſhew that at that time, how holy ſoever <hi>Abraham</hi> had been, yet his Children were prophane enough. But Mr. <hi>Petto</hi>'s Drift is to make Men believe that each of them (whom he calls <hi>Believers) are as holy a Root in reſpect of conferring Church-Priviledges, as</hi> Abraham <hi>was, and ſo their Children muſt needs be holy for Baptiſm.</hi> But this is a very unlawful conſequence; ſeeing <hi>Abraham</hi> never did, nor ever can confer that Holineſs upon ſo much as one of his Offspring, which ſhall entitle them to Baptiſm; becauſe every particular Perſon's Repentance and Faith is required as the true Antecedents to Baptiſm, as is granted by the <hi>Church of England</hi> in her <hi>Catechiſm.</hi> But how well ſhe keeps to her Doctrine therein, admits of conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. you teach, that <hi>Infants are holy by ſeparation to God and his Service.</hi> But, Sir, can you tell us what Service of God In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are fit for? If other Men may judg as well as you, then as they are not able to ſerve God in ſpiritual things, ſo God requires it not of them whilſt Infants. But ſo ſtrangely are you tranſported here, that you tell us from Mr. <hi>Cotton, That Sin it ſelf is ſanctified to Believers.</hi> This is another Strain of new Doctrine; and will it not follow from your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that Sin hath the Name of Father, Son, and holy Spirit upon it? Let Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> look to it: You muſt have a care how you take up ſuch Notions.</p>
                  <p>You will by no means admit the Holineſs here mentioned to be meant of a Matrimonial or Legitimate Holineſs. And yet I pray what Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Unbeliever can that be but Matrimonial, ſo as the believing Husband and the unbelieving Wife might cohabit together as Husband and Wife without Sin? The Childrens Holineſs is derived from this Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Unbeliever, (as the Word <hi>elſe,</hi> being rightly referred, does ſhew it doth.) This Holineſs therefore in true Conſtruction of the place is moſt fitly interpreted (as <hi>Eraſmus</hi> doth expound it) of <hi>Legitimacy,</hi> and ſo did the eminent Man <hi>Auguſtine</hi> of <hi>Hippo</hi> (long before <hi>Eraſmus)</hi> take the ſence; for he tells us, <hi>whatſoever that Holineſs is, it is certain it is not of Power to make Chriſtians, or remit Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Figures which you give us out of the Old Teſtament, are <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. 2. and 20. 7. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. 6. <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 6. and 14. 2. and 26. 19. and 28. 9.

                     <hi>a holy People.</hi> But what is all this to your purpoſe? God ſpake not theſe things to Infants; he tells us ſo himſelf: <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 2. <hi>And know you this day: for I ſpeak not with your Children, which have not known, and which have not ſeen the Chaſtiſement of the Lord your God, his Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his mighty Hand, and ſtretch'd out Arm,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 7. <hi>but your Eyes have ſeen,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—Therefore ye ſhall keep all the Commandments,</hi> &amp;c. Sure you have not proved your Argument by any thing you have yet brought for that purpoſe. For,</p>
                  <p>By all that you have ſaid, it appears not, <hi>that ſome Infants are ſo diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, as to have the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit upon them.</hi> Nor are you able to name ſo much as one ſuch Infant now in being, and conſequently you can with no ſhew of Reaſon baptiſe them. I conſider a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: Who muſt do this previous Work to Infant-Baptiſm? Muſt the ſame Miniſter do both? And what Order have you to put the Name of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt upon Infants twice, once before you ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle them, and then again when you ſprinkle them?</p>
                  <p>There is one thing remarkable from your ſelf and others in theſe later times, who eſpouſe this Controverſy. You all ſeem to be convinced that none are to be baptiſed but Diſciples, according to <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. and indeed the Text is ſo very clear to that purpoſe, that it cannot be denied. But when I behold the miſerable Shifts you are put to, to prove Infants Diſciples according to Chriſt's Commiſſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 19. I do with the greateſt Admiration bewail your Unhappineſs; and cannot tell how to imagine that any wiſe Men among you does really believe your ſelves in what you ſay on that account. And ſure I am the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have as ſtrong a pretence from <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum,</hi> for their Tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as you have from <hi>Matheteuſaté</hi> for Infant-Diſcipleſhip.</p>
                  <p>And to ſpeak freely, they are both incredible things; all Senſe and Experience militates equally againſt both Opinions. If they be Truths, it muſt be becauſe they are both Miracles: but then they want the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of true Miracles; for they are no ways demonſtrable that there is any Miracle at all in either of them; we are only told that they are ſo, <hi>i. e.</hi> that the <hi>Bread in the Eucharist is Real Fleſh;</hi> That <hi>the Child in your Rantiſm is born again of Water and Spirit, made a Diſciple of Christ, &amp;c.</hi> but no mortal Man knows any of theſe things to be true. And what is it that we may not believe, if we muſt believe ſuch things as theſe? <hi>Prayer for the Dead, Purgatory fire, &amp;c.</hi> will come upon us armed with our own Arguments, if we admit the former.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, as to your firſt Argument, Give me leave to ſay, if your Hearers can receive your Dictates, and ill-prov'd Affirmations, I

know not but they may believe you in whatſoever you will be pleaſed to tell them.</p>
                  <p>What you ſay of the Antiquity of Infant-Baptiſm, I ſhall here conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in few words; for ſince you inſiſt only upon <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Teſtimony, whoſe Grounds for Infant-Baptiſm you confeſs to be unſound; I need ſay little here, that which was built upon bad Principles then by him, and ſtands upon as unſound ones now by you, does gain nothing by either of you. But will you know that it is plainly granted by ſome of the moſt Learned of your way; <hi>That there is neither Precept nor Practice in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for Infant-Baptiſm [Here it wants the beſt Antiquity], nor any just Evidence for it for about two hundred Years after Christ.—Yet it came in upon a groſs Mistake of the Scripture: that in what Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>and Dr.</hi> Hammond <hi>has ſaid for it, there is nothing that looks like an Argument.</hi> Dr. <hi>Barlow.</hi> This is enough at preſent.</p>

                     <hi>But ſome Infants are viſibly or externally in the Covenant which God made with</hi> Abraham:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore by the Will of Chriſt they are to be baptized.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p n="1">BEfore I anſwer this Argument, I ſhall conſider a few things: And, 1. That (as Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> grants) God made the Covenant of Grace with <hi>Abraham,</hi> twenty four years before he gave him the Covenant of Circumciſion, ſee <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3, 4. with 17. 24. ſo that the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace had no external Sign, as it was made with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. But when God was pleaſed to add to this Covenant the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Land of <hi>Canaan, &amp;c.</hi> then it was that he gave him the Law of Circumciſion: and theſe additional Parts I take to be moſt properly,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43974:11"/>
if not only that which is the Covenant of Circumciſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is to be underſtood that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not the only Perſon in the World, which was under the Covenant of Grace at this time, when God made Covenant with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. 'Tis obſerved by ſome that <hi>Salah</hi> lived after the Covenant of Circumciſion was made about 50 years. <hi>Arphaxad</hi> lived thirteen years after; and that <hi>Heber</hi> lived till <hi>Jacob</hi> was about twenty years old, which was long after <hi>Abraham</hi> died. Now theſe with <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> (if he were not one of theſe) with many others (amongſt whom was juſt <hi>Lot)</hi> were not only true Worſhippers of God, according to the Covenant of Grace, but ſome of them ſuperiour to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> himſelf, for <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> being the <hi>King of Salem, and Priest of the most high God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. And as neither theſe nor their Poſterity were liable to any loſs of the Covenant of Grace, by their not being circumciſed after the manner of <hi>Abraham;</hi> ſo neither <hi>Job,</hi> nor other worthy Men that were not of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh, had any obligation to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: from whence it muſt needs follow that God intended not the ſign of Circumciſion to belong to Perſons as they were in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, but that it was appropriate for ſome great Ends, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſpecial preſervation to the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as of the Kindred from whom Chriſt ſhould proceed, and with whom he would preſence himſelf, in a Land of Promiſe, by a diſtinct way of Worſhip from all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who at that time were falling very faſt into Idolatry.</p>
               <p n="4">4. And beſides this, it is certain that this Sign of Circumciſion, was by God's Appointment to be affixed to ſome to whom the Covenant of Grace might ſeem to have the leaſt extent (or at leaſt they did forfeit all Intereſt in it) this was the caſe of <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> who proved ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked: and it is to be queſtioned whether the Bondmen or Slaves in <hi>Iſrael</hi> had that Ceremony as a Badge of the Covenant of Grace. Men may talk high of theſe things and prove little, or whether Circumciſion was a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith to any Perſon in the World ſave to <hi>Abraham:</hi> And in what ſence it was ſo to him (who had ſo many things peculiar to him) is not eaſy to be demonſtrated.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Our Practice in Religious Inſtitutes is not to be gathered from ſuch uncertain Conjectures, but to ſtand upon the clear Direction of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuter, or the Practice of ſuch as God hath thought fit to make Precedents to us; and it is certain we are not at all concerned in the Law of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and for us to take our Rules thence for the Subjects of Baptiſm, is very childiſh and reflects Diſhonour upon Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who never ſent us to learn Infant-Baptiſm from Infant-Circumciſion, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43974:12"/>
have they taught it at all. Theſe things premiſed I anſwer to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument by theſe enſuing Diſtinctions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If by Covenant Mr. <hi>P.</hi> means the Covenant of Circumciſion (as he does, for he quotes <hi>Gen.</hi> 7. 9, 10, 11. to prove his Aſſumption), and by ſome Infants he means the Infants of Chriſtians as ſuch, as that is his meaning; then I deny his <hi>Minor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Or, if by Covenant, he mean that Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. diſtinct from the Covenant of Circumciſion; and by ſome Infants being in this Covenant externally, he means Infants are concerned in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Profeſſion or Practice of Worſhip; ſtill I deny the <hi>Minor:</hi> for God by that Covenant of Grace, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. never required the Performance of ſuch Duties of Infants.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If by Covenant, he mean the gracious Pardon of Original Sin to ſome Infants only, or the Salvation of their Souls dying ſuch; and by ſome Infants he means that ſome few of them only are viſibly in that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and all the reſt in a viſible State of Damnation to Hell Torments; ſtill I deny his <hi>Minor.</hi> For God has not ſaid (and therefore Man ought not to ſay it) that ſo much as one poor Infant ſhall be damned; but he is ſo far from that, that he has no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked, but rather that they turn and live; and hath aſſured us that the Son ſhould not bear the Iniquity of the Father, which can only be true in reſpect of Damnation, for all Infants do bear the Sin of their Father <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſometimes in temporal Puniſhments they bear the Sin of their immediate Parents.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If his Arguments were ſo good natured, as to allow Infants indefinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be in a viſible State of Salvation, <hi>(viz.</hi> a declared Right to the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, as their dear Saviour hath teſtified they have) yet I would deny the Conſequence of his <hi>Major,</hi> becauſe the Covenant of Grace, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as abſtracted from the Covenant of Circumciſion, never required the Application of any Ceremony to Infants as a Pledg of it, either before the Law, or as it is now eſtabliſhed by our Saviour in the Goſpel Oeconomy; ſo that his Concluſion is far from Truth, which tells the World that <hi>by the Will of Chriſt ſome Infants are to be baptized.</hi> Now let us examine his Proof.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He begins <hi>pag.</hi> 7. with <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. which ſpeaks not one word of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; and himſelf tells us in the next Page, That <hi>the Covenant in Goſpel-times cannot be kept by Circumciſion;</hi> for <hi>that,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is abrogated, and ceaſed to be the Token of it;</hi> ſo that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. can be no Proof for his <hi>Minor.</hi> But he quotes <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 38, 39. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16, 17. <hi>And this</hi> (he ſays) <hi>is a full Command to baptiſe all in Covenant now.</hi>

But for Anſwer, conſider that no more are commanded in this place to be baptiſed, than are firſt commanded to repent; nor no more were baptiſed, than gladly received the Word. And the Promiſe is expreſly of the pouring out of the Holy Ghoſt upon all Parents and Children, <hi>as God ſhall call them:</hi> But no Command nor Promiſe reſpecting Baptiſm, and the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, before the Lord ſhall call them, whether Parents or Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

Nor need they any Laws to be written in their Hearts during Infancy, for they can underſtand none, and God ſpeaks not with them about the Obſervation of his Laws, as he tells us <hi>Deut.</hi> 11. 2.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Commandment is brought to prove Infant-Baptiſm, but Mr. <hi>P.</hi> ſhould know it does not command any particular Form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip at all.

               <p>Mr. <hi>P.</hi> tells us there <hi>is no Warrant to delay the Application of Baptiſm;</hi> And I grant it. But then he ſhould conſider that where there is no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority nor Capacity to diſpenſe Baptiſm, there is no delay. And this is the caſe of Infants: Nor does their being under the merciful Covenant of Salvation by Chriſt, oblige them to Duty in Infancy, becauſe they can perform none. And therefore your arguing from <hi>Foederati</hi> to their being <hi>ſignati,</hi> is better Rhyme than Reaſon; for if you follow that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, it will unavoidably bring Infants to the Lord's Table, where
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43974:13"/>
you will not be pleaſed with them. And pray conſider what Multitudes were <hi>foederati</hi> before, and in, and after <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, who yet in your own Judgment were not <hi>ſignati;</hi> ſuch were the Patriarchs before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and thoſe under their Conduct; ſuch were the thouſands of Males who died before the eighth day in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Such were all the Females, who alone were one half of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed; all theſe were <hi>foederati,</hi> yet were none of them <hi>ſignati.</hi>

               <p>What you are pleaſed here to add <hi>of ſome that can, and ſome that cannot fall away.</hi> As it's impertinent, ſo I think it far better for Men to ceaſe ſuch idle Diſputes, and to exhort one another daily to take heed that they do not fall away.</p>
               <p>For my part I am far from thinking that any Man can ſtand by his own Strength, or do any thing in Religion as he ought without the Help of God: I likewiſe grant that God does much more for ſome, than he does for all Men. Yet all this gives us no occaſion or Authority to tell any Perſon in the World, <hi>that it is impoſſible for him to fall, ſo as to periſh.</hi> And if we may not tell another Man this confident Story, it's bad ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to tell our ſelves that we cannot fall ſo.</p>
               <p>I think it's only proper to ſay of God, <hi>He cannot lie,</hi> and then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>all Men may lie;</hi> and this Lie may be their Ruin for ought they know; <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 27.</p>
               <p>I will not diſpute whether there be a State attainable in this World, in which Men ſhall certainly be ſaved, I doubt it not: but when Men have got to that degree, is ſo hard to be demonſtrated, that I take him for no wiſe Man, that will affirm it of himſelf, or any other in particular.</p>
               <p>It remains therefore the beſt way in the World to do as <hi>Paul</hi> did, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27. <hi>Beat down the Body, and bring it into Subjection, lest while we preach to others, we become Cast-aways.</hi> And if any confident Gentleman ſhall here tell me the Word only intends <hi>reprovable,</hi> I'le make bold to tell him, he does neither underſtand the Greek, nor his own Heart much better than I do, and that is not very perfectly, I will aſſure him.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Some Infants are viſibly Chriſt's, and ſo are</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed;</hi> and hence he would <hi>infer their Baptiſm.</hi> He has many Words, and very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten repeated, the ſubſtance of all has I think already been anſwered; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeeing he talks here of a threefold Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of <hi>Natural, Spiritual,</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Seed,</hi> I will ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Scriptures which he brings to prove Infants to be the <hi>Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Seed of</hi> Abraham. For the Scriptures which he brings to deſcribe the Spiritual Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſpeaks not one word of Infants. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 8, 9. ſhews that God would <hi>juſtify the Heathen through Faith,</hi> and concludes thus; So then <hi>they which be of Faith, are bleſſed with faithful</hi> Abraham. This is not ſpoken of Infants, yet they ſhall be bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>The Texts he brings to prove Infants to be the <hi>Eccleſiastical Seed of</hi> Abraham, are many<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 1, 2. where the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven is compared to wiſe and fooliſh Virgins:</hi> but I ſuppoſe no wiſe Man takes Infants to be of either ſort, for they are neither wiſe nor fooliſh, but they are innocent.</p>
                  <p>Two Texts more we have, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>John</hi> 15. 6. where we learn that the <hi>Jews were broken off for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief, and the Gentiles stood by Faith; that ſome Branches in Christ not bearing Fruit are taken away,</hi> and thoſe which bear Fruit <hi>are purged to bring forth more Fruit:</hi> But what all this is to Infants no Man can tell.</p>
                  <p>He quotes theſe over again, and with them <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 14. <hi>Mark</hi> 10. 13, 14. <hi>Luke</hi> 18. 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 20. Now he that from theſe Texts would prove In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſiastical Seed,</hi> muſt prove that in the three firſt Texts, the Word <hi>Kingdom</hi> muſt needs ſignify the Church-militant, and that Chriſt admitted theſe Infants into the Church by Baptiſm, or elſe that they have Authority to do more than Chriſt himſelf did: For if theſe very Infants were not baptiſed, they muſt have very great Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that can pretend from hence to find ground to baptiſe others.</p>
                  <p>The next Chriſt tells <hi>Peter, that he would build his Church upon a Rock.</hi> But muſt all that are ſaved be <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Eccleſiastical Seed?</hi> Sure ſome Infants may be ſaved who were never baptiſed for all this. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 16. bids Chriſtians <hi>ſalute one another with an holy Kiſs,</hi> and tells them alſo that <hi>the Church of Christ ſalutes them.</hi> I ſee nothing from hence to prove <hi>Infants viſibly Chriſt's, ſo as to be</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Seed;</hi> ſure his <hi>Propoſition</hi> will fail of Proof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:43974:14"/>
The Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 27. tells the Corinthians that <hi>they were the Body of Christ, and Members in particular.</hi> But not one word to prove that there was one Infant of this Communion. Yet all Members of that one Body were partakers of that one Bread, in which their Unity was demonſtrated, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 12, 13, 14. only deſcribes the Viſion that <hi>John</hi> ſaw of the Son of God, and the ſeven Golden Candleſticks. But no Man can yet find in any of theſe Candleſticks ſo much as one Infant concern'd bearing up the light of Truth in the profeſſion of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>Now for his Argument, I would know the meaning of this Speech, <hi>Some Infants are viſibly Christ's.</hi> If he means ſome Infants only are Chriſt's by Redemption; how can he poſſibly know the Redeemed from the Damned? (for ſo they are ſuppoſed to be in this Mans deſtiny.) The work of Redemption is viſible, becauſe God's Word tells us who Chriſt died for, and that is <hi>for every Man,</hi> Heb. 2. 9. and here Infants are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually Chriſt's viſibly.</p>
                  <p>But ſo long as Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> thinks that Chriſt died but for ſome Infants only, (and thoſe very few in compariſon of the whole, he cannot name one for whom Chriſt died, it being impoſſible) for them to give any Demonſtration by which he may know ſuch a thing, and therefore he can have but ſmall comfort in baptizing any of them, if indeed it were lawful to baptize ſome Infants, as he ſuppoſes. Nay, were he as ſure that Chriſt died for ſome particular Infants, as I am that he died for them all, yet would it not follow that they are <hi>Abraham's Eccleſiaſtical Seed,</hi> ſo as to be baptized: for Chriſt knew that the Infants whom he took in his Arms were his, and yet he did no ſuch thing to them; and I ſhall never think Mr. <hi>P.</hi> wiſer than our Saviour, nor ſo kind to poor Infants as he was.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> argues thus: <hi>Some Infants are viſibly of the Faith, and ſo are Abraham's Seed.</hi> Here I deny the Antecedent. I ſay no Infants are viſibly of the Faith. And Mr. <hi>P.</hi> tells me in this very place, That <hi>he does not ſay that Faith ſemenal, and habitual, or actual, is in all Infants baptized; for then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all of them must be ſaved, which they are not; or elſe they might loſe that ſpecial Faith: But they are inviſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vested in the Covenant or Promiſe, which is the Word of Faith, and may bear that Name, &amp;c.</hi> I anſwer:</p>
                  <p>Here are two kinds of Faith which the Scripture knows nothing of, i. e. <hi>ſeminal,</hi> and <hi>habitual.</hi> However I perceive he knows not one Infant that has any of theſe kinds of Faith, he therefore has found out a fourth, and that is a reputative Faith, or a thing which he ſays <hi>may bear that</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:43974:14"/>
                     <hi>name.</hi> Sure theſe are meer Dreams and Fancies, and ſo let them go.</p>
                  <p>Actual Faith Infants have none; and this is all the Faith that Man can make Judgment of by God's Word. He does indeed grant all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants which are baptized have not this Faith; and if he dare affirm it <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>f any of them, all the Experience of the World will confute him, and ſo he has loſt his Argument, as a meer Story without Truth, and againſt all Experience. For ſeeing Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God; he cannot without a Miracle ſhew <hi>any Infant to be viſibly in the Faith;</hi> for the poor Babe knows not its right hand from its left. He might as well ſay ſome Infants are viſibly in Repentance, and I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel why the <hi>Poedobaptists</hi> do not inſiſt upon that, as well as Faith, to entitle their Children to Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> tells us, <hi>If Infants have not Faith for the preſent, yet vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they are under a Promiſe of it, which Promiſe Baptiſm may be a Sign and Seal of; it may ſeal a Doctrine of Faith, even where a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of it is yet wanting.</hi> Theſe and what follows, are meer Dictates and Preſumptions, without Proof. Yet he brings <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. 6. where God promiſes <hi>to circumciſe the hearts of the Iſraelites, and the heart of their Seed, to love the Lord with all the heart, and with all the ſoul.</hi> But God ſpake not this to Infants, nor as a thing to be done to them in their Infancy; for when they ſhould thus be circumcis'd, they ſhould be able to know the Lord very well, for they ſhould love him then with all the Heart and Soul. Now this Promiſe is made to all Men upon future Contingencies, for God commandeth all Men every where to repent, and wills that the Goſpel (which contains this and many other precious Promiſes) ſhould be preached to every Creature; And if <hi>Baptiſm may be a Seal of this Doctrine, even there where there wants a Principle of Faith,</hi> as you tell us it may; then we may go and baptiſe every Creature, and not higgle as you do about ſome Infants only: but ſhould we do thus, God's Word would trip up our Heels, as it does yours, for tho he has proclaim'd Peace to the World by the Goſpel, yet he makes Faith neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the Pledg of its Reception; <hi>He that believeth, and is baptiſed, ſhall be ſaved; If thou believest with all thine Heart thou mayst be baptiſed: When they believed, they were baptiſed,</hi> not one Perſon admitted without; and then what is Mr. <hi>Petto</hi> that will adventure <hi>to give Baptiſm, even there where there is not Faith, no nor ſo much as a Principle of it?</hi> How ſhall Baptiſm be the Anſwer of a good Conſcience without a Principle of Faith? And what good will it do you without Faith?</p>

He quotes <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 3. <hi>I will pour Water upon him that is thirsty, I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, &amp;c.</hi> Well, but not in Infancy; when was this done to any of your Infants? Or, has not God made good this Promiſe in the Goſpel? Men muſt be thirſty before this Water be poured out upon them. You bring <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59. 21. which might have ſhewed you that theſe Promiſes belong not to Infants; ſeeing they cannot underſtand either the Word or Spirit, which yet is here promiſed to be in the <hi>mouth of the Church, and her Seed for ever;</hi> or, if you pleaſe, in the <hi>mouth of Chriſt, and his Seeds Seed for ever.</hi> But Infants are ſo called, ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin, à non fando,</hi> becauſe they cannot ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>You bring <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 13. and 112. 2. where 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Seed of good Men ſhall inherit the Earth, and be mighty upon Earth, and be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> But I think theſe are unfitly applied to Infants in Infancy; and yet if they concern'd them, here's no Proof that they are viſibly in the Faith during Infancy.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall become of the Infants of ill Men by Mr. <hi>Petto</hi>'s Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine? they are put by him in a Condition contrary to that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of good Men, as if the Infants Bleſſing or Curſing muſt be meaſured out, as the Parents are Believers, or otherwiſe. Let us ſee his Scriptures; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 28.<hi>—The Seed of the wicked ſhall be cut off:</hi> But why muſt this be applied to Infants? Sure he has Mercy for them, ſo as not to turn them into Hell. For he hath told us, if thoſe Children of wicked Men which live to years do but turn from the wicked Ways of their Fathers, they ſhall not dy; and ſo equal are God's Ways, that if the Son of a righteous Man follow the Ways of wicked Men, he ſhall die: as to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Judgments, I grant the Infants do ſometimes ſuffer for the Sin of their Parents, but our Diſcourſe is about their Salvation.</p>
                  <p>You bring <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. again, and thence you infer that the Infant-ſeed of the <hi>Jews</hi> was broken off for the Parents Unbelief. But if this Break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-off be underſtood of an Excluſion of Infants to Hells Torments, it is a moſt falſe Opinion, as I ſhall fully ſhew anon.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Abraham</hi> by virtue of his Faith which he had being uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, is a Father of the faithful, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> is very true. But that any of them are his Children, ſo as to be Members of the Church militant, to do and ſuffer for Chriſt, without actual Faith, is not true, nor does <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 10, 11, 12. prove the contrary; let us hear your Text: <hi>How then was it reckoned? when he was in Circumciſion, or in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion? not in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion. And he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>received the Sign of Circumciſion, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:43974:15"/>
                     <hi>which he had being yet uncircumciſed, that he might be the Father of them that believe, though they be not circumciſed, that Righteouſneſs might be imputed to them alſo. And the Father of Circumciſion to them, who are not of the Circumciſion only, but alſo walk in the Steps of that Faith of our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>which he had being yet uncircumciſed.</hi> May the God of Heaven give you a good underſtanding of this Place, and then all your ſtruggling for Infant-Baptiſm would ſoon vaniſh.</p>
                  <p>For there is nothing more evident than this, that none but ſuch as ſo believe, as to walk in the Steps of that Faith which <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf had (which was true actual Faith,) are the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in a viſible Church-ſtate to worſhip God, either in Baptiſm, or other Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>pag.</hi> 48. You proceed to anſwer many Objections, and in all you ſay this ſeems to be your great Stick, That Infant-Intereſt in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. is not cut off by any thing ſo objected, as you have ſet them down; and unleſs this be ſhewed, all Objections ſignify nothing to you.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To which I anſwer, Infants had as good Right to the Covenant of Grace before Circumciſion, and have the ſame Right now which they e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had to that bleſſed Covenant: of this more by and by.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. No Perſon's Right to Circumciſion did ariſe out of the Covenant of Grace, but did only iſſue from the Command of God; otherwiſe all good Men then living muſt needs be circumciſed, for they were in the Covenant of Grace as well as <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As Circumciſion did not give <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed an Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, ſo the Abrogation of Circumciſion did not take that Intereſt from them. Nor did the omiſſion of it, when in being, cut Infants off from the Covenant of Grace: It only cut them off from the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the external Priviledges of the Jewiſh Churchſtate. For the delay of the Circumciſion of <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Child did not cut it off from the Covenant of Grace, nor did the omiſſion of it fourty Years in the Wilderneſs, cut them Infants off from the Covenant of Grace who died in that time, howbeit before they poſſeſſed the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> they muſt be circumciſed; which evidently ſhews that the Covenant of Grace, and the Covenant of Circumciſion are to be diſtinguiſhed. And therefore though Infants have now no Part in the Covenant of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, yet they loſe nothing by it; becauſe though it was very uſeful till Chriſt came, for the Ends for which it was ordained, reſpecting the Church-ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the Birth of our Saviour, of that Seed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43974:16"/>
according to the Fleſh; yet the Removal of it was a great Mercy, whether we reſpect the Severity of the Service it ſelf, or the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to which it bound all that were circumciſed.</p>
                  <p>Neither does any Man's Right to the Covenant of Grace ariſe from the Covenant of Circumciſion; neither does his Right to Baptiſm ariſe from the Covenant of Grace, without a Divine Command appointing to whom, and how it ſhould be performed. Now the Goſpel being preached <hi>for the Obedience of Faith to all Nations, Rom.</hi> 16. 26. And that Typical Covenant of Circumciſion being made void, and the Goſpel appointing no Ceremony for Infants (yet aſſuring them of Heaven) but making Repentance and Faith the two firſt Principles of the Chriſtian Religion, and Baptiſm the third Principle in order to a due Profeſſion of Goſpel-worſhip in a Church-way, it is manifeſt that Infant-baptiſm is an Innovation, and makes a Breach upon the ſacred Doctrine contained in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> as ſet down, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. And therefore all good Men ſhould labour that Truth herein according to Primitive Crder may be reſtored.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs that Infants (even all of them dying ſuch) have an undeniable Right in the Covenant of Grace, to Life and Salvation, I hope to make very evident both from the Scripture and right Reaſon, in the laſt Part of this Treatiſe to which I now apply my ſelf; and though herein I ſhall not directly anſwer to Mr. <hi>Petto,</hi> yet I ſhall ſcarce fail to remove thoſe things, which may ſeem to be of any moment, in his often and unneceſſary Repetitions.</p>

Theſe are his Words: <hi>It is the Covenant-Intereſt and Baptiſm of the Infant-ſeed, only of viſible Believers, that I plead for; and there are ſuch vaſt Numbers (even millions) of theſe, that if Men unduly exclude and raze out the Names of ſo many out of that great Charter of Heaven, they will have a dreadful Account to give thereof to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In anſwer to theſe childiſh Fears and undue Reflections upon us, I ſhall take the pains to tranſcribe what I have formerly written upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it being yet unanſwered.</p>
               <p>This new Art of pleading for Infant-baptiſm by virtue of their Church-memberſhip, Covenant-Intereſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not from the Scriptures di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, but altogether by remote, obſcure, and far-fetch'd Conſequences; I ſay, conſidering theſe Subtilties of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and others, I perceive the Controverſy to riſe very high, and Queſtions thereupon to be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, inſomuch that I have had for my ſhare not leſs than five hundred of them ſent out by Mr. <hi>Barret</hi> abovenamed, which has been redargu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two Books of <hi>Antiqueries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hereupon I conceived it needful to conſider this matter, for I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very wiſe and good Men engaged on both ſides; and as I believe much more ſtraining in the Point of Church-memberſhip, or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-Intereſt of Infants than needed. By which the Readers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, as handled between Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> and Mr. <hi>Tombs,</hi> ſhall ſooner fill their Heads with Amazement, than their Hearts with Satisfaction, in tracing the ſeveral Meanders of their Scholaſtick Diſputations.</p>
               <p>And though I am abundantly ſhort of the Accompliſhments of either of theſe Champions, yet ſtanding to view till they engage, I hope I have thereby been led to the Conſideration of a Medium, which if well conſidered and improved, will reconcile the difference about Infants vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church-memberſhip, and Covenant-Intereſt, and yet do not doubt at all that Infant-baptiſm will be found unneceſſary, and unlawful. To which purpoſe I ſhall lay down once more this Poſition.</p>
               <q>That all Infants (as ſuch) are in a viſible State of Salvation by the Covenant of Grace, and ſo are of the univerſal Church of God; and cannot be put out of that bleſſed State, till by their voluntary Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from God, by chuſing ſinful Ways, they deſtroy themſelves.</q>

And the better to convince my preſent Adverſaries, I will make my Enterance hereunto by a Paſſage out of Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Book, of <hi>More Proves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 8. where he ſaith,</p>
               <q>
                  <p>All Mankind is brought by Chriſt under a Covenant of Grace, which is not vain, nor repealed by God, but as their Abuſe of the Grace of the Covenant may caſt them out.</p>
                  <p>For as a Covenant of intire Nature was made with all Mankind in innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> ſo a Covenant of Grace was made with all Mankind in lapſed <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. in the promiſed Seed; and renewed again with all Mankind in <hi>Noah.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Now this Doctrine being no more than plain Truth, we ſhall apply it to the caſe in hand, by ſhewing,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That this Covenant of Grace was a viſible Church-Covenant.</item>
                  <item>2. That it was made with all Mankind, and takes place in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.</item>
                  <item>3. That it was never repealed by God.</item>
                  <item>4. That no Infant did ever abuſe the Grace of this Covenant; and that therefore no Infant was ever caſt out of this Covenant.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And then, fifthly, they all ſtand viſible Members of the Catholick or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, by virtue of this Covenant, however their Parents do abuſe or neglect it. And hence it will follow, no dying Infant is damned, but are all in a viſible State of Salvation. Theſe things I hope to ſhew to Satisfaction.</p>

And that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Nature being broken by <hi>Adam,</hi> and in him by all his Poſterity, it being not a Covenant of Grace, could not afford means to juſtify the the Offenders in the Sight of God. There muſt therefore be ſome ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Act of Grace or Mercy from God, elſe <hi>Adam,</hi> even whole Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind who were then in his Loins, muſt have ſtood under Condemnation for ever; <hi>ſeeing no Man could redeem his Brother, nor give to God a Ranſom for him, Pſal.</hi> 49. 7.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43974:17"/>
It is the received Doctrine of Chriſtians that the viſible Church began in <hi>Adam;</hi> and that his Family was the Church, wherefore the whole World being then the Church, and that Church-Covenant being made with the whole World, which was to proceed from <hi>Adam,</hi> and this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant yet remaining, it follows againſt all Contradiction, that whole Mankind, conſidered as they came into the World, in the ſeveral Ages of it, are in that Covenant, and ſo in a viſible State of Salvation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Univerſal Church of God.</p>
                  <p>But whereas many did apoſtatize from the Grace of God's Covenant, <hi>by corrupting his Way, Gen.</hi> 6. 12. it was neceſſary that they ſhould be ejected; and therefore was the Profeſſion of this bleſſed Covenant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated and appropriated to that Part of the Adult, who had not ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned themſelves out of it. But ſtill we do not find that the Innocent was ejected with the Guilty. For this is God's Order, <hi>It is he only that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, whom he will blot out of the Book of Life,</hi> Exod. 32. 32, 33.</p>
                  <p>And therefore neither the Method which God took with <hi>Noah</hi> in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Covenant of his Grace; nor yet that Order which he obſerved with <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 12. was excluſive of any Infant in the World, as to the Grace or Mercy of eternal Life, no more than the Eſtabliſhment of it by Chriſt in the Goſpel, in a far more excellent way, for diſtinguiſhing the precious from the vile, is in any wiſe, no not in the leaſt <hi>iota,</hi> exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of any dying Infant of ill Men: but contrary-wiſe the Right of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, without excepting any of them, is aſſerted by Chriſt in this laſt and moſt ample Edition of the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Nor can any Man ſhew either by Scripture or Reaſon, that God will ſhut out all the dying Infants of wicked Men, from Life and Salvation by Chriſt, no nor ſo much as any one of them. <hi>For we are ſure that the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is according to Truth, that the Judg of all the Earth will do Right: That the condemned ſhall all be judged according to the Deeds done in the Body.</hi> But as for poor Infants, what Evil have they done?</p>

                  <p>That this Covenant was made with all Mankind, becauſe it was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> without the leaſt Intimation of the Excluſion of any part of his Poſterity (as they proceed from him) to the End of the World. Neither has God himſelf explained the Covenant of Grace to be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of any, but for the Cauſe of their own Iniquity. And this was evident firſt in the caſe of <hi>Cain,</hi> who not being faithful in his Offering,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43974:18"/>
was not accepted; yet God was pleaſed to tell him how he might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted?</hi> It ſhould ſeem God never rejected <hi>Cain</hi> till now, neither did he now delight to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject him, but graciouſly expoſtulates with <hi>Cain</hi> to convince him of his Evil, and aſſures him of Acceptance, <hi>if he did well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If then <hi>Cain</hi> had an Intereſt in the Grace of God, who can we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to be ſhut out of it? Or how ſhould Infants be caſt out of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, till they with <hi>Cain</hi> ſhut themſelves out of it?</p>
                  <p>Evident it is that the Covenant of Grace extended to thoſe Rebels in the old World, becauſe we read that the Long-ſuffering of God waited in the Days of <hi>Noah</hi> upon them, and he gave them <hi>time of Repentance,</hi> and ſent <hi>a Preacher of Righteouſneſs (even the Righteouſneſs of Faith)</hi> among them. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 5. therefore it is ſaid Chriſt went by his Spirit and preached to them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. though none of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved his Word.</p>
                  <p>Now ſuch Acts on God's part are great Evidences of his Graciouſneſs towards Men, and ſhews that he remembers his Covenant made in Chriſt for them, even for them that rebel againſt him, and ſo periſh. And then how ſhould we think that he ſhould not be gracious to poor Infants, who never rebelled againſt him?</p>

                     <hi>The Covenant of Grace,</hi> Gen. 3. 15. <hi>was never repealed by God.</hi> For if it be, there is now no Covenant at all: Nor can it be repealed to one Man, but it muſt be repealed to all Men. 'Tis true, Men may forfeit the Mercy of God held forth in that Covenant, but the Covenant cannot be repealed, for then there can be no certainty of Mercy for Sinners. Chriſt our Lord may as ſoon be made null, as this Covenant: For what if ſome do apoſtatize, ſhall this make the Grace of God without effect? God forbid. When we continually ſee the Covenant of God's Grace diſplayed, making Overtures of Kindneſs to Sinners, <hi>by beſeeching them to be reconciled to God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. What ſhall we ſay? Has the chief of Sinners this Benefit by the Covenant of Grace? And ſhall poor innocent Babes have no Benefit by it? Is he not worſe than the chief of Sinners, that is thus expoſed to Damnation? Sure there are better things with God for poor Babes, and chiefly in this he has not given Parents power to make void the Covenant of his Grace with reſpect to their Infants: For he hath ſaid, <hi>the Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father: The Soul that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it ſhall die.</hi>

                  <p>Although it is moſt true that Original Sin is come upon Infants, and Death by Sin: <hi>Yet this is as true,</hi> That Original Sin was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt the Covenant of Grace.

                  <p>Otherwiſe if the Sin of ſubſequent Parents ſhould make void the Grace of the ſecond Covenant, as the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> made his Poſterity guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Breach of the firſt Covenant, we may then cry out, <hi>who then can be ſaved?</hi> But therefore was our Saviour the <hi>Mediator of the New Teſtament, for the Redemption of the Tranſgreſſions which were under the first Teſtament.</hi>

The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who make Baptiſm as neceſſary for Infants as any Body does, yet they have ſo much Kindneſs, as to condemn Infants only to a State of Loſs, but not of Torment: Whilſt thoſe of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Spirit do ſend them (by their Doctrine) to yell among the damned in Hell-fire. Sure this is no part of the Goſpel, <hi>I will not call it ſo:</hi> Yet I will ſay thoſe that reject that great Salvation held forth in the Goſpel, are juſtly condemned; but this is not the caſe of Infants.</p>

And though it is true, God ſuffered the Infants to die with the wicked Parents, yet that is no Argument of God's condemning them to Hell. For did not the ſame God ſuffer his Servant <hi>Sampſon</hi> to die with the Fall of the Theatre, among the wicked <hi>Philiſtines?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And we ſee the righteous often taken away by the ſame common Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities which have befallen Nations and Cities. Let us remember how tender the Lord was of the Infants of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> and that may convince
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43974:19"/>
us that the ſame gracious God could not be cruel to the Infants of the old World; and he that made thoſe little ones an Argument to juſtify his ſparing ſinful <hi>Nineveh,</hi> againſt the murmuring of <hi>Jonah,</hi> would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly make that an Argument for us to believe, that had his Judgments proceeded againſt that City, according to the Propheſy of <hi>Jonah;</hi> yet he would have diſtinguiſhed between the Innocent and the Nocent, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of future Puniſhment and Mercy: For it was not the Sin of the Infants, which cryed to Heaven for Vengeance, but of the grown Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                     <p>When we conſider how hardly Almighty God was drawn to inflict thoſe Judgments upon Mens Bodies in the old World, and in <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 18. and frequently where we read of the Execution of his Judgments; it might juſtly ſeem very ſtrange that Men ſhould think that God can be ſo eaſily provoked to damn Infants to Hell: For him I ſay to damn poor Infants to Eternal Fire, who was ſo unwilling to inflict on the Babes in <hi>Nineveh</hi> ſo much as a Temporal Judgment; nay he is unwilling to deſtroy the very Cattel for Mans Sin, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. which are only capable to ſuffer a ſhort of Death.

But in Juſtice he puniſhed thoſe wicked Parents, in putting a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to their Poſterity. And did not God in the Days of <hi>Noah</hi> deſtroy the Beaſts and Fowls of Heaven, yet who ſo weak to think that he was offended with them? Was the Lord angry with the Beaſts of the Field? God was juſt in taking away <hi>David</hi>'s Child, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. yet who ſo raſh to ſay that God did this in Juſtice againſt the Child? much leſs that the Child was damned, or that God was angry with the Child. <hi>David</hi> was far from ſuch an Opinion, for tho that Child was conceived and born in Sin, as much as any, yet <hi>David</hi> nothing feared the Damnation of the Child, but rather ſhews his Confidence of its Salvation, when he ſaid, <hi>I ſhall go to it.</hi> For had it gone to Hell Torments, he would not have comforted himſelf with Thoughts of going to it.</p>

I can hear Men talk big Words againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as if they were very great Sinners, yet I never ſaw any Proof, that any Infant had any Sin of its own, for which you would here make them periſh.</p>
                     <p>The Scripture ſaith Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of a Law, and tells us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo where no Law is, <hi>there is no Tranſgreſſion.</hi> You muſt therefore either ſhew ſome Law to be given to Infants, or elſe you cannot make them guilty of any Sin <hi>of their own.</hi> And ſeeing you have granted that none ſhall periſh purely for anothers Sin, it remains for you, or ſome body elſe, to ſhew what Sin has been committed by them, or any of them, for which they incur the Damnation of Hell. You may talk of Infants <hi>contracting Sin of their own;</hi> but I am to learn how this can be ſaid of thoſe who neither act nor conſent to Sin at all. Such Scriptureleſs Notions are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

to be exploded than embraced.</p>
                     <p>And though you ſeem to have ſome Charity <hi>for thoſe and their Seed, who only come up to the Covenant of Grace made</hi> with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> though they never heard the Goſpel, whilſt you ſay, you <hi>do not rank them with Imſdels;</hi> yet this is but a ſlender Kindneſs: you do not ſay they ſhall be ſaved, and you are poſitive in this, <hi>that Infants are not ſaved by the Covenant of Grace, if they be neither Believers, nor the Seed of ſuch.</hi> How this Doctrine will ſtand with the Juſtice of a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous God, I cannot conceive when I conſider, that God hath not given to Infants either Capacity to believe, or Liberty to chooſe whether they will be the Seed of Believers or Unbelievers. Will you yet ſay a gracious God will be more harſh in Acts of Juſtice, than the Rules will bear which he hath given to Men? <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. 25, 26. Here he will not have a Damſel puniſhed, though her Body be defiled, <hi>becauſe ſhe could not help it.</hi> And yet you would have him ſend Infants to Hell for that which they cannot help!</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>It is not the part of a wiſe Legiſlator</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>to recede from his own Laws;</hi> much leſs to deſtroy them, by acting contrary to them. It muſt be a fault then in you, thus unjuſtly to repreſent the God of Juſtice. Is the Covenant of Grace ſet upon ſuch a little Point, as that the greateſt Part of Infants cannot poſſibly have any Benefit by it? So you teach, who affirm <hi>Infants cannot be ſaved unleſs they be Believers, or the Seed of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi> Why call you a Covenant made with Infants on ſuch Terms a Covenant of Grace? ſure ſuch abſolutely impoſſible Terms in any Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant are not very gracious, when the Non-obſervation of them is Damnation without remedy, and that of the Innocent too.</p>
                     <p>You would condemn this in Men; you would abhor to hear or receive ſuch Terms of Man; yet thus you make many believe that God deals with the greateſt part of poor Infants.</p>

And it is moſt certain, <hi>no Infant is the Serpents Seed,</hi> it being out of his Power to beget them to be his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, ſeeing they are out of the reach of his Temptations during Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.

                     </p>
                     <p>But what is all this to the innocent Babes of the Gentiles? they were not thus the Children of Wrath, no nor out of the Covenant of Grace, as made with <hi>Adam,</hi> having never abuſed the Grace of that Covenant.

Only this is very true, they now underſtood the Riches of God's Grace to Mankind, and that God had pitty for them, when they were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins. And therefore they could not rationally doubt of his good Will towards their dying Infants: For ſtill his Unwillingneſs to deſtroy the actual Sinner, is Argument enough that he will never deſtroy the innocent Child eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</p>

What Hope there is of all Infants entring into Heaven (however it may be hid from the <hi>Pagans.)</hi> is evident enough from our Saviour's Speech; <hi>Except ye be converted, and become as little Children, ye ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now ſuppoſe I take the Infant of a Jew or Pagan for my Pattern, and labour that my Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may anſwer to ſuch a Precedent, in point of Innocency, Humility, and Simplicity; will not this as well accord the Intent of our Saviour's Words, as if I took the Child of a Chriſtian for my Pattern? <hi>certes</hi> it would.</p>

Seeing, according to your Doctrine, had the Parents believed, their Infants had been in the Covenant of Grace. But now for their Fathers Sin (for what you ſay of their own contracted, is but a Fable) they are left by you in the Kingdom of the Devil to ſuffer with the Devil and his Angels for ever. Now this dreadful Doctrine can never be proved by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, though ſome have aſſayed to do it.</p>

Indeed <hi>Diodate</hi> would have us believe that <hi>God</hi> caſt <hi>Eſau</hi> (even before he was born) <hi>out of his Love as a Father:</hi> But here is no Proof. For if we ſhould admit his Gloſs upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 13. yet we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that God knew what <hi>Eſau</hi> would be in time, and did here fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew what in time ſhould be done concerning him. <hi>Eſau</hi> lived to be a Man, and a very ſinful Man. God knew all this before. <hi>Eſau</hi> is not to be ranked with dying Infants, therefore the Inſtance of <hi>Eſau</hi> is nothing to the purpoſe. And this Inſtance failing, as it evidently doth, I am ſure there is not the leaſt ſhew of Proof in the Scripture for the <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of <hi>Dying Infants.</hi> And therefore no Man ought to believe ſuch ſtrange Doctrine, nor trouble the World nor Church of God with it.</p>
                     <p>When our Saviour denounces the dreadful Sentence of <hi>Hell's Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he directs his Speech to Hypocrites, and grievous Sinners.

But here it is poor Infants are above theſe Angels; Infants have a Redeemer, but the fallen Angels have none.</p>
