         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE
TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>THere hath been of late Years many Aspersions cast upon Vs,
whereby the People in some Places (especially in the
West of this Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi>) have been much stirred
up against us, and much hard and cruel Vsage have we
Suffered; and have often been in danger of our Lives, both in our
Meetings and in the Streets, and sometimes in our own Houses:
And since the Sitting of the Late General Assembly at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi>
what a mighty Clamour hath been among the People through a
great part of the Nation concerning us? Some saying, we must be
all Excommunicated, and that none must Converse or Deal with
us, others saying, we must all be Banished, The rude Multitude
that abuse us often threatning us with the General Assembly, and
taking occasion from thence (especially in our Meeting at <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi>)
to be more Wicked, Prophane and Loose in their Carriage
towards us than they were before: And the only Reason that is


<pb facs="tcp:31269:3"/>
given for this Confused Noise about us, and for all the Cruel and
Vnchristian Vsage we meet with, is it not the same that was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
against the LORD and his People by their Adversaries
and Persecutors in former Ages? that is, under pretence of being
Deceivers, Deluders, Hereticks, Schismaticks, possessed with
the Devil <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Did not the Chief Priests and Pharisees tell People that Christ</hi>
was a Deceiver, and that he had a Devil? John. 7. 47. Mat. 2. 63.
Luke 11. 15. John 8. 48. <hi>and did not the People revile and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute
Him under that pretence; and were not the Apostles accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
Deceivers, Turners of the World upside-down, <hi>and deemed</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
to Live upon the Earth; 2 Cor. 6. 8. Acts 27. 50. <hi>And
was not Paul called</hi> a Pestilent Fellow, a Mover of Sedition, a Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leader
of the Sect of the Nazarines? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Acts 17. 6. Acts 24. 5. <hi>And
were not all the Revilings, Scoffings, Stonings, Imprisonments,
and other hard usage that they met with, inflicted upon them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
those hatefull Names and Epithites aforementioned; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the</hi> dark Priests, benighted Elders and Proud Pharisees and others
<hi>stirred up the People against them? and did not the Heathens</hi>
put Wild-beasts Skins upon the Christians <hi>to make them appear</hi> like
Beasts that the Dogs might be stirred up to Devour them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And was it not under the black and detestable Names of</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks;
Deluders, Schismaticks, (<hi>and sometimes of</hi>) Socerers (or
Witches) <hi>That the Popish Clergy incensed the People against the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Protestants,</hi> prohibiting them all Trade and Commerce, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
them to cruel Scoffings and Revilings, <hi>and at last</hi> Murthering
many Thousands of them (<hi>as may be seen at large in the Books of
Martyrs) Was ever Christ or his Apostles found in such cruel pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
or stirring People up thereunto. Did he not</hi> rebuke those
Disciples that desired the destruction of some that would not receive
Him, telling them they knew not what Spirit they were off, and that
he was not come to destroy mens lives but to save them? Joh. 9. 55, 56.


<pb facs="tcp:31269:3"/>
               <hi>And were not the Stoners, Abusers, Scoffers and envious Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
Persecutors, and the Priests and Teachers that stirred
them up thereunto,</hi> such as were filling up the measure of their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
<hi>and</hi> drawing down the Righteous and terrible Judgments of God
upon themselves? Mat. 23. 32, 33, 34, 35, Acts. 7. 51. 52. <hi>So our
earnest</hi> desire is, that they who have shown themselves so eager to
be found in such cruel Practices in this our Age, may seriously
consider what Spirit they are off, and whose Steps they are tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, and that they may Repent before it be too late.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now we having often been wrongfully accused (and from thence
hatefull Names put upon us) with denying</hi> the Trinity, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scriptures, that we undervalue the Merits and Sufferings of
CHRIST; <hi>Some saying,</hi> we deny His Divinity, <hi>others saying,</hi> we
deny His Humanity, The Ordinances, The Resurrection, <hi>and</hi> the
Great Day of Judgement <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have therefore found a Concern upon us to Publish a brief Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of what our belief hath been &amp; still is concerning those &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
weighty points of Christian Doctine, &amp; so leave it to the serious
Consideration of the empartial Reader what ground there is for that
mighty Clamour that hath been and yet continues against us, and
whether it be not like theirs of Old that cryed out, Men of Israel
Help? <hi>&amp;c. Acts</hi> 21. 28.</p>

Asserted. Being a Brief account of Their Faith in
Relation to several weighty Matters, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Their Christian Belief is Questioned.</head>
            <p>Question. <hi>WHat's your Belief concerning the Blessed Trinity, as our Term is?
Answer,</hi> Our Belief is, that in the Unity of the God-head
there is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, being those Three Divine Witnesses
that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit;
and that these Three are One, according to Holy Scripture Testmony.

of God, or that Jesus Christ is truely God and Man?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, we verily believe that Jesus Christ is truly God and Man,
according as Holy Scripture Testifies of Him, God over all blessed for ever,
he true God and Eternal Life, the One Mediator between God and Men, even
he Man Christ Jesus. <hi>Joh. 1. 1. 2. Rom. 9. 5. 1 Joh. 5. 20. 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 5.</p>

and Merits of Jesus Christ, or by your own Righteousness or Works?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By Jesus Christ his Righteousness, Merits and Works, and not by
our own, God is not indebted to us for our deservings, but we to him for

               <hi>Quest.</hi> Do you believe and own the Divine Offices of Jesus Christ in his Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, verily we sincerely believe and own Christ, not only as He is
the Light of the World, enlightning every Man coming into it; but also that
he is given for a Leader, and for a Commander. And that He is both King,
Priest, and Prophet to and over His Church and People. He is the Minister
of the Sanctuary which the Lord pitched, and not Man, and we are to hear
Him in all things. <hi>Isa. 55. 4. Zech. 9. 9. Heb. 3. 1. Deut 18. 15. 18. Heb.</hi> 8. 2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Do you believe or own Baptism as Essential to Christianity, or necessary to
Salvation, and for the Ingrafting us into Christ and His Church?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> We believe and are fully perswaded, <hi>That</hi> Baptism which is Essential
to Christianity, and the saving Baptism, or the Cause without which none can
be true Christians, or saved, is the Inward Spiritual washing of Regeneration
by the Word of Life. This is the saving Baptism into Christ and His Church,
which produceth the Answer of a Good Conscience towards God, of which
the outward was a Figure, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 21. This is that <hi>One Baptism</hi> of Christ by
one Spirit into <hi>that one Body,</hi> whereof Christ is Head. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 5.</p>
            <p>As to Dipping or Sprinkling Infants, or Young Children we find no Precept
or Precedent in Holy Scripture for the practice thereof, and therefore we
cannot think our not believing it Essential (or necessary) to Salvation, or
making <hi>Christians;</hi> a sufficient Argument to prove us <hi>no Christians</hi> (unless it
can be proved that none are saved without it, and that all are saved that have it.)
Considering also what's positively affirmed in the 39 Articles of the Church
of <hi>England</hi> as in the 6th. Article, <hi>That whatsoever is not Read in the Holy
Scriptures, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any Man, That it
should be believed as an Article of the Faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to

               </gap>ht to have among themselves, or as a Seal of the Saints Communion
and Commemoration of Christs Death for us, or as Figurative of Christs Body and
Blood Spiritually received by Faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> The Supper of the Lord we own, and tenderly consider in a
twofold Sense, 1. In the Figure. 2. In the Substance. 1. That our Lord
Jesus Christ at his <hi>Supper</hi> with His Disciples, did Eat the Passover (which
was for the Fulfilling and Consummation of the Fasts under the Law:) see
<hi>Luke</hi> 22. And at this <hi>Supper</hi> He did take and Minister Bread and the Cup
to his Disciples (for there was no Transubstantiation) saying, <hi>This do in
Remembrance of Me;</hi> and said the Apostle, <hi>As often as ye shall Eat this
Bread, and Drink this Cup, ye shew the Lords Death till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.
After this they did more clearly know His coming: and Christ after the
Spirit; <hi>Jesus Christ in them.</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. and 5. 16. 2. And Christ sald to
His Disciples, <hi>I will not Drink henceforth of this Fruit of the Vine until that day I
Drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom,</hi> Matth. 26 29. And likewise of the
<hi>Bread, I will not any more Eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of
God,</hi> Luke 22. 16. And he further said, <hi>I appoint unto you a Kingdom as my
Father hath appointed to me that ye may Eat and Drink at my Table in my
Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 22 29. 30. In these things we believe he spoke
Mysteriously, and that every Member of his Spiritual Church, doth daily
Spiritually partake of His Body and Blood by Faith, as the Cup of Blessing
which we Bless, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ? And the
Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ?
For we being many are ONE Bread, and ONE Body, for we are all
partakers of that ONE Bread, 1 Cor. 10. 15, 16. 17. The Son of God
saith, <hi>Behold, I stand at the Door and knock, if any Man hear my Voice, and
open the Door, I will come into him, and will SVP with him, and he with me,</hi>
Rev. 3. 20. And Wisdom calleth to the Simple, <hi>Come, Eat of my Bread,
aud Drink of my Wine,</hi> Prov. 9. 4, 5. And saith Christ, <hi>The Bread of God
is He that cometh down from Heaven, and giveth Life unto the VVorld, I am
that Bread of Life; my Flesh is Meat indeed, and my Blood is Drink indeed,
He that Eateth my Flesh, and Drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in Me, and I in
him,</hi> John 6. We believe that all who thus do truly partake of Christ by
Faith, are in true Communion and Love among themselves, which they do

want, who are only in the outward Observations of <hi>Sign and Shadows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Do you own the Seals of the New Covenant?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Yes, as the New Covenant is Spiritual, so are the Seals thereof
(as they may be Termed) proper to it, and therefore we believe they stand
not in any external Shadow, Sign or Figure, but in <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Substance,</hi> the
<hi>Seals</hi> of the New Covenant (which is Inward and Spiritual) must needs be
the Evidence, Testimony and Work of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> giving us Assurance
through Faith of our share and Interest in that Covenant. See what the Holy
Scripture saith in this Case; see 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 22. Who hath also Sealed us and hath
given us the earnest of the Spirit in our Hearts.</hi> Ephes. 1. 13. <hi>After that ye
believed ye were Sealed with that Holy Spirit of Promise.</hi> And <hi>Ephes. 4. 30. And
grieve not the Holy Spirit of God whereby ye are Sealed unto the day of Redemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our Christian Sense and Belief in these Matters may be briefly summ'd up
in what follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. We believe, That the spiritual appearance, and living enjoyment
of Christ in spirit, is above all outward signs, shadows, or figures, or <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
Remembrance only of him thereby. And that <hi>Christ</hi> more clearly discovers
himself by his spirit in the New Covenant, then by any outward Representations
in the Old, or thereunto appertaining.</p>
            <p>2. That the <hi>One Baptism</hi> of the spirit, is a seal or confirmation of the New
Covenant to true Believers, and of them in it; and so is their spiritual Eating
and Drinking with him in his Kingdom a certain assurance, Seal or Evidence
of their spiritual Communion with Him, and in Him.</p>
            <p>3. As all outward shadows and figures were of a decreasing nature, so there
is the substance thereof, which they pointed at, and wherein they ended,
though the names given to the shadows were carried along to the substance
also, that it might the more plainly appear in Scripture how the shadows
were fulfilled in the substance Christ; as in the Old Covenant there was
outward Circumcision of the flesh; in the New, there is the Inward Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision
of the Spirit. In the Old, there was diverse <hi>Washings or Baptisms

shadow, was a Type of another Type outward, but alwayes of the thing
Typified ot shadowed forth, which was the substance and end of that shadow
or Type, as may be shewen at large, if any undertake to shew us any shadow
or thing that is figurative in its own nature (mentioned in Scripture) which
they suppose we cannot shew the substance of, under the same Name or
Title.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> Do you believe and own the Holy Scriptures contained in the Books of the
Old and New Testament, to be given by Divine Inspiration, and to contain all
Matters of Doctrine and Testtmonie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> necessarie to be believed and practiced
in order to salvation, and Peace with GOD?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answer.</hi> Yes, we do, and by the assistance of the Grace and good Spirit
of GOD, which gives the true understanding of the Mind of GOD, and
meaning of Holy Scripture, we always desire to live in the Faith, Knowledge
and Practice of them in all things appertaining to Life and Godliness, Holy
Scripture being given by Divine Inspiration, is profitable for Doctrine,
Correction, and Instruction, that the Man of GOD may be perfect, thorowly
furnished unto every good Work, able to make the Man of GOD wise
unto Salvation, through Faith in Christ Jesus.</p>
