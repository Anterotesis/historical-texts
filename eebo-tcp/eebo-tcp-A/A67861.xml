            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </note> as no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular answer can be made thereunto, onely it appeareth by that which hath been said, That the Lord Admiral his Officers, and Ministers, principally by colour of the said void <hi>non obstante,</hi> and for want of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed advice, have unjustly incroached upon the Common Laws of this Realm, whereof the marvail is the lesse, for that the Lord Admiral, his Lieutenants, Officers and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters, have without all colour, encroached and intruded upon a Right and Prerogative due to the Crown, in that they have seized, and converted to their own uses, Goods and Chattels of infinite value, taken by Pyrats at Sea, and other Goods and Chattels which in no sort appertain unto his Lordship, by his Letters Patents, wherein the said <hi>non obstante</hi> is contained, and for which he and his Officers remain accountable to his Majesty. And they now wanting in this Blessed time of Peace, causes appertaining to their natural Iurisdiction, they now incroach upon the Iurisdiction of the Common-Law, lest they should sit idle, and reap no profit; and if a greater number of Prohibitions (as
<pb facs="tcp:62270:9"/>
they affirm) have been granted, since the great benefit of this happy Peace, than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in time of hostility, it moveth from their own encroachments, upon the Iurisdiction of the Common Law; so that they do not onely unjustly incroach, but complain also of the Iudges of the Realm for doing of Iustice in these cases.</p>

               </list>
               <p>The Acts of Parliament are, First, The Statute of the 13. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 5. which restrains the Admiral from meddling with things within the Realm.

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That of the 5 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which is pretended to exclude the Admiral from meddling with things done within Ports and Rivers.</p>
               <p>The First of these, being more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, may in this place be considered, the rest being more particular may, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussing of some other particular points to which they are appliable, be examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>That of the 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 5. or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains, that the Admirals and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties shall not meddle of any thing done within the Realm, but only of things done upon the Sea, as it hath been used in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third.</p>

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62270:30"/>
divers Jurisdictions and Franchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses belonging to the King &amp; other Lords, from whence it may be conceived, that the Parliament intended only to restrain him from medling in his Courts with such things within the Realm, wherein he had encroacht upon the Jurisdiction of the King and other Lords, which what those things were, it doth no wayes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; but it cannot be imagined or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably conceived, that it was intended the Admiral should be debarred from proceeding in Causes of Navigation and Negotiation by Sea, which never did belong to any other Courts of the King or other Lords, and were formerly held proper for the conusance of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and as things were then stated could not be held encroachments.</p>
               <p>So much may the rather be supposed, because the Statute restraining him from meddling with things done within the Realm, but only with things done upon the Sea, further adds, <hi>according to what hath been duly used, in the time of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prince King</hi> Edward, <hi>Grand-father to the King,</hi> which was King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And it is manifest, That the Law was continued all that Kings time, in regard that in the 49 year of his Reign, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected Sea-men for the Inquisition at <hi>Quinborough,</hi> in the conclusion say, That touching some businesses proposed in the Articles of the Inquisition, they know no better advise nor remedy than that which had been formerly used and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62270:32"/>
after the manner which is contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Law of Oleron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All which being admitted and duly considered, it may be presumed, that such Causes as did originally by Civil Law belong to the Admiralty, and what for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Kings had antiently ordained for the regulating of the same, as likewise such as were agreeable to the matters decided in the <hi>Iudgments of Oleron,</hi> and what are conteined in the Inquisition taken at <hi>Quinborough,</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, were within the conusance of the Admiralty Court, and consequently the same are permitted to be tried and determined in the same Court by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the 13 of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Touching the Judgments, Judicial Acts, and Book-Cases intended to restrain the Admiral of <hi>England</hi> in exercise of his Jurisdiction as it is granted in the Kings Commission, it may be answered in general, First, That those Judgments, Judicial Acts, &amp;c. are in Causes of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in respect of Jurisdiction betwixt the Courts of Common Law and the Admiralty Court, and it is incident to all professions, where there is any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition or emulation with others, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62270:32"/>
to that which is most to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Secondly, Such Judgment sand Book-Cases have been grounded upon the common understanding of the Statutes, without any notice or respect to the Laws of the Sea, or the condition of Maritime Causes, the circumstances of the places being the chief Rule by which they have been framed. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That many of them upon due exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation may be found not so concluding as they are pretended, and although much respect and reverence be due to the Authours, yet we are not bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that their judgments are infallible. Fourthly, That the Judicial proceeding as Prohibitions, being the results of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer authorities they may be weighed accordingly.

               </p>
               <p>To these authorities may be answered in general, First, That whereas some of them speak of <hi>Altum Mare,</hi> the Statute of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62270:33"/>
the 13 of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. hath no such Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute, but mentions simply the Sea.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That the same Authorities granting that the Admiral hath jurisdiction on the Sea, do not declare, much less conclude, that he hath no jurisdiction elsewhere: And as to the particulars,</p>
               <p n="1">1 The Authority of 2 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. which affirms that the <hi>Irish</hi> were subject to the Admiral of <hi>England,</hi> for a thing done on the Sea, mentions not for what kinde of thing, and happily it might be for some offence against the Crown, or against the Peace, in offering violence to the Kings Subjects, or the subjects of his Allies; and in such Cases it might be understood, that he had Jurisdiction over the <hi>Irish,</hi> as over the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> and other Nations, onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the high Sea; but it cannot from thence be argued, but that if it were a business concerning Navigation, or Negotiation by Sea, he might also have had Jurisdiction over the <hi>Irish,</hi> as well as over other persons, not onely <hi>super alto mari,</hi> but also in other places elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The Plea to the Action of Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass, in the 7 <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2. might be
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62270:34"/>
good, and allowed in two respects; First, In regard the thing was done where the Country could take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and therefore no Jury by twelve men could be had. Secondly, In regard the Ship and goods were taken from the Kings Enemies, against whom no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass could be committed, because that to offend them any wayes was lawfull; and in that respect the Plea might have been allowed, although the Ship and Merchandise had been taken in a Port, or Navigable River.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas <hi>Fortescue</hi> sayes, that things done upon the high Sea, prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the Admiral, ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined according to the Proofs made by Witnesses, and no more, Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cook</hi> affirms, That it proves by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press words that the Admiralty is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the high Sea: <hi>Fortescue</hi> having given reason for Trials by Jury, when the Neighbourhood of the Country could take notice of the business, Grants that for things done in other places, the Law of the Kingdome doth allow of proofs by Witnesses, as in Causes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced before the Admiral for things done on the high Sea, and likewise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62270:34"/>
the Constable, for things done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea; so that it is evident he doth no more expresly confine the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Jurisdiction to the high Sea, than he doth the Constables to places be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea; it being notorious that his Jurisdiction extends to Deeds of War, and Arms within the Land; as it will be proved that the Admirals Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction likewise to matters of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, and Negotiation by Sea.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Touching the Authority of <hi>Dyer,</hi> that by Libel in the Admiralty Court, the Case is surmised to commence, <hi>Sur la haut mer, &amp;c.</hi> It may be answered, that the Libels in the Admiralty, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (as the business falls out) declare, <hi>Super alto mari &amp; infra jurisdictionem Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> but ordinarily Causes are laid onely <hi>intra fluxum &amp; refluxum Maris &amp; Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionem Curiae,</hi> and generally the Causes are no otherwise described, but <hi>A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra B. in causa civili, &amp; Maritima.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, by Commissions from time to time Granted by the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> to the Admirals, power is given, <hi>Ad cognos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendum, &amp;c. to hold the Conusance of Charter-parties,

Policies of Assurance, Bills of Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomry, Bills of Lading, and of Sale of Ships.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Causes and Sutes ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by occasion of businesses contained in such Writings have in all observable times and places been held to be Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and the Conusance of them hath been allowed to Martim Courts, as it hath been before fully shewed; and it may be further considered, that such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Writings have their Original from ancient Maritim Laws, &amp; are both in names and nature, things forein to the Laws of this Realm: And so much may be gathered from the order which <hi>Wes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth in his Book of Presidents, where after the form<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Deeds and Contracts proper to the Common Law, he handles those which concern Merchandizing and Trade by Sea, as things of a distinct and several nature.</p>
               <p>Touching the particulars, First, Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-parties seem to have been derived from the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Laws, by which it was provided, <hi>Si quis na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

               </p>
               <p>There is likewise mention of Charter-parties
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62270:36"/>
in the Role of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and in the <hi>French</hi> later Ordinances, made for the reglement of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty of <hi>France,</hi> and it is supposed that no mention of them can be found in any Law or Statute of this Realm, until the 32 of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 14. where the Conusance of them is referred to the Admiralty, as it shall be hereafter shewed. Moreover <hi>Malines</hi> confirms, that anciently in Charter-parties it was exprest,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lex Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. p.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 21.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Contents thereof should be understood according to the Law of Oleron</hi>; and at this time there are Clauses usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inserted into them, enjoyning, That the Merchants besides the payment of Freight, shall make allowance for <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, Average</hi> and <hi>Pettelodmenage,</hi> things no where occurring in the Books of Common Law, and anciently determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by the Law of <hi>Oleron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Policies of Assurance are grounded upon the Civil Law, which alloweth an Action for the undertaking a hazard which is doubtfull, for reward or consideration first given, which is commonly called a <hi>Praemio,</hi> they are of later Civillians called <hi>Sponsiones Merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriae,</hi> and <hi>Assecurationes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>P.</hi> 1 <hi>cap.</hi> 24</note> which <hi>Malines</hi>

affirms, were taken up in this Kingdome from the Laws of <hi>Oleron,</hi> practised on the Sea coasts of <hi>France,</hi> but it is manifest that now they are likewise in use in <hi>Venice, Naples, Genua, Ancona, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal,</hi> and in other places where the affairs of the Sea are regulated by the <hi>Civil Law, the Consolato, and Laws of Oleron.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Bills of Bottomry, when an Owner, or Master of a Ship, to furnish his Voyage, takes up money upon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary interest to be paid when the Ship arrives at the Port appointed, and thereby engages his Ship for the performance of the same, are grounded on the ancient <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Laws. <hi>Iulius Pollux,</hi> a learned Expositor of tearms, or words used amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi> calls a Bill of this kinde, <gap reason="foreign">

praestantur, Maritimae, &amp; nauticae dicuntur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, Bills of sale of Ships are made conformable to Maritine Laws; for as <hi>West</hi> in his Presidents delivers the form, it is in such Bills of sale exprest and declared, That he that sells the Ship bindes himself, his Executors, and Administrators, the said Ship so bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained and sold, to warrant and defend, against all men, for one whole year, and a day, <hi>according to the Law</hi> of <hi>Oleron,</hi> the danger of the Sea, Fire, and Enemies, onely excepted.</p>
               <p>These things being considered, it may be thought reasonable, that such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts and Writings being grounded upon the Civil Law, the Laws a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Merchants, and other Maritime Laws, the Sutes arising about the same should rather be determined in those Courts, where the proceedings and Judgements are according to those Laws, than in other Courts which take no notice thereof.</p>
               <p>For the restraining of the Court of Admiralty from proceeding in Sutes arising from such Contracts and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings made at Land, although the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:62270:37"/>
therein contained, are to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at Sea, amongst the Authorities cited by Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> there may be intended appliable to this purpose, First the Act of Parliament of the 15. of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the 2. Chap. 15. Secondly, some judgements given, and Prohibitions granted in the Courts of Common Law, concerning causes of this sort, commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>Touching the Statute of the 15. of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. Chap. 34. which is the ground of the main Objections against the Admirals Jurisdiction, it may be conceived, That whereas that of the 13. Chap. only in general restrains the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals from medling with things done within the Realm, and allows them to meddle with things done on the Sea, that is relating to the Sea, This Statute was intended to declare more expressly, both in what places, and in what mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they should not meddle, And touching the places, in regard <hi>the word Realm,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Comment in Littleton Sect.</hi> 43.</note> 
                  <hi>as Sir</hi> Edward Cook <hi>observes, in a general sence extends to the Sea within the Kings Dominions, as well as to the Land,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the restraint, to be only <hi>within the bodies of Counties,</hi> And it may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62270:38"/>
that he intended a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Bodies and the Extremities or bounds of Counties, as the Statute of the 3. of <hi>Edward</hi> 1. makes a difference betwixt things done <hi>within the Shires, and things done within the Marches, and Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Shires,</hi> whence the Statute of the 5. of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Chap. 5. allows to the Admirals Jurisdiction, as the main Sea, so also the Coasts of the Sea, being no parts of the Bodies of any Counties of the Realm, and in that respect this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute specially excepts from the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Jurisdiction, the Conusance of wreck of Sea, as happening on the Coasts or Shores of the Sea, out of the bodies of any Counties, so that as to the place, or Territory of the restraint, this Statute declares it streighter, than that of the 13. of <hi>Richard</hi> the second.</p>
               <p>Touching the matters, with which the Admiral by this Statute is not to meddle within the bodies of Counties, they are expressly declared. First <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, Pleas, and Quarrels,</hi> That is perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Actions concerning Contracts; and Secondly are implyed matters Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and the prosecution of them.</p>
               <p>Touching the First, which concern
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:62270:38"/>
this Assertion, the words are, <hi>That the Court of Almiralty hath no manner of Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance of any Contract, Plea, or Quarrel, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing within the bodies of any Counties; But all such Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels shall be tried, determined, and remedied by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law.</hi> Which words are so general, that it is pretended, they ought to be understand of all Contracts, and Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings whatsoever, even of such as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Sea businesses, if they be made, or written within the Bodies of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries.</p>
               <p>In answer whereunto, there may be taken into consideration, a General Rule cited by Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> allowed as he saies by all Laws,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iurisdict. of Courts</hi> p. 330.</note> in construction of Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, viz. <hi>Quamvis lex generaliter loqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, restringenda tamen est, ut cessante ratione, &amp; ipsa cesset, cum enim ratio sit anima, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorque ipsius legis, non videtur legislatur id sensisse, quod ratione caret, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62270:39"/>
were wont or ought to have of right</hi>; by which words it is acknowledged, that the Conusance of some ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ters did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly belong to that Jurisdiction; And not to diminish any of their Ancient and just rights in things belonging to the Sea, which are permitted, and allowed to the Admiral, by the Statute of the 15. of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. and unto which neither the Kings Courts, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Courts of any other Lords had formerly before this Statute any pretence.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> in his Answers to the 1. Objection of the Complaint, 8<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi,</hi> saith, That the Judges acknowledge, that of Contracts, Plea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, and Quarrels made upon the Sea or any part thereof, &amp;c. the Admiralty hath and ought to have Jurisdiction, and that no President can be shewed, that any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rohibition hath been granted for any Contract, Plea, or Quarrel concerning any Marine cause made or done upon the Sea. By which words he implies, that although the Admiral had and ought to have Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction upon the Sea, yet it was only concerning Marine Causes, but if a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, Plea, or Quarrel were made or done upon the Sea concerning any Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62270:39"/>
Cause, or matters concerning busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the County, a Prohibition might be granted. Now it may seem worthy of Consideration, whether any Reason can be shewed why the Courts of Common Law ought to have cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels which concern Terrene Causes, or Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters concerning businesses of the County, made or done upon the Sea; Yet if Contracts, Pleas, or Quarrels, which concern Marine Causes, or Matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Sea, be made or done within the Bodies of Counties, the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral ought not to have the like Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance, And if no reason thereof can be shewed, how according to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule which Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> delivers touching the Construction of Statutes, the common Interpretation which is made of that of the 15. of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. Chap. 3. by which Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels arising within the Bodies of Counties, are extended to Contracts, Pleas, or Quarrels relating to Marine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, can be justified, the reason of the Rule being, <hi>Cum Ratio sit anima Legis, non videtur Legislator id sensisse, quod ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione caret, etiamsi Verborum generalitas, prima facie aliter suadeat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:62270:40"/>And that the place only, where a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract is made of written, should alter or transferr the Jurisdiction to the Courts of Common Law, may seem very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, for the reasons following.</p>
               <p>First, for that Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels, being things incorporeal, or matters of right, may more properly be said to arise from that, from which they are caused, or occasioned, than from the place where they happen to be made, and so Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels occasioned by the businesses of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be said to arise within the Body of the County, and Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels occasioned by the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the Sea, may be said to arise from the Sea, in what places so ever they happen to be made, or Written. So it is properly said, <hi>Ex facto jus oritur, &amp; actio oritur ex delicto.</hi> Because the Law results from the fact, and the Action is occasioned by the fault. So where the Jurisdiction of the Admiral of <hi>France,</hi> is said to be, <hi>pour le fait de la Mer,</hi> Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> renders it in Latin,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Secondly, that the end of a Contract, being to have something performed, and Pleas and Quarrels are occasioned by the non-performance, or ill performance of the same, The place of performance is more considerable, than the place where the Contract was made, or written; So <hi>Ulpian</hi> a famous Roman Lawyer saith, <hi>Mulier exigere dotem illic debet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>l. exigere, D. de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciis.</hi>

                     </gap>omicilium habet, non ubi instrumentum dotale conscriptum est, nec enim id genus contractus est, ut tam eum locum spectari oporteat, in quo instrumentum dotis actum est, quam locum domicilii, in quem mulier per conditionem matrimonii reditura erat, When a Dowry is to be restored to a Wife, after her Husbands death or divorce, it is not to be estimated, according to the value of things where the instrument or deed of the Dowry was made, but according to the value of the place where the Dowry was to be made good, that is the place, where her Husband li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, for that if the Question be whether a Maritime Contract were made or no, it may be determined by a jury of the place, But if the Plea or Sute be (as most commonly it is) whether
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62270:41"/>
the Contract be performed, or not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, it cannot be determined but upon proofs, made from the place of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, of which the Vicinage to the place where the Contract was made, can take no notice, and therefore it is improbable that the Statute should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that such Sutes should be tried, discussed, and determined only by the Courts and course of Common Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Common Law is not so strict, but that according to the nature of the business, it allows Jurisdiction to other Courts; For although Promises and Contracts of money, are generally Pleadable in the Courts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Donatio in Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.</hi>
                  </note> yet as <hi>Bracton</hi> writes, <hi>causae de rebus promissis ob causam matrimonii, in foro Ecclesiastico terminari debent, quia cujus ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, id, &amp; jurisdictionis, est principale, ejus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem erit accessorium</hi>; And in an other place he gives a reason for the same, <hi>quia semper videndum propter quid aliquid sit, vel promittatur.</hi> And again, although Sutes touching Tenures and Services belong to the same Courts of Common Law,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sect.</hi> 136.</note> yet <hi>Littleton</hi> shews, That if <hi>Tenants in Franck Almain, fail to perform divine Service, the Lord may complain thereof to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:62270:41"/>
the Ordinary</hi>; and Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> in his Comment thereupon observes, that the <hi>Law doth appoint every thing to be done, by those to whose Office it properly appertaineth, and so saith he, the Lord hath remedy for his Divine Service (albeit it issue out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Lands) in foro Ecclesiastico, by the Ecclesiastical Court.</hi> And certainly if what constructions are made of the Law, were made of this Statute, it would be more easily admitted, That a Maritime Contract, although made, or written within the County, should be tried before the Judge of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, whose Office it is to determine Maritime causes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, For the better discerning of the meaning of this Statute, it is offered to consideration what hath been the sense of Parliaments in preceding and subsequent Statutes; as first in the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the Staple made in the 27 of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. in 3 <hi>Chap.</hi> where it is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That the Mayors and Constables of the Staple, shall have Iurisdiction and Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance within the Towns where the Staple shall be, of all manner of things touching the Staple, which shall be ruled by the Law Merchant, and not by the Common Law of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:62270:42"/>
the Land, nor by the usage of Cities, Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs, or other Towns, &amp;c.</hi> So that all manner of Contracts and Covenants made betwixt Merchant, and Merchant or other, where one party is a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, whether <hi>the Contract be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Staple, or without,</hi> the Plaintiff may sue his action or Quarrel before the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stices of the Staple by the Law of the Staple, unless he make choice to sue in some other place of the Common Law; from which may be observed, First, That the Merchants businesses, by the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Parliament, were held fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be regulated by a special Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the Law-merchant, than by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Laws or customes of the Countries. Secondly, That where Contracts or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants did concern Merchandize, or matters belonging to the Staple, it was not thought considerable, to point of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, whether the Contract or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant were made within or without the precincts of the Staple.</p>
               <p>The susequent Statutes are that of the 32 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that the Court of Admiralty may hold plea of Charter-parties; and that of the 43 of <hi>Elizabeth, Chap.</hi> 12. which
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:62270:42"/>
hinders the Courts of common Law from medling with Policies of Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which two things are the main matters endeavoured to be maintained by the Statute of the 15 of <hi>Rich.</hi> the 2. to belong to the Conusance of the Courts of common Law, because they are usual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made at Land, within the bodies of Counties.</p>
               <p>The Statute of the 32 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Ch.</hi> 14. prohibiting the employment of Forein ships, ordained, concerning the shipping of this Kingdome, <hi>That the Owners, or Masters make their departure from the Port of</hi> London, <hi>after the Freighting, or Lading of the Ship, as soon as wind and weather wil serve, according to the Charter-party made betwixt the Owner, or Master, and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, without protracting of time, and also that they, and every of them to his power, shall see and provide that all Wares and Merchandises, which shall be by the said Merchants, and their servants brought into any Ship or Vessel, shall be honestly and in good order saved and kept; Provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, that if any Merchant stranger, or other, finde himself grieved, or damnified, by negligent keeping of his Wares, or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandises, or by long delaying, or protracting
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:62270:43"/>

               </p>
               <p>The Statute of the 43 of <hi>Elizabeth, Chap.</hi> 12. declares, <hi>That whereas differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces growing upon Policies of Assurance had been ordered by discreet Merchants, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Lord Mayor, who did speedily decide those Causes, until that of late years, divers persons did withdraw themselves from that arbitrary course, and have sought to draw the parties assured, to seek their monies of every several assurers by Sules commenced in her Majesties Courts, to their great charges, and delay, thereupon it was enacted, that a Commission should be granted, giving power to certain Commissioners</hi> (the first whereof is the Judge of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty) <hi>to order and decree such Causes, in a brief and summary course, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of pleadings and proceedings.

               <p>The Legal authorities which may be conceived to be intended to debar
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62270:44"/>
the Admiral from the Conusance of Contracts, and writings made at Land, touching things to be performed at Sea, or such as shew that since the making of the Statute of the 15 of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and not before, the Courts of Common Law have admitted, and held Pleas of Charter-parties, of Policies of Assurance, and declared something concerning Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners wages. Touching Charter-parties, it is shewed first that in the 31 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. an Action was brought upon the Statute, of double damages, by <hi>William Hore</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Ieffery Unton,</hi> who had sued the said <hi>Hore</hi> in the Admiralty for four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score pounds upon a Charter-party of Freightment of a Ship of the said <hi>Ieffryes,</hi> imployed to go towards <hi>Island,</hi> in regard, <hi>Contractus ille apud novam Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum infra corpus Comitatus, &amp; non super altum mare factus, &amp; junctus fuit</hi>; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon damages were assessed against the Defendant to an hundred Marks, and costs to 40 l.</p>
               <p>Again, that in the 28 of <hi>Elizabeth</hi> in the Kings Bench, upon a Charter-party, by a Deed indented which was made at <hi>Thetford</hi> in the County of <hi>Norfolk, Euangelist Constantine</hi> sued <hi>Hugh Glynn,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:62270:44"/>
for the breach of Covenant, in not stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>Mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Concerning Policies of Assurance, That in the 38 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. in a Case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Crane</hi> and <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again, that in the 36 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> an Action of the Case was brought in the Kings Bench upon an Assumpsit, from a Policy of Assurance, where it was
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62270:45"/>
undertaken, That a Ship should sail safely from <hi>Melcomb Regis</hi> to <hi>Abbevil</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> the Ship being arrested by the <hi>French</hi> King in the River of <hi>Somme,</hi> in the Realm of <hi>France,</hi> and the matter was there adjudged: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o which may be added what S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Ed. Cook</hi> delivers for Law in <hi>Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dales</hi> case, <hi>Cum combein le contract comme le performance, &amp;c.</hi> when <hi>as well the Contract as the performance of it, is wholy done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea, and it so appears, the Trial fails at the Common Law</hi>: But here, saith he, the Assumpsit was made at <hi>London,</hi> which is the ground and foundation of the Action, and therefore the Trial of necessity shall be there, or otherwise it shall not be tryed at all; and the Arrest which is in issue is not the ground of the Action, but the Assumpsit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching Mariners wages is, that of the Book of 48 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. where it is said, That if a Mariner make a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with one to serve in a Ship on the Sea, yet if his wages be not paid they shall be demanded in that Court, by the Common Law, <hi>Nemy per ley Mariner.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To these Authorities it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in general, that all, but the last, are grounded upon the commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62270:45"/>
sense of the Statute of the 15. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. that the Contract doth rise only there, where it is made or written, with out any respect to the nature of the business, and the occasion thereof, from whence in truth it doth more properly arise; And whereas other acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have in some special points ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and declared otherwise, it may be hoped that it may not be held a crime unexcusable, if a man should doubt of the reasonableness of those authorities.</p>
               <p>Touching the particulars, As First of the 31. of <hi>Henry</hi> 6. betwixt <hi>Hore</hi> and <hi>Unton,</hi> wherein double Dammages were given for suing in the Admiralty Court upon a Charter-party, it is said, that the Sute was upon a Charter-party of Freightment, for four score pounds, It doth not appear that it was for the freight of the Ship, although it be most probable; and if it were so, why the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Ship should not as well sue for his freight, by virtue of the Statute of the 32. of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. as the Merchant by vertue of the same Statute, might sue in the Admiralty for dammage done to his goods, aboard a Ship, contrary to the Charter-party, without any respect to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62270:46"/>
the place where it was made? if no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son can be shewed, that Judgment may be thought not to have been grounded so much upon reason as it was upon the common received opinion of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Statute, as it is therein rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>quia contractus ille apud novam Sarum, factus &amp; junctus fuit.</hi> Touching that of the 28. of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whereby <hi>Glynn</hi> was condemned to <hi>Constantine</hi> for breach of Covenant, in a Charter-party, in the summ of 500. l. it seems a Case far more reasonable, though something grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, because it is not denied, but that a sute upon a Charter-party may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced at the Common Law, upon a penalty, as it seems that was, for breach of Covenant, in not staying at <hi>Madrill,</hi> so many dayes as were limitted by the Charter-party, Only that is thought no concluding argument, against a sute in the Admiralty for freight grounded on a Charter-party; But whereas when in the Arrest of judgment, it was alleged that the Trial was not sufficient, because the issue did arise out of a place in a Forein Kingdome, from whence no Jury, by Twelve men might be had, Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> sayes that Sir <hi>Christopher Wray</hi> and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62270:46"/>
the whole bench resolved, That the Plaintiff should recover cost, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, because the Charter-party was made at <hi>Thetford</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> within the Realm, it is as much as if Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> had said, that whether the suggestion in the issue, were true or false, tryed by a competent, or incompetent Jury, yet if the sute were brought upon a Charter-party, the Conusance thereof did belong to the Common Law, and whether the former Judges, had proceeded well or not, was not material, so that what is premised formerly touching Judgments and judicial Acts, in the <hi>First</hi> Chap. may from this case be excused.</p>
               <p>And as touching the infinite prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions granted upon sutes commenced in the Admiralty concerning Charter-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there may be something declared, and made appear reasonable hereafter, in an other place.</p>
               <p>As to the instances of Policies of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance held tryable at the Common Law, although by the Statute of the 43. of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it hath been shewed, that the proceedings in those causes at the Common Law, were altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to the Kingdome, yet in regard
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:62270:47"/>
Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> reasons in <hi>Dowdales</hi> case for the maintaining of proceedings in such businesses, may be applyed to other matters, to the prejudice of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty Jurisdiction, something may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served concerning the same, in Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Cooks</hi> reasons, as first, That the Assumpsit is the ground, and foundation of the Action, and that the Arrest, or Imbargo in that case had been no ground of an Action, if there had been no As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpsit, neither could the Assumpsit have produc'd an Action, if there had not been an Arrest. But what was the nearest, and immediate ground of the Action? without doubt, the Arrest, And what was chiefly in question? not the Assumpsit, for it was taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that that was done in <hi>London</hi>; but it was the Arrest, which (as it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) was in issue; And it is likely that the Common Law which intended a Trial of the Vicinage, intended it of the thing or matter which was in issue, to be tried. But he further argues, That the Trial must be of necessity where the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumpsit is made, for otherwise there could have been no Trial, at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, which might have savour'd of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62270:47"/>
some reason, If possibly there could have been no Trial in any other Court, but the Cause being Maritime, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Merchants, it might more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, have been tried in the Admiralty or in the Assurance Court, without a Jury, or Trial of Twelve men, by witnesses, as <hi>Fortescue</hi> acknowledgeth.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, touching that of the Book of 48. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. where it is said, That if a Mariner make Covenant only to serve in a Ship on the Sea, yet if the wages be not paid, they shall be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that Court, by the Common Law, not by the Law Mariner, the occasion was, that an action of debt being b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ought at the Common Law, upon an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion dated at <hi>Harflet in Kent,</hi> whereas in truth it was made in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the consideration was Service done in Warr in <hi>France,</hi> thereupon one of the Judges said, That the summ demanded grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing due for Service done in Warr, the Cause ought to be tryed in the Consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Marshals Court; Another (as it seems willing to retain the cause) said t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>at he hired a man to go in a message to <hi>Rome,</hi> although the service were done in another Realm, yet what was due by
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62270:48"/>
covenant, might be recovered in that Court; Another said, if a Mariner make a Covenant with one to serve in a Ship on the Sea, yet if his wages be not paid, they shall be demanded by the Common Law, &amp;c. So that it is plain it was not a Resolution of the Court, but a <hi>fuit dic,</hi> as they say, and one mans opinion, by way of argument to another purpose; And the ground thereof might be, that if it were in issue whether such a Covenant were made, it might be tryed at the Common Law, but it doth not conclude but that if the Question were, whether the service in the Ship were performed on the Sea, it might more properly be tryed in the Admiralty Court.</p>
               <p>For confirmation on this point.</p>
               <p>First, To the 4. Request of the Judge of the Admiralty to the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of the Kings Bench 12. <hi>May,</hi> 1575. <hi>viz.</hi> That the Judge of the Admiralty may have and enjoy the knowledge of the breach of Charter-parties made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Masters of Ships and Merchants for voyages to be made to the parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea, according as it hath been accustomed, time out of mind, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the good meaning of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62270:48"/>
of 32. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 14. though the same Charter-parties be made with in the Realm, The answer is, <hi>This is agreed upon for things to be performed upon, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, though the Charter-party be made upon the Land, by the Statute of</hi> 32. <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>chap.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Secondly, it was agreed unto by all the Judges and Attorney General before the King and his Counsel, <hi>That if a Sute be before the Admiral, for Freight or Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners wages, or for breach of Charter-parties for Voyages to be made beyond the Sea, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Charter-parties happen to be made with in the Realm, and although the money be payable within the Realm, so as the penalty be not demanded, a Prohibition is not to be granted.</hi> But if the Sute be for the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty, or if the Question be made whether the Charter-party were made or not, or whether the party did release, it is to be tryed by the Kings Court at <hi>Westminster,</hi> So that at first it be denied upon Oath that a Charter-party was made, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial upon Oath tendred, to which it may be added, that it was there further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, <hi>That if Sute shall be made in the Court of Admiralty, for building, amending, saving, or necessary victualling of a Ship,
<pb facs="tcp:62270:49"/>
against the Ship it self, and not against any party by name, but such as for his interest makes himself a party, no Prohibition is to be granted, though this be done within the Realm.</hi>

               <p>FIrst it is apparent that Ports, and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers are places where Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime businesses, and causes of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence concerning the same, may happen, as well as on the main Sea it self, and in truth are more proper for such affairs, than for any ordinary businesses of the Land, <hi>Portus</hi> (saith <hi>Ulpian</hi>) <hi>est locus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusus quo importantur merces &amp; exportan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>

goods do chiefly concern Navigation, and Merchants affairs.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Flumina navigabilia,</hi> that is navigable Rivers, are of the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and use, and it is allowed by the Common Law, <hi>that every water which flows and reflows, is an Arm of the Sea,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> maintains that Navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are in the Kings special Dominion,<note place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, it is evident by the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of <hi>Oleron,</hi> established for Law in the Admiralty of <hi>England,</hi> That many causes are resolved concerning Damma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges done by one Ship to another, sailing in the River, and for falling foul one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62270:50"/>
another, in the Port or Harbour, as also for loss done to Merchants goods in the Ports of discharge, by miscarriage, in the unloading, by reason of unfit coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, and tackling. It may likewise be shewed out of the Inquisition taken at <hi>Quinborough,</hi> that many things done in Ports and Navigable Rivers, are within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, as Ship-wrights taking excessive wages, removing of Anchors, cutting of Buoy ropes, and taking Salmon at unseasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times, the using of unlawfull Nets, the spoyling of Beds of Oysters, the dreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging for Oysters and Mussells at unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable times, and divers other matters. Against the Admirals Jurisdiction in this respect are pretended likewise Statutes, Book-cases, Judicial Acts, &amp;c. by which it is endeavoured to be proved, That the Admirals Jurisdiction is confined only to the high Sea, and wholly excluded from things done in Ports, and Navigable Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, which are said to be within the bodies of the Counties of the Realm. The first Statute is that of 15. <hi>Richard</hi> 2. which declares, that the Court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty hath no manner of Conusance, Power, or Jurisdiction of any Contract,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62270:50"/>
&amp;c. or any other thing rising within the Bodies of Counties, either by Land, or by Water; which later part is so Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and uncertain, that according to the General rule delivered by Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> before mentioned, <hi>lex generaliter loquens restringenda est, &amp;c.</hi> for by the general understanding of it, as it is most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally understood, by the Professors of the Common Law, it doth not only debarr the Admiral from the Conusance of those causes, which he is supposed to have encroached to the prejudice of the Courts of Common Law, but also from the Conusance of those things, which they were wont, or ought to have of right, contrary to the express meaning of the Praeamble of that Statute, as all those Causes which before this Statute did belong to the Admiral by the Roll of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and the Inquisition at <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may reasonably, and probably be conceived, that the Statute intending to restrain the Admirals Jurisdiction, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the words, <hi>Other things in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> such things, about which Actions and Sutes at the Common Law might arise, And having before mentioned
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62270:51"/>
Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in private persons might have an interest by way of personal Actions, did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards add <hi>other things arising within the Bodies of Counties,</hi> intending thereby pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick offences, and such as are against the Crown, as Treason, Murther, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter, Mayhemes, Robbery, Tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes <hi>vt &amp; armies,</hi> and the like, which interpretation, First is agreeable to the Praeamble, which mentions encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Jurisdiction, &amp;c. per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the King. Secondly, because the Statute ordaining that such things shall be tryed, discussed, and determined by the Laws of the Land, and not before the Admiral; seems to intend things, which might be tried either way, as Offences of that Nature, which done on the Sea, might have been tried before the Admiral, and being done on the Land were to be tried in the Courts of Common Law. Thirdly, because the reservation in the conclusion of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Provides, that nevertheless of the death of a man, or Mayheme done in great Ships, being, and hovering in the main stream beneath the Bridges next to the Sea, the Admiral shall have Conu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62270:51"/>
which being in the nature of an Exception, implies, that the things before mentioned in general, were to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of Offences, or matters of the same nature, and condition.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> where he cites the Statute of 15. <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. notes, that it was to be observed, how curious the makers of it were, to exclude the Admiral from all manner of Jurisdiction, within any Water which lyeth within any County of the Realm; but if his words be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, his curiosity goes far beyond them, for whereas the words of the Statute Anciently and generally have been received, only beneath the Bridges next or nigh the Sea, he renders it only beneath <hi>the Points of the same Rivers,</hi> The French word <hi>Pounts,</hi> being easily turned into <hi>Points,</hi> which Criticism might have the better passed, if it might be known what were meant by <hi>Points of Rivers</hi>; we understand by <hi>Points of Land,</hi> some extreme parts or ends, which in respect of the rest, are of a more accute figure, but Rivers towards the Sea, (which way the Criticism looks) grow broader, or wider, far from any Angular acuteness; Again, we commonly say above, or b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath

the bridge; but if we speak of the extremites, we say behither or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, within or without the Lands end; besides, whereas the words in that place are ships riding in the main stream of Navigable Rivers, it may be doubted where that main stream can be found beneath the points of the River.</p>
               <p>The former reading of the Statute, <hi>viz. beneath the Bridges,</hi> is agreeable to an ancient Edition of the Statutes at large printed 1543. above a hundred years since; so <hi>Rastals</hi> Abridgement, and <hi>Poultons</hi> Collection of the Statutes, and is so received by <hi>Crompton</hi> in his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction of Courts, where he writes of the Admiralty, according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes. It is further confirmed by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuscript Copy of the Statutes in <hi>French,</hi> in the Library of <hi>Merton</hi> College in <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> in which are these words, <hi>Niene meyns de mort de omme, &amp; de mayheme, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grosses neifs, estants &amp; o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The second Statute that may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to this purpose is that of 5 <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, Chap.</hi> 5. which relating to divers
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62270:52"/>
things made offences by that Statute, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dains, <hi>that all and every of the said offences, done on the main Sea, or Coasts of the Sea, being no part of the bodies of any Counties of the Realm, and without the Precinct, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and Iurisdiction of the Cinque Ports, and out of any Haven or Pier, shall be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Lord Admiral.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching this Statute it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That the end thereof was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Title, for the maintenance of the Navy, and as for a mean to that end, for the imploying of <hi>English</hi> ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, especially for the bringing in of Fish, for which purpose it provides, That Wednesdayes should be held Fish-dayes; That none shall demand toll of Fish brought in Subjects ships; That no Herring unsalted should be bought out of strangers bottoms; besides, that no Wares should be carryed from Port to to Port; and that no Wine, nor Woad shall be brought in but in <hi>English</hi> ships, of which businesses it might be more fit for the Officers of Corporate Sea-Towns to enquire, than for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral, which the Parliament under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, might without prejudice to his Jurisdiction in other matters except
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62270:53"/>
from him touching offences of that kinde, the enquiry within Havens and Piers.</p>
               <p>Besides, whereas Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> recites the words, <hi>That all such Offences shall be tryed before the Admiral</hi>; the words of the Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ute are, <hi>before the Lord Admiral of</hi> England, <hi>or his Lieutenant or Deputy or Deputies, and other Iustices of Oyer and Terminer, according to the form of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the</hi> 28 Hen. 8. <hi>for Causes of Piracy.</hi> So that it concerns not the Admiral in his ordinary capacity, but as he is chief in that Commission. And whereas Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> from this concludes, That by the Judgement of the whole Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Jurisdiction of the Admiral is wholy confined to the Sea, and Coasts of the Sea, being no parcel of the County, how strongly soever he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives it, under favour it is no good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to infer from these new created offences, of which he is to enquire in an extraordinary way, that he hath no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction in other matters, which did formerly belong unto him, especially touching Navigable Rivers, of which in this Statute there is no mention, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:62270:53"/>Moreover, whereas the Judgement of the Parliament in this Statute is so confidently urged for the limiting of the Admirals Jurisdiction, it is de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>red, that to the points in question, two other Statutes, the one long subsequent to that of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. the other not long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding that of the 5 of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> may be taken into consideration.</p>
               <p>The first is that of 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. concerning the trial of Piracies, and other crimes committed within the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals Jurisdiction, wherein it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, <hi>That all Treasons, Felonies, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, Robberies, Confederacies committed in or upon the Sea, or in any other Haven, Creek or place, where the Admiral, or Admirals have, or pretend to have Iurisdiction, shall be enquired, tried, heard, or adjudged by the Admiral, and others appointed by the Kings Commission under the Great Seal, in such shires and places of the Realm as shall be limited in the Commission, as if any such offence had been committed upon the Land,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The end of this Statute was, that whereas Piracies, and other offences committed within the Jurisdiction of the Admiralty, were formerly tryed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:62270:54"/>
to the Civil Law, and Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders could be convicted onely by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the parties, and proofs by Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, to reduce the Trial of the same to the course of the Common Law by a Jury of Twelve men; by which Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, although the Manner of the trial of Offences were altered, yet the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the Admirals Jurisdiction are allowed to extend not onely to the Sea, but to Havens, Creeks and places, where the Admiral, or Admirals have, or pretend to have Jurisdiction. And in the Commission of Oyer and Terminer grounded on that Statute, the places of Offences committed, to be heard and determined before the Admiral, and others, are thus described, <hi>Tam in aut super mari, aut aliquo portu, rivo, Aqua dulci, Creca, seu loco quccunque infra flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um maris ad plenitudinem, a quibuscunque primis pontibus versus mare, quam super littus maris, &amp; alibi ubicunque infra juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictionem nostram Maritimam, aut limites Admiralitatis Regni nostri, &amp; Dominiorum nostrorum:</hi> By which words, not onely power is given to hear and determine offences in those places; but it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise declared that those places do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62270:54"/>
to his Majesties Maritime Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and of his Admiralty.</p>
               <p>The second Statute is that of the first of <hi>Elizabeth, Chap.</hi> 17. made for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of Spawn and fry of Fish, and the remedies thereof being provided, it is ordained, <hi>That the Lord Admiral of</hi> England, <hi>and the Lord Mayor of</hi> London <hi>for the time being, and all and every other, which lawfully have, or ought to have any conservation, or preservation of any Rivers, streams or waters, shall have power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire according to that Act,</hi> which plainly shews, that the Parliament then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that the Admiral of <hi>England</hi> had power and Jurisdiction to some purposes in Rivers and Streams, salt and fresh, otherwise, he had not been na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the first place, amongst those who had right of conservation of the same.</p>
               <p>The Jurisdiction of the Admiralty as to publick offences and causes criminal since the Statute of 15 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. hath been so well settled by the Statute of 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. that there can be little occasion of difference touching those matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Courts of the common Law, and the Court of the Admiralty; yet
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62270:55"/>
Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> having unnecessarily col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected many other legal authorities which may be applied to maintain that by the Common Law the Admirals Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction did not extend to Ports and Navigable Rivers, it may not be amiss to examine the grounds and weight of the chiefest of them, which may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to two heads; First, such as shew that Havens and Navigable Rivers are within the bodies of Counties, and that the common Law hath held plea of things done in them. Secondly, That the Courts of common Law have pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished such as have sued in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty Court, for things done in Ports and Navigable Rivers.</p>
               <p>Touching the first, these Authorities might be intended.</p>
               <p>First, That in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> the first, a Replevin was brought for the taking of a ship on the coasts of <hi>Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> in the Sea, and carrying her into the County of <hi>N.</hi> The Defendant al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he pleaded that the thing was done on the Sea, was overruled to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, from whence amongst other things <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Edw. Cook</hi> makes a special ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, That when the taking of a
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:62270:55"/>
thing is partly on the Sea, and partly on the Land, the Common Law shall have the Jurisdiction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, That in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 2. It was held, That where one may see what is done on one part of the water, and on the other, it was held no part of the Sea, and that the Coroner shall exercise his office in this case, and of this the Country may have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That in the 43 of <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, sixty Acres of Marsh ground over which the Sea did flow and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow, were adjudged parcel of the Mannor of <hi>Brancaster,</hi> belonging to the Abbot of <hi>Ramsey,</hi> and by consequence were within the body of the County to the low water mark.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, That in the 46 of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. an Action of Trespass being brought in the Kings Court against certain persons of <hi>Hull,</hi> for taking a ship in the Haven of the Town, the Mayor and Bailiffs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Conusance by Charter of the King, by which it is granted, that the Citizens and Burgesses of <hi>Hull,</hi> should not be impleaded, <hi>Alibi de transgressioni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus infra Burgum, quam infra Burgum,</hi>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:62270:56"/>
which was allowed, and the Haven ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the Burrough, by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence was within the County.</p>
               <p>How far these Authorities conduce to the proof of the head proposed, may be doubted, but as to the ground of the head it self, which is so much insisted on, That where the Courts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law have Conusance, the Court of Admiralty can have no Jurisdiction, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der favour it is insufficient, for in the same place several Courts to several pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses may have distinct Jurisdictions, Robberies and divers other Offences committed in forests, are prosecuted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ordinary Justices, and yet the Justice in Eyre concerning vert,<note place="margin">

In <hi>France</hi> as <hi>Sanction</hi> writes, the Lords of mannors adjoyning to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers, have several rights of fishing, and other commodities, by the Kings grant or by prescription, and if they be disturbed they may have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, in the Ordinary Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, but as touching the free use of the Rivers in respect of Navigation, and that which concerns the Publique, the special Officers called the Masters of the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62270:56"/>
Waiters, (whose Authority in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome belongs unto the Admiral) have the charge thereof, and if any Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments be given, or Annoyances done in those respects, it belongs to their Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and power to reform the same.</p>
               <p>Touching the particulars, and first of that of the Replevin in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. concerning a Ship taken in the Sea, and brought into a River, and the defendants being over-ruled to answer, the Reason was, as <hi>Berry</hi> the Chief Justice said, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the King would have the peace kept, as well by Sea, as by Land, Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> in his notes upon <hi>Fortescue,</hi>

                     <hi>cap.</hi> 32. <hi>p.</hi> 31.</note> recites the case more fully and gives another reason, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>William Crake de Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham</hi> was summoned to answer a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of <hi>Robert de Beause,</hi> for taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a Ship of the value of 40. l. on the Sea, near <hi>Scarborough,</hi> to which it was pleaded by the Counsel, that the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff did count or declare of a thing taken on the Sea, out of any County, So that if the matter were put in issue before the Country, it could not be resolved what Sheriff should summon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that the Admiral was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the King to hear and determine
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62270:57"/>
sutes of things done on the Sea, &amp;c. Whereunto <hi>Berry</hi> Chief Justice of the Common Pleas answered, we have a general power throughout all <hi>England,</hi> but of the power of the Admirals of which you speak, we know nothing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will we assign our power to them, without commandment from the King, touching which you shew nothing; <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> said, The place is so near, that if a man had killed one there, he should have been taken, and brought to the Land, and hanged, as well as if the fact had been commited on the Land; <hi>Mettinggam</hi> said more, we tell you that we have power of things done on the Sea, as upon the Land, and therefore we order you to answer; The reason which Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> gives, was because in those times the Common Law had Conusance of things done on the British Sea within the view of the Land, although afterwards it kept its limits, <hi>infra corpus comitatus, Leaving the Sea wholly to the Admiral</hi>; So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Verse, sometimes applyed by Sir <hi>Edward Cook, Iudic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

grounds, over which the Sea did flow and reflow, adjudged to be within the Mannor of <hi>Brancaster</hi> in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> the 3. whence it is concluded to be within the County, is taken up by Sir <hi>Edw. Coole</hi> upon the credit of <hi>Dyer</hi>: But Sergeant <hi>Callis</hi> in his Readings cites the Record in this manner, <hi>Contra Abbot de Ramsey de quodam processu facto, versus dictum Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, ad ostendendum quare sexaginta acrae Marisci in manum Domini Regis non debent seiziri. Et Abbas respondet quod ipsa tenet Manerium de Brancaster quod scituatum est iuxta Mare, &amp; quod est ibidem Mariscus qui aliquando per Fluxum Maris minora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, aliquando per Fluxum Mardo auge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, &amp;c.</hi> By which it is apparent, that those grounds were claimed by that King, as waste and floted grounds, and no parcel of the Mannor, which the Abbot did justifie, and howsoever they might be part of the County, yet they could not be places concerning which there might grow any question of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, for although they were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to flowing and reflowing of the Sea yet they were not either fit for the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor arriving of Ships; and admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that some thing may be inferre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:62270:59"/>
from thence to prove that places where the Sea floweth may be within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Counties, yet it doth not wholy exclude the Admiral from having Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdion, by Sir <hi>Edw. Cooks</hi> learning, in Sir <hi>Henry Constables</hi> Case, where he sheweth, That it hath been resolved by the whole Court, that the soyl over which the Sea doth flow and reflow, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter le High-water mark, and the Low-water mark,</hi> the Land may be parcel of a Mannor of a subject, and yet it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, That when the Sea did flow <hi>ad plenitudinem,</hi> the Admiral should have Jurisdiction of any thing done upon the water, betwixt the High-water mark, &amp; the Low-water mark, by the ordinary and natural course of the Sea, and when the Sea doth reflow the Land may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to a subject, and then any thing done upon the Land shall be tried at the Common Law, for it is then parcel of the County, whereupon he makes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, That beyond the Low-water mark the Admiral alwayes hath Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, and betwixt the High-water mark, and the Low-water mark, the Common Law, and the Admiralty have <hi>divisum imperium</hi> interchangeably,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62270:60"/>
and why the same should not hold as well in Arms of the Sea, as in the open Sea, may deserve some considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The allowance of the Common Law of the Haven of <hi>Hull</hi> to be within the <hi>Burrough,</hi> in respect of an Action of Trespass determinable at the Common Law, for the reasons before shewed in general, it doth not hinder but that in the same place if damage be done by one ship to another, remedy may be given according to the Judgements in the Roll of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and so in respect of the place, though not of the cause, the Common Law, and the Admiralty may have <hi>conjunctum imperium</hi> occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There remain those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities which shew that the Courts of Common Law have punished, and restrained such as have sued in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty for things done in Havens, and Navigable Rivers, as by actions of double Damages, Praemuniries, and Prohibitions.</p>
               <p>Touching the first it is related, That 6 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. <hi>Iohn Burton</hi> in the Common Pleas recovered against <hi>Bartholomew Putt,</hi> for
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62270:60"/>
double damages 1400 l. for that the said <hi>Putt</hi> had sued <hi>Burton</hi> in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty for entring and taking away three ships with Merchandises and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners, with force of Arms, <hi>Super Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um mare,</hi> whereas the taking thereof was in the Haven of <hi>Bristol, intra cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Comitatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, That the like Action 12 of <hi>Henry</hi> 6. was brought by <hi>Robert Cupper,</hi> against <hi>Iohn Reyner,</hi> who had sued him in the Admiralty Court for entring his ship in the Haven of <hi>Yarmouth, infra Corpus Comitatus Norf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Concerning Praemunires, it is said, That 38 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6, one was brought by <hi>Iohn Cassy,</hi> against <hi>Richard Beauchamp,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Paunce,</hi> for that they sued him in the Admiralty Court for taking away certain <hi>Iewels super Altum mare,</hi> whereas he took them <hi>apud Stratford-Bow infra corpus Comitatus Middlesexiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, That in the 9 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. a Praemunire was brought for a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te in the Admiralty Court for taking and carrying away, <hi>Quandam naviculam apud Horton Key, at South Lynn,</hi> supposing the same to have been done <hi>super altum mare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="tcp:62270:61"/>It cannot be denied but that these Authorities especially contain <hi>forcible Arguments,</hi> and fit to fright men from suing in the Admiralty Court, but how <hi>reasonable,</hi> it may be considered.</p>
               <p>Touching the Action of double Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages, in the leading Case of <hi>Burton</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Put,</hi> the point of Issue was (as it may be supposed) whether the thing done in the River of <hi>Bristol,</hi> were done within the body of the County, and eight Terms (as Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> relates) were spent in deliberation of the Case, which argues that the Judges could not easily agree upon the same, and happily the reason was, because the Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> 4. for double Damages, relates onely to that of the 13 of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 5. and the Action was layed upon that of the 15 <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 3. Touching things done within the Bodies of Counties, it being not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to extend a penal Law from one Statute to another; and how rightly it was so adjudged, may be better consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; and it may be thought upon, why that being a leading Case, and having received so long deliberation, the Reasons of the Resolutions of the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62270:61"/>
Judges are no way published.</p>
               <p>It may be farther noted as to our purpose, that the taking of Ships in the Haven of <hi>Bristol</hi> was done with force of Arms, which made it more than an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary business, of which the Admiral claimeth the Conusance in such places, but was of the condition of those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which belong unto him onely upon the Sea; the other Cases of double Damages, for ought appears to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, might be for matters of Trespass, committed likewise by Force and Arms.</p>
               <p>Touching Praemunires brought for suing in the Admiralty Court, Sir <hi>Edw. Cook</hi> saith, That they being brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Statute of the 16 of King <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. for suing in <hi>Curia Romana aut alibi,</hi> are so evident, and of so dangerous a conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, as no application shall be made thereof. And for the dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence it is most true, for that the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty intended in that Statute extends to the imprisonment of the person during pleasure, and the loss of all his goods, and of the profits of his Lands during life; and for the application which he forbears, it may be conceived that his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:62270:62"/>
meaning was that the Admiral, or his Judge might be made liable thereunto; but for the Evidence that by <hi>Curia Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mana aut alibi,</hi> the Court of Admiralty should be understood, under his favour it is not so clear; nor if the Statute be well considered, can it with any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son be maintained; the word <hi>Alibi,</hi> or elsewhere in that Statute was in truth intended of <hi>Avignion</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> or some other place, to which the Pope and his Court in those times did usually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; and that Statute being intended to exclude the forein authority of the Pope, it might be thought necessary to debar the people of this Kingdome from having intercourse to the Popes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory, whether at <hi>Rome</hi> or any where else; and when the Popes authority and his Laws were in force in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and no way depending upon the Crown, the word <hi>Alibi,</hi> or elsewhere, was held to extend to Bishops Courts, if they medled with temporal causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Kings Courts, especially if they took upon them to reverse, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage Judgements given in the Courts of Common Law; but how the word <hi>Alibi</hi> should be applied to the Kings
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:62270:62"/>
Court of Admiralty, never relating to any Forein power, and proceeding onely by those Laws which are allowed by the King to be in force in that Court, it is a mystery beyond any ordinary imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It may be further noted, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be said that the two Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nires were brought upon such occasions, yet it doth not appear that any Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given upon either of them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, For confirmation and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this Point, it may be added, that before the King and his Councel it was likewise agreed unto by all the Judges, <hi>That the Admiral may inquire of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress all Annoyances and obstructions in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigable Rivers beneath the first Bridges, that are any impediment to Navigation and pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage to and from the Sea; and also try all personal Contracts and injuries done there which concern Navigation upon the Sea, and that no Prohibition is to be granted in such Cases.</hi>

               <p>Fifthly, For that, as <hi>Fortescue</hi> affirms, Contracts and Bargains made amongst strangers in another Realm, must be proved (otherwayes than in the Courts of Common Law) by witnesses, which, saith he, cometh to pass, because in those parts there be no neighbours, by

whose oaths Juries of twelve men may be made, as in Contracts and other cases arising within the Realm, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to be done.</p>
               <p>To avoid the Admirals Jurisdiction in holding Pleas of Contracts, or things done beyond the Sea, Sir <hi>Ed. Cook</hi> affirms, that Bargains and Contracts so made, wherein the Courts of Common Law cannot administer Justice, did belong to the Constable and Marshal, for the Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Admiral is wholy confined to the Sea, which is out of any County; whence it may be gathered, that as to this point he intends for Authorities the Statutes of the 13 of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. which sets forth the Jurisdiction both of the Constables and Marshals Court, as also of the Court of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty.</p>
               <p>That concerning the Constable and Marshal, is as far from the purpose, as it was from Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> thought to give any addition of power to that Court. The Act declares, <hi>That to the Constable and Marshal it belongs to have Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusance of Contracts, and Deeds of Arms out of the Realm,</hi> whence it is inferred, that therefore out of the Realm, the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62270:65"/>
Admiral shall have no Conusance of Contracts, or matters concerning Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and Trade; It may be better argued from that Act, That as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament allowed to the Constable and Marshal, Jurisdiction in Causes of Arms, and Warr, arising both within and without the Realm, which cannot be determined by the Common Law, so it did intend Causes of Navigation and Trade arising either within or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Seas, to be tried by the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, The nature and the Quality of the business, more Conducing to the point of Jurisdiction, than the Circumstances of the place where it happens; The Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute which allows the Admiral to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with things done upon the Sea, by Sir <hi>Edward Cooks</hi> leave, doth not confine his Jurisdiction to the Sea, in respect of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The other Authorities which may be collected, to prove how the Admiral hath no Jurisdiction of things done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea, are a writ in the Register, and <hi>Fitz Herbert,</hi> and a number of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions.</p>
               <p>That of the Register is, If goods be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from an English-man in <hi>Spain</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Sea, and the party cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Justice there, he shall have a writ of the Sheriff to arest the Bodies of the offenders, and to seize their goods to the value, which proveth, saith Sir <hi>Edwar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the former, by them are intended cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Answers of the Chief Justice and other Judges of that Bench, to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests of the Judge of the Admiralty in the year 1575. of which mention is made in the complaint of the Admiral, 7. Object. wherein it is set forth, That the Agreement made in <hi>anno Domini</hi> 1575. between the Judges of the Kings Bench, and the Court of Admiralty, for the more quiet and certain Execution of Admiral Jurisdiction, was not observed, to which Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> answers, that that supposed agreement, had not been delivered unto them, but having heard the same read before his Majesty (out of a Paper not subscribed with the hand of any Judge) they answer, that for so much thereof as differs from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Answers, it was against the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, and therefore the Judges of the Kings Bench never as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented thereunto, as it is pretended, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth the phrase thereof agree with the Terms of the Laws of the Realm.</p>
               <p>It is not probable that Dr. <hi>Dunn</hi> then Judge of the Admiralty would have produced such an Agreement to the Judges before the King, but that he had
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62270:68"/>
some ground for the same, which being supposed, it may as well inferr that those Concessions were agreeable to the Laws and Statutes of the Realm, because those Judges did assent unto them, as that they did not assent because they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the same; And it may as well be doubted, whether those things wherein those Answers at that time did differ from the Resolutions of all the Judges in the 8. of King <hi>Charls,</hi>

<pb n="124" facs="tcp:62270:71"/>
that these resolutions of all the Judges touching the Jurisdiction of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, ought to be of no lower esteem, the rather for that the unanimity of all the Judges to the former, must be taken upon the credit alone of Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> but as to the latter, the Evidence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of doth appear by the joynt subscriptions of all before named, which is likewise attested by Sir <hi>George Crook,</hi> who was one of them, who in his reports of Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary term 8 <hi>Caroli,</hi> under the title of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions upon causes of Admiral Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, writes that it was agreed, as followeth.</p>
                  <p>First, if sute should be commenced in the Court of Admiralty, for Contracts or other things personally done beyond the Sea, no Prohibition is to be awar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if sute be before the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral for freight, or Mariners wages, or for breach of Charter-parties, for Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages to be made beyond the Seas, though the Charter-party happen to be made within the Realm, so as the Penalty be not demanded, a Prohibition is not to be granted; But if the sute be for penalty, or if question be made, whether the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62270:71"/>
Charter-party be made or no, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Plaintiff did release, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise discharge the same within the Realm, this is to be tried in the Kings Courts, and not in the Admiralty.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if sute be in the Admiralty, for building, amending, saving, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Victualling of a Ship, against the Ship it self, and not against any party by name, but such as for his interest makes himself a party, no Prohibition is to be granted, though this be done within the Realm.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, although of some causes arising upon the Thames beneath the Bridge, and divers other Rivers beneath the first Bridge, the Kings Courts have conusance, yet the Admiral also hath Jurisdiction there, in the point especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally mentioned in the Statute of 15. of <hi>Richard</hi> 2. and also by Exposition, and Equity thereof, he may enquire of, and redress all Annoyances, and Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are or may be any Impediment to Navigation, and passage to or from the Sea, and also to try personal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, and Injuries done there which concern Navigation on the Sea, and no Prohibition is to be granted in such ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:62270:72"/>Fifthly, if any be imprisoned and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>habeas Corpus</hi> brought, it be certified, that any of these be the cause of his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment, the party shall be remaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>Subscribed the 4. <hi>Feb.</hi> 1632. by all the Judges of both Benches.</p>
                  <p>Sir <hi>George Crooks</hi> Reports being pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by Sir <hi>Harbotle Grimston,</hi> are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and allowed as for the Common benefit, by the Judges then being, (viz.) by <hi>Iohn Glynn, Oliver St. Iohn, Edward Atkins, Robert Nicholas, Matthew Hales, Hugh Windham, Peter Warburton,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Parker.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may be presumed, that what so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny persons Eminent both for their place, and also for their knowledge of the Laws, and Statutes of the Realm, did so deliberately, and cautiously resolve upon, and others of like quality have countenanced, ought to be received, and respected as sufficient Authorities, as to those points whereof they did declare their Resolutions, notwithstanding the confident opinions of any others, either private, or singular persons, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: And that the Kings Majesty and his Councels approbation being added
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62270:72"/>
thereunto, should be of force enough to settle all doubts and differences concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the same, the rather, for that anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently (as before is shewed) the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> with their Councel only, have made Constitutions concerning the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, and that in point of Jurisdiction, and it is apparent by the ancient Record, cited both by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> That the most famous Prince, King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. (in whose time the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty received its chief establishment) in the 12. year of his Reign, did consult and advise with his Councel, and his Judges concerning the same; And it may seem strange,<note place="margin">

(whose Acts are insisted upon as the greatest obstructions to the Admirals Jurisdiction) the Kings Councel alone are enabled to decide, what belongs to the Constables and Marshals Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the King himself with his Councel, and Judges, should not have as much power to determine, what belongs to the Jurisdictions of his Admiral.</p>

                  </gap>ideration, how far the proceedings of the Courts and Judges of the Common Law, in intermedling with causes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to the Admiralty, and in obstructing the proceedings of that Court, may be justified; By the former, is intended their drawing of such causes by actions of Trover, and of Trespass, to their Conusance, by the later their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraging of Stipulations, and prescribing the forms of libells in such causes.</p>
               <p>The former may the rather be insisted upon, in regard Sir <hi>Edward Cook</hi> doth so
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:62270:73"/>
often, and so earnestly in general inveigh against the encroaching of the Court of Admiralty upon the businesses belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Courts of Common Law, and in particular where he chargeth, That in the blessed time of peace, those who belong to that Court, wanting businesses proper to that Jurisdiction, do encroach upon matters belonging to the Kings Courts, lest they should sit idle, and have nothing to do; the like practice of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching being far more unexcusable in those, who belong to the Kings Courts, which do alwayes abound with busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses sufficient for the same.</p>
               <p>Concerning the Actions of <hi>Trover.</hi> Amongst the grievances complained of by the Admiral, 8 <hi>Iacob.</hi> It is presented in the first place, That whereas the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusance of all Contract, and other things done on the Sea, belongeth to the Admirals Jurisdiction, the same are made triable at the Common Law, by supposing the same to have been done in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> or such places: And under favour, the answer thereunto is neither clear, nor direct, nor to the purpose; For the ground of that answer being laid, That the Admiral hath no Conusance of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62270:74"/>
any thing done within any County, it is said, That it is not material whether the place be upon the Water, <hi>Infra fluxum Aquae</hi>; but whether it be upon any water within the County; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is acknowledged, That of things done upon the Sea, out of any County, the Admiral ought to have Jurisdiction, and that no presidents can be shewed that any Prohibition hath been granted for any Contract, Plea, or Quarrel, for any Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritine cause done upon the Sea. In this Answer it is confest, That the Admiral ought to have Jurisdiction of things done on the Sea, and that no Prohibitions have been granted for any such causes; but whether by the supposal or fiction of a ships arriving in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> the Courts of Common Law do hold Plea of things done on the Sea, it is nether confessed, nor denied, much less is there any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son given for the same. Where it is said, It is not material whether the place be upon the water, <hi>infra fluxum &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxum Aquae,</hi> but whether it be upon any water within the County, That may be true, in respect that it is suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that all things done in the County belongs to the Conusance of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62270:74"/>
Law; but when the place where a thing is done belongs apparently to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Jurisdiction which pretends as well to the right of the place, as to the right of the cause, the place of the action can in no wayes be suppressed, and another suggested in the room thereof; for if that be permitted, the one Jurisdiction being the greater, a more potent may soon swallow up the other, not onely to the prejudice of the subjects for whose good the diversity of Courts were ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, but also the wrong of the Prince from whom those Jurisdictions are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Thomas Rydlye</hi> in his view of the Civil Laws, further shews how inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Admiralty, and unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this practice is, in regard that in Law no Fiction ought to be admitted, but such as is both possible, and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; First, That it ought to be Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, because otherwise it were to admit that by way of supposition, which nature will not alow; and therefore although one that is dead, to some constructions of Law, may be feigned to be alive, if at that time any of his equals in age be still living, yet one who dyed two hundred
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62270:75"/>
years since, cannot to any purpose be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be living, all of the same age being long before dead. Secondly, The Fiction ought to be Equitable, because if there be no reason for it, it is altogether unnecessary and useless; and therefore although the Law may admit a Fiction or supposition, that a childe in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers womb, is already born, for its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, in regard that otherwise it might be deprived of its filial portion, or some other right in equity belonging to it; yet where there is no such reason or equity, it ought not to be admitted, as vain and ridiculous; but for the fiction of a ship to arrive in <hi>wardo de cheap,</hi> where there is no water to bear or carry, is of a thing utterly impossible; and it is wholy void of equity, because a Trial of any business thereupon cannot obtain any just and fait remedy thereby at the Common Law, which might not have been had in the Court of Admiralty, which is a more competent and proper Court, for the trial of such things, than any Court of the Common Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Concerning Actions of Trespass, the Admiral in his ordinary capacity claiming no Jurisdiction of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62270:75"/>

                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62270:77"/>Secondly, concerning Libells in the Court of Admiralty, The Lord <hi>Hobard</hi> in <hi>Audly</hi> and <hi>Iennings</hi> case affirms, that if a Contract in truth were made at Sea, and in the Admirals Court it be laid generally, without saying <hi>super alto mari,</hi> a Prohibition might lye, for the Libel must warrant the sure in it self; But Justice <hi>Reeves</hi> in his Argument, <hi>Paschae</hi> 22. <hi>Garoli,</hi> differs from him in opinion, and distinguishes betwixt a particular Jurisdiction, created in diminution of the general Courts of Common Law, and a particular Jurisdiction over things that never did belong to the Courts of Common Law, but which is wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from the same: In the first case he confesseth that it is necessary to allege the cause of Action to arise within the new created Jurisdiction, because <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma facie,</hi> nay <hi>de Iure,</hi> the Courts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law have general Jurisdiction of those things, but in the later case, as of the Admiralty, if the cause be Maritime, there is no need to averr it to have been done upon the Sea, out of any respect to the Courts of Common Law, for that it doth not tend to the diminution of any of those Courts, and for Confirmation
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62270:78"/>
thereof he affirms, that the Jurisdiction of the Marshalsey, stands partly upon the Statute <hi>Articuli super Chartas,</hi> and the words of that Statute are as restrictive as any words of the Statutes touching the Admiralty, and by the books of the Common Laws, the Marshal cannot hold Plea in some cases unless both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be of the Kings Houshold, nor in any case unless one of the parties be so, yet it is resolved, that the Declaration is good, although it be not averred therein, that any of the parties be of the hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shold, and therefore a <hi>Fortiori</hi> it is not necessary in the Admiralty to specifie in the Libel the thing to have been done, <hi>super alto mari,</hi> the Admiralty Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being more distinct from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, than that of the Court of Marshalsey.</p>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62270:80"/>
causes concerning the Sea, Summarily and in a more compendious way than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Judges use; And the like, as Sir <hi>Iohn Davies</hi> relates, hath seemed to the wisdome of this Kingdome, <hi>Our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> saith He, <hi>have not only made extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary provisions, for a more speedy reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of debts due unto Merchants, for their Merchandizes, than is provided by our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, as appears by the Statute of</hi> Acton Burnel, <hi>made the</hi> 11. <hi>of</hi> Edward 1. <hi>and the Statute</hi> De Mercatoribus, <hi>made the</hi> 13. <hi>of</hi> Edward 1. <hi>but also hath allowed a Court of Proceedings in cases of Merchants, different from the course of our Common Law; For by the Statute of the</hi> 27. <hi>of</hi> Edw. 3. cap. 2. <hi>it is declared, That the proceedings in causes of Merchants shall be from day to day, and from hour to hour, according to the Law of the Staple, and not according to the course of the Common Law</hi>; and by another Article in the same Parliament, <hi>That all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants coming to the Staple shall be ruled by Law-merchant, touching all things coming to the Staple,</hi> and not by the <hi>Common Law of the Land</hi>; and by another Article, <hi>That neither any of the Benches, nor any of the Iudges of the Common Law shall have any Iurisdiction in those cases.</hi> To which may
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62270:80"/>
be added the Statute of 32 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. and of the 43 of <hi>Elizabeth, Chap.</hi> 12. which direct, <hi>That such causes betwixt Seamen and Merchants shall be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered summarily, and without delay, and as in discretion shall seem most convenient.</hi> All which was, and may be observed in the Court of the Admiralty, which in many causes proceed at any time, and in all causes summarily, and according to Equity, but neither is, nor can be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in Courts of Common Law, which are open onely in Term times, and proceed in an ordinary and strict way.</p>
               <p>Secondly, For the advantage of those who use Navigation, and Trade by Sea, The Law-merchant and Laws of the Sea admit of divers things not agreeable to the Common Law of the Realm, which may be better insisted on in the Court of Admiralty, than in the Courts of the Common Law. So much is likewise declared by Sir <hi>Iohn Davyes,</hi> relating se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral instances to that purpose. 1. <hi>If two Merchants, saith he, be joynt Owners, or Partners of Merchandizes, which they have acquired by a joynt Contract, the one shall have an Action of account against the
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62270:81"/>
other,</hi> Secundum Legem Mercatoriam, <hi>but by the Rule of the Common Law, if two men be joyntly seized of other goods, the one shall not call the other to account for the same.</hi> 2. <hi>If two Merchants have a joynt interest in Merchandizes, if one dye, the surviver shall not have all, but the Executor of the party deceased, shall by the Law-Merchant call the surviver to an account for the Moity, whereas by the Rule of the Common Law, if their be two joynt Tenants of other goods, the surviver</hi> Perjus accrescendi <hi>shall have all.</hi> 3. <hi>In an Action of Debt upon a simple Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> (which is without a Deed in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) <hi>the Defendant by the Common Law may wage his Law,</hi> That is, he may barr the Plaintiff from his Action, by taking an Oath that he doth not owe the Debt, <hi>but when one</hi> John Cumpton <hi>Merchant brought an Action of debt</hi> Secundum Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Mercatoriam <hi>against another Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant upon a Contract, without</hi> Deed, <hi>and the Defendant would have waged his Law, he was not permitted so to do,</hi> and the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was given for the Plaintiff. It is not hereby intended that the Courts of Common Law cannot or do not take notice of the Law-Merchant, in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants cases, but that other things like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62270:81"/>
considered, it might be thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable, if they so desire, to allow them the choice of that Court, where the Law-Merchant is more respected, than to confine them to other Courts, where another Law is more predominant. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, there may be danger of doubt thereof, because those things are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for proofs at the Common Law, which are held sufficient in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty amongst the Merchants; for as Sir <hi>Iohn Davies</hi> further observes, <hi>At the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law no mans Writing can be pleaded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, as his Act, and Deed, unless the same be sealed, and delivered: But in sutes between Merchants, Bills of Lading, and Bills of Exchange, being but ticquets, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Seals, Letters of advice, and Credence, Policies of assurance, Assignations of Debts, all which are of no force at the Common Law, are of good credit and force by the Law-Merchant.</hi> To which may be added, what <hi>Malines</hi> observes, That the bearer of such Bills, by the course amongst Merchants, shall be admitted to demand, and recover the Contracts, without Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Atturney, which is not admitted in the Common Law. It is moreover considerable, That the Law of the Sea
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62270:82"/>
looks one way, when the Common Law looks another; As for instance, A Ship is Freighted, or hired for a Voyage to the Indies, at 20 l. per moneth by Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-party, it appeareth that having been eight Moneths in the Imployment of the Merchant, who Freighted her, before she makes any Port, with her Lading she perisheth in the Sea, in this case by the Common Law, as it hath been averred, the Owner of the Ship ought to have Freight for eight Moneths: but by the Law of the Sea, which hath alwayes been allowed, The Merchant losing his goods, the Owner loseth his Freight; A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if the Owner loseth his Freight, the Mariner, although he escape, loseth his Wages, for the time he served, which happily would not be thought so if he sued at the <hi>Guild-Hall</hi> for the same.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, for encouragement and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of those who use Navigation and Trade by Sea, it is considerable, That in the Court of Admiralty, one and the same Action may be brought against diverse and several persons, undertaking the same business, as when many joyn in subscription to a Policy of assurance, but if a sute be brought at the Common
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62270:82"/>
Law, every man must be sued severally, which the Parliament in the Act concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning assurances, held inconvenient; and in the like manner, divers and several Persons may joyn in the same sute, as Mariners for wages, at a small charge to themselves, with little prejudice to the Masters, or Owners which are sued, and obtain a Decree or Order all together, whereas when they sue at the <hi>Guild-Hall,</hi> every man sues severally, to the great charge of every particular, and to the excessive dammage of the Masters, or Owners, if Judgements be given a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, Besides the inconvenience (of which the Statute of the 28. of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. takes notice) That if Mariners or Shippers, which by reason of their often Voyages and Passages must depart, without long tarrying and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting of time, be enforced to attend the ordinary terms of the Common Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Court of Admiralty for the conveniency and dispatch of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and Sea-mens causes, admits of proofs, which the Courts of Common Law do not allow, for in that Court ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Civil Law, the Plaintiff
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:62270:83"/>
may be relieved by the Defendants an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, upon Oath, which in the ordinary Courts of the Common Law is not affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; Again, whereas in those Courts the Evidence must be produced at the Barr, before the Jury, Sea-men, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners, which are many times necessary witnesses, for the reason before exprest, cannot be present without great preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to themselves and the Trade of the Kingdome; But in the Admiralty Court they may be produc'd at any time, after the sute is begun, and their Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being taken in Writing, they have liberty to follow their own, and the common occasions. Moreover, many times in causes concerning Navigation, and Trade by Sea, no proof can be made, but by Witnesses remaining in Forein parts, to which the Writs of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law do not extend, but those Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses by Commission out of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty Court, are usually sworn and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined by Magistrates in those places, and their examinations so taken are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for sufficient proof upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
               <p>Divers other instances might be given, by which it would appear that the Court
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62270:83"/>
of Admiralty can give redress in Sutes concerning Navigation and Trade with more conveniency than the Courts of Common Law; but these considered, and how much it concerns the good of the Kingdome, and those who s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pport Navigation and Trade, may be sufficient to discover, which Court may be best justified in proceeding in causes of that nature.</p>
               <p>What inconvenience may follow both to the Private and Publick by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing of the Courts of Common Law, and by obstructions made unto the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty in such businesses, may appear in one particular, that is concerning Charter-parties and Freight due for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of shipping. There is but one instance given of a Sute brought at the Common Law upon a Charter-party, <hi>viz.</hi> the 28 of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> which was on the Merchants part for breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, <hi>viz.</hi> for not staying in a Port of discharge so many dayes as were agreed upon, for which the Owner was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in 500 l. without any respect to the Loss or Damage which the Merchant had sustained: And if it be considered how many clauses there are in Charter-parties,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62270:84"/>
and Covenants of things to be performed for which the Owners are bound under a general penalty, if upon every breach advantage should be taken in extremity, no man would have great comfort in hiring out Ships to the Sea: And it may be observed, that there is no President that ever any man sued for Freight at the Common Law, which ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues much difficulty in that way, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the performance of the Voyage being to be maintained by such proofs as cannot be produced in those Courts. And whereas it is affirmed, That infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Prohibitions have been granted in causes commenced in the Admiralty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Charter-parties, it must follow, that thereby was occasioned infinite loss to the Owners of the Shipping, it being most probable by what hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, That the cause for Freight being stopped in the Admiralty, there was no means to recover the same in the Courts of the Common Law. For that is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule, That that Merchant which declines that Court knows he is in no danger elsewhere; and it falls out ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, That for long Voyages great summs are due for Freight, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62270:84"/>
not alwayes having good success, are sometimes put to their shifts, but how far it stands with the dignity of the High Courts to countenance, or in truth afford protection to such shifts, we leave them to consider, but no man can conceive other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, than that those courses must needs more weaken the Shipping of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, than divers Ordinances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions intended for the maintenance thereof can possibly advance the same. Besides the decay of Shipping, these things conduce to the impoverishing of Mariners who are the life of Shipping, for Freight is said to be the mother of wages, and the Owner losing his Freight, the Mariner cannot so well obtain his wages, and in consequence must betake himself to some other course of life.</p>
               <p>The like inconvenience falls out in Trade and Commerce, when Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are granted for Contracts, or things done <hi>in partibus exteris &amp; transmarinis,</hi> The Merchant if he can avoid the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty where he must answer upon Oath, and proof may be made by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, thinks himself secure from any danger at the Common Law. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may be supposed that remedy
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62270:85"/>
may be given in the Chancery, yet how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is possible it is not usual for that Court to send Commissions into Forein parts, and the pretence is for the right of Jurisdiction in the Kings Courts of the Common Law, without respect to the Chancery, to which sir <hi>Ed. Cook</hi> seems to be no great friend.</p>
