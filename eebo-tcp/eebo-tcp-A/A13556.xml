            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

godly Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hat Mr. <hi>Luther</hi>
in his last Sermon
at <hi>Wittenberg</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolde,
we see in these
our dayes fully performed and
accomplished: hee had observed
thirty severall sects, and secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
raised up by Satan in his
time against that holy doctrine
preached by himselfe; all which
had hee not beene able by the
Scriptures to have resisted, and
refuted, he must have beene (as
himselfe said) of thirty severall
religions. Among them he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth
the <hi>Anabaptists, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomists,
Libertines, Servitians,</hi>
&amp;c. of all whom he foretold, that
<pb facs="tcp:18870:3"/>
though now they (saith hee) by
the power of the word, and by the
vigilancy of godly teachers lye
close and still; yet will they be
intent, and ready on all occasions
to rise, and raise up their dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
errours to disturbe the
peace of the Church, and the
prosperity of the Gospel. And
indeede accordingly have we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
the Church of God in all
times since, lesse or more infested
with these dangerous sectaries,
I meane the <hi>Libertines,</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
enemies to the Law of
God, and to the holy obedience of
it. Against whom as St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
in his time wrote two books
<hi>against the Adversaries of the
Law:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Contra Legis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarios.</note> so Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> dealt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily
in his time, in his booke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled,<note place="margin">Adversus furiosam sectam Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</note>
               <hi>Against the furious sect
of the Libertines:</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
godly men since that time.
Let not us be offended that the
spawne and succession of those
lewd libertine sectaries are now
<pb facs="tcp:18870:3"/>
issued forth in troopes amongst
us,<note place="margin">Nemo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur aut consterne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur cum tam inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litos, &amp; ab omni rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res cernas: Calv.</note> nor marvaile that the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
of Gods most righteous
Law prevaileth amongst a rude
multitude, the <hi>sonnes of Belial;</hi>
whom Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> calleth a
<hi>prodigious</hi> and <hi>belluine</hi> sect,
furious and madded in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
and fierce as unbroken
coltes against whosoever would
curbe them, and straiten the
reines of their unbridled licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousnesse.
But rather let us
observe, 1. Satans malice in
sowing tares where good seede
was sowne, and that in the Lords
field. 2. Gods just permission of
so many schismes as <hi>tares</hi> rising
with the graine; and therein re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
the contempt and diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of his word, he hath
sent strong delusions, that many
should <hi>believe lies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Thes: 2.</note> 
               <hi>who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
not the truth in the love
of it.</hi> 3. The levity, wantonnes,
and instability of unsetled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spellers,
that are in every new
<pb facs="tcp:18870:4"/>
fashion of opinion, with every new
man that hath the tricke of mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
novell conceits against re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
truthes; that if thirty
new-minted fansies should rise
up in their age, they were like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be of thirty religions,
and of every last praise God, that
the truth was never truly prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
till now. 4. Let us excite
our selves to the love of truth,
to the hatred of errour, and to
the fencing of our selves against
seducers; importuning in seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
invocation the God of truth,
not to punish our wantonnesse in
profession, with <hi>taking the
word of truth utterly from us:</hi>
and thus shall we temper poyson
to a remedy,<note place="margin">Quod ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stis machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natur in perniciem, convertit Deus in adiutori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um: Aug: Epist: ad Sextum 105.</note> and turne that to
an help which the enemy intends
for our hurt. For the setling of
mine owne people (some of them
looking that way) I delivered
lately some grounds, both to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
the rule of the Law upon
the regenerate, as also to refute
<pb facs="tcp:18870:4"/>
the contrary errour of our new
audacious Antinomists, and
Libertines, and Famelists, who
as the olde <hi>Manichees</hi> and <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionists,</hi>
abolish the <hi>whole Law,</hi>
and that <hi>wholly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One preacheth, that <hi>the whole
Law since Christs death is
wholly abrogated, and abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Another, that <hi>the whole
Law was fulfilled by Christ
1600 yeares agoe, and we have
nothing to doe with that.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
that to <hi>teach obedience
to the Law of God, is to teach
popery, and to leade men into a
dead faith.</hi> Another, that <hi>to
doe any thing because God
commands us, or to forbeare
any thing because God forbids
us, is a signe of a morall man,
and of a dead and unsound
Christian.</hi> And upon these hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and deceitfull grounds doe
these masters of errour bottome
a number other ridiculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits,
which yet they deliver as
<pb facs="tcp:18870:5"/>
oracles, and anathematize who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall not so receive them.
As 1. That the Law being abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to the justified, <hi>God can
see no sinne in them;</hi> for hee
can see no Law transgressed.
2. <hi>That the regenerate cannot
sinne;</hi> for where is no Law, is no
transgression: according to that
Luciferian principle rife among
them, <hi>Be in Christ, and sinne if
thou canst.</hi> 3. That being in
Christ, they are <hi>Christed with
Christ,</hi> as pure as Christ, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
as Christ, as farre beyond
the Law as Christ himselfe: the
right brood and spawne of the
olde <hi>Catharists</hi> and <hi>Puritans.</hi>
4. That the Law is not to bee
taught in the Church, and they
are legall Preachers that doe
so, and preach not Christ. 5. They
hence disclaime all obedience to
the Law, and raile at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
and practise of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as good for nothing, but to
carry men to hell; and cry out
<pb facs="tcp:18870:5"/>
on the Ministers as Popish, and
as <hi>having Monks in their bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi>
who set men on working, and
doing, and walking holily. 6.
They renounce and reject all
humility, confession and sorrow
for sinne, they scorne fasting and
prayer, as the seeking not of God,
but of our selves. One saith, that
<hi>neither our omissions, nor
commissions should grieve us:</hi>
and another, <hi>Neither doe my
good deedes rejoyce mee, nor
my bad deedes grieve mee.</hi>
They deride and flout the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
of repentance and mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and upbraid such as walke
humbly before God. What say
they? <hi>Will you repent all your
dayes?</hi> and, <hi>You cannot sinne,
but you must repent an whole
fortnight after.</hi> Nay they are
set upon so merry a pin, as they
can thinke of their former sinnes
with merriment. <hi>I am glad of
my sinne</hi> (saith one) <hi>because
it hath drawne me to Christ:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:18870:6"/>
and why doest thou not mourne
that by those sinnes thou hast
pierced Christ? 7. They reject
the Saboth as Iewish wholly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated
with all other comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements;
as one of them profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
that <hi>were it not for offence
of men, he would labour in his
calling on that day as well as
any other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These with many other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequents
of the same stampe, all
tending to loose the conscience
from all awe of God, from all care
of duty, from all feare of sinne,
and judgement to come, (though
they walke in all licentiousnesse,
and prodigious courses) are such
as a right bred Christian cannot
but tremble at; and were there
but a few droppes of modest blood
in their veines, the Masters of
such lewd and libertine opinions
could not but blush at: who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
answer before God (without

               </gap>ling of simple

men (and women especially) into
such desperate wayes.</p>
            <p>My intention being onely to
propound the grounds of naked
truth, (which as a right line is
the rule of it selfe, and of that
which is crooked) and that to
my owne, in my owne plaine and
ordinary manner; it was farre
from my thought to make my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
more publicke, till partly
the scorne and insolency of these
schismaticall spirits on the one
hand, and partly the importunity
of many godly both Ministers
and private persons thrust mee
into a second survey, and review
of what I had delivered. They
said they knew some drawne off
their opinions by hearing the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
preached; and doubted not
but if it were made more pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke,
it would be much more
usefull to the Church, especially
seeing these seducers creepe into
such corners of the Citty and
Country, where are weakest
<pb facs="tcp:18870:7"/>
meanes of resistance, whose stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
hopes and holdes lie in the
ignorance and too credulous sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of their proselites. I
made many objections to my self,
some to them: I knew this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
soundly and judicially
handled already by others; that
it might more profitably and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
be undertaken by some
other better furnished with gifts
and leisure: how little I could
expect the satisfaction of others
in an argument of this moment,
who in the throng of businesse,
and burden of many weekly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises,
could scarce gaine
thoughts or time to satisfie my
selfe: How unsafe to thrust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a publicke quarrell: how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune
and <hi>lawles</hi> the adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
who holde not themselves
countable to God, for any wrong
they doe unto man. But yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suaded
to deny my selfe for the
service of God and his Church,
and that the seasonablenesse of
<pb facs="tcp:18870:7"/>
the treatise might adde an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
unto it, and that it
might be some stay to the teacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
untill a more elaborate, and
compleate worke might by some
other be prepared: I yeelded unto
the publication of that little
which I had done; animating my
selfe with the same arguments
that wise and prudent Generalls
use to encourage and hearten
their souldiers withall, when
they are to joyne issue with the
approaching enemy: and they
be foure. 1. The goodnesse and
<hi>justice of the cause,</hi> which is
just, and honourable; for we take
part with God, and fight his bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
in the quarrell of his most
righteous Law. 2. The <hi>victory
is easie and certaine,</hi> unlesse God
and his Law can be conquered:
and who ever rose up against God
and prospered? 3. <hi>The quality
of the adversaries</hi> must adde
courage unto us, Christians in
name, but siding, and sorting
<pb facs="tcp:18870:8"/>
with the damnable heretickes of
ancient times: of whom I will
not speake what they are worthy
to heare, but what I may with
judgement write, and whom the
sequell discourse will shew to be
of proud, furious, and audacious
spirits. 4. <hi>The assurance of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
assistance:</hi> for are the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries
such? certainly then
is their strength gone: God's spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
is gone from them, for he <hi>tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
the humble,</hi> and sendeth
the proud empty away. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
the <hi>spirit,</hi> and outboast all
men, that they are taught, and
led, and moved by the <hi>spirit,</hi> and
are past all motives and persua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of man or meanes: but God's
spirit is a soft, sober, calme and
quiet spirit, both in Christ the
head, and in all his members:
and that furious, factious, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
and quarrelsome spirit of
theirs,<note place="margin">Deus ecce furentibus obstat.</note> is that uncleane spirit of
Satan, usually breathed into he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tickes
and enemies of the truth,
and of the spirit of truth: by
<pb facs="tcp:18870:8"/>
whose onely assistance wee shall
shape them (not as they say in
scorne, a garment after our owne
fashion) but such an answer out
of the Scriptures, as shall not
hide their nakednesse, but unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
their ignorance, emptinesse
and folly, and vindicate the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Law of God from their schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall
cavills, and hereticall
contempt. And why not? For
doe we exclaime against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
for blotting out the second
commandement, as sacrilegious
persons? and against the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptists
for denying the fifth? and
shall we be silent at these secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
whose blindnesse hath made
them bolde to blot out all the ten
at once? which although they
were writen with God's owne
finger, and that in tables of stone,
yet these mad men presume their
nailes so steeled, as that they can
scratch them out all at once, and
yet God see no sin in them. I shall
speake unto them all along the
<pb facs="tcp:18870:9"/>
Treatise; and now will onely
desire of them, or rather of God
for them these two things: <hi>First,</hi>
that my reproofe may be a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
unto them; at least if it be
conceived a wound, yet not of an
enemy, but of one that out of
love desireth to leave them a testimony
of faithfulnesse: and the
other is,<note place="margin">Optimus portus poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiae mutatio consilii: Cic: Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> that the Lord would
worke in them a timely change
both of opinion &amp; practise; so as
they may no longer <hi>turne the
grace of God into wantonnesse</hi>
and liberty, but get out of this
snare of the Divel, wherein they
are held to doe his will, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to you that are desirous
to walke in the olde and good
way, and are not yet infected
with this spreading gangrene of
licentiousnesse, I shall be bolde to
give some advise for prevention.
As 1. To looke carefully to your
<pb facs="tcp:18870:9"/>
precious soules, which Satan ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
wayes beleaguereth: let not
pretences of faith in Christ loose
you from duty towards God;
catch not at ease, or presposterous
and overtimely comforts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the impostour hath you at ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.
2. Looke well to your
estates, and outward meanes, lest
these impostours make a prey,
and advantage on you, as they
have done on some already, who
have confessed that these pedlars
have basely inveagled from them
even to the very cushions of their
windowes: for the Apostle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
not in vain, that <hi>through
covetousnesse they make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise
of unwary soules.</hi> 3.
Suspect such men as come with
a strange language, and unwon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
phrases and manner of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king:<note place="margin">Etiam lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendum cum Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia recte sentiente: Cyprian:</note>

one of the first principles of their
cousening trade. Surely the
Ministery of Christ, and his
Apostles, and of all godly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
is to <hi>cast off all cloakes of
shame, and to walke not in
craftinesse, neither to handle
the word of God deceitfully;
but in declaration of the truth,
to approve themselves to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <note place="margin">1 Cor: 14. 9</note> 4. Nourish the grace of

of opinions, have opened a

are ready with <hi>Salomons foole

I endeavour to establish others,
I may seeme to forget my selfe,
and that I must incurre many
censures and contempts from
this lawlesse generation of men;
but my labour is with the Lord,
<pb facs="tcp:18870:11"/>
and my reward is my conscience
of well-doing: I shall contemne
their contempt, love their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
hate their errours, and
studie while I am, to be
as serviceable to the
Church, and the
faith once given
to the Saints,
as I can.</p>

out of Rom. 6. 14.
For ye are not under the

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the words of the
Apostle are to be
enquired, 1. What
is meant by the
<hi>Law:</hi> namely, The
Morall Law in the ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
containing our
whole duty to God, and to our
neighbour. 2. What it is to be
<hi>under the Law:</hi> namely, not
under the rule and obedience of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18870:13"/>
the Law, for our Apostle loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
no Christian from that;
but Christians are not under
the raigne of the Law, by the
raigne of which, sinne raigneth
unto death. This being the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
reason, that the raigne
of the Law, puts them under
the reign of sin. 3. Who are
these that are not under the
Law? <hi>Yee:</hi> that is, beleevers,
justified and sanctified persons,
that are <hi>dead to sinne, and alive
unto God in Iesus Christ our
Lord,</hi> verse 11. and onely these,
seeing the naturall man is yet in
his sinnes, and under the whole
power of the Law in the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and extremity of it. <hi>Rom:
7. 6. We are delivered from the

God in a new spirituall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,

to the externall letter of
the law, which onely breedeth
externall actions. And that it
is the priviledge of beleevers
appeareth by these reasons.<note place="margin">4 Reasons.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. Because Christ was <hi>made
under the Law, to redeeme those
that were under the Law, that
we might receive the adoption of
sonnes, Galat.</hi> 4. 4. The reason
is good; Christ was under
the Law, therefore Christians
beleeving are not under it; and,
Christians are redeemed from
being under the Law, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
are no longer under it.</p>
            <p>2. As many as are under the
Law,<note place="margin">Gal. 3. 10.</note> are under the curse. <hi>But
it is the priviledge of belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
not to be under the curse;
for</hi> they that are of the faith of
Abraham, are blessed with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Abraham. <hi>Therefore they
are not under the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:18870:14"/>
3. <hi>It is the priviledge of
beleevers, to receive the
spirit of Christ.</hi> Rom. 8. 14.
As many as are Christs, are
led by the spirit of Christ: <hi>and
therfore they are not under the
Law.</hi> Gal. 5. 18. If yee be led by
the spirit, yee are not under the
law.</p>
            <p>4. It is the priviledge of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers
to have eternall life, and
the inheritance, by promise, and
not by the tenour of the Law;
and therefore all they, and only
they are free from being under
the Law. <hi>Gal. 3. 18. If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
be by the Law, it is no
more by promise. But God gave
it to Abraham by the promise.</hi>
Were beleevers under the
Law, they should have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
by the Law: but they
have it not by the Law, but by
promise; and therefore are not
under the Law. For the Law
and the promise in the cause of
righteousnesse, and life, will not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:18870:14"/>
be agreed, no more than light
and darknesse, fire and water,
whose natures are most abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> But what or where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
is this priviledge of not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under the Law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> This priviledge will
appeare the clearer, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
the danger of being under
the Law,<note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under the Law, in 4 things</note> in foure things. First,
in that the Law wrappeth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
sinner in the curse of God,
both in this life, as also in the
life to come; so as hee is no
where secure, but lyeth naked
to the curse meeting him at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
corner. The Law is a thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt
to blast him in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
in his estate, in his name, in
his goods, in his calling, in his
comforts, in all his enterprises,
and occasions; the sentence is
passed upon him, and where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he is, hee is in the way to
execution. It would daunt, and
astonish the hardiest, and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niest
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18870:15"/>
heart, to heare the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of death pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it for violating the law of
his Prince and Country. It
would marre all his merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to conceive hee were
presently to suffer but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
death for offending the law
of man. And it would much
more spoyle the pleasure of sin,
if the sinner could with an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
eare, heare the sentence of
eternall death denounced by
the Law, against soule and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
for violating the righteous
Law of the eternall God. If an
house were ready to fall upon
a mans head, how would hee
bestirre himselfe, and winde
every way to hye himselfe out
of the danger. But the burden
of the Law is more intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
than the weight of all the
sands, and mountaines in the
world; and this oppressing
weight is ready to fall on the
head of every sinner: which
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:18870:15"/>
how should it amaze, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright
them, and make them
restlesse, till they bee gotten
without the reach of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>2. The Law in the raigne of
it shuts up heaven, (which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives
no trangressour) and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
the gate of hell wide open
upon the sinner; and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
casteth him into hell hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
but bringeth an hell into his
conscience before hell; that if
his heart be not dead within
him as <hi>Nabals,</hi> it is restlesse
as the raging sea, tormenting
him for the present with hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
feares, dreadfull horrours,
and selfe-accusing; the biting
and gnawing of which worme
is the very entrance into hell,
and a beginning of the eternall
torments of it: for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
whereof many wicked
men have chosen death, and
hastned their owne execution,
as farre more sufferable and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:18870:16"/>
3. The Law in the raigne of
it, thrusts the sinner under the
power of the Divell, as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
malefactour into the
hand of the executioner, to be
ruled at his will. Now must
hee blinde his eyes, and as it
were by an handkerchiefe over
his eyes, hee must pinion him,
and binde him hand and foote,
and by effectuall delusions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
him to his death. And
what is more just, than that
he who will not be led by the
spirit of God, should be given
up to be ruled by the Divell.</p>
            <p>4. The Law in the raigne of
it, addeth a sting, and sharpneth
the point of all afflictions,
which by it become the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of hell, and properly cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses;
retaining their naturall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimony
and poyson; and are as
the red sea, even a well, and a
devouring gulfe to drowne the
Egyptians, which same sea is
a wall and paved way to save
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18870:16"/>
the Israelites. It armeth all
Gods creatures against the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
who are ready in their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
rankes to revenge their
Lords quarrell, till he enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
that new covenant; of which
see <hi>Hosea</hi> 2. 18. It is the Law
that makes death a doore to
hell, and a downefall to eternall
perdition: the Law is merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse,
and knoweth no other
condition, but <hi>doe</hi> or <hi>die:</hi> so as
if a man dye under the Law,
there is no expectation but of
death without mercy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. But how may a
man get from under this dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
estate?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By the attaining and
exercise of three saving graces.<note place="margin">How a man may get from under this dangerous state.</note>
First, <hi>Faith</hi> in the Son of God;
which 1 apprehendeth Christs
righteousnesse for the fulfilling
of the Law. 2. <hi>Faith</hi> establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Law; both because it at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth
in Christ <hi>Remission</hi> of
sinnes, and so remission of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:18870:17"/>
rigour of the Law, as also an
<hi>Imputation</hi> of that full righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
which the Law requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
3. <hi>Faith</hi> is the Law of
Christ, by obedience of which
Law every beleever must live,<note place="margin">Habak. 2. 4.</note>
and is answerable to the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of the whole Law.</p>
            <p>The second grace is <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi>
and timely turning unto
God; this helpeth a man from
under this danger. 1. In that it
flyeth from the dreadfull sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the Law, and knock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
at the gate of mercy; it seeks
and sues for pardon, and will
not give over, till it have got a
gracious answer, that all the
sins are remitted. 2. In that it
wipes off all old scores, repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
all the actions of the Law,
getteth all sinnes cast into the
bottome of the sea, never to be
remembred any more: nay it

which is a kinde of fulfilling it.
For 1. It is a worke of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the regenerate, who hath
written the law in their hearts,
and made them of rebells and
enemies to the Law, and the
righteousnes of it, lovers of the
Law, and lovers of obedience.
2. It hath the promise of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,
and is accounted as
full and compleat obedience to
the Law: and themselves now
called perfect and undefiled in
the way. God looketh not now
on their obedience as theirs,
but as on his owne worke in
them, nor approveth the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for the work, but the work
for the person.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:18870:18"/>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> By sundry notes or
markes.<note place="margin">Sixe notes of tryall, to know one gotten fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> under the danger of the Law.</note> First, by <hi>subjection to
the Gospel</hi> in the power of it;
when a man contenteth not
himselfe with a title of faith,
or a shew of profession, or a
forme of godlinesse, or a name
that he liveth; but groweth in
the knowledge and obedience
of the Gospell: for would a
man be saved, and obey neither
the Law nor Gospell? No, no,
the Apostle concludeth him
under the whole power of the
Law, that <hi>knoweth not, nor obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the Gospel of Christ, 2 Thes:
1.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>2. By <hi>thankefull walking wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of the Gospel:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> this man
knoweth that all the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
are <hi>Gods workmanship;</hi> and
that the end of all our free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from sinne, is the free
and cheerefull praise of God:
and therefore he cannot but be
thankfull to Christ his delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
from under so hard and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:18870:18"/>
cruell a Master as the Law,
which did nothing but accuse,
accurse, terrify and condemne
him: now will he highly prize
his freedome, and glory in his
happy liberty: now will he live
to Christ, and for Christ; and
ascribe all his happinesse unto
him, as doth the Apostle for
that happy victory over sinne
and the Law, 1 <hi>Cor: 15. last:</hi>
and <hi>Rom:</hi> 7. 24, 25.</p>
            <p>3. There is now <hi>peace of
conscience,</hi> which formerly (if
waking) did bite and sting; but
now excuseth and acquitteth.
I meane not here a sencelesse or
brawny conscience, the issue of
a dead conscience; which like
a dead man, lay him under a
Church or mountaine, he is
quiet, feeleth nothing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
of nothing: so lay the
secure sinner under the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
burden of innumerable
sinnes, his conscience is quiet,
and complaineth not. But this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:18870:19"/>
peace followeth not from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feelingnesse,
but from feeling
sin pardoned, from perceiving
sin subdued, and from discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
sinne repented of, striven
against and conquered: for the
spirit of grace is ever a spirit
of mourning, and from that
sowing in teares ariseth the
harvest of joy.</p>
            <p>4. Hee that is got from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law is now a Law to
himselfe, that is, he willingly
submitteth himselfe to the rule
and obedience of the Law: the
way to escape the yoake and
coaction of the Law is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a free and cheerfull ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server
of the Law. Which
standeth in three things. 1. In
a care to doe the duties which
the Law requireth, and in such
manner as the Law doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
so neare as we can, <hi>Psal:
119. 6. Rom:</hi> 7. 22. 2. In hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humility
and griefe that we are
so short of the Law in our best
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:18870:19"/>
duties; that when wee have
done all we can, we are so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
and that even all our
righteousnesse is as a stained
clout. 3. And all this out of
love of God, and of obedience,
not for feare of hell or judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
whence Gods people
are called <hi>a willing people. Psal:
110.</hi> 4.</p>
            <p>This must every beleever
aime at; for hee that willingly
liveth in the breach of the Law
is certainly under the curse of
it.</p>
            <p>5. A man gotten from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, giveth up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
to the leading of the spirit:
<hi>Gal: 5. 18. If yee be led by the
spirit, yee are not under the
Law.</hi> Now to be led by the
spirit is, 1. To suffer the spirit
of God to guide the minde,
with knowledge, for he being
the spirit of illumination, his
office is to lead the Saints into
all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uth. 2. To allow him to
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:18870:20"/>
carry and order the heart, will,
and affections with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and constancy in all good
duties, whence hee is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a free spirit, not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he worketh in himselfe
freely, and as the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
where he will; but from
his powerfull effect in the
Saints, who by his strong and
mighty gales are caried strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in their motions of grace
and obedience. This finde and
challendge thy freedome from
under the Law. But if the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
that rules in the world
guide the course, or Satan car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
a man into the foule lusts of
uncleannesse, worldlinesse, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuousnesse,
malice, or the
like, as the swine into the lake;
this man is under the whole
curse and raigne of the Law,
because he is under the power
and reigne of his sinne.</p>
            <p>6. There is joy and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
for others freedome as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:18870:20"/>
for a mans owne: he that is
truly converted is unfeignedly
glad for the worke of Gods
grace in others, <hi>Rom. 6. 17. God
be thanked that yee have beene
the servants of sinne, but now ye
have obeyed the forme of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
&amp;c. Eph. 1. 5. Phil.</hi> 1. 5.
A godly Pastour with <hi>Paul</hi>
wisheth all as himselfe, except
his bonds. A godly parent will
<hi>rejoyce to see his children to walk
in the truth.</hi> A father or hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
cannot content himselfe
with his owne safety from a
deadly danger, and see his wife
and children left in it still. A
godly Master as <hi>Ioshua</hi> will
have all his house serve the
Lord with himselfe, and will
not endure in his family, a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
servant, a vassall, and slave
to the Divell, and sinne; but
will pull him out of the fire or
water, or turne him out of
doores: yea every sinner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
himselfe, wil strengthen
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:18870:21"/>
the brethren, as <hi>Peter,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
Psal:</hi> 51. 13. By these notes
may a man try and discerne
whether he be yet under the
Law or not.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>HAving shewed that it is
the priviledge of justified
persons not to be under the

place to limit this proposition
of the Apostle within his own
bounds; which ancient bounds
while our Libertines remove
or break downe, they open a

and licentiousnes, both of

            <p>For the right understanding

of our Apostles meaning, we
must consider the Law two

or appendices be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
unto it.</p>
            <p>The substance of the Law
standeth in five things.<note place="margin">The sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Law in 5 things.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. The Law in the substance
of it,<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 89.</note> is an <hi>eternall</hi> doctrine,
shewing what is good, what is
evill, never changed, never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished,
never abrogated, (no
not by Christ) but is as a beame
from an eternall Sunne; and the
Sunne being eternall, how can
the beame but be so also? and
thus beleevers are still under
the teaching of it; without
which no man can know what
God is, nor what is his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
nor what is the manner
of his worshipp, nor what
duties wee are to performe,
nor how to performe them,
either to himselfe, or to our
brethren.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:18870:22"/>
2. The law in the substance
of it, is a revealer of sinne. <hi>Rom.
3. 19. By the Law commeth the
knowledge of sinne;</hi> and every
sinner, yea even beleevers are
still under the rebuke of it, so
long as in many things they
offend all, and stand in need of
the Law, both to worke them
to humility and repentance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
new sinnes committed, to
worke them to a feare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
awe of God, and to
drive them out of themselves
unto Christ, for recovery out
of their daily infirmities; for
were there no law, there were
no transgression, nor discovery
of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15.</p>
            <p>3. The Law in the substance
of it is a rule of good life, and
as the Gospell teacheth <hi>how to
beleeve,</hi> so the Law teacheth
<hi>how to live:</hi> the Law is as the
touchstone to try what is gold
in us, and what is drosse; it is
as the line and plummet to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:18870:22"/>
shew what is straight, and
what is crooked: and thus is
under the direction of it both
for matter and manner of all
actions which please or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please
God. For as the Law
civill is the rule of civill life, so
Gods Law is the rule of godly
life: and as a good workman
that is Master of his trade, will
have his rule ever at his back,
or in his hand, to measure eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
peece of his worke, that it
may stand levell and square; so
even the beleever hath as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
need of the rule of the
Law, which (the Apostle saith)
is <hi>profitable for doctrine, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
reproofe and institution
even of the man of God.</hi> 2 Tim.
3. 17.</p>
            <p>4. The Law in the substance
is the expresse idea or represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Law of nature
written in our hearts in the
time and state of innocency, and
the naturall principles of it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:18870:23"/>
be quite extinct, or shaken
out of the heart of the worst
man; for the very Heathens
had it written in their hearts,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15. and much lesse can
it be shaken out of the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
in whom it is renewed
and rewritten in their spirits
by the finger of Gods spirit,
<hi>Ier.</hi> 31. 33. Nay the beleever
cannot chuse but be framed to
a cheerefull and spirituall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
of it, so long as the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
performeth that office in
them.</p>
            <p>5. The Law in the substance
of it, promiseth a righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and eternall life to all the
performers of it: and no belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
expecteth another righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes,
nor another life, nor on
any other condition, than the
same in the Law; onely in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
manner and meanes the
same life must be attained, by
our ful performa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the law,
though not in our selves, but
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:18870:23"/>
in our surety; and by the same
righteousnes, not inherent in
us,<note place="margin">The belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the whole sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the Law.</note> but imputed unto us. So as
by this former consideration
we see that the <hi>beleever is still
under the whole substance of the
Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now in the second place
seeing the justified person is
so many wayes under the Law,
how saith the Apostle that the
beleevers are not under it? To
resolve which point, we must
now consider the circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and appendices of the Law,
which make it an heavie yoak,<note place="margin">Seven ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendices of the Law, in none of which the beleever is under the Law.</note>
an intollerable, and insuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
burden, in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the beleever is not under it.
These appendices of the Law
are seaven.</p>
            <p>First, one consequent of the
Law is, that it yoaketh every
man to a personall performance
of it; for himselfe must doe all
things that are written in the
Law, to live in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:18870:24"/>
And this is now an <hi>impossible
obedience,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 3.</note> 
               <hi>because of our flesh.</hi>
But Christ having perfectly
fulfilled the Law for the belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and becomming the end of
the Law for righteousnesse to
every one that beleeveth: in
this regard they are not under
this rigour of the Law, which
knoweth no surety, no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour,
no imputed obedience,
but in every mans owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
and yet the Gospell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
no part of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of the Law, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth
perfect obedience: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it tendreth it in the person
of the surety, and gets accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
when perfect obedience
is done <hi>for</hi> the person, though
not <hi>by</hi> him.</p>
            <p>2. Another appendix of the
Law is, that this <hi>rigorous</hi> exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of personall, and perfect
obedience is urged upon paine
of eternall death:<note place="margin">

in all things that are written in
the booke of the Law, Deut. 27.
26.</hi> and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 10. Now the
beleever is not under this co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent
of the Law: for <hi>Christ
was made a curse for us, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed
us from the curse of the
Law, Gal.</hi> 3. 13. and by him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
justified by faith, we escape
this damnatory sentence, <hi>Rom.
8.</hi> 1. But it is one thing to be
free from the curse of the Law,
another from the Law it selfe:
and it is no good sequell, We
are free from this sanction of
the Law; therefore from the
substance.</p>
            <p>3. Another appendix of the
Law is,<note place="margin">In which regard it I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

his heart to a willing, and
cheerefull endeavour in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
for what the Law pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes
to be done, it helpeth in
the doing of it: and as Christ
himself became under the Law
not forced or coacted, but free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
so is now the Christian.</p>
            <p>But this being but an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct,
shall we argue from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving

               </gap> exactly. And thus it is an
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18870:25"/>
impossible yoake; for <hi>by the
workes of the Law no flesh can
be justified, Rom:</hi> 3. 20. so as
now the beleever is not under
the Law for <hi>justification,</hi> unto
whom Christ is made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
and whose perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is imputed, <hi>Rom:</hi> 4. 5.
But it is no good argument,
that because the Law is <hi>fulfilled</hi>
by Christ, it is therefore <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished</hi>
by Christ: surely every
simple man can distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<hi>accomplishing</hi> and <hi>abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing</hi>
the Law: nor it will not
follow, that because the Law
cannot <hi>justifie,</hi> therefore it
cannot instruct, guide, or <hi>edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 5 consequent is, that the
Law is the vigour and strength
of sinne; that it arraignes, and
condemneth the sinner, and is
the <hi>minister of death, 2 Cor:</hi> 3. 7.
But <hi>there is no condemnation to
those that are in Iesus, Christ,
Rom:</hi> 8. 1. for that heavie sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:18870:26"/>
of the Law is transferred
upon Christ himselfe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
off the beleever. But it
will never hold weight or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

power of the Law, he is
free therefore from the <hi>manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi>
and directory power of

            <p>The 6 consequent or appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix

is not thus under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citation
of the Law, who by
grace is in great part freed from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18870:26"/>
this reluctation and resistance,
and by the same grace made
tractable and willingly subject
to the Law, which they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne
to be so concordant, and
a very counterpaine of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse
and justice of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe;
and thinke themselves
so farre from being loosed from
the Law by the doctrine of
grace, that they are faster tyed
to the obedience of it.</p>
            <p>The 7 and last appendix of
the Law, is to consider it as the
Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> and in <hi>Moses</hi>
hand given to the Church of
the <hi>Iewes;</hi> in which respect it
had many circumstantiall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
to that people, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
accessories in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
towards them; besides
some strictnesse, rigour, and
terrour to that people under
rudiments: In regard of which,
beleevers in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are not under the Law as
it was in <hi>Moses</hi> hand; but sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:18870:27"/>
references and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
as suppose, time, place, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
tables, testament, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
measure, terrour, rigour
are altered, and changed in the
Church since Christs death.
But it will prove no good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
that because an heire in
minority is under tutours and
rods, therefore he may being
come to yeares live as he list,
and become a lawlesse man: or
that because the Law as given
by <hi>Moses</hi> to the Church of the
<hi>Iewes</hi> is in some <hi>circumstances</hi>
altered, therefore it must be in
the <hi>whole substance</hi> of it abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
and that <hi>wholly:</hi> or that
because the Church of the olde
Testament was under a strait
Law, therefore the Church in
the new Testament must be
under none.</p>
            <p>The summe of all is compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in these three following
conclusions:</p>
            <p>1. That the regenerate are

and his most righteous Law,<note place="margin">Psal. 2. 2, 3</note>
saying, <hi>Let us break these bonds,

we are under the teaching of

which he <hi>brake off as a thred of

               <note place="margin">Iudg. 16. 9</note>
and our selves as loose, and at
liberty from it, as he was from
them; for <hi>the whole Law is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished
to us wholly.</hi> Therefore
we are to prove against them,
that true beleevers have both
a true use of the Morall Law,
and besides their lively faith,
wherin they have received the
spirit, have need of the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
and doctrines of the
Morall Law, for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
of the duties of it: and
that by these reasons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:18870:29"/>
If the same sinnes be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
after faith as before,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Reason</hi> All the same sins are forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den after faith as before.</note> then is
the Law in some force to belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.
But the same sinnes are
forbidden them after faith as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
<hi>And therefore the Law is
in some force to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The proposition is cleare,
because the Law onely <hi>discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
and revealeth sinne,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 7.</note> as the
Gospell doth the remedy. The
assumption is also manifest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Law is an eternall
truth, and is never at agreement
with any sinne in whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Concupiscence before faith
is sinne, and no lesse sinne after
faith in the regenerate: <hi>Davids</hi>
murder, and adultery were sins
after faith; and the same man
that beleeved in God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
adultery with <hi>Bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheba.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> These were foule sins
in themselves, but not in him
because he was justified.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Then <hi>Nathan</hi> was
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:18870:29"/>
deceived in saying, <hi>Thou art
the man:</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when he
said, <hi>I have sinned.</hi> Had <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
sinne after faith? then was
<hi>David</hi> under a Law for obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:
for every sinne is the
<hi>transgression of the Law,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Ioh. 3. 4.</note> and
<hi>where no Law is, can be no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression.</hi>
The like of <hi>Peter</hi> in
the new Testament apparantly
a beleever, for <hi>Christ prayed
that his faith should not faile;</hi>
yet after that fell into those
foule sinnes against the Law,
rash swearing, and false swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and cursing himselfe;
which were foule sins in him,
as well as in themselves; why
should he else goe out, and
weepe bitterly? <hi>Peter,</hi> as full
of shifts as he was to save his
skin, was to seeke in this shift,
to turne off all his sinne, and
sorrow at once, that being a
beleever, and in the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
the Law had nothing
to doe with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:18870:30"/>
This argument our Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
and Famelists can by no
other shift avoid, but by fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to a perfect purity in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
for this is a dangerous,
and desperate principle of their
Catechisme rife in the mouths
of their Novices, <hi>Be in Christ,
and sinne if thou canst;</hi> and is
very coherent with their other
tenents: for were the Morall
Law indeed wholly abolished,
why should they not worship
false Gods, sweare, breake the
Saboth, rebell, kill, whore,
steale? what should hinder
them from rayling, and revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all Ministers and people,
besides their owne sect, as in a
dead faith,<note place="margin">The Saints are perfect not perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctists.</note> as onely morall men
in state of death? all this is no
sinne: abolish the Law, and
thou maist say, <hi>Sin if thou canst.</hi>
But oh vaine men.<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 120.</note> Can <hi>David</hi>
sinne, and for his <hi>sinne his flesh
tremble with feare of Gods judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</hi>
Can <hi>Peter</hi> at the side
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:18870:30"/>
of Christ sinne, and that after
so many warnings of Christ
himselfe? Doth <hi>Paul</hi> know

a <hi>law in his members rebelling
against the law of his minde?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 7. 15. 19. 23.</note> and
that after grace received, <hi>the
good hee would doe, hee did not,
and the evill hee would not doe,
that did hee?</hi> and are you in so
high a forme beyond these

<hi>Eccles: 7. 20. There is not a just

The Apostle saith not simply

nor sinneth unto death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
returne and repentance,
because the seede of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth

him the worke of the Divell.
<hi>Prov. 20. 9. Who can say, I am
pure from sinne?</hi> Who? I can
say so, and I can, saith every Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine;
my sin may be sought
for, and cannot be found; and
mine, saith another, is washed
off, that it cannot be seene; and
mine, saith a third, is as a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
of inke dispersed in the sea,
and not to be discerned. And
indeed thus it is in the justified
in respect of Gods account, and
imputation; but while they
speak so magnifically of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in respect of the presence
of sinne, they onely blow up
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:18870:31"/>
their bladder bigger, which
all the while is swelled up but
with stinking winde and emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinesse.
But they would have
some places out of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
as men beyond the

            <p>
               <hi>If the same duties be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

               <note place="margin">2 Reas.</note>
               <hi>and every conscience bound to
the performance; then the Law
in the whole use is not abolished
to beleevers.</hi> But the first is
true:<note place="margin">The same duties are required after faith as before.</note> and therefore the second.
The former appeares, because
where any duty is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
there the rule of that duty
is implied: and this rule is the
Morall Law, which bindeth all
men to all duties of it both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
and after Christ, being an
eternall measure of all that is
right or crooked.</p>
            <p>That it is a rule of duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Christ, they deny not; and
that it is a rule of duty since
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:18870:32"/>
Christ, I make it plaine thus.</p>
            <p>1. Because Christ himselfe
did confirme, expound, esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
and fortify the Law by
his word and authority, which
was the scope of his large Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
upon the Mount, in <hi>Mat.
5.</hi> 6. and 7 chapters: which
had it beene to be utterly abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished,<note place="margin">Quod ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatius Christus exposuit, magis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinere ad Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note>
he would rather have
declaimed bitterly against the
Law as our Antinomists doe, &amp;
have rather commended the
<hi>Pharises</hi> for weakning it by
their glosses; than have vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
it, and restored to the full
strength and power of it.</p>
            <p>2. Our Lord not onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmes
it in it selfe by his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and life, but also in the
conscience of every Christian.
<hi>Matth. 5. 19. He that breaketh
the least of these commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and teacheth men so to
doe, shall be least in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of heaven: but he that shall
teach and observe them, shall be
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:18870:33"/>
called great in the kingdome of
heaven:</hi> that is, shall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured,
and counted a worthy
member in the Church of God.
No, saith the Libertine, we
must not teach the Law in the
Church; and those that doe are
legall Preachers, that lead men
into a dead faith; we must doe
nothing, because God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
us: nay we not onely
reverse the least of them, but
all at once, and teach others so
to doe. See now if fire be more
contrary to water, or Christ to
Belial; than Christ to these
sonnes of Belial, that will be
under no yoke of the Law, no
rule, no obedience.</p>
            <p>3. The Apostles after Christ
bring converted Christians e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where to the rule of the
Law, and frequently alledge the
Law to urge the duties of it:
and therefore the Law ceaseth
not to be the rule in the new
Testament; for if it had, they
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:18870:33"/>
would not have pressed exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
by the Law. <hi>Rom. 12.
19. Dearely beloved, avenge
not your selves:</hi> Why? <hi>For it
is written, Vengeance is mine.
Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 9. pressing the duty
of love, the onely debt besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
a Christian, he urgeth it
by this argument; because, <hi>love
is the fulfilling of the Law;</hi> and
repeateth all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the second Table, not
to repeale or reverse any of
them, but to confirme them as
the rule still, and comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
them all in this, <hi>Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thy selfe.
Ephes 6. 1. Children obey your
parents;</hi> and presseth the duty
from the Law; <hi>for this is the

Heb. 12. 28. Let us have
grace to serve God acceptably,
with reverence and feare.</hi> Why?
<hi>For our God is even a consuming
fire.</hi> Did not now the Apostles
come as well with <hi>a rod,</hi> as
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:18870:34"/>
with <hi>the spirit of meeknesse?</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 21</note> did

not they call mens eyes, not
onely to <hi>behold the goodnesse of

Rom.</hi> 11. 22. Dare now
an audacious Libertine step out
and tell the Apostles (as they
tell us) that they were legall
Preachers, that they taught
men popery and justification
by workes; and that they
made men onely morall Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
because they held the
Law before them as the rule
of all duties both of piety and
charity?</p>
            <p>If Christ came not to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
the Law,<note place="margin">3 <hi>Reas:</hi> Christ cam not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolish the Law, and therefore it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished.</note> but to fulfill it,
then the Law is not abolished:
for either Christ abolished it,
or none; and either by his
comming, or not at all. But
Christ chargeth us, not to
thinke that hee came to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:18870:34"/>
it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 17. For
what is it to destroy the Law,
but to take from it that vertue
and power whereby it is a
Law, and to make it of none
effect.<note place="margin">Christ cam not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Law, why?</note> And that Christ came
not to destroy the Law is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest:
because 1. It is his owne
Law, <hi>which must endure for
ever in heaven, Psal.</hi> 119.
2. Because it is <hi>holy, just,</hi> and
<hi>spirituall, Rom.</hi> 7. 13. Which
words imply, 1. That there is
in it a supernaturall, divine,
and unperishing vertue, resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
God himselfe, who shall
as easily be destroyed as his
Law. 2. That it serveth to be

4. That whosoever have the

their hearts; they cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
from the Law; but the

the more doe they discerne the
spirituall power of it, and frame
to the spirituall observance of
it: so did the Apostle in this
place; so <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 19. 7, 8.
and 119. 39.</p>
            <p>Nay Christ came to <hi>fulfill
it,</hi>

1. By preaching, illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating,
and inforcing the
Law, by vindicating it from
false glosses, and restoring to
the full and first strength of it;
by all which he sheweth it to
bee immutable and eternall.
2. By plenary and full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of it, and by his perfect,
and personall obedience, both
active and passive; so as he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
all the righteousnesse of
it; and left not one iota of it
unfulfilled. 3. By donation of
his spirit, writing the Law in
the hearts of the elect, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:18870:35"/>
them to new and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
obedience of it; for to this
end the Saints receive the law
of the spirit of life, that they
may not walke after the flesh
any more,<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 2.</note> but after the spirit,</p>
            <p>If the Apostles after Christ
did not abrogate the Law,<note place="margin">4 <hi>Reas.</hi> Nor the Apostles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished the Law.</note> but
establish it; then it is not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
to beleevers in the new
Testament. But they by the
doctrine of faith did not. <hi>Rom.
3. 31. Doe we abrogate the Law
by faith? God forbid; nay wee
establish it.</hi> Where the Apostle
cryes downe that grosse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the contrariety of the
Law and Gospell, so as one of
them must needs devoure the
other, as <hi>Moses</hi> rod did the
rods of the inchanters. True it
is they are a distinct and divers
doctrine; but in God and his
word is no contrariety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And
true it is the Law and Gospell
will never stand together in the

justification of a sinner before
God,<note place="margin">Lex et fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des mutuo se iuvant, mutuo si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi dant manus. P. Mart.</note> yet they friendly concur
and agree in Christian conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,
wherein they are inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable,
as also they are in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
institution: yea here they
helpe one another, as one hand
doth another. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the holy
Apostles who knew that the
Gospell was not properly and
substantially the Law; yet usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in the publication of the
Gospell confirme the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Law.<note place="margin">But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the authority of it.</note> See some instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<hi>Rom. 1. 18. The Gospel is the
power of God to salvation:</hi> and
by it not onely the <hi>righteousnes
of God is revealed from faith to
faith,</hi> but the <hi>wrath of God is
revealed from heaven against all
ungodlines:</hi> not that the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
is a <hi>ministery of wrath,</hi> but
a witnesse that wrath hangs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the heads of wicked men
rejecting the Gospell. <hi>Rom. 2.
16. Christ shall judge the secrets
of men according to my Gospell:</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:18870:36"/>
that is, according to the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Gospell preached
by me. 1 <hi>Iohn 2. 1. Brethren,
I write these things to you that
you sinne not:</hi> and what did he
write else but the sweet tidings
of the Gospell,<note place="margin">1 Ioh. 1. 9.</note> that is any <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
his sinnes, God is faithfull
and just to forgive them;</hi> and
that <hi>if any sinne, wee have an
advocate with the Father,
&amp;c?</hi> For as no man can teach
any duty of the Law, but ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
calls to faith: for call to the
love of God, the substance of
the first Table; must not he be
first beleeved, and then loved?
or to prayer; how can they call
on him on whom they have
not beleeved? and so in the rest:
so neither can a man preach
faith without some reference
to the Law; for can a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve
a remedy without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
&amp; search of the wound?
nay it is the Law that fits us to
prize Christ a physitian, or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:18870:37"/>
else would we never meddle
with him, no more than he
would seeke out for a garment
that hath no sence of his shame
or nakednesse. What if the Law
know not, nor command one
to die, or satisfie for another;
yet it doth not denie, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
or hinder the mercy of
God revealed in the Gospell,
but maketh way unto it. The
Apostles therefore did not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate
the Law by faith; nay
(saith our Apostle) <hi>we establish
it.</hi> From whence the argument
will rise stronger: <hi>If the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles
did stablish the Law by the
doctrine of faith, then is not the
Law abolished to beleevers in
the new Testament.</hi> But they
did establish the Law by faith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Quest.</hi> How doth faith sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish
the Law?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In shewing that
all the menaces and curses of it
are not in vaine, but all fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in Christ, who was laid
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:18870:37"/>
under them all to free us from
them.</p>
            <p>2. It fulfils the Law, because
it bringeth before God the
perfect fulfilling of the Law
for justification; though not
in our selves, yet in our surety,
in whom wee have perfectly
fulfilled it, and shall live by it;
the Law must be absolutely ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
by us in our surety, or we
cannot live.</p>
            <p>3. It stablisheth the Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<hi>faith worketh by love:</hi>
which love is the fulfilling of
the Law: so as by faith being
justified, as we are in a stron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
obligation to the duties of
it, so we begin a new obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,<note place="margin">Dicatur mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi in decem praeceptis quid non fit a Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vandum. Cant. Faust. lib. 3.</note> and there is no duty
which a Christian is not firme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obliged unto. Tell me (saith
<hi>Augustine)</hi> what there is in
all the ten commandements,
what it is that a Christian is
not bound unto?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:18870:38"/>
4. Because by faith we can
pray, and by the prayer of faith
obtaine the spirit of God, by
whom we are supplied with
needfull strength to obey the
Law:<note place="margin">Fides im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrat gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Lex imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.</note> so <hi>August:</hi> faith obtaines
grace, by which the Law is
fulfilled: and <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith,
that faith stablisheth the Law,
because faith shewes those du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to be done which the Law
commandeth to be done.<note place="margin">Quia quae in Lege di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta sunt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienda, per fidem osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duntur fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta. Ambros.</note> And
thus have we strengthened our
fourth argument, which hath
proved that the Apostles of
Christ abolished not the Law,
but established it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is not without use and
force in the new Testament.</p>
            <p>In whomsoever must be a
constant endeavour of confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
to the Law,<note place="margin">5 <hi>Res:</hi> Every be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever is bound to strive to conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Law.</note> to those the
Law is not abolished. This is
plaine, because where any
thing is to be regulated, there
the rule is necessary. But every
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:18870:38"/>
beleever after conversion must
strive to a conformity with
the Law, 1. in his <hi>inner</hi> man,
2. in his <hi>outward</hi> man, 3. in
his <hi>whole</hi> man.</p>
            <p>1. In his <hi>inner</hi> man,<note place="margin">1. In his inner man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> he must
<hi>delight in the Law of God, Rom.

serve the Law of God,</hi> verse 25.
and in his affections hee must
<hi>love the Law. Psal. 119. 97. Oh
how love I thy Law. Psal. 1. 1.
The blessed man delighteth in
the Law of the Lord:</hi> not
onely in the knowledge of
it (which an hypocrite may)
but in the conformity of their
hearts and affections with it;
they carry friendly affections
to the Law. Our Antinomists
outboast all men in point of
their justification.<note place="margin">Iustificati amici Legis efficiuntur. Ambr. in Rom. 8.</note> But <hi>St: Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
his rule denieth them to
be justified, because they are
not friends with the Law. And
<hi>Mr. Luther,</hi> whom they chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendge
as their friend, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:18870:39"/>

men; of whom he saith, that
they love the Law, as well as
a murderer loveth the prison,
and so well love these the Law,
and therefore by his censure
rejected among the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
            <p>2. In his <hi>outward</hi> man,<note place="margin">2. In his outward man.</note> and
action the justified man must
testifie that the Law of God is
<hi>written in his heart:</hi> so the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle,
1 <hi>Ioh. 2. 17. He that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filleth
the commandement abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
for ever.</hi> What is this
commandement, and what is
it to fulfill it? The commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is the same which he had
delivered in the former part
of the chapter, consisting of
two branches. 1. To beleeve
in the Sonne of God, as our
onely satisfaction, our onely
advocate, and the reconciliati
on for the sinnes of the world,
v. 1,. 2. That we embrace him
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18870:39"/>
as our unerring patterne of our
lives, and walke as he walked,
v. 6. <hi>Quest.</hi> How did hee
walke? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. In the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
observation of the whole
Law. 2. In speciall: In the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
love of the brethren, v. 9.
and in the contempt of the
world. Now must Christ walk
in the obedience of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,
and must not the
Christian? Yes, saith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle,
Every Christian must <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill</hi>
the commandement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> What will you teach
justification by workes?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> No, we call not men
to legall fulfilling of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
but evangelicall:
as 1. when the minde delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in the Law of God, as ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
just and good. 2. When
the heart hides it, to conforme
unto it. 3. When the affection
desireth to fulfill it, rejoyceth
when he can attaine to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and sorroweth when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:18870:40"/>
he faileth in it. 4. When in
his actions he beginneth that
obedience which shall end in
perfect fulfilling: this the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
accepteth, and accompteth
a fulfilling of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Thus the Apostle, <hi>Rom:
8. 4. The righteousnesse of the
Law is fulfilled in us, which
walke not after the flesh, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the spirit:</hi> that is, Christ
by his meritorious obedience
to the death, hath not onely
freed us beleevers from the
<hi>condemning</hi> power of sinne, but
from the <hi>commanding</hi> power
of it; and so renewed our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
as that the Law of God
shall be fulfilled in us: and that
two wayes. 1. By application
of his owne perfect fulfilling of
it unto us; with whom we by
faith being united unto him,
whatsoever is his being the
head, is ours also being mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
2. By our sanctification
it is fulfilled in us <hi>inchoately:</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:18870:40"/>
that is, by obedience begun
here, which at last shall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,
so as not the least mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or desire contrary to the
Law shall be left in our nature.
Thus is the righteousnesse of
the Law fulfilled, not by us,
but in us, even here below; and
is our rule both in earth and in
heaven.</p>
            <p>3. In his <hi>whole man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. In his whole man.</note> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
must grow up to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of Christ, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
of his holinesse, which
is no other but the perfect i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of God expressed in the
Law. This growth in grace,
and sanctification, is called the
<hi>rising up</hi> to full holinesse, as
the Sunne riseth up higher till
perfect day. <hi>Prov. 4. 18. The
way of the just is as the light,
which shineth more and more till
perfect day.</hi> But this cannot be
done without the helpe of the
Law, the onely rule by which,
and the scope unto which it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:18870:41"/>
must be directed. For 1. how
should a beleever free from sin
know himselfe <hi>in the service of
righteousnesse,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 18. if
he be under no command, or
if his obedience be without
rule or direction? 2. or how
should he discover his daily
errours, to be humbled for
them? how should he <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
from whence he is fallen?</hi> or
be raised to <hi>doe his first workes</hi>
(for all this must further his
sanctification) without the rule
of the Law? 3. Or, how should
he see the imperfection, and
uncleannesse that cleaveth to
his best duties, whereby he is
kept from proud Pharisaisme,
and the arrogant conceits of
these libertine perfectists; but

and the onely meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

therefore all the instrumentall

of salvation must be cut off and

alone decreeth our salvation,
Christ alone meriteth it, the

the Gospell revealeth it, and

Ministers they preach it, and
they save, namely ministerially.
1 <hi>Tim: 4. 16. Thou shalt save

speaking of the duties of

meanes of salvation: these
wild conceits come in as the ill

God will bee worshipped in

This is mechanicall divinity

he must see the sinnes
that hee pardoneth, and in

his knowledge were

cause, for both are merited by
sinne. 2. Nor in their <hi>matter,</hi>
being materially both one; the
same sword, the same plague,
the same famine, the same
blindnesse, sicknesse and death.
3. Nor in the ground of them;
for both are threatned and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
by the same Law. 4. Nor
in their sence and feeling; for
there is no difference between
the smart of sonnes and slaves.
But the difference is in, 1. the
person inflicting: 2. in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
bearing and suffering: 3. in
the end of God which is not

the same: 4. in the fruit and

God in this judgement
principally intended his owne
glory, in the honouring of his
Sonne, and not principally the
sinne either of the parents or
sonne. 2. Christ speaketh not
of the <hi>meritorious</hi> cause of this
judgement, but of the <hi>finall</hi>
cause: and so the objection is
not to the purpose.</p>

his affliction was for tryall, and
not for correction: but this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth

was no correction in it, at least
might not be.</p>

               <p>2. They forget that <hi>David</hi>
and <hi>Peter</hi> repented after saith:
That the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi>
that <hi>kept the name of Christ, and
had not denied the faith,</hi> must
<hi>yet repent her selfe, else Christ
will come against her, Rev.</hi> 2. 12.
and 16. And how much cause
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:18870:67"/>
have the best men to repent of
their daily sinnes, that must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
daily of their best duties,
which they must confesse are
as a filthy clout?</p>
               <p>3. Although the spirit by
faith assureth the beleever, that
all his sinnes are satisfied by the
death of Christ; yet the spirit
also perswadeth the heart, that
in this way of humiliation and
repentance we shall receive as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance
of remission of daily
sinnes, and particular infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties:
for else the spirit should
faile in his office, which is to
bring even the house of <hi>David,</hi>
and the inhabitants of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
(that is, true beleevers) to
the fountaine of grace, and stir
up in them deepe sorrow and
earnest lamentation in seeking
pardon for daily sinnes, and
speciall provocations against
the Lord, whom by their sins
they have pierced.</p>
               <p>4. Prayer for forgivenesse of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18870:67"/>
daily sinnes is an act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
enjoyned by Christ on
him that hath formerly repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
is justified, and calleth
God Father; as in that petition
of his most holy prayer, <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give

               </p>
               <p>5. They that overflow with
love, and outboast all others in
their pretence of love, which
is so strong and active as they
need no other mover, forget
that increase of love to God
must needs increase repentance
and sorrow for offending him:
if love be great, so wil sorrow,
as in <hi>Peter.</hi> In a word, their
harvest of joy is too hasty, and
will prove like an <hi>inheritance
hastily gotten:</hi> this is not the
time of wiping away all our
teares, nor is our dripping seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time

wonder what shift they make
to repeat the Lords prayer, or
to pray in his words, unlesse
they have learned the tricke of

conscience of their owne need;
which modesty is indeed a lie,
and fained humility.</p>
               <p>2. Prayer for pardon will
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18870:68"/>
stand with assurance of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,
and assurance of pardon
will not stand without prayer
for pardon; for then are we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
of pardon, when we can
pray for pardon, God being
found favourable onely in his
owne way.</p>
               <p>3. Though wee know our
sinnes pardoned, yet must we
pray for pardon; neither doth
assurance of pardon and mercy
dead our prayer for pardon,
but quicken it. Christ knew
his sheep should never perish,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 28. but yet he prayeth
for them, that they might not
perish, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 17. 11. He knew
that his Father would glorify
him, but yet prayeth that his
Father would glorify him, <hi>Ioh.
17.</hi> Who will say this his
prayer was needlesse? <hi>Paul</hi>
knew that God would <hi>deliver
him from every evill way,</hi> yet
prayed for it. So though we
know our sinnes to be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:18870:69"/>
yet it is not needlesse to
pray for pardon.</p>
               <p>4. Though God in heaven
have by an eternall sentence
blotted out the sinnes of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever
in the first act of his
conversion,<note place="margin">We must pray for pardon of sinne in the court of our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, as well as in the court of heaven.</note> and this sentence
can never be blotted out, yet
we may and must <hi>pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
of sinne;</hi> namely, that this
sentence of pardon may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
in our owne conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces:
and thus it seemes <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
prayed earnestly for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse
of his sinnes, <hi>Psal.
51.</hi> when he knew long before
that God had forgiven them;
for <hi>Nathan</hi> had tolde him, that
<hi>God had put away his sinne:</hi> he
prayed that God would not
only forgive his sin in heaven,
but even in his own heart also.</p>
               <p>5. Though our sinnes be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given
even in our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences,<note place="margin">And for a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable measure of assurance.</note>
yet because of the stain
and guilt of new sins our assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
is sometimes weakened,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:18870:69"/>
and not so comfortable, wee
must <hi>pray for pardon of sinne</hi>
still; that is for a greater, and
more comfortable measure of
assurance, and a sweeter taste
and apprehension of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in remission of sinne; for
who can taste of this sweet ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
and not long for more?
and whereas our weaknes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
so firmely apprehend it,
and our corruption doth daily
weaken it, we must pray for
the continuance of our comfort
and mercy; whereof prayer is
a principall meanes.</p>
               <p>6. Suppose we have pardon
of sin in the beginnings of it,<note place="margin">And in the full and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall fruits and effects of pardon.</note>
and some sweet fruites, yet we
must pray for it in all the fruits,
in all the effects, in the full

of it; for by remission of sinne
wee are now freed from the
damnation of sinne, and from
the domination of it; yet are
we not freed from all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainders
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:18870:70"/>
of sin, nor from all

for notwithstanding the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

with terrours of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
Gods just deserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

solemne sentence of absolution
by the mouth of the Iudge,
which shal fully and really give
us compleat possession of Gods
whole mercy; which we now

the Saints pray for Christs

of full and finall remission of

                  <p>That Preachers ought not to

               <p>

on so merry a pin, if the way to

1. Neither can they sinne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

2. Neither if they should,
could God see it. 3. If hee
should chance to see it, he could
not bee displeased with it.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:18870:71"/>
4. If he should be displeased,
his hands are bound, he cannot
correct it. 5. Themselves ought
not now to sorrow or repent
for any sin any more. 6. It is
idle to pray for pardon of sin,
which is already pardoned,
whether it be past, or present,
or to come. 7. And now they
must not so much as heare of
their sinnes any more, and all
their religion is turned into a
merriment, which they call a
meeting with such comfort as
they never found before: but
this comfort will prove but a
laughter in the face, when the
heart hath cause to be heavie.
For,</p>
               <p>1. Is there nothing else to be
feared of a Christian but finall
condemnation? a childe may
feare to be whipped, though
he feare not to be disinherited:
<hi>Psal.</hi> 52. 6. even the <hi>righteous
shall see and feare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. A man may feare that

not of <hi>distrustfulnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. No man is so holy but
hath need of threatnings, and
faith beleeveth <hi>threatnings</hi> as

THe undivided companion
of <hi>ignorance</hi> is <hi>pride;</hi> for
no man that ever aright knew
God or himselfe, but the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
he approached to God with
<hi>Abraham,</hi> the more did he
humble himselfe in dust and
ashes. But here is a generation
of men swelled up with pride,
and blowne up with a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
that they are gotten
into the highest forme of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection:
they can scorne and
disdaine the directions of the
Law, as being far beyond it; for
they have attained a full perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
not of <hi>justification</hi> onely,
but of <hi>sanctificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               </hi> also already;
they are free not onely from
the <hi>power</hi> of sinne, but from the
<hi>presence</hi> also: Christ himselfe is
not purer, or more free from
sinne than they are: nay being
borne of God they cannot sin
if they would: if they doe acts
of sinne in high nature; yet
where is <hi>no Law is no trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression:</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:18870:76"/>
God cannot see them
in that glasse. Hence they can
loose themselves from most
ministeries, but some teachers
of their owne sect; and deride
the holy labours of godly Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
who with zeale and
piety persuade men to walke
according to rules. Oh what an
height of pride are those pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
peremptory persons come
unto, who complaine that <hi>their

and shame. Doe you preach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst

            <p>Yet here 1. let it be considered

to be led into temptation, that
cannot sinne if they would?
3. Did hee ordaine the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

they die: why deny they that

            <p>Secondly, Sanctification hath
three degrees in this life,<note place="margin">Three de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the highest imperfect.</note> the
highest of which is imperfect.</p>
            <p>1 Is the <hi>death of the body of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18870:78"/>
sin.</hi> Which is not all at once, but
resembleth the death of Christs
body on the crosse, which was
diminished by degrees, till his
spirit by his last breath was
surrendred to his Father. Thus
is it in the christian, whose last
breath of sinne, and of the body
goe out together.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second</hi> degree is the <hi>bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall
of the body of sinne,</hi> which
is a further proceeding in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
as buriall is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
of death, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
of the dead body not
all at once; but by little, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.
So mortification is not an
act of a day, but of the life.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Third</hi> degree of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
is a <hi>raising</hi> from the
grave of sinne to a new life, by
vertue of Christ his Resurrect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion:
that looke as a graft set in
to a new stock, draweth juice
and life from that stock, not all
at once and then no more; but
still draweth, and by drawing,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:18870:78"/>
groweth by degrees unto the
full height and age of it:
eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so is it here, christian life is
continued as naturall by dayly
supply and addition of that
which is daily wanting.<note place="margin">Why God would not free his servants from all sinne in life as well as in death</note> God
indeed if he had pleased, might
in a moment have freed his
servants from all sinne, as well
in life as in death; but he wold
not: because his wisdome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures
himselfe more glory in
his protection and assistance of
the Saints: and in the victory
of his servants against sin, than
if they were free from sinne.</p>
            <p>The fiercer the enemies were
that rose up against <hi>Moses</hi> in

and that the labour might have

<hi>oppugnation</hi> of it: a fearefull
fruite indeede of their decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:
but men having once lost
the way of truth, know not
where they shall lodge.</p>
            <p>And it will not be amisse to
looke into their modell of new
Divinity, and how cunningly
they have molded the whole
lumpe, and kneaded it together,
that every peece and position
of it may let themselves loose
from all bands of duty and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="140" facs="tcp:18870:82"/>
1. They must not live in the
presence of God,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused lump of Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme in 9 poysonfull positions.</note> nor hold him
in their sight as a God seeing
their sinnes or actions, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased
with the evill of them:
and why now should they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare
any sinne?</p>
            <p>2. They must not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God a rewarder of his
owne grace, or any good duty
to which he enableth: and how
then can they desire to doe
good, or be good?</p>
            <p>3. They must not see their
sin a violation of the Law, nor
as it is an enmity against God,
nor as causing wrath to worke
in them either humiliation for
sinne past, or detestation of sin
present, or feare of it for time
to come.</p>
            <p>4. Neither Gods will, nor
their owne wills moves them
not to forbeare any sinne: not
the former, because they are
free from all lawes; not the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
because the will of man is
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:18870:82"/>
turned against sin by vertue of
inherent holinesse wrought by
the spirit (which they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime)
so as onely the light of
their mind may condemne it;
and the unseemelinesse of it in
a professour may restraine it,
else they are loose to any.</p>
            <p>5. They cannot be sick of evill
motions, nor detest evill
thoughts, nor watch against
temptations, nor care for the
purging of their hearts; for
how can they sinne being born
of God? or if they could, they
are not to be countable for any
sin, nor can God take notice of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Christs most innocent soul
was vexed with the molesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of injected motions of evil,
though instantly rejected, but
these must not, they are so holy</p>
            <p>6. They must not live by any
rules,<note place="margin">Lex Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistarum. Quod vos lumus san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum est, August.</note> but by a wilde and spati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
pretence of immediate,
and enthusiasticall direction.
Enemies are they to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
and exhortations;
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:18870:83"/>
for because Christs <hi>perfections</hi>
are <hi>their perfection.</hi> In vaine it
is to perswade either for good
thoughts into the minde, or
good inclinations into the will,
or good actions into the life.
They desire not their hearts,
nor wills, nor actions to agree
with Gods law, for it is quite
abolished. And much lesse doe
they turne the precepts of God
into prayers as the Saints ever
used to doe. Oh with what vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence
must headstrong men be
caryed unto unrighteousnesse,
when the word as a bridle must
not hold them in, nor check
or controll sinne in the soule,
to lessen either the power or
practise of it?</p>
            <p>7. They must not brooke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

sinnes more securely, they free
themselves from all feare of
woe and judgement, and from
all the strokes of God, or his

the <hi>obedience, rule, counsell,</hi>
and direction of the Law; and

words immediately going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
saith that <hi>the Law is good if
it be used lawfully:</hi> which words
clearely import and imply, that
among beleevers there is a
good vse of the Law, which
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:18870:92"/>
true use hee shewes in the fifth
verse, namely, to be a guide
and direction to the duties of
love and charity, which is
now the effect of faith, as the
words plainly show: for <hi>the
end of the commandement is
love, out of a pure heart, a good
conscience, and faith unfained.</hi>
Note, that the Apostle maketh
that <hi>love</hi> which is the <hi>end of
the commandement,</hi> a fruite
and effect of faith: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a beleever is not loosed
from the love and obedience
of the Law by faith, but tyed
unto it.</p>
               <p>2. The sence of the Apostle
is not, that a righteous man
can be under no lawes; for
<hi>Adam</hi> in innocencie was a
most righteous man, and yet
was under the Law, both
in generall, under the whole
Morall Law; and in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
under the Law concerning
the forbidden tree: and this
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18870:92"/>
Law was given to the most
righteous man in the world.<note place="margin">The Law is given <hi>unto</hi> a righteous man, but not <hi>against</hi> him.</note>
Innocency and righteousnesse
in perfection exempts no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
from the Law of his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atour.
But the Apostles mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
is, that the Law is not
given <hi>against a righteous man,</hi>
that frameth his course ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law; it dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not with him as an enemy
that assenteth unto it, that is
delighteth in it in the inner
man, that is ruled and ordered
by it; it can pronounce no
sentence of damnation against
him; it neither can justifie
him who is already justified
by faith, nor yet can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne
him. And that this is
the true meaning of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
appeareth by 2 arguments
in the text.<note place="margin">Non dicit <gap reason="foreign">

freed such a one from the curse

as also by his spirit made him
a lover of the Law. And this
is the same in sence with that
of the Apostle, <hi>Gal: 5. 23. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
such</hi> (namely as expresse
those recited fruites of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit)
<hi>there is no Law:</hi>

3. Neither is the Law given to

from them by terrours, or
threatnings, or expectation ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the just are not under the Law
in this <hi>servile manner</hi> of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
as are the lawlesse and
disobedient: for by a free spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of grace they doe the works
of the Law, so farre as they are
regenerate; and the Law to
them is not a compelling com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander,
but a sweet and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
counsellour, and rule of life.
But although the Law be not
given to the just, to fasten any
crime or curse upon them, nor
to exact personall, and perfect
obedience for righteousnesse
before God; nor to force, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
or rigorously exact obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

that it is no way else given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

foote, and utterly abolished
by the enemies of the truth.</hi> It is
easie from these words of <hi>Mr.
Luther</hi> to collect, that, 1. Hee
did not conceive the Law
thrust out of all use by Christ:
for then why should men fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
God learne the true use of
it? 2. That if hee feared men
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:18870:109"/>
would abolish it, then his
judgement was it ought not to
be abolished. 3. That if hee
esteeme this sort of men that
would abolish the Law, ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the truth: then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he is not their patron in this
loose and carnall opinion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And pag.</hi> 154. Forasmuch
as wee diligently and faithfully
teach these things: we doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
plainly testifie, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
not the Law, and workes, as
our adversaries doe falsely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
us: but wee doe altogether
establish the Law, and require
the workes thereof, and wee say
the Law is good and profitable.</p>
            <p>And cap: 5. 14. pag. 254. <hi>It is
necessary that godly Preachers
should as diligently teach the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of good workes, as the
doctrine of faith: for Satan is a
deadly enemy to both.</hi> Is <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

to your foolish tenents
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:18870:109"/>
as the Sunshine of midday is to

Doth not he disclaime you as
adversaries, yea as false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers,
while you challenge a line
or syllable of his doctrine in
the patronage of your delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
You reject the Law, and
workes; he professeth, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth
neither: you abolish
the whole Law wholly; but
he establisheth it: you reject
them for legall Preachers that
teach not Christ aright, who
urge men to the duties of the
Law; but he imposeth it as a
necessary part of their office to
urge the Law, yea as necessary
as to teach the doctrine of

when <hi>Duraeus</hi> the Iesuite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
against Mr. <hi>Luther</hi> the
same which these Libertines
affirme of him, that it was his
judgement that the Decalogue
appertaineth not to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;
thus gravely answereth:
That <hi>Luther</hi> most truly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Decalogue, that is,
that condition of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,
either of full and perfect
obedience, or of malediction

Christ to them hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way

            <p>The fourth is, judicious Mr.
<hi>Perkins,</hi> from whose gracious
mouth and Ministery I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in my youth often the
same holy truth, as now in his
fruitfull writings appeareth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where. As in his <hi>golden
chaine, chap:</hi> 31. having set
downe the use of the Morall
law in the unregenerate, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth,
that <hi>the use of the Law
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:18870:116"/>
in the regenerate is farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise:
for it guideth them to new
obedience, which obedience may
bee acceptable to God through
Christ.</hi> And upon <hi>Gal:</hi> 3. 12.
hee answereth this question;
why the Lord saith, He that
doth the things of the Law
shall live: considering that no
man since the fall can doe the
things of the Law: and shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>that still the Lord repeateth
his law in the olde tenure: 1. To
teach that the law is of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
and uncheangable nature:
2. to advertise us of our weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and shew us what wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
doe: 3. To put us in minde
still to humble our selves, after
we have begun by grace to obey
the law; because even then wee
come farre short in doing the
things which the law requireth
at our hands.</hi> And on verse 23.
he inquireth, that now seeing
faith is come, what is the guard
whereby wee are now kept?</p>

Answ. <hi>The</hi> precepts of the
Morall Law. The sayings of the
wise are as nayles, or stakes fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to range men in the compasse
of their owne duties. Ecclesiast.
12. 11. <hi>And most plainely he
coucheth our whole doctrine
concerning the Law, in the ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of our question upon vers.
15.</hi> eiusdem capitis. <hi>The questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is how farre the Morall Law
is abrogated.</hi> Answer. <hi>Three
wayes. 1. In respect of</hi> Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
2. <hi>Of</hi> malediction. 3. <hi>In
respect of</hi> rigour. <hi>For</hi> in them
that are in Christ, <hi>God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the</hi> indeavour to obey for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
it selfe. Neverthelesse
<hi>(saith he)</hi> The Law as it is a
rule of good life, is unchangable,
and admitteth no abrogation:
And Christ in this regard did
by his death establish it. Rom. 5.
31.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And on c. 4. 5. The Law must
be considered two wayes.</hi> First
as a rule of life. Thus Angels
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:18870:117"/>
are under the Law, and Adam
before his fall, and the Saints
now in heaven: and none yeeld
more subjection to the Law than
they, and this subjection is their
liberty. <hi>Againe consider it as a
grievous yoke three wayes,
none can beare it, &amp;c. And in his
Treatise of conscience, cap. 2.
saith, That the</hi> Morall Law bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
the consciences of all men, at
all times to obedience.</p>
            <p>The fifth is our learned and
industrious <hi>Doctor Willet: Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmin</hi>
(saith he) is not ashamed
to slaunder us, that wee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
christian liberty to stand
herein, that we are altogether
freed from the obedience and
subjection of the Law: <hi>Vt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
cum suo decalogo nihil ad not
pertinent. But we call God and all
the world to record, that we wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
no such thing: knowing tha-Christ
came not to dissolve, but
to fulfill the Law.</hi> Here <hi>therefore</hi>
Bellarmin <hi>fighteth with his owne
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:18870:118"/>
shadow.</hi> But Christian liberty
consisteth in three things that
we are exempted: 1 From Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonyes:
2 From the curse
and guilt: 3 From the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and reigne of sinne. &amp;c.
And upon <hi>Exod.</hi> cap. 20. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
10. quest. 9. saith
thus. The Morall Law is not
now in force <hi>quoad justificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem:</hi>
that is, in respect of justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;
but it bindeth <hi>quoad
obedientiam,</hi> in respect of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
for we are bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to keep
all the precepts of the Law: but
yet <hi>quoad modum obedientiae et
terrorem,</hi> in respect of terrour,
and rigorous manner of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
we are not bound. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The sixth is that grave and
learned Bishop <hi>Downam,</hi> whom
I must honourably mention, not
onely for his worthy parts and
labours in the Church; but in
the speciall reference of a pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and worthy Tutor and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of my selfe in the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:18870:118"/>
That right Reverend Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,
in his Treatise entituled,
<hi>The doctrine of Christian liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>
doth exactly (as his manner
is) open and cleare this whole
doctrine, and in section or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph
15. hath these words:
The Papists charge us, that
wee place <hi>Christian Liberty</hi> in
this, that we are <hi>subject to no
Law in our conscience, and before
God,</hi> and that we are free from
<hi>all necessity of doing good works,
which is a most divelish slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi>
for though we teach that
the <hi>obedience to the Law,</hi> is not
<hi>required</hi> in us <hi>to Iustification:</hi>
but that wee are free from the
exaction of the Law in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe:
yet we <hi>deny not,</hi> but that
<hi>unto sanctification,</hi> the <hi>obedience
of the Law is required,</hi> &amp; <hi>we by
necessity of duty bound to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
therof.</hi> And againe, <hi>We
confesse to be free from obedience,
is to be servants of sinne,</hi> and the
willing &amp; cheereful worship of
God is true liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:18870:119"/>
And we acknowledge that the
Morall Law of God is perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
and <hi>immutable,</hi> and that this
is <hi>an everlasting</hi> truth, that the
<hi>creature is bound to worship and
obey</hi> his Creator: and so much
<hi>the more bound,</hi> as he <hi>hath</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the greater benefits. And
after, the more a <hi>man is assured</hi>
of his <hi>free</hi> justification, the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he is enabled,</hi> and <hi>the more</hi>
he is <hi>bound</hi> to obey it. And the
Law hath singular use in them
that are justified, 1. as a rule of
direction for al obedience. 2 As
a glasse of detection of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection
to keepe us humble.
3 As a rod of correction in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of he flesh and old man
for mortification &amp;c. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
that section thus. We
are therefore in our sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
freed, though not from <hi>the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;</hi>
yet from the servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and bondage of the Law,
in three respects.</p>
            <p>The seventh is, that learned
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:18870:119"/>
Bishop <hi>Davenant</hi> a speciall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
of our Church, and
one worthy to succeed that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<hi>Iewell</hi> in the sea of <hi>Salis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</hi>
In his elaborate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary

may not therefore hence take
to our selves a liberty to sinne,
but an alacrity in our service to

an ingenious and reverend
Divine, who in his fruitfull
Commentary on the 8. to the
<hi>Romans,</hi> delivereth himselfe
wholly unto us in this point, &amp;
in the end of the 4 verse hath
these words:</p>
            <p>Albeit by Christ we be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
from <hi>the curse of the
Law,</hi> yet wee are not <hi>exempted
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:18870:120"/>
from the obedience thereof.</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the one, the Apostle
said, <hi>we are not under the Law,
but under grace.</hi> In respect of
the other he had said, that <hi>the
Law is good,</hi> and our Saviour
protesteth, he came not to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy</hi>
the Law, but to <hi>fulfill it,</hi>
both in <hi>himselfe</hi> and his <hi>mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi>
not onely by righteousnes
<hi>imputed,</hi> but also <hi>inherent.</hi> For
the Law stands to us as <hi>a rule of
our life;</hi> wee love the <hi>holines</hi>
thereof, and strive to <hi>conforme
our selves</hi> unto it.</p>
            <p>The ninth is that most sound
and learned professour of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity

consider the substance of the

concerning piety; wee
deny with Christ, that the
Law is simply abrogated; who
said, <hi>I came not to destroy the

it is manifest that it is

gracious instructions in my

That <hi>the Law shall keepe the use

God, and the majestie of his

Mediatour in heaven to pleade

those for whom Christ in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
pleadeth: and even so
is our earnest prayer that they
may be helped out of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,

(howsoever they applaud
themselves) they have none
to pleade for them, never a

            <argument>
               <p>Containing the conclnsion,
and a short direction how
the people of God should
carry themselves towards
the Law of God.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THese premises being all
duely considered, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth
that such as desire to
learne Christ aright, should
take his directions how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meane
themselves towards his
Law, which is so <hi>holy, just,</hi> and
<hi>good.</hi> To which purpose it
shall not be amisse to lay these
grounds in our consciences,
and order our selves by them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> That in the Liberty
from the Law, consists the
chiefe stay and comfort of a
Christian; because being now
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:18870:124"/>
freed from the guilt of sinne,
from the <hi>curse</hi> of sinne, and
from exaction of an inherent
and personall righteousnesse to
justification: hee may now
without respect of his owne o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
and without regard
of any righteousnesse of his
owne, relie upon the mercies
of God, and merits of Christ,
and challenge his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
before God, with the
the Apostle, <hi>Phil:</hi> 3 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That upon this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of <hi>justification,</hi> (wherein
is no respect at all of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall
obedience) issueth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
liberty of <hi>sanctification;</hi>
which is a freedome from the
bondage and staine of sinne,
not wholly and at once, (as is
our justification) but in part
and degrees: and here although
the obedience of the Law be
quite shut out of our <hi>justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
yet it is required unto
<hi>sanctification,</hi> and we necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:18870:125"/>
bound unto it; but not to
bee thereby justified, seeing
wee must necessarily be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
before we can be obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> that the Law is
an <hi>eternall doctrine,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 89.</note> and abides
for ever; yea <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>it
endures for ever in heaven:</hi>
that is, not onely his decree
appeares stable by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and perpetuall Law
which hee hath set in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
and cannot be broken:
but as Saint <hi>Basil</hi> expoundeth
it, it abideth inviolably obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by heavenly inhabitants,
even the holy Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves:
so as though it may be
contradicted, controverted,
and resisted by Libertines on
earth; yet it is not abrogable
for ever, but abideth stable in
heauen. Doe the Angels in
heaven observe it as a rule of
holinesse, and doe not the
Saints in heaven? doe they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:18870:125"/>
live by divers charters? And
if the Saints in heaven, who
have attained full perfection,
and perfect sanctification, are
bound to the Law, are the
Saints in earth so perfect, as
they are loose from it? Hath
not Christ done as much for
them as for these?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That the Law of
God is the rule of godly life:<note place="margin">Psal. 119. 24</note>
in which regard holy <hi>David</hi>
calleth it a <hi>counseller,</hi> and a
directer unto good duties: and
therefore wee must acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the necessity of this part
of the word. The Sunne is not
more necessary for the day, nor
the Moone to governe the
night,<note place="margin">Psal, 119, 105.</note> nor a <hi>lanterne</hi> or <hi>candle</hi>
for a darke house; than this
part of the word, so long as
wee are in the night of the
world: for without this light
we grope in the darke, nothing
can be seene, no action can be
well done, nothing wanting
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:18870:126"/>
can be found, no crooked thing
can be straightened, no streight
thing tried; nay all our way
in which this light of God
shineth not, is darknesse, and
tendeth to utter darknesse. The
pillar of the cloud and of fire,
was not more necessary to <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>
in the wildernesse, for
their station or motion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Canaan, than is this shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
pillar of Gods Law to
guide us unto heaven: and as
it was their happinesse that
their pillar lasted them till
they entred Canaan; and it had
not beene for their ease to have
rejected it in their way: so
ought we to esteeme our selves
happy in the fruition of this
holy doctrine, and direction;
and on the contrary these Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines
to be unhappy men,
who being in as darke, as
heavie and dangerous a way,
and wildernesse, put out their
light, and breake to peeces,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:18870:126"/>
and cast away their lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horne.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Being the rule of
godly life, we must square all
our duties thereby; even as a
workman applieth his rule to
every part of his worke, and
declines not to the right hand
or to the left: and holy wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
requireth no lesse, but
that, that should be the <hi>square</hi>
of all, which must bee the
judge of all things done in the
flesh be it good or evill. And
hence is it that the LORD
writeth his Law by his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in the spirits of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and imprinteth it in
the fleshly tables of their
hearts, that all their motions,
actions, and affections should
be conformable unto it. But
how doe these lawlesse men,
affirming the Law to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
abolished, denie it to bee
written in their owne hearts?
and consequently that they
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:18870:127"/>
want the spirit, promised to be
sent into the hearts of the elect
for this purpose: And that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
themselves are none of
the elect, or that the spirit is
wanting in his office, which
were an high blasphemy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That as the Law is
a reveiler of <hi>duty,</hi> so it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiler
of sinne too: and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
the sinfull defects of our
best obedience. And because by
<hi>the Law is the knowledge of sin,</hi>
therefore by the obedience and
<hi>works of the Law can no flesh
be justified.</hi> That same Law
that discovereth and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
a traytor, cannot acquit
him: and it were madnes for
him to expect life, from that
Law which hath sentenced him
with death. Shall franticke Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists
ever finde life and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
by the works of that
Law which condemns that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
fact? And are not they next
to fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nzy, that after all this so
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:18870:127"/>
open disclaiming it; would fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten
upon us, that because wee
teach <hi>the Law,</hi> wee therefore
teach <hi>justification</hi> by the Law.
Nay, we are so farre from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
to any such poysoned
assertion. That when the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
promiseth salvation and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
life, to repentance and
good works, wee deny them
promised to these, as perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
of the Law, but only as
they are fruits of lively faith,
by which the promises of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life are apprehended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> that the Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a constant reveiler of sinne,
wee must by the Law be still
drawne neerer unto Christ:
not onely by the Law to see our
sinne, and in our sinne our need
of Christ: but we must see the
Law fulfilled for us in Christ:
else can we never looke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably
towards the Law. And
because it revelleth sinne: not
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:18870:128"/>
onely <hi>before we come to Christ,</hi>
to bring us first unto him, but
it reverses sinne when <hi>we are
come to Christ:</hi> wee must by it
be brought to Christ still. And
it is false that they say, that the
Law is indeede a scoolemaster
to bring us once unto Christ,
but then wee have done with
it, and it with us; for it must
ever bring us to Christ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so long
as by sinne wee estrange our
selves from him, or him from
us. That place in <hi>Galat. 3. 24,
25.</hi> nothing contrarieth our
doctrine:<note place="margin">

I remit the Reader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Wee must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
the Law in the substance
of it, the <hi>image</hi> of God written
in the heart of <hi>Adam</hi> in inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
and by the finger of the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:18870:128"/>
same spirit written in the
hearts of all the elect: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
must feare &amp; tremble
to sin against this Law, which
floweth from the righteous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of God, and the impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of which is the violating
of his owne image, and nature,
so farre as wee can reach it.
A man may breake the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<hi>Law,</hi> and not violate his
<hi>Person<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> but not Gods: for God
and his image in his Law, are
so straitly united, as one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
wrong the one, and not the
other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninthly,</hi> Wee must frame
our selves to <hi>love</hi> this righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Law, for this image of
God ingraven upon it: yea and
the more that wicked men
hate and resist it, the more that
sonnes of <hi>Belial</hi> rise up against
it; wee must love it the more,
obey it so much the more,
maintain and defend the power
and honour of it, with so much
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:18870:129"/>
the more zeale and earn estnesse,
so did holy <hi>David, Ps. 119. 126.
Wicked men have destroyed the

concludeth them enemies to

time to pleade for God and his
Law, when wicked men most
oppose and oppresse it. Now
