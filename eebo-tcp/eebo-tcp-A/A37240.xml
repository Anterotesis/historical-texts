            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
KINGS
Most Excellent

            <p>THis <hi>Question, SIR,</hi>
Concerning your
Majesties Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in laying Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
ought not to have
been made or moved at all; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit,
it hath been stirred and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated
<pb facs="tcp:93719:3"/>
in Parliament, it is now
become an Argument of such
Dignity and Importance, as the
best-able amongst your Servants
learned in the Law, may well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
their best learning in the
discussing thereof. For my part,
though I find my self unable to
handle this Noble Question, as
the weight and worthinesse re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth;
yet have I upon sundry
occasions arising from the course
of my service, collected such
notes, and drawn together such
materials, as may be of use in the
building of a Fortresse in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of this Prerogative; and
sure I am, that if your Majestie
will vouchsafe to cast your eye
upon these Collections, that your
Judgment will make a far better
use and application thereof, than
<pb facs="tcp:93719:3"/>
I who have gathered the same,
can posible do; these little sparks
of knowledge being taken into
your Majesties consideration, wil
instantly multiply and arise into
a flame, and so give a great light
for clearing of this Question:
This learning within my hand, is
but a Spade, in your Majesties
hand will become a Scepter. I
have onely like the poor <hi>Indian,</hi>
digged up the Oare of Mine,
which being brought into the
Kings Mint, and refined there,
becomes part of the royall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
For the Argument it self, it
will hardly receive any Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<q>Ornari res ipsa negat, contenta
doceri.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The best light I can give it, is

               <p>THe <hi>Question</hi> it self is no more

               </p>
               <p>By the word Imposition, we mean
only such rates or sums of money as the
King by Letters Patents, under the
Great Seal of <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> hath set
upon Merchandizes imported and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported,
and commanded the same to be
paid and levied to His Majesties use, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
and above the Customes and Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
formerly due and payable for the
same Merchandizes.</p>
               <p>By the word Merchandizes, we mean
only such goods or Merchandizes as are
transported over the Seas, from one
Realm or Dominion unto another, to be
sold or exchanged for reasonable gain
or profit; for upon the ingate or outgate
of Commodities so crossing the Seas on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
Customes, Subsidies, and Impositions
for Merchandizes are paid and taken,
and not for any Commodities carried
too and fro by Sea and Land, within one

not only our customary Common Law,

but such other Laws also as be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

doubtlesse they did it by vertue of this
Prerogative given unto them by the
Law of Nations; for Kings upon their

this, by their Prerogative, without the
consent of the people, <hi>Vetusissima coronae

which common reason hath establisht

               <p>Neither is this the onely Prerogative

therefore that Common-wealth of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
hath alwayes had a peculiar and
proper Law to rule and govern it; this
Law is called the Law Merchant, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
the Laws of all Nations do take speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
knowledge; first both the Common
Law and Statute Law of <hi>England</hi> do
take notice of the Law Merchant, and
do leave the causes of Merchants and
Merchandizes to be decided by the rules
of that Law; for what saith the Book of
13 <hi>Edw. 4. 9, 10?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 Edw. 4. 9, 10.</note> A Merchant Stranger
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93719:14"/>
made sute before the Kings Privy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
for certain Bailes of Silk feloniously
taken from him, and it was moved that
this matter might be determined by
Common Law, unto which motion the
Lord Chancellor doth there answer;
This sute is brought by a Merchant, who
is not bound to sue according to the
Law of the Land, nor to tarry the tryal
of twelve men, nor other solemnity of
the Law of the Land; albeit, the King
hath jurisdiction of him within the
Realm, and may cause him to stand to
his Judgement, yet this must be accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the Law of Nature, which some
call the Law Merchant, which is a Law
universall throughout the word; these
are the words of that Book, &amp; it is there
resolved by all the Justices, That if the
Merchandizes of such a Merchant stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
be stollen and waved by the Felon,
the King himselfe shall not take those
Merchandizes as waifes, though in that
case the goods of another person were
lost by the Common Law of <hi>England.</hi>
Doth not this case make it manifest, that
in the judgement of our Common Law,
Merchandizes that crosse the Seas, are
goods of another nature, quality,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93719:15"/>
and consideration, than other goods and
Chattels which are possessed within the
Realm, and do not crosse the Seas? This
learning is not common in our Books,
and therefore I think it meet to exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie
this difference with more cases in
this point.</p>
               <p>If two Merchants be Joynt-Owners,
or Partners in Merchandizes, which they
have acquired by a Joynt-Contract, in
this case the one shall have an Action of
Account against the other, <hi>die legem mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoriam,</hi>
saith the Register, <hi>fol. 135.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Reg. fol. 135.</note> and
<hi>F. N. 117. D.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">F. N. 117. D.</note> and yet by the rule of the
Common Law, if two men be joyntly
possessed of other goods which are not
Merchandizes, the one shall not call the
other to account for the same.</p>
               <p>Again, if two Merchants have a joynt
Interest in Merchandizes, if the own die
the Survivor shall not have all, but the
Executor of the party deceased, shall by
the Law Merchant call the Survivour to
an account for the moytie <hi>F. N. 117. D.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">F. N. 117. D.</note>
whereas if there be two Joynts of other
goods which are not Merchandizes, the
Survivor shall have all, <hi>per jus accrescendi,</hi>
even by rule of the Common Law.</p>
               <p>Again, in an Action of Debt, upon a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93719:15"/>
simple Contract which is without Deed
in writing, the Defendant by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law may wage his Law, that is, he
may bar the Plantiff of his Action by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
an Oath that he doth not ow the
Debt nor any part thereof, and yet in
<hi>Itin. Derby 2 Edw. 3.</hi>

                  <hi>Iohn Crompton</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
upon a Contract without Deed,
the Defendant would have waged his
Law, but was not permitted so to do,
and so Judgement was given against the
said Defendant.</p>
               <p>Again, the goods of Ecclesiastical per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
are discharged of Toll by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, <hi>si non exerceat Marchandizas
de eisdem,</hi> saith the Register, <hi>259. a.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Regist. 259. <hi>a.</hi>
                  </note> for
then their goods are charged, being now
become goods of another nature, when
the same are turned into Merchandizes;
so are the goods of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility
discharged by Gabels and Impositions if
they traffique not, but if they traffique,
saith <hi>Bodin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bodin.</note> their goods are charged like
other Merchandizes.</p>
               <p>Again, for goods wrongfully taken
within the Land, the Common Law gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
remedy against the Trespasser, or
the wrongfull Taker onely; but if an
<hi>English</hi> Merchant be spoiled of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93719:16"/>
upon the Sea, or beyond the
Sea, by the Subject of another King, the

Whereupon the Lord Mayor of <hi>London,</hi>

and delivered the same to <hi>Thomas Debas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi>

Regni ad satisfaciendum Mercatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
Florentinis de pecuniis ipst mutuo tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derunt
Willielmo Episcopo Leodiensi.</hi> Here
we see that <hi>Lex mercatoria,</hi> which doth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93719:16"/>
apparently differ from the ordinary Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law of this Kingdom, is said to be
<hi>Consuetudo Regni.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And lastly, in a sute at the Common
Law no mans Writing can be pleaded
against him as his Act and Deed, unlesse
the same be sealed and delivered; but
in a sute between Merchants, Bills of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
Bills of Exchange, being but Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckets
without Seals, Letters of advice
and credences, Policies of assurance,
Assignations of debts, all which are of
no force at the Common Law, are of
good credit and force by the Law Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.</p>
               <p>Thus we see how Merchandizes do
differ from other goods and Chattles in
the eye of the Law, and how the Law
Merchant doth differ from the common
Law of <hi>England,</hi> and how the Common
Law doth admit and allow thereof. Our
Parliaments likewise have not onely
made extraordinary provision for the
more speedy recovery of Debts due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Merchants for their Merchandizes,
than is provided by our Common Law,
as appeareth by the Statute of <hi>Acton Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell,</hi>
made the 11 <hi>Ed. 1.</hi> and the Statute
<hi>de Mercatoribus</hi> made <hi>13 Ed. 1.</hi> but also
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93719:17"/>
have course of proceedings, in cases of
Merchants differing from the course of
our Common Law, for by the Statute of
27 <hi>Ed. 3. cap. 2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">27 E. 3. Cap. 2.</note> it is declared, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in causes of Merchants shall be
from day to day, and hour to hour, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Law of the Staple, and
not according to the course of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law; and by another Article in
the same Parliament, that all Merchants
comming to the Staple, should be ruled
according to the Law of Merchants,
touching all things comming to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not by the Common Law of the
Land; and by another Article, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Benches, nor any ordinary
Judges of the Common Law shall have
any Jurisdiction in those cases; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that the Law of Marque and Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall,
which is a branch of the Law Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
shall be used as it had been used
in times past. So as the Parliament doth
but declare the ancient Law, and doth
not introduce a new Law in those ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</p>
               <p>Untill I understood this difference
between Merchandizes &amp; other goods,
and between the Law Merchant and
the Common law of <hi>England,</hi> I confess
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93719:17"/>
I did not a little marvell, <hi>England</hi> being
so rich, and entertaining Traffique with
all Nations of the World, having so
many fair Ports and so good Shipping,
the King of <hi>England</hi> also being the Lord
of the Sea, and also a principall part of
his Royal Revenue consisting in duties
payable for Merchandizes, so as many
Questions must of necessity arise in all
ages touching Merchants and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes,
What should be the cause that in
our Books of the Common Law of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
there are to be found so few cases
concerning Ships or Merchants, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Customes or Impositions paya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
for Merchandizes.</p>
               <p>But now the reason thereof is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
for the Common Law of the Land
doth leave these cases to be ruled by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<hi>Law,</hi> namely the <hi>Law</hi> Merchant,
which is a branch of the <hi>Law</hi> of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>The Law Merchant, as it is a part of
the Law of Nature and Nations, is
universall and one and the same in all
Countries in the World, for as <hi>Cicero</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cicero.</note>
saith of the Law of Nations, <hi>Non erit alia
lex Romae, alia Athenis, alia nunc, alia posthac,

                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> perpetua continebit, &amp;c.</hi> So may
we say of the Law Merchant, there is
not one Law in <hi>England,</hi> another in
<hi>France,</hi> another in <hi>Spain,</hi> another in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi>
but the same rules of reason, and
the like proceedings of the Law Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
are observed in every Nation; for
as our Chancellor of <hi>England</hi> affirmeth,
13 <hi>E. 4. 9.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">13 E. 4. 9.</note> That the proceedings of the
Law Merchant ought to be according to
the Law of Nature, which is universall;
so say the Civilians of severall Nations.
The <hi>Italian</hi> Doctor saith, <hi>In curia merca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum
naturalis aequitas praecipue expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anda,
&amp; ex aequo &amp; bono causas dirimendas

likewise saith, <hi>Apices &amp; subtilitas

whereby it is manifest, that causes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Merchants and Merchandizes,
are not wont to be decided by the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar

but by the generall Law of Nature

this Conclusion. Suppose it be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Taxes and Tallages may not be laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93719:18"/>
our goods within the land, without
an Act of Parliament, yet by the Law of
Nations, and by the Law Merchant,
which are also the Law of <hi>England,</hi> in
cases of Merchandizes the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as well as other Kings, may by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Prerogative, without Act of
Parliament, lay Impositions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
crossing the Seas, being goods
whereupon the Law doth set another
character than goods possessed in the
land, as is before expressed.</p>

               <p>But this is to be understood of causes
arising within the Land onely; for all

for the most part concerning Merch. and
Merchandizes crossing the seas, our Kings
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93719:20"/>
have ever used the <hi>Roman</hi> Civil Law for
the deciding &amp; determining therof, as the
<hi>Romans</hi> did use the Law of the <hi>Rhodians</hi>

by the King of <hi>England</hi> to his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall,
who in his Court of Admiralty
doth proceed in those cases according
to the rule of the Civil Law.</p>
               <p>Now for the Rules of the Civill Law
touching the power of Kings, in laying
Impositions upon Merchandizes, the
same are clear without question, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served
without contradiction in all the
nations of the world, <hi>Regii tantum juris ac
muneris est vectigalia imponere, redditus, seu
vectigalia portus quae perveniant ex his quae

And if it be objected, That these rules

of the Emperour, a learned Civilian hath

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Kings Prerogatives in general, and
that the same do consist in certain speciall
points or cases reserved to the absolute
power of the Crown; when the Positive
Law was first established, and that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
Law of <hi>England</hi> doth acknowledge
and submit it self to those Prerogatives.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY the Law of Nature all things were
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon, and all persons equal, there
was neither <hi>Meum</hi> nor <hi>Tuum,</hi> there was
neither King nor Subject; then came in
the Law of Nations, which did limit the
Law of Nature, and brought in proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
which brought in community of
things, which brought in Kings and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
which took away equality of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
for property caused Contracts,
Trade, and Traffique, which could not
be ministred without a King or Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate;
so as the first and principal cause
of making Kings, was to maintain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
and Contracts, and Traffique, and
Commerce amongst men. Hereupon by
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:93719:24"/>
the same Law of Nations, Tributes and
Customes became due to the King or
Prince to maintain him in his place of
Government, <hi>quasi Ministerii sui stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
saith the School-man, <hi>Deo Minister est
tibi in bonum ideo &amp; tributa potestas,</hi> saith
Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> and all these things, namely
Property, and Contract, and Kings, and
Customes, were before any positive Law
was made; then came the positive Law,
and limited the Law of Nations, whereas
by the Law of Nations the King had an
absolute and unlimited power in all
matters whatsoever. By the positive
Law the King himself was pleased to
limit and stint his absolute power, and to
tye himself to the ordinary rules of the
Law, in common and ordinary cases,
worthily and princely, according to the
Roman Emperour, <hi>Dignissimum Principe
Rex se allegatum legibus confiteri,</hi> retaining
and reserving notwithstanding in many
points that absolute &amp; unlimited power
which was given unto him by the Law
of Nations, and in these cases or points,
the Kings Prerogatives do confist; so as
the Kings Prerogatives were not grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto him by the people, but reserved
by himself to himself, when the positive
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:93719:24"/>
Law was first established; and the King
doth exercise a double power, <hi>viz.</hi> an
absolute power, or <hi>Merum Imperium,</hi>
when he doth use Prerogatives onely,
which is not bound by the positive Law;
and an ordinary power of Jurisdiction,
which doth co-operate with the Law, &amp;
whereby he doth minister Justice to the
people, according to the prescript rule
of the positive Law; as for example, the
King doth not condemn all Malefactors,
but by the rule of the positive Law; but
when the Malefactor is condemned by
the Law, he giveth him a pardon by his
absolute Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Again, the King doth punish the
breach of the Peace within the Land, by
the ordinary course of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon Law,
but he doth make War and Peace with
Forreign Nations, <hi>Quod pertinet ad libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
jus gladii,</hi> as a Doctor speaketh, by
that absolute and unlimited power,
which the Law of Nations hath given
unto him.</p>
               <p>Again, the King doth establish the
Standard of Money by vertue of his
Prerogative only, for the Common Law
doth give no rule touching the matter,
or form, or value thereof; but when
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93719:25"/>
those Monies are dispersed into the
hands of the Subjects, the same do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
subject in respect of the property
thereof, to the ordinary rules of the
Common Law.</p>
               <p>Again, the right of Free-hold and
all Inheritance, and all Contracts reall
and personall, arising within the Land,
are left to be decided by the positive
Law of the Land; but the Government
and ordering of Traffique, Trade, and
Commerce, both within the Land and
without, doth rest in the Crown as a
principall Prerogative, wherein the
King is like to <hi>Primum mobile,</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth
about all the inferiour Spheres in
his superiour Course, and yet doth suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
all the Planets underneath him to
finish all their divers and particular
courses; or rather he doth imitate the
Divine Majesty, which in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the world doth suffer things for
the most part to passe according to the
order and course of Nature, yet many
times doth shew his extraordinary
power in working of miracles above
Nature.</p>
               <p>And truly, as the King doth suffer
the customary Law of <hi>England</hi> to have
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:93719:25"/>
her course on the one side, so doth the
same Law yeeld, submit, and give way
to the Kings Prerogative over the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and therefore in the <hi>1 Hen. 7. fol.
23.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 H. 7. fol. 23.</note> there is a rule, That every Custome
is void in Law <hi>quae exaltat in praerogativum
Regis,</hi> which is an argument, that the
Kings Prerogative is more ancient than
the customary Law of the Realm; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
the power of the Kings Prerogative
above the Common Law doth appear in
this, That whereas all privileges do
flow, and are derived from the Kings
Prerogative, and every privilege in one
point or other <hi>privat communem legem,</hi> yet
the Common Law doth admit and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
of privileges granted by vertue of
the King Prerogative.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Kings Prerogative in the ordering
and governing of all Trade and Traffique
in Corporations, Markets, and Fairs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Land, and the Common Law doth
acknowledge this Prerogative, and submit
it self thereunto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIrst, it is manifest that all Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Cities and Boroughes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Land, were chiefly instituted for
Trade and Commerce, and not by the
rule of Common Law; no such Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
can be made but by the Kings
Charter; for though there have been
some Corporations which have been
time out of mind, yet the Law presumes
that the same at first had their begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
by the Grant of the King; besides,
we find in divers ancient Charters made
unto those Corporations, a power grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto the King to take <hi>de omnibus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
venalibus</hi> within their Liberties, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sums of Money, <hi>viz. de libra piperis,</hi>
so much, <hi>de libra zinziberis,</hi> so much, <hi>de
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93719:26"/>
quolibet panno, &amp;c.</hi> for murage, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the reparation of their Walls,
which is nothing else but an Imposition
laid by the Kings Charter to maintain
those Cities &amp; Boroughs wherein Trade
and Traffique is maintained; wee find
such a Charter granted to <hi>Nottingham, 3
Edw. 1. pat. m. 21.<note place="margin">3 Edw. 1 pat. m 21</note> in Arch. turris London.</hi>
The like is granted to <hi>Cloneniell,</hi> and to

in <hi>England,</hi> to take for five years a
certain sum of Money of every Passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
toward the paving of the same
Town.</p>
               <p>Again, no Fair or Market may bee
holden within the Realm, neither can
a multitude of Subjects assemble them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
together to that end, without a
speciall Warrant or Grant of the King;
and when a Subject hath a Grant of a
Fair, he hath a Court of Py-powder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
thereunto, wherein the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in Summary <hi>&amp; de plano</hi> from hour to
hour, as in the Court of Merchants;
And for the Government of all Fairs and
Markets, especially touching Weights
and Measures, the Standard whereof was
first established by the Kings Ordinance,

to whom the establishing of the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard
Monies, which is <hi>mensura publica
omnium rerum commutabilium,</hi> is also reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
as a speciall Commoditie.</p>
               <p>Besides, in every Fair and Market
where things are bought by retail, for
the necessary use of the Buyer, and not
to sell the same again as Merchandizes in
another Market, for that is regrating and
unlawfull, by the rule of the Common
Law, There is a Toll taken, which is
nothing else but an Imposition laid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Buyer, and that that Toll was
originally imposed by the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
it is manifest in this, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Tenants of the Crown, namely the
Tenants in ancient Demeasne, are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
of Toll in all Markets and Fairs;
and that the King by Charter hath dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
divers other persons of Toll, as
appeareth in the Register of Writs, and
<hi>Fitz. Na. Brevium,</hi> where we find divers
Writs <hi>essend quiet de Theolneo.</hi> But
this discharge of Toll is onely for things
bought for necessary use of the Buyer,
and for Merchandizes, for the Tenants
in ancient Demeasne are discharged of
Toll, for such things only as are for their
provisions, or manurance of their lands,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:93719:27"/>
and in the Writ which dischargeth the
goods of Ecclesiasticall persons of this
Toll, there is this clause, <hi>dummodo non fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciat
Merchandizas de iisdem,</hi> as is before
declared.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Kings Prerogative in the
Ordering and Government of Trade
within the Realm, doth appear in that
notable Charter granted to the Abbot
of <hi>Westminster,</hi> recited in the Register of

               <argument>
                  <p>That the King hath another Prerogative in the
Government in the Trade of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
crossing the Seas, differening from the
Prerogative which he useth and ordereth
in Trade and Traffique in Markets and
Fairs within the Land, and of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between Custome and Toll by the rules
of the Common Law.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TOuching Merchandizes crossing
the Seas outward and inward, the
same are of another quality, and the Law
hath another consideration thereof, than
it hath of such things as are bought and
sold in Fairs and Markets within the
Land, as is before expressed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the duties payable upon the expor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and importation of Merchandizes,
have another name, being called Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes,
and not Toll,<note place="margin">Custome and Toll.</note> and are also paid
in another manner, for Customes must
be paid before the Merchandizes be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
and brought to Land; whereas
toll is not paiable but for goods brought
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:93719:28"/>
into the Fair or Market.</p>
               <p>Again, Custome must be paid whether
the Merchandizes be sold or not, but
Toll is not due but for goods bought
and sold in the Market.</p>
               <p>Again, Custom is alwayes paid by the
Merchant, who selleth or intendeth
to sell his Merchandizes in grosse; but
Toll is ever paid by the party who buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
some Commodity for his proper use
and provision by retail.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if Customes be not paid or
agreed for before the Merchandizes be
discharged and brought to Land, the
Merchandizes are <hi>ipso facto</hi> forfeited, and
may presently be seized to the use of the
King; but if Toll be not paid, the thing
sold is not forfeited, only it may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
and detained till the Toll bee
paid; or an Action upon the Case may
be brought for the Toll. These differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
between Custome and Toll do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
prove that Merchandizes for
which Customes are paid, do differ from
other goods sold in the Markets and
Fairs, for which Toll is taken, and that
the Trade of Merchandizes crossing
the Seas, and the Trade that is used in
Markets and Fairs, are ordered by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93719:29"/>
Prerogatives; and as the Tolls of
severall kinds which are taken in Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,
Fairs, and Towns Corporate, were
first imposed by vertue of that Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
whereby the King ordereth all
Trade within the Land; so by vertue of
that other Prerogative whereby the
King governeth the Trade of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
crossing the Seas, the Crown of
<hi>England,</hi> ever since the first institution of
the Monarchy, hath from time to time
raised and received out of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
Customes, and Impositions, of divers
Nature and Natures, according to the
diversities of Merchandizes exported
and imported, and the divers occasions
and necessities of the comercion.</p>

                  <p>Of the ancient duty called Custome, payable

               </argument>
               <p>THE ancient duties payable for
Merchandizes, were but of two
kinds, and known by two names, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
and Prizes; Customes were paid
for Homebred and Native Commodities
exported, and Prizes were taken out of
Forreign Commodities imported.</p>
               <p>The Native Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>modities out of which
Custome was paid, were Wooll, Wooll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fells,
and Leather, and this Custome did
consist of rertain rates or sums of Mony,
imposed by the King upon those Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
exported, which rates were
raised and reduced higher or lower, from
time to time, as occasion did arise; for
although in the time of King <hi>Edw. 1.</hi> the
Customes payable for those Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
were reduced to this certainty, <hi>viz.</hi>
to a demi mark for every Sack of Wooll,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:93719:30"/>
a demi mark for every three hundred
Wooll-fells, and a mark for every last of
Leather, which we call now the great
and ancient Custome, <hi>ab initio non fuit sic,</hi>
these were not the rates from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
for not long before that time there
was a greater and more ancient Custome
paid for the exportation of those Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,

this Custome of a demi mark was a

which was then thought rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
(as after upon sundry Petitions

of time, the name of the great and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93719:31"/>
Custome; this Custome of demi
mark was not granted to the King by
Parliament, but reduced to that rate by
the King, by the prayer of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mons,
as is expressed in the Record of 3. <hi>Edw. 1.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Edw. 1.</note>
                  <hi>fin. memb. 24.</hi> for albeit the Charter for
confirmation of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> made in
<hi>25 Edw. 1.</hi> doth recite, That the demi
mark was granted by the Cominaltie, yet
is there no Act of P. printed or recorded,
wherein that grant of the Cominaltie
doth appear, neither can it stand with
the rule of reason that the demi mark
being a diminution of the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
should proceed from the grant of
the Cominalty to the King, for the King
would never have accepted of such a
grant as did diminish his Revenue, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had it been thank-worthy or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable,
and therefore the King having
a Negative voice, would never have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
his assent to such a grant in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
but it is to be presumed that this
diminution of the ancient Custome was
made in Parliament, and not by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that by prayer of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as the Record of <hi>3 Edw. 1. Rot.
fin. memb. 24.</hi>

                  </note> testifieth, the King was then
well pleased for that time to draw down
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93719:31"/>
the ancient Custome to that rate, and the
people did willingly yeeld and consent
to the payment thereof; and this I take
to be the true interpretation of the
Charter or Statute made in <hi>25 Edw. 1.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Statute 25 E. 1.</note>
And therefore because we find no Act of
Parliament whereby the people did ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
grant the great and ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
to the King, and because we find
it was uncertain and subject to diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and alteration, we may conclude,
that it was but an imposition laid by the
King from time to time by vertue of his
Prerogative, without any grant from the
Cominalty of the Realm who can make
no grant but by Act of Parliament; &amp; in
truth it were absurd to affirme, that the
great and ancient Custome imposed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Native commodities of the Kingdom
was first granted by Act of Parliament;
since it cannot be imagined that ever
those commodities did passe out of the
Kingdom, without Custome, being equal
in time with the first Scepter; and since
the Scepter was established many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
years before the people were called
to be in Parliament; besides, the very
name of Custome doth note and argue
that it began before any Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93719:32"/>
was made, for that it signifieth a
duty payable or accustomable to be paid

               <p>FOr the Forreign commodities which
are brought into <hi>England,</hi> our Kings
in ancient times did not take any Rates,
or Customes, or Sums of Money, but took

price as themselves did likewise think
fit and reasonable, which was called the
Kings price; this Prerogative is proved
by the rule of the Imperiall Law, <hi>Rex non
recognoscens superiorem potest Ã¨ India in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria

given <hi>31 Edw. 3. 60.</hi>

<hi>Norwich</hi> having forfeited to the King
thirty Talents of Beasants of Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the quantity and value thereof
was uncertain, it was adjudged that the
Kings House should set down of what
quantity and value every Talent should
be, and that the same should be paid ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly;
and by the same Prerogative,
whensoever any Subject is to pay a Fine
or Ransome unto the King for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
The King himfelf doth limit

               <p>The Forreign commodities thus ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the King in <hi>Spain,</hi> at his own

these prizes were many times grievances

called <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> made in the

31 year of his reign, did remit unto all

&amp;c.</hi> and the Charter doth further recite,
That for the remission of these prizes the
Merchants Strangers did grant unto the
King three pence upon the pound, now
called the petty-custome, out of all For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Merchandizes imported, except
Wines; and for our Native commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties

a demi mark, over and above the
duties payable by Denizens for the same
commodities; which grant being made
by the Merchants of every Nation, not
being incorporated and made a body
politick, is in respect of them of no force
of the rule of the common Law, until the

conjecture, what easie rates the King gave

This Custome of Prizage was meerly an

Afterwards the Records of this Kings
time do plentifully declare, That he by
vertue of his Prerogative, without Act of
Parliament, laid many great Impositions,
and raised extraordinary profit upon
Merchandizes, though not alwayes after
one manner, yet all the means he used
may be reduced unto three kinds.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he did impose certain rates
or sums of Money upon Merchandizes,
as fourty shillings upon a Sack of Wooll,
with a ratable proportion upon other
commodities, for levying whereof hee
only sent out his Writs to the Collectors
of his Customes in every Port; and this
kind of Imposition being of the nature
of the Impositions now in question, was
more usuall and frequent than any other
in this Kings reign, as appeareth by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
Records in the Exchequer, and in
the Tower of <hi>London, 17 E. 3. Rot. 308. in

At other times he sent out Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to take up great quantities of Wooll
and other commodities, at a low price,
set by himself, and transported the same
beyond the Seas, where he made the best
profit thereof, for payment of the wages
of his Army there, as appeareth by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall

did remit all prizes to Merchant Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
by <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> as is before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed;

was at liberty to take prizes of them
as well as Strangers.</p>
               <p>The King did many times shut up all
the Ports, and stop all Trade, and then
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93719:39"/>
granted licences to all particular persons
to transport Wool and other commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for which licences he took fourty
shillings, sometimes fifty shillings for a

Merchandizes, and this is manifest by

               <p>Thus did this warlike and politique
Prince, King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> by his Prerogative,
without Act of Parliament, lay sundry
Impositions and charges upon all sorts of
Merchandizes; and although upon Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Subjects in Parliament, when
they granted him other Aids and Subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of greater value than these his Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
he did many times remit and

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Profits raised unto the Crown out of
Merchandizes during the reigns of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Kings who succeeded K. <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> untill
the reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>TRue it is, that during the reign of
these Princes, we finde no Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
directly set upon Merchandizes
by their absolute power or prerogative;
but they did not forbear to lay Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
directly, for that they wanted right
so to doe, or because they doubted of
their right in that behalf; for they well
knew they had the same right, the same
prerogative, and absolute power that
their Predecessors had; but because
they found other means to make other
profit upon transporting of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizÃ©s,
and that in another manner, and
in so high measure, as the trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
in those daies could hardly
bear any greater charge, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of overthrowing all Trade and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce:
And therefore those Princes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93719:40"/>
did in their wisdomes forbear to lay any
further Impositions by their Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives:
For these Kings who reigned after
King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> who conquered <hi>Callis</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> and before Queen <hi>Mary</hi> lost <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi>
had two principal waies and meanes
to raise extraordinary profits upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
but proceeding from one
cause, namely, from establishing the
Staple at <hi>Callis;</hi> for King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> some
few yeares before his death, did by his
Prerogative in point of Government,
without Act of Parliament, erect a Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at his Town of <hi>Callis,</hi> and did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
and command,<note place="margin">Staple at Callis.</note> that all the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
exported out of <hi>England,
Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> by any Merchant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nison,
or Alien, should presently be
carried to the Staple at <hi>Callis,</hi> and to no
other place beyond the Seas. This Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
at <hi>Callis</hi> was first setled and fixed
there by an Ordinance which the King
made by virtue of his Prerogative and
absolute power in the government of
Trade and Comerce, without Act of
Parliament: And if this Ordinance so
made had been thought unlawful, and
against the liberty of the Subject, it
would never have been approved and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93719:41"/>
confirmed by the Judgements of so
many Parliaments in the times of <hi>Rich.
2. Hen. 4. Hen. 5.</hi> and <hi>Edw. 4.</hi> Neither
could there have been such heavy penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
layd by those Parliaments upon the
transgressors of those Ordinances: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> the
sixth, it was made Felony to Transport
any Merchandizes to any part beyond
the Seas but to <hi>Callis</hi> onely. Now the
Staple of <hi>Callis</hi> being thus established,
there did arise a double profit to the
Crown for transportieg of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
over and above the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
and other Subsidies granted by
Parliament.</p>
               <p>First it came to pass, that the Customs
and Subsidies for Merchandizes trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
out of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
which before was single, and payd
but once, that is, upon the outgate;
after the establishing of the Staple at
<hi>Callis,</hi> the duties for the same Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
became double at the least, and
for the most part treble, and were ever
payd twice, and for the most part thrice;
namely, once upon the outgate in the
Ports of <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland;</hi>
secondly, upon the ingate at <hi>Callis;</hi> and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93719:41"/>
because all the commodities brought
into <hi>Callis</hi> could not be vented into the
main Land there, but the greatest part
was to be exported again by Sea into
higher or lower <hi>Germany,</hi> and other the
North-East Countries, and some into
<hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Hands of the
<hi>Levant,</hi> there did arise a third payment
of Customes and Subsidies for so much
of their commodities as were exported
again cut of <hi>Callis,</hi> by meanes whereof
the Customes and Subsidies did amount
to threescore thousand, or threescore
and ten thousand pounds sterling, <hi>per
annum,</hi> in the latter times of King <hi>Edw.</hi>
3.<note place="margin">E. 3.</note> and during the reign of <hi>Rich. 2. Hen.
4.<note place="margin">R. 2. H. 4.</note> Hen. 5.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">H. 5.</note> and the beginning of the
reign of <hi>Hen. 6.</hi> as appears by the Records
of the Exchequer of <hi>England,</hi> which
according to the valuation of Moneys at
this day, the ounce of Silver being now
raised from two shillings to five shillings,
do make two hundred thousand pound
sterling, <hi>per annum,</hi> which doth equal, or
surmount all the Customes, Subsidies,
and Impositions received at this day,
though that plenty of money, and price
of all things, and consequently the
expences of the Crown be exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93719:42"/>
increased in these times.</p>
               <p>And albeit the breach of Amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Crown of <hi>England</hi> and the
Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> who was the Lord of
the Lower <hi>Germany,</hi> in the weak and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate
time of King <hi>Hen. 6.</hi> did cause
a stop of Trade between us, and that
Country into which the greatest part of
our Staple wares, especially Wooll and
Cloth were vented, and uttered,
and was likewise the cause of loss
of all our Territories in <hi>France,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<hi>Callis,</hi> and all the Merchandizes
thereof, whereby the Customes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
duties payable for Merchandizes
were in the time of that unhappy Prince
withdrawn, and diminished to a low
proportion; yet afterwards upon the
Mariage of <hi>Margaret,</hi> Sister to King <hi>E. 4.</hi>
unto the Lord Duke of <hi>Burgundy,</hi> as that
in honour of the English Wooll, which
brought so much Gold into his Country,
he instituted the Order of the Golden
Fleece; and thereupon the Customes,
Subsidies, and Impositions were raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
to so high a Revenue, as our Kings
could not well, in policy, strain that
strength of profit upon Merchandizes
any higher.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:93719:42"/>
Secondly, albeit the Staple established
at <hi>Callis</hi> being first established by an order
made by the Kings Prerogative and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power, was afterwards approved
and confirmed by sundry Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet did the King by another Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
retain a power to dispence with
that Ordinance, and those Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and to give license to such, and
so many Merchants as himself thought
fit, to export any Merchandizes out of
<hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> unto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
parts beyond the Seas besides, <hi>Ã  non
obstante</hi> of the first Ordinance, and of the
Statutes which did establish the Staple
at <hi>Callis.</hi> By virtue of this Prerogative
and power, the several Kings who had
<hi>Callis</hi> in their possessions, did grant so
many Licences to Merchants, as well A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liens
as Denizens, to transport our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
commodities immediately into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places without coming to <hi>Callis,</hi> for
which Licences, whereof there are an
incredible number found in the Records
of <hi>England,</hi> the Merchants payd so dear
for their commodities, especially the
<hi>Genoeses,</hi> and the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and other
Merchants of the <hi>Levant,</hi> as by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
made of those Licences did amount
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:93719:43"/>
to double the value of those Customes
and Subsidies payable for exportation
thereof; and thereof those Princes as
they had the less need, so had they no
reason at all to charge the Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
with any other, or greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.</p>
               <p>In these two points before expressed
doe consist the principal cause why the
Princes of <hi>England</hi> who succeeded King
<hi>Edw. 3.</hi> who won <hi>Callis,</hi> untill the reign of
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> who lost <hi>Callis,</hi> did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
use their Prerogative in setting
any other Impositions upon Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes
above the ancient Customes and
Subsidies granted by Parliament: For it is
to be observed, that most part of those
Princes who reigned after K. <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> and
before Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> had the Subsidy of
Tonnage and Poundage granted unto
them by Parliament, which being added
to the gain of the Staple of <hi>Callis,</hi> did
augment not a little the profit layd upon
Merchandizes. And may be a reason
likewise why those Kings did forbear to
lay any other Impositions by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</p>
               <p>We may adde hereunto other reasons.
First, <hi>Rich. 2.</hi> was a <hi>Minor,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:93719:43"/>
by the great Princes of the Blood,
who would not suffer him to use his
Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that during the Wars of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York</hi> there was no fit time
to make use of that Prerogative, while
both parties did strive to win the favour
of the people.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that King <hi>Hen. 7.</hi> had much
ado to settle himself in the quiet posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of the Kingdome after those trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that King <hi>H. 8.</hi> had such a
mass of Treasure left him by his Father,
and did so inrich himself by dissolution
of Abbyes, as he had no need to make
use of this Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Fiftly, that K. <hi>E. 6.</hi> was also a <hi>Minor,</hi>
and that his chiefest Council did more
contend to advance their own houses
than the Kings profit.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That Queen <hi>Mary</hi> did use her Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in laying Impositions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>QUeen <hi>Mary,</hi> in whose time the
Town of <hi>Callis</hi> was lost, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently
the benefit of the Staple at
<hi>Callis</hi> was lost, did by her absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
as appeareth by the Report of the

upon Clothes, <hi>viz.</hi> six shillings
and eight pence upon every Cloth, over
and above all Customes and Subsidies.
True it is, that the Merchants petition'd
to be disburthened of this Imposition,
which was referred to the consideration
of the Justices, and other; whereupon
they had many assemblies and confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
as that Book reporteth: And
albeit the Resolution of the Judges in
that behalf be not found in that book,
it is to be presumed, That they adjudged
the Imposition to be just and lawfull,
because it was continued and answered
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:93719:44"/>
during all the Reign of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi>
This Queen <hi>Mary</hi> likewise by her Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onely,

which during her life time was payd

of which Cities and Townes are
exempted and discharged of Poundage
granted by Act of Parliament there,
which Imposition was never impugned
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> but hath since the setting
thereof been levied and payd without
contradiction. And that wee see how
long the Crown of <hi>England</hi> hath been
seised of this Prerogative, in laying
Impositions upon Merchandizes, and
how the same hath been put in practice
by the most prudent Princes since the
Conquest.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The general reasons whereupon this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is grounded.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALthough it be a matter of difficulty,
and doth savour withall of curiosity
and presumption, to search a reason for
every Prerogative that is incident to the
Crown; for <hi>Sacrilegii est disputare de
Principis facto,</hi> saith the Imperial Law;
and <hi>Scrutator Majestatis opprimitur Ã 
gloria,</hi> saith the Wise man: Yet the
reasons whereupon this Prerogative is
grounded are so many, and manifest, as
it were not amiss to collect the principal
of them, rather for the confirmation,
than the satisfaction of such as have
moved this question touching the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
of Impositions layd by his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
upon Merchandizes.</p>
               <p>First, the King is the Fountain of all
Justice, and therefore the first reason
drawn from the Kings charge in doing
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:93719:47"/>
Justice, and procuring Justice to be done
to Merchants, not onely distributive
Justice, wherein consisteth <hi>Praemium</hi> and
<hi>Paena,</hi> but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mutative Justice is also deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the king. Now his Majesty doth
exercise commutative Justice chiefly in
the ordering and government of Trade
and Comerce, wherein hee is to doe
Justice, or to procure Justice to be done
to his Subjects, who do make contracts
real and personal within the Land: But
to his Merchants that trade and traffique
with Forrein Nations, and to Strangers
that trade &amp; traffick with us, for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mutative Justice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Land, the King receiveth sundry
profits, which grew first by way of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.
A man cannot recover a Debt
in the Kings Court, but first he payeth
the King a Fine for his first Process:
Land cannot be conveighed by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Recovery but a Fine for the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
must be payd to the King. Neither
can Land be passed from one to another
by Fine in the Kings Court, but the
Kings Silver must be payd, <hi>pro licentia
concordandi.</hi> Adde hereunto the profit
of the Seals in all the Kings Courts, for
all manner of Writs: And yet the King
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:93719:48"/>
                  <hi>in Charta magna</hi> did promise, <hi>Nulli nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimus,
nulli vendemus Iustitiam vel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum;</hi>
but the Kings taking of these, and
the like Duties, is no breach of the great
Charter, for that the same was imposed
by the King long before the Charter was
made and taken, <hi>ut Ministerii sui stipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi>
as the Schoolman speaketh; and
withall to recompence the charge of the
Crown in maintaining the Court of
Justice: See <hi>Bodin lib. 6. de Repub. cap. 2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Bodin lib. 6: de re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pub. ca. 2.</note>
where hee speaketh of the like profit
made upon the Process in <hi>France:</hi> And
shews that the antient Romans did the
like: And the Emperour <hi>Caligula</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Caligula:</note> took
the fortieth penny of that which was
demanded in every several Civil Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
If then such profits be taken for
the King in his Courts of Justice within
the Land, towards the charge which he
sustaineth in the maintainance of these
Courts and the Offices thereof, which
duties were at first limitted and imposed
by the King himself without any Act of
Parliament; for who ever heard of an
Act of Parliament whereby the same
were granted? Is there not as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why the charge of the King in doing
Justice, and procuring Justice to be done
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:93719:48"/>
unto Merchants, whose residence and
comerce is for the most part out of the
Land, should be recompenced out of
Merchandizes imported, and exported,
not according to the will of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
and pleasure of the people,
but proportionable according to the
Kings charge, which being best known
to himself, it is most meet that the
recompence should be limitted by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self?</p>
               <p>Touching the charge of the King in
doing, and appointing Justice to be done
to Merchants; Are not all Leagues,
Truces, and Treaties of State with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein
Princes, wherein the publique
Trade and Comerce of Merchants are
ever included, concluded, and made
at the Kings charge? Did not the Kings
Council of State, and high Court of
Chancery give more speedy hearing to
the causes of Merchants than to the
causes of other Subjects? Doth not the
King maintain a Court of Admiralty for
deciding of Marine causes, which doe
for the most part concern Merchants?
Doth he not bear the charge of several
Leiger Ambassadors in <hi>Italy,</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> in the <hi>Lom. Countries,</hi> in <hi>Turkie,</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:93719:49"/>
whose principal Negotiation doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist
in procuring Justice to be done to
our Merchants? And if our Merchants
doe suffer wrong in any Forein Country
by reason of any defective neglect in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Justice there, doth not the King by
his Prerogative grant them Letters of
Mart, or Reprisal, that they may right
themselves, which is a <hi>species justi
Belli,</hi> as the Civilians call it? And if
the injury done to the Merchants bee
multiplyed and continued with a high
hand, Is it not the Kings Office to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
and prosecute War against such
a people as doth refuse to doe Justice
unto his Merchants? For this cause the
Romans began the first Punick War,
saith <hi>Appian, Cicero</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Appian. Cicero.</note> in his Oration <hi>pro
Lege Manlia,</hi> affirmeth, <hi>Populum Romanum
faepe Mercatoribus Injuria suis tractata bella
gessisse.</hi> Briefly, the plenty of Money
being greater in this Age than ever was
there by reason of so many Millions of
Gold and Silver brought from the <hi>Indies</hi>
into <hi>Europe,</hi> and the price of all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
being withall greatly enhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
and the charges and expences of
Princes exceedingly encreased, is it meet
or just that: the King at this day should
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:93719:49"/>
be stinted or bound to that old Demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
onely for Native commodities, or
the three pence of the pound for the
Forein commodities which <hi>Edw. 1.</hi> was
content to accept of four hundred years
since, or a single poundage onely, which
in the time of King <hi>Edw. 4.</hi> was not suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to maintain the necessary charges
of keeping the Sea, as the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
<hi>12. Edw. 4. cap. 5.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12 Ed. 4. cap. 5.</note> which grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that Subsidy to the King, reciteth
all the Kings charge in supporting the
Trade of Merchants being unlimited,
and infinite: And shall the duties pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for Merchandizes be stinted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
to such a proportion only as the
Subject shall bee pleased to grant unto
him? Assuredly if the King had not a
Prerogative of his own absolute power
without Act of Parliament, to increase
the duties payable for Merchandizes at
this day, a Merchants Counting-house
would be richer than the Kings Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer;
and the Subject who may live
privately, and moderate his expenses,
and yet raise the Fines of his Coppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds,
and Rents of his Demeans with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
controlement, would be in better
case than the King, who by reason of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:93719:50"/>
the Majesty of his Estate cannot abridge
his charges, and yet should have no
power of himself without leave of his
Subjects to increase his Revenue.</p>
               <p>Again, the King is not only at charge
in doing of Justice to his Merchants at
home, and in procuring Justice to bee
done to them abroad, but he doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
maintain a Royall Navy of Ships, the
best, the fairest, the strongest in the world
at this day, to protect all Merchants from
spoyl and Piracy on the sea. In the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance
of this Navy, the King doth
expend more Treasure than the whole
Revenue of some of his Predecessors did
amount to.</p>
               <p>And he doth not onely secure Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
by Sea, but he gives them safe
conduct by Land also, as appeareth by
the great Charter: So as they may well
give our King that title which <hi>virgil</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Virgil.</note>
gives to the King of Bees, <hi>Ille operum cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stos:</hi>
And seeing Merchants are most
likely resembled to those Industrious
creatures, because they bring the hony
to the Kings Hives, to wit, to his Havens
and Ports, where they, and their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
bee protected and reserved,
why should they not imitate the Bees in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:93719:50"/>
observing their King, and in making him
partaker of the fruit of their labours?
Neither is it a new thing, or an invention
of this Age, to lay Impositions upon
Merchants for their Waftage and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
at Sea; for <hi>plinius</hi> tels us, <hi>lib. 19. cap. 4.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Plin. lib. 19. cap. 4.</note>
                  <hi>Merces praetiosae ut ex India, Arabia, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,

necessariÃ² classem parandam esse

exercitus habendi causa vectigal rubri maris
institutum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A third reason drawn from the Interest
the King hath in the parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
and the custody thereof, which
giveth him power to shut and open the
same at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>Again, all the Ports of the Kingdome
are the Kings, not onely the Cinque-Ports,
which have a special Warden
appointed by the King, but the rest of
the Ports are also his, and many of them
bear a mark of the Kings Inheritance in
their Additions, as <hi>Linn Regis, Waymouth,
Melcombe Regis, Pool Regis;</hi> for the King
is <hi>Custos totius Angliae Regni;</hi> as the four
Seas are the Walls of the kingdom, so
the Havens and Creeks are the Gates,
and Posterns of it. They are <hi>Ostia,</hi> they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:93719:51"/>
are <hi>Ianua Regni;</hi> and we find two Ports
in <hi>Italy</hi> called by those names, the one
at the mouth of <hi>Tiber,</hi> the other corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
called <hi>Genoa,</hi> but the true name there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is <hi>Ianua.</hi> And as the Havens are <hi>Ianua
Regni,</hi> the King himself is <hi>Ianus,</hi> and hath
power to open and shut them at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Omnia sunt nostra clausa patentque manu.</hi>
Saith <hi>Ianus</hi> in the Poet. And again, <hi>Modo
namque Patulchus idem &amp; modo sacrifico
Clusius ore vocor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> hath ever had
this Prerogative incident to his Crown,
to shut and open the Ports when it
pleased him, as appeareth by many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,
especially by the Parliament Rolls
in the time of King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tempore Edw. 3.</note> wherein are
found many Petitions that the Sea might
be open, which during that Kings time
was often shut by virtue of his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
only, and never fully opened again,
but when the King layd an Imposition
upon Merchandizes.</p>
               <p>And this Prerogative of Custody of
the Ports, and of shutting and opening
the same, is reserved unto the Crown
upon an excellent reason: For Trade
and Comerce is not fit to be holden with
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:93719:51"/>
all persons, neither are all things fit to
be imported or exported: For such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
as are enemies to the Crown, &amp; come
to discover <hi>Arcana Regni,</hi> such persons
as come to corrupt Religion, or the
manners of the people, such persons as
under colour of Merchandizes come to
set up Monopolies, or a dry Exchange to
drain or draw away our commodities or
money out of the Kingdom, are not fit to
enter in at the Gates of the Kingdome.
And again, such commodities as the
kingdom cannot spare, as Corn in time of
dearth, and such as may advantage our
Enemies and hurt us in time of Warre,
as Horses, Armor, Gunpowder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are
not fit to be exported out of the Realm:
And Poysons, Heretical books, and other
things which are apparently hurtfull to
the people, are not to be imported; and
therefore the Prerogative of opening
and shutting the Ports is accompanied
with another absolute power, of stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and imbarring of Trade &amp; Comerce,
sometimes generally, sometimes between
us and particular Nations, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for particular Merchandizes only,
whereof there are many presidents and
examples both in Records and Histories
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:93719:52"/>

Prerogative of imbarring Trade, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
out of the undoubted Prerogative
which the King hath to make Peace and
War with Forein Nations, for open War
is no sooner denounced, but all Trade of
Merchandize is stopt and imbarred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Nations which are ingaged in
the Warre, <hi>durante bello inter Reges Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianos
merces quascunque exportare vetamur
ne Regni arcana scrutentur,</hi> saith a Doctor
of the Imperiall Law; whereupon wee
make this Argument, That since the King
hath absolute power of shut the Ports,
and stop Trade, it standeth with as good
reason that he shold have the like power
to lay reasonable Impositions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
for opening of the Ports, and
for giving of freedome of Trade again;
he that may doe the more, may doe the
lesse, <hi>Non debet ei cui id quod majus est, id
quod minus est non licere,</hi> saith the Rule of
the Law; hee that may prohibit Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
not to Trade or passe, may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
with that prohibition, and give
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:93719:52"/>
them leave to go and Traffique <hi>sub mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, the King of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>Dominus
Maris,</hi> which floweth about the Island, as
divers ancient Books and Records do
testifie, as <hi>Fitz Avowry 192. 6 Rich. 2. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.

names do note a propriety in the Princes
and States, who are Lords of the Land
adjoyning. Hence it is that our Common
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:93719:53"/>
Law doth give unto our King all the land
which is gained from the Sea, which
<hi>Stampford</hi>
                  <note place="margin">stampford</note> in the Book of the Kings Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative

all Navigable Rivers wherein the Kings

have within their Dominions; he must
of necessity have the like absolute power
as they all have to lay Impositions upon
Merchandizes imported and exported,
otherwise he cannot possible hold the
ballance of Trade upright, or perserve
an equality of Traffique between his
own Subjects and the Subjects of Forein
Princes, and consequently it will lye in
the power of our Neighbours to drain
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:93719:54"/>
and draw away all our wealth in a short
time, or else to overthrow all Trade and
Comerce between us and them at their
pleasure, and we shall have no means to
encounter or avoid the mischief; for their
Princes, having sole power to impose,
will have the sole making and managing
of the Market between their Subjects
and us, and consequently may set what
price they please upon all Merchandizes,
enforcing us to sell our Commodities
cheap, and buy their Commodities dear,
onely by this advantage of laying Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions.</p>

<hi>Hen. 8.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tempore. Henry 8.</note> the Emperor and the <hi>Freneh</hi> King
had raised the valuation of their monies
both so high, as there grew not only an
inequality of Trade between their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
and the Subjects of <hi>England,</hi> but our
monies standing at their former values,
were carried out of the Realm in great
quantities; The King in the 24 year of his
Reign granted a Commission unto Cadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<hi>Woolsey</hi> to enhance the values of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
monies likewise, by that means to set
ballance of trade even again, and to keep
our monies within the Realm.</p>
               <p>Upon the same reason of State, when
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> that now is, in the year
1614.<note place="margin">The K. of <hi>Spain's</hi> Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in An. 1614.</note> had laid an Imposition of thirty

imported and exported by Strangers;
the <hi>French</hi> King <hi>Hen. 4.</hi> was quickly sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of it, and did forthwith impose the
like in his Kingdom; then it followed of
necessity that other Nations should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
and imitate them, whereby it came
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:93719:55"/>
to passe that Comerce of Merchants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally

                  <p>Of the several Objections that are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Kings Prerogative in laying Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
upon Merchandizes, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Answers thereunto.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE first Objection<note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> touching the
property which all free Subjects
have in their goods.</p>
               <p>First, it is objected, that under a Royal
Monarchy where the Prince doth go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
by a positive Law, the Subjects have
a property in their Goods, and inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
in their Lands; <hi>Ad Reges potestas

as the King hath no such Prerogative,
say they, whereby he may take away
the Lands or Goods of a Subject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his consent, unless it be in a case of
Forfeiture.</p>
               <p>And therefore though <hi>Samuel</hi> foretold
the people when they desired a King,

Yet <hi>Ahab,</hi> though he were a wicked
King, did not claim that Pretogative
when he coveted <hi>Naboths</hi> Vineyard, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
did he enter into it untill <hi>Naboth</hi> by
false witnesses was condemned and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to death for blasphemy, and then he
took it for a lawfull Escheat; but when
the King doth lay an Imposition upon
Merchandizes without the consent of
the Merchants, and doth cause the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
of his Customes to take and levie
the same; it seems say they, they take
away the goods of the Subject without
his consent, and without cause of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture,
which is not warranted either
by Law of Nations, which brought in
property, nor by the Law of the Land,
which doth maintain property.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Answer to the first Objection.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO this Objection we answer,<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the 1. Object.</note> That
the King doth not take the Land or
Goods of any without his consent; but
here we must distinguish, there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
and expresse consent, and there
is an implicit and general consent, when
a man doth give his Goods, or surrender
his Lands to the King by deed enrolled,
or when in Parliament which represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the body of the whole Realm, and
wherein every man doth give his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
either by himself, or his Deputy. A
subsidy is granted to the King, there is
an expresse consent; but when subjects
who live under a Royall Monarchy, do
submit themselves to the obedience of
that Law of that Monarchy, whatsoever
the Law doth give to that Monarch, the
subjects who take the benefit of the Law
in other things, and doe live under the
protection of the Law, doe agree to that
which the Law gives by an implicit
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:93719:57"/>
and general consent, and therefore there
are many cases where the King doth law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
take the goods of a Subject without
his particular &amp; expresse consent, though
the same be not forfeited for any crime
or contempt of the Owner.</p>
               <p>If a Theef do steal my goods and
waive them, the King may lawfully take
those goods without my particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
and without any fault or forfeiture
of mine; but in regard I live under the
Law, which giveth such wayves unto the
King, he taketh not the same without my
implicit consent; so if my Horse kill a
man, the King may lawfully take my
Horse a Deodand without my fault or
consent in particular; but in that I have
consented to the obedience of the Law
which giveth all Deodands to the King,
he taketh not my Horse without the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
or generall consent of mine.</p>
               <p>In the time of War the King doth take
my House to build a Fort, or doth build
a Bulwark upon my Land, he doth me no
wrong, though he doth it without my
consent, for my implicit consent doth
concur with it, for that I being a member
of the Common-weal, cannot but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to all Acts of necessity tending to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:93719:58"/>
the preservation of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>So if the King doth grant me a Fair or
Market, with a power to take a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Toll; If a man will buy any thing
in my Fair or Market, I may take Toll of
him, though I give no particular consent
to the grant, because the Law whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
every Subject doth give consent and
obedience, doth warrant the taking of
Toll in every Market and Fair granted
by the King.</p>
               <p>So it is in case of Impositions, the Law
doth warrant the Kings Prerogative to
impose upon Merchandizes, as is before
declared, and therefore though the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
give not their particular consents
to the laying of these Impositions, yet in
regard they live under the protection
and obedience of the Law, which sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
it self to this Prerogative, and allow
and approve the same; it cannot be said
that the King doth take these Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them without their implicit and
generall consent.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the second Objection touching the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
and unbounded largenesse of this
Prerogative.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe second Objection<note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> is against the
uncertainty and unlimited large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of this Prerogative, for in other
cases they say, where the King taketh the
goods of a Subject by his Prerogative,
there is a certainty what he may take, as
in the case of wayvs, he may take onely
the goods wayved, and no more.</p>
               <p>In case of Deodand, he may take only
the thing that causeth the death of a
man, and no more.</p>
               <p>In case of wreck, he may take only the
goods that are wreckt, and no more.</p>
               <p>In case of Wardship of Land holden
in Capite, the King may take the profits
of the Land, till the Heir sues his Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and no longer.</p>
               <p>In case where the King hath <hi>Annum
Diem &amp; vastum,</hi> hee may retain of the
Lands of the Felon attainted, which are
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:93719:59"/>
holden of other Lords for a year and a
day, and no longer.</p>
               <p>In all these cases there is a certainty
what the King shall have, and how long
he shall have it; but in case of Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the quantity or rate thereof high or
low, is left to the Kings own will or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure;
so as if he should be mis-led, as many
Princes have been, with evill Counsell,
he might with his Prerogative doe hurt
the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon-wealth, by laying too heavy
burthens upon his Subjects; for though
hetherto his Majesty hath imposed upon
Merchandizes only twelve pence on the
pound over and above the ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
and the Subsidies granted by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
yet this Prerogative being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted,
he may hereafter (say they) set
five shillings or ten shillings upon the
pound, if it please him, and so undoe the
Merchants, or discontinue and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
all Trade and Comerce.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Answer to the second Objection.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO this Objection the fittest answer
is,<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the 2. Object.</note> That it is an undutifull Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and withall too busie, too bold, and
too presumptuous; for it is an Objection
against the wisdome of the King in point
of Government, and against the bounty
and goodnesse of the King towards his
people: the Text of the Civil Law cited
before, doth call it a kind of Sacrilege to
dispute of Princes Judgments or Actions;
and for the Law of <hi>England,</hi> sure I am, that
it trusteth the Wisdome and Judgement
of the King alone in matter of greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
than in laying of Impositions,
or setting of rates upon Merchandizes.</p>
               <p>Is not the Kings wisdome only trusted
with the absolute power of making War
and Peace with forein Nations, whereby
hee may when hee pleaseth interrupt all
Trade of Merchandizing? Is not the
King alone trusted with the like power
of making and decrying of monies which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:93719:60"/>
is the onely <hi>Medium</hi> of all Traffique and
Comerce? Is not he solely and without
limitation trusted with the nomination
and creation of all Judges and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
who are to give Judgement in
cases concerning the Liberties, Lands,
and Lives of all his Subjects? hath not
he a sole and unlimited power to pardon
all Malefactors, to dispence with all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Laws, to distribute all Honours, to
grant to whom he pleaseth Protections,
Denizations, Exemptions, not only from
Juries, but from all other Services of the
Common-wealth? and yet these Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
if the same be not used with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and moderation, may prove pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to the Common-wealth, as well
as the laying of Impositions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes.
Shall therefore any unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Subject make these conclusions? The
King may have a continuall Warre with
Forein States and Princes, and so conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
corrupt all courses of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
<hi>Ergo,</hi> he shall lose his Prerogative
of making War or Peace, when himself
in wisdom shall think fit so to do. The
King may decry all monies of Gold and
Silver in Bullion, and establish a Standard
of Copper or Leather; therefore he shall
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:93719:60"/>
coyn no monies without the consent of
the people. The King may if he please,
break up all the Prisons, pardon all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
and so give impunity to all Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> he shall pardon no Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors
by Act of Parliament. These are
found absurd, or rather wicked conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>Ã  posse adesse</hi> is an absurd Argument,
but <hi>Ã  posse &amp; nolle nobile est.</hi> The Law
presumes the King to be so noble and so
wise, that all Acts done by him, or in his
Name during his Infancy, are of as good
force in Law, as if the Law had bin done
in his ripest years. The Law presumes
the King to be most just in all his actions,
&amp; therfore it hath these rules; the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
of the King can do no wrong, the
King can commit no disseisin, the King
can make no discontinuance, and the
like, <hi>Cor Regis in manu Domini,</hi> saith <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Solomon.</note>
and therefore the Law presumeth,
that God will ever direct him to that
which is just; is it not then too much
curiosity to instruct where the Law trust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
and too much presumption to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
against the presu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>ption of the Law,
especially in the time of such a King who
is the wisest, and justest, the most religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and most gracious King that ever
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:93719:61"/>
reigned in <hi>Europe?</hi> Can any man imagine
that so great a Master in the Art of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
the most prudent King of <hi>great
Britain &amp; Ireland,</hi> the two greatest Islands
in this Hemisphere, and seated most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiously
for Traffique, which all the
World knowing that the duties paid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him for Merchandizes, are the most
certain, settled, and assured, and withall
the best and richest part of his Revenues
at this day, will lay heavier Impositions
upon Merchandizes than they are able to
bear, and so destroy all Trade and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce?
When King <hi>Hen. 7.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Henry 7.</note> his most pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Predecessor, did lend money to his
Merchants to maintain Traffique, will
he for a little extraordinary profit for
the time present, pluck up at once the
Root, and dry up the Fountain of this
Revenue for the time to come? it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
it is uncredible, it is impossible;
But suppose that this is credible, that
the King should lay such heavy Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon Merchandizes, as all Merchants
should refuse to Traffique, who should
lose most by that, the King or his people?
assuredly hee should suffer an exceeding
great losse in his Customes; but we that
are of the Commons should save by it, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:93719:61"/>
all things necessary for the Life of
man within the Land, which is.</p>
               <q>Terra suis content a bonis,<note place="margin">Poeta.</note> non indiga mercis.</q>
               <p>We should spare these vain expences
which we now make upon Forein Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
namely Cloath of Gold, Cloath
of Silver, Silks, Spices, Wines, and many
other superfluous &amp; unnecessary things,
which doe nourish Pride, and Luxury,
Riot and Excesse amongst us, which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
our manners, and in the end will be
the ruin of the Common-wealth; I may
therefore conclude this point, That since
the King hath power by his Prerogative
to lay Impositions upon Merchandizes,
he hath also a power coincident thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
to limit and rate the proportion and
quantity thereof, according to his own
wisdom &amp; reasons of State, from time to
time; for either the King must set down
the rates, or the people, or the King and
people both by Act of Parliament; but if
the people will not assent or agree to a
reasonable limitation thereof in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
shall the King lose those Royal
Duties which all other Kings do take by
vertue of their Prerogative? it were most
unreasonable, absurd, and unjust.</p>

               <p>Secondly, King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> did at sundry
times during his Reign, lay severall Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions
upon Woolls and other Staple
commodities, sometimes fourty shillings,
sometimes fifty shillings upon a Sack of
Wooll, and other the like rates upon
Merchandizes, yet could be never fix
nor settle the same upon His Subjects;

               <p>Again, the same King many times did

the exportation of Merchandizes;
then would he take great sums of Money
to grant licences to transport, which
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:93719:63"/>
proved as great a charge as Impositions,
and yet upon sundry complaints of the
people in Parliament, the Sea was set

               <p>Lastly, in the last year of this Kings

parts, and shall recieve an Answer<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to Object. 3.</note>
consisting of divers parts; the first part
of this answer, King <hi>Edw. 1.</hi> being a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and resolute Prince, did not onely
impose the three pence upon the pound
upon Merchant Strangers, by his <hi>Charta
Mercatoria,</hi> but justified and maintained
that Imposition during his life. True it is,
that after his death, King <hi>Edw. 2.</hi> it was
repealed, as is before objected; but whose
Act was this? by whom was this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
made, which did repeal this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
not by the King and his Parliament,
but by certain rebellious Barons, who
took upon them the Government of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:93719:64"/>
Realm, and called themselves Ordainers;
Wherefore King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> in the first year
of his Reign, did revive that Charter, and
commanded by his Writ that the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
and Duties therein contained
should be collected and levied to his use;
He maketh mention of these Ordinances
of <hi>5 Edw. 2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5 Edw. 2.</note> and saith the same were made
<hi>per quosda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Magnates,</hi> and not by the King,
as appeareth by the Record, <hi>1 Edw. 3. Rot.
fin. memb. 30. in Arch. Turris,</hi> which in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
place before I have recited, by
which Record it likewise appeareth, that
those Ordinances <hi>5 Edw. 2.</hi> were before
that time repealed and made void, and
therefore that which was done in that
time of that unfortunate Prince, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
by his unruly Barons, is not to be
urged and used as an example, especially
since they that urge this repeal of <hi>Charta
Mercatoria,</hi> might, if they would find any
thing which makes against their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting
humour, find in the said Roll of
Ordinance, made in <hi>5 Edw. 2.</hi> divers Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
wherein those Ordainers did wrong
and wound the Prerogative in matter of
greater importance than in the repeal of
that Charter, for they might have found
among the same Ordinances these things
ordained.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:93719:65"/>First, that the King should not make
gifts of Lands, Rents, Franhises, Wards,
or Escheats, without the consent of the
Ordainers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, that all gifts and grants
formerly made by the King, not only of
Land and other things in <hi>England,</hi> but in
<hi>Gasconie, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> should be
resumed and made void.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, that the King should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part
out of the Realm, nor make Warre,
without the assent of his Barons, and of
his Parliament.</p>
               <p>That because the King was misguided
and counselled by evill Counsellers, it
was ordained, that all his Counsel should
be renewed, and new Officers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
appointed for him.</p>
               <p>These traiterous Ordinances were
made against the King at that time, and
therefore it is a shame that any part of
these Ordinances should be made an
argument against the right of the Crown
in laying Impositions upon Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes;
for with the same reasons they
might argue the King had no right to
grant his Lands, Rents, Wards, or Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheats,
that he might not go out of the
Realm, nor make Warre, nor choose his
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:93719:65"/>
own Counsellers or Servants without an
Act of Parliament; and it is manifest, that
those factious Barons did cause the King
to forego the said Impositions, rather <hi>ad
faciendum populum,</hi> and to gratifie the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
and to draw them to their party,
than for the good of the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon-wealth;
for if they had been good Counsellers
they would have done as the Senate of
<hi>Rome</hi> did,<note place="margin">Senatus Rome.</note> when <hi>Nero</hi> in a glorious humor
to please the people, would needs have
discharged at once all Customes and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions;
the Senate gave him thanks
for his favour towards the people, but
utterly diswaded him so to doe; telling
him, that in so doing, he would ruine the
state of the Common-wealth; for indeed
no Common-wealth can stand without
these duties, they are <hi>Nervi,</hi> they are <hi>suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus
&amp; sanguis Reipublicae,</hi> and therefore no
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mon-wealth was ever without them,
but the imaginary Common-wealths of
<hi>Plato</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas More,</hi> for they doe
both agree; for in the Common-wealths
of which they dream, there was nothing
to be paid for Merchandizes export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and imported. But to return to King
<hi>Edw. 2.</hi> what followed upon the Repeal
of <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> and the discharge of
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:93719:66"/>
Impositions which King <hi>Edw. 1.</hi> establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed?
was not that poor Prince King
<hi>Edw. 2.</hi> enforced to take up great sums
of money of his Merchants, by way of
loan, which he never repaid again? 11
<hi>Edw. 2. Rot. fin. m. 12.</hi> whereby the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
received a greater detriment than
if they had made a double payment of
Customes and Impositions which the
King had discharged, and therefore the
example of this weak Prince doth make
but a weak argument against the right of
the Crown, in laying Impositions upon
Merchandizes; and here I think it fit to
observe that they were all wise and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Princes which are spoken of in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
ages, to have laid Impositions upon
Merchandizes, namely <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>Land,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Solomon.</note> 
                  <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iulius Caesar.</note> and <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Augustus Caesar.</note>
in the Empire, King <hi>Ed. 1.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Edw. 1.</note> and King <hi>Ed. 3.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Edw. 3.</note>
in <hi>England;</hi> but on the other part, they
which released all Customes and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions,
were but weak Princes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
themselves and the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth
wherein they lived; namely <hi>Nero</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Nero.</note>
in the Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> King <hi>Edw. 2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Edw. 2.</note> and
King <hi>Rich. 2.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rich. 2.</note> with us; and truly by the
rule of our Common Law, the King can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not,
if he would, release all Subsides and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:93719:66"/>
Aids of his Subjects, that they should be
for ever discharged of all Subsidies to be
given to the Crown, such a grant were
made void, and against the Law.</p>
               <p>Secondly, touching the Petitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
to the King in sundry Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
against Impositions laid by that
King upon Merchandizes, upon view of
the Record wherein these Petitions are
contained, with their answers made by
the King thereunto, it is evident, that
neither the Petitions of the people, nor
the Kings answers thereunto, do disprove
this right of the Crown to lay Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon Merchandizes; for Petitions
do not of necessity prove or suppose the
Petitioners have received wrong; Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are of divers kinds. 1. There are
Petitions of Grace,<note place="margin">Petitions are of divers kinds, &amp; have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers.</note> which do not insist
upon any right, but upon meer Grace
and Favour. 2. There are Petitions of
Right, wherein the Petitioner doth set
forth a pretended right, and yet perhaps
upon examination it is found that they
have not right at all, and commonly they
ask more than their right is, <hi>Iniquum pet as
ut aequum fer as. 3.</hi> There are Petitions
<hi>Armatae,</hi> when a company of Rebels arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
against the Crown, do yet preferre
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:93719:67"/>
their Petitions, but with an intent to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
their desire, whether it be right or
wrong, if their Petitions be not granted,
<hi>Et stricto supplicat ense petens,</hi> many of their
armed Petitions were exhibited during
the Barons Wars, during the Wars of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster</hi>
and <hi>York,</hi> and in sundry popular co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
since the Conquest; but these
Petitions which we speak of were made
by the Commons, or by some factious
Spirits, in the name of the Commons, in
sundry Parliaments holden during the
Reign of King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> howbeit, if wee
look upon the form of these Petitions,
we shall find there is nothing sought but
Grace and Favour; and if we consider
the Kings answers, though many of them
be very gracious, we shall find him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
much reserved, and withall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
not to prejudice or conclude his
Prerogative in point of right; the form
of these Petitions was for most part but
thus, The Commons pray, that the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
or Maletolt of fourty shillings
upon every Sack of Wooll may cease or
be taken away, and that the Custome of
the demi mark may onely be taken: Or
thus, The Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mons pray, that the passage
of the Sea may be open to all manner of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:93719:67"/>
Merchants and Merchandizes, as it had
been in former times; herein we find no
claim or challenge of right, but a modest
prayer of Grace and Favour, unlesse the
word <hi>Mayletolt</hi> may seem to imply a
wrong, because some do conceive that
the word doth signifie an evil Toll,<note place="margin">Mayle <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>ã€ˆâ€¦ã€‰</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </note> wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
indeed the word doth signifie Toll-money,
for <hi>Mayle</hi> in old <hi>French</hi> is a small
peece of money, and therefore the rents
taken by force in the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi>
was called <hi>Blackmayle,</hi> and the word
<hi>Mayletolt,</hi> in some of our old Statutes is
taken <hi>in bonam partem,</hi> which speaks of
<hi>Droiturell Mayletolts.</hi> But in what form
doth <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> make his Answers to those
Petitions? in divers formes, according to
the diversity of the occasions &amp; reasons of
State, but alwayes in a gentle and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
manner, sometime he granteth the
Petition in part onely, for a certain time,
or after a certain time expired, that his
people may know, that as he receiveth
part of the Petition, so he might have
rejected the whole if he might have been
so pleased; sometimes he granted the
whole Petition, yet not absolutely but
conditionally, that hee may receive a
greater recompence; but wheresoever
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:93719:68"/>
he doth franckly yeeld to remit any Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
we find in the same Record a
Subsidy granted unto him of far greater
value and profit than the Imposition by
him remitted, wherein we perceive that
he followed the wise counsell of <hi>Roabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
old Counsellers, given in the like
case of Impositions, <hi>3 Kings cap. 12.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3 Kings cap. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>sihodie
obedieris populo huic &amp; petitioni eorum
cesseris locutusque, diebus, &amp;c.</hi> sometimes he
gives a generall or doubtfull answer, and
sometimes hee is silent and gives no an
swer at all; so as he doth never bind
nor conclude himself by any of those an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers
to those Petitions, but with such
reservation as he might still make use of
his Prerogative in laying Impositions
upon Merchandizes; to demonstrate
this point more plainly, it were not amiss
out of many Records which I have seen,
and whereof I have the Copies tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
out of the Records themselves,
with mine own hands, to select and set
down some of those Answers in any of
the kinds aforesaid. In <hi>14 Edw. 3. cap. 21.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">14 Ed. 3. cap. 12.</note>
the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>mons pray the King that he would
grant an Act of Parliament that no more
Custome should bee taken for a Sack of
Wool but a demi mark, nor for Lead, nor
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:93719:68"/>
Tin, nor Leather, nor Wooll-fells, but the
old Customes. This Petition is general
and extending to all Staple Comodities
without exceptions of persons, or limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of times; but what is the Kings an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer?
That from the Feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi>
which commeth, unto a year, neither he
nor his Heirs shall take of any <hi>Englishman</hi>
for a Sack of Wooll, more Custome than
the half Mark, upon Wooll fells, and
Leather, no more than the old Custome.</p>
               <p>Here this Petition is granted but in
part; First, in respect of the persons, for
<hi>Englishmen</hi> only are favoured, and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
are omitted; Secondly, onely in
respect of the Commodities, for Wooll-fells
and Leather onely are exempted,
and Tin and Lead remain to be charged
as before; Thirdly, in respect of the time,
for the King continueth his Impositions
formerly laid for a year and more, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
that Petition.</p>
               <p>But let us see withall what the King
did gain in Parliament, upon yeelding
to the peoples Petition but in part; in
the first Sessions of this Parliament, it was
granted that every man who should ship
Woolls over the Seas, should find Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to bring in upon his first return, for
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:93719:69"/>
every Sack of Wooll, two Marks of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Plate or Bullion, and to deliver it to
the Kings Executors; and in the next
Sessions there was granted unto him the
nineth Fleece, the nineth Lamb, and the
nineth Sheaf of Corn throughout the
Realm, which the people did often times
redeem with a gift of twenty thousand
Sacks of Wool.</p>
               <p>Here we see the fruit that the King
made by following of <hi>Rehoboams</hi> old
Counsellers, &amp; yet out of this grant and
remission made by the King, who can
draw an Argument against the Kings
right in laying Impositions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes?</p>
               <p>Again,<note place="margin">Anno 29 Ed. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>29 Edw. 3.</hi> when there lay an
Imposition of fourty shillings upon a
Sack of Wooll above the old Customes,
A Conferrence was had between the
Lords and Commons in the White-Chamber
at <hi>Westmin.</hi> where after a short
Parliament, saith the Record, <hi>29 Edw. 3.
Rot. Parliament. numb. 11. in Arch. Turris.</hi>
It was concluded, that the King should
have a greater Subsidie out of Wooll,
Wooll-fells, and Leather, for six years; so
as during that time, the King did lay no
other Impositions or Charge upon the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:93719:69"/>
Commons. Here is a conditionall agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the King and the poople,
and here the King doth remit his power
of Imposition, for a recompence of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
value.</p>
               <p>And this is a strong Argument, That
the King had right to impose, otherwise
the people would never have bought
their freedom from Impositions at so
high a rate or price.</p>
               <p>The like conditionall agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the King and the people, we find

out of these Answers against the

upon Merchandizes?</p>
               <p>Lastly, in <hi>13 Edw. 3. Rot. Parliament.
numb. 13.</hi> the Commons pray, that the
Maletolts of Wooll may be taken as it
was used in former times, being then
enhaunsed without the Assent of the
Commons.</p>
               <p>To this Petition there is no answer
found of Record, the King is silent, and
gives no answer at all; which doubtless
the King had not refused to do, if the
Petition had been exhibited in point of
right, and not in point of favour.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, touching the punishing of
the persons before mentioned, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing
of new Impositions to be set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Merchandizes, we are to consider two
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:93719:70"/>
circumstances; first, the time when, and
next the causes wherefore these persons
were called in question.</p>
               <p>The time when these persons were
called to account, was a Parliament hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in <hi>50 Edw. 3.</hi> the last year of that
Kings Reign, at which time that great
and renowned Prince, who had been
formerly assisted by a most wise and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique
Councell, was become weak and
stupid, and almost in despair, through
sicknesse, age, melancholy, conceipted
upon the death of his eldest Son the
Black Prince, and suffered himself to be
ill-governed by a Woman called <hi>Alice
Perrey,</hi> and her Favourite the Lord <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer;</hi>
upon which occasion and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
the Commons grew more bold than
they were wont to be in former Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
and therefore if ought had been
done in that Parliament, which might
prejudice the Kings Prerogative, it is
not to be urged as an example or presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in these times; but in truth, the
causes for which these persons were cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured,
do rather approve the right of the
Crown in laying Impositions, than any
way disaffirm the same.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lions</hi> case 50 Ed. 3. <hi>Rot. Parl. nu. 17, 18.</hi>
                  </note> First, <hi>Richard
Lions,</hi> a Farmer of the Customes, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:93719:71"/>
in this Parliament by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
that he had set and procured to be
set upon Wooll, and other Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
certain new Impositions without
assent of Parliament, converting the
same to his own use without controule,
the High Treasurer not being acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
therewith, the said <hi>Richard</hi> assuming
to himself in divers things as a King, 50
<hi>Edw. 3. Rot. Parliament. numb. 17,18,19,
20.</hi> This was his Accusation, and though
his answer were, that he set those Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
by the Kings Commandment, yet
did he shew no Warrant for it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was justly punished with fine, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
disfranchisment, and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>But how may this insolency and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanour
of a Subject, be an argument
against the right or Prerogative of the
King? <hi>Lions</hi> a Merchant of his own head
cannot set Impositions upon Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes;
<hi>Ergo,</hi> King <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> a Monarch, of
his royall Authority cannot do it; what
an absurd argument were this? as if a
man should say, it were High Treason in
a Subject to Coyn money; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the King
himself cannot do it, or cause it to bee
done; besides, the accusation it self doth
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:93719:71"/>
imply, that the King hath power to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
upon Merchandizes, because <hi>Lions</hi>
is charged, being a Subject, to take upon
him as a King in divers things, &amp; namely,
in setting of Impositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s; as if they should
have said a King may do it, but not a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
according to the rules of the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Law, <hi>Solus Princeps instituit vectigalia
Regni tantum juris &amp; muneris est indicere
vectialia, imponere vectigalia maximi Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perii
est, inferior a Principe non potest impone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
and the like.</p>
               <p>And the Bill exhibited by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
in this Parliament, <hi>50 Edw. 3. Rot.
Parliament. 191.</hi> praying that those that
should set new Impositions by their own
Authority, encroaching unto themselves
Royal Power, might have Judgement of
life and member, seemeth to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon good reason, and doth prove it
is a Mark of Soveraignty and Royall
Power to set Impositions; and therefore
if a Subject of his own head, of his own
authority wil presume to do it, he is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to dye for it; and yet this Bill did
receive but a general answer, <hi>viz.</hi> Let the
Common Law run as it hath been used
heretofore.</p>
               <p>Touching the Lord <hi>Latimers</hi> censure,<note place="margin">Lord Latimers ease.</note>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:93719:72"/>
he had not only upon his own head and
authority set sundry Impositions upon
Merchandizes at <hi>Callis,</hi> where the Staple
there was much decayed; but he was
charged with sundry other misdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors
mentioned in the said Roll, namely,
that he brought in divers Tallies and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckets,
whereby the King was indebted
unto his Souldiers and Pensioners, for
which he gave little or nothing to the
parties, and yet had an entire allowance
in the Exchequer, to the great damage
of the King, and scandall of the Court;
that he had also deceived the King of
the pay and wages which he had sent
unto his Souldiers in <hi>Britain;</hi> that he had
sold a great quantity of the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions
for his Army there, and converted
the same to his own use; and that he had
delivered up the Town of Saint <hi>Saviours</hi>
it <hi>Normandy,</hi> and the Town and Fort of
<hi>Betherell</hi> in <hi>Britainy,</hi> not without suspiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Corruption and Treason.</p>
               <p>How can the Lord <hi>Latimers</hi> censure
for these deceits and misdemeanors
make an argument against the right of
the Crown in laying Impositions upon
Merchandizes?</p>
               <p>And the like may be said of the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:93719:72"/>
of <hi>Iohn Peachy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Peachies Case.</note> who having got a
Patent that none should sell sweet Wines
within the City of <hi>London</hi> but himself,
his Deputies, and Assignes, by colour
thereof did extort three shillings and
four pence, out of every Pipe or Vessell
of sweet Wine sold by others within the
City. Shall this extortion committed
by a Subject, by colour of a Patent, where
perhaps the Patent doth not warrant it,
be objected as an argument, that the
King himself might not lay the like Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
upon every Pipe or Vessel by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of his Prerogative? therefore the
punishment of these presons was not the
cause, that for an 150. years after
that, no Impositions were layd upon
Merchandizes by Prerogative; but the
Princes who succeeded <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> untill
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> did forbear to use their
Prerogative in that kind, for those other
notable and true causes which are
before at large expressed in the seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
Chapter.</p>
               <p>Lastly, touching the Imposition of six
shillings and eight pence upon every
Cloth, laid by Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> after the losse
of <hi>Callis;</hi> she held the same with a new
Imposition upon <hi>French</hi> Wines, without
any question during her life; and albeit
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:93719:73"/>
complaint were made against the Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
set upon Cloaths unto Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi>
upon her first entry (as it is usuall
for the people to complain of burthens
and charges upon every change of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.)
Yet we find that after the
Conference of the Judges spoken of by
my Lord <hi>Dyer, 1 Eliz. f. 165. Dyer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Eliz. Dyer. fol. 165.</note> (though
their resolution be not their reported)
Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> did continue that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
and also the Impost upon <hi>French</hi>
Wines, as being lawfull set for the space
of fourty four years without any further
contradiction; besides, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
did raise divers other new Impositions,
as is before declared, whereunto there
was never made any opposition during
her Reign, and which His Majesty that
now is, hath received without any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
for the fpace of fifteen years; and
thus much may suffice for answer to the
several points in the third Objection.</p>

bound or taken away by divers Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FOurthly, It is objected,<note place="margin">Object. 4.</note> That though
it were granted and admitted, that
the King <hi>de jure communi,</hi> hath a rightful
Prerogative to lay Impositions upon
Merchandizes, yet that power say they,
is restrained and taken away by sundry
Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>First, the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, cap.
30.</hi> doth give safe conduct and free pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to all Merchants to buy and sell, <hi>abs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
aliquibus malis tolnetis per antiquas &amp;
rectas consuetudines.</hi> Secondly, by the Act
or Charrer of confirmation in <hi>25 Edw.
3.</hi> The King doth release a Mayltolt
of fourty shillings upon a Sack of
Wooll, and doth grant for him and His
Heirs, unto the Commons, that he shall
not take such things without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons
consent or good will; and in the
same Act or Charter reciting, that wheras
divers people of the Realm were in fear,
that the Aids and Taxes which they had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:93719:74"/>
given to the King before that time, was
towards his War, and other businesses of
their own grant and good will, might
turn to a bondage of them and their
heirs, because in time to come they
might be found in the Rolls, and were
likewise grieved for Prizes taken
throught the Realm, The King doth
grant for him and his Heirs, That he will
not draw such Ayds, Taxes, or Prizes,
into a Custome, for any thing that had
been done before that time, be it by Roll
or any other president that may bee
found. Thirdly, by the Statute <hi>14 Edw.
3. cap. 12.</hi> the King doth grant that all
Merchants Denizens, and Aliens, may
freely come into the Realm with their
goods and Merchandizes, and freely
tary there, and safely return, paying their
Customes, Subsidies, and profits thereof,
reasonably due. Fourthly, by the Statute
<hi>11 Rich. 2. cap. 9.</hi> it is enacted, That no
Imposition or Charge be put upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> Wools,
Wooll-fells, or Leather, other than the
Custome or Subsidie granted to the King
in that Parliament, if any be, the same to
be adnulled and repealed, saving to the
King his ancient right; there are other
Acts of Parliament containing the same
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:93719:74"/>
sence and substance, but these principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
have been singled out, and cited as
specially Statutes restraining and taking
away the Kings Prerogative in laying
Impositions upon Merchandizes.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Answer to the fourth Objection.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO this Objection first I answer,<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>swer to the forth Object.</note>
That this being a Prerogative in
point of Government, as well as in point
of profit, it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>not be restrained or bound
by Act of Parliament, it cannot be limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by any certain or fixt Rule of Law,
no more than the course of a Pilot upon
the Sea, who must turn the Helme, or
bear higher or lower sail according to
the wind and weather; and therefore it
may be properly said, That the Kings
Prerogative in this point is as strong as
<hi>Samson,</hi> it cannot be bound; for though
an Act of Parliament be made to restrain
it, and the King doth give his consent
unto it, as <hi>Samson</hi> was bound with his
own consent, yet if the <hi>Philistins</hi> come,
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:93719:75"/>
that is, if any just or important occasion
do arise, it cannot hold or restrain the
Prerogative, it will be as thred, and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
as easie as the bonds of <hi>Samson;</hi> and
again, <hi>Ius imponendi vectigalia inhaeret scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro,</hi>
saith the Law Imperiall, <hi>&amp; quod Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro
inhaeret non potest tolli nisi sublato Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tro.</hi>
The Kings Prerogatives are the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams
of his Crown, and as inseparable
from it as the Sun-beams from the Sun;
The Kings Crown must be taken from
his head, before his Prerogative can be
taken away from him; <hi>Samsons</hi> hair must
be cut off, before his courage can be any
jot abated. Hence it is, that the Kings
Act, nor any Act of Parliament can give
away His Prerogative; for in his own Act
the King cannot release a <hi>tenure in Capite,</hi>
nor grant it to any Subject, <hi>Dyer 44.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dyer 44.</note> If
the King grant Land to <hi>I. S.</hi> to hold as
freely as the King himselfe holds his
Crown, he shall hold his Land still of
the King in <hi>Capite,</hi> and if he Alien it hee
shall pay a Fine, for the tenure is vested
in the King by his Prerogative, saith the
Book, 14. <hi>Hen. 6. 12.</hi> and therefore when
King <hi>Fdw. 3.</hi> did grant unto the Black
Prince his eldest Son, the Dutchy of
<hi>Cornwall, una cum omnibus wardis maritagiis
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:93719:75"/>
&amp; releviis, &amp;c. non obstante Prerogative
Regis,</hi> the Prince could not seize a Ward
that held of the Kings Ward, who held
in <hi>Capite</hi> of the King, because it belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the King by his Prerogative. 34
<hi>Ass. pl. 25.</hi> whereby it is manifest, that
the King by his own Grant cannot sever
his Prerogative from the Crown, nor
communicate any part thereof to any
one, not to the Prince his eldest Son; and
in this case of Tenure it was resolved in
the last Assembly of Parliament in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
That no Act of Parliament could
be framed by the wit of man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
all Tenures of the Crown might be
extinguished; neither can any Act of
Parliament in the flat Negative, take
away the Kings Prerogative in the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative.</p>
               <p>The King hath a Prerogative in the
affirmation, that he may pardon all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors; There is a Statute made at
<hi>Northampton, 2 Edw. 3.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Statute of North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton. 2 Edw. 3.</note> That no Charter
of pardon for killing a man shold thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
be granted, but in one case, where
one man killeth another in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
by misfortune: Hath this Statute
so bound the Prerogative, as no man ever
since hath been pardoned for killing a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:93719:76"/>
man, but in the cases before mentioned?
The King hath a Prerogative in point of
Government, to make choice of the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff
in every County; there is a Statute
made, <hi>28 Edw. 3. cap. 7.</hi> That no man shall
be Sheriff two years together, and that
no Commission shall be granted or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new'd
for the year following, to him that
hath been Sheriff the year before; Was
the Kings Prerogative bound by this
Statute when hee granted the Sheriff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick
of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> to the Earle of
<hi>Northumberland</hi> during his life, with <hi>non
obstante</hi> of that Statute <hi>2 Hen. 7. fol. 6.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
the King hath no ancient and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute
power to grant dispensation for
holding Ecclesiastical Benefices <hi>in Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum.</hi>
There is a Statute made <hi>7 Edw. 3.</hi> in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> whereby it is enacted and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that the Kings dispensation in this
case shall be utterly void, if it be not by
Act of Parliament; did this Statute so
derogate from the Kings Prerogative,
and so restrain it, that he might not only
by his Letters Patents, Grant <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>menda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi>
before the Statute of <hi>28 Hen. 8.</hi> in
this Realm? assuredly the Kings dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<hi>non obstante</hi> the Statute would
have taken away the force thereof, as if
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:93719:76"/>
no such Law had ever been made: There
are many other cases of like nature which
I omit; as for the particular Statutes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
recited, the words thereof are too
generall to bind or restrain this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in laying Impositions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes.
First, that Statute of <hi>Magna
Charta</hi> doth give safe conduct to all Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
to come and go, and to tarry
within the Realm, and to buy and sell
their Merchandizes, <hi>sine malis tolnetis per
antiqnas &amp; rect as consuetudines.</hi> How do
these generall words restrain the Kings
Prerogative in this Case? for the ancient
Common Law of the Land, which is the
Common Custome of the Realm, doth
warrant and approve the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative
in laying Impositions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
as before I have fully and
clearly proved, then a reasonable Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
laid by the King is <hi>Antiqua &amp; recta
consuetudo</hi> warranted and approved by
the Great Charter.</p>
               <p>Secondly, albeit King <hi>Edw. 1.</hi> by Act
or Charter of confirmation of <hi>Charta Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catoria,</hi>
made in <hi>Anno 25.</hi> of his Reign,
doth release the Maletolt of fourty shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
upon a Sack of Wooll; and doth
grant for him and his heirs, that he will
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:93719:77"/>
take no such thing without the assent
and good will of the Commons. That
word (<hi>such</hi>) doth not absolutely bind the
Kings Prerog. that he shall lay no Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
at all, for it is to be intended such
in quantity, such in excess, for foury shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
at that time was as much as six
pound at this day, which the scarcity of
money in those dayes being considered,
and compared with the plenty of money
at this day, might then be said to be a
great burthen, and yet this strong band
doth not bind K. <hi>Ed. 3.</hi> his Grand-child
but that, notwithstanding this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
or Act of Parliament, he took these
things in greater quantities, sometimes
fourty shillings, sometimes fifty shillings,
upon a Sack of Wooll, when the <hi>Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stins</hi>
came upon him, that is, when the
Wars of <hi>France,</hi> and other urgent occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
did presse him to it; as to the other
Article contained in the Act or Charter
of <hi>25 Edw. 3.</hi> where it is said the people
did fear, lest the Aids and Taxes
granted of their good will to the King
might turn to a bondage to them and
their heires, when the same in time to
come should be found in the Rolls; and
the King did grant for him and his heirs,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:93719:77"/>
That he would not draw such Ayds and
Taxes into a Custome; that Act in this
point restraineth not the Kings Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in setting Impositions upon Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
for it speaketh only of Ayds
and Taxes willingly granted by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in Parliament, &amp; therefore I marvell
that this Article was ever objected or
used as an argument against Impositions;
and whereas the King doth grant that
such Ayds shall not be drawn into a
Custome, such words are usuall in the
preambles of Acts of Subsidies where the
grant is large and extraordinary, <hi>viz.</hi>
That it may not be drawn into an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that it may not be a president in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
times; and yet succeeding Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
have not forborn to grant as large
Subsidies as formerly were granted.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Statute of <hi>14 Edw. 3.
cap. 12.</hi> doth rather maintain the Kings
Prerogative in this case, than any way
impugne or impeach it, for by that Law
free passage is granted to all Merchants,
paying the Customes, Subsidies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
thereof reasonably due. Now certain
it is, that all duties payable to the King
for Merchandizes, are of three kinds only,
Customes, which are these ancient and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:93719:78"/>
certain duties, wherein the Crown hath
no Inheritance, as is before expressed;
Subsidies which are granted by Act of
Parliament, and Impositions which are
raised from time to time by the Kings
Prerogative onely, we find not a fourth
kind, and therefore the word <hi>Profits</hi> must
needs be taken for Impositions.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, the Statue of <hi>11 Rich. 2. Cap.
9.</hi> though it provide in expresse terms,
that no Imposition or Charge be layd
upon Wooll, Wooll-fells, or Leather, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than the Custome or Subsidy gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in that Parliament, yet it saveth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to the King his ancient rights; this
was as turbulent a Parliament as ever
was holden in <hi>England,</hi> and yet was the
Kings Right acknowledged, though the
unruly Lords and Commons did in a
manner force his Assent to limit his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative
at that time.</p>
               <p>Lastly, if these Acts had absolutely
bound the Kings Prerogative, and had
been observed literally and punctually
untill this time, the King should onely
have had at this day the Demi mark for
our own Staple Wares, and perhaps the
three pence Custome for Forein Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
and no more. What an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:93719:78"/>
what an absurdity had this
been at this day, when all Forein Princes
have raised their Customes to an exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
height? when as I have noted before
the necessary expences of the Crown are
so much encreased, when the prizes of
all Commodities are so much enhanced,
when there is so great a plenty of money
in this part of the World, when the
Kings Revenue within the Land is so
much improved; Is it fit that Duties
payable for Merchandizes should stand
at a stay and keep the old rates without
augmentation?</p>

were never taken, but when the same
was granted by Parliament.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>FIstly, it is objected, That the Subsidies
of Tonnage and Poundage,<note place="margin">Object. 5.</note> were
never taken by any King of <hi>England,</hi> but
when the same were granted by Act of
Parliament, which is an Argument, say
they, that the King could never take
those duties but by his absolute power,
for if his Prerogative could have impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
those rates of it self, what need was
there of an Act of Parliament? why
should the King have expected the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
of the Commons? <hi>cum Dominus eis

so empty, as the Jewells of the Crown

               <argument>
                  <p>The Answer to the fifth Objection.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Answer to this Objection is
twofold; First,<note place="margin">The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the 5. Object.</note> That which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
is not true, for Tonnage and
Poundage have been taken by the Kings
Prerogative without Act of Parliament;
Secondly, If it had been true, it is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against the Kings Prerogative in
this point, for what is Tonnage but a
certain sum of money payable for every
Tun of VVine imported? did not King
<hi>Edw. 3</hi> by force of his <hi>Charter Mercatoria,</hi>
without Act of Parliament, take two
shillings for every Tun of VVine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by Strangers? did not the same
King set a new Imposition of <hi>Gauge, viz.</hi>
upon every Tun of VVine brought into
<hi>London,</hi> as is before expressed? and are
not the severall Impositions of VVines
taken by His Majesty in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
a kind of Tonnage? being nothing
else but extraordinary rates imposed
upon ever Tun of VVine, and levied
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:93719:80"/>
and taken by the Kings Prerogative.</p>
               <p>Again, was not the three pence upon
the pound imposed by King <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. by
his <hi>Charta Mercatoria,</hi> a kind of Pound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
and well nigh as great an Imposition
as twelve of the pound granted at this
day by Act of Parliament? if we consider
the Standard of Monies in the time of
King <hi>Edw. 1.</hi> when a peny sterling did
contain as much or more pure Silver, as
the three pence sterling doth contain at
this day; but admit that no Tonnage or
Poundage had ever been taken, but by
grant in Parliament; yet it is no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but that the King might impose
the like or the same by his Prerogative,
for three particular reasons: The first,
because these Subsidies were granted for
maintainance of the Navy Royall, the
charges whereof were grown so great in
the time of King <hi>Edw. 4.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ed. 4.</note> as appearech by
the Act of Tonnage and Poundage gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the 12 year of that Kings Reign,
that it sufficed not, nor in time to come
was like to suffice or defray the charge of
the Crown in keeping the Sea: these are
the words of that Act, if then in the time
of King <hi>Edw. 4.</hi> the Subsidy of Tonnage
being three shillings upon a Tun of
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:93719:80"/>
VVine brought in by Denizens, and six
shillings upon a tun brought in by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
and the Subsidy of Poundage or
of twelve pence of the pound upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>modities was not then sufficient
to bear the charge of the Royall Navy,
which was not comparable by many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
in strength, and beauty, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of Ships to the Kings Navie at this
day; Doth it stand with reason, that
the Crown should be stinted or limited
ever after to take no more than those
poor Subsidies granted at that time? that
the King should wait for a Parliament,
and pray an ayde of the Commons for a
competent means to maintain the Walls
of the Kingdom, when by the Common
Law of the Realm he may grant Letters
Patents for Murage, to maintain the
Walls of a Corporate Town. If any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
necessity should arise for repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Navy Royall, and making a
Navall War, should the King expect a
Parliament for a greater Subsidy to bee
granted by the Commons before he
should rigge and make ready his Ships,
perhaps a Kingdom might be lost in the
mean time; as if a Pilot sitting at the
Helm, and seeing a sudden gust of wind,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:93719:81"/>
would over-set the Ship, or perceiving
her to be running on a Rock, should for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to turn the Helm, or cause the Sail
to be stricken, untill he had consulted
with the Mariners or Passengers, and
demanded their consent or counsell in
the businesse; the Pilot himself with
his Mariners and Passengers might be
cast away, before they were agreed what
course to take.</p>
               <p>Secondly, these Subsidies of Tonnage
and Poundage were first granted by Act
of Parliament, in the time of the Civill
VVars between the two great Houses of
<hi>Lancaster</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> when the severall
Kings were loath to make use of their
Prerogatives, but were glad to please
their people, and loath to impose any
charge upon them, but by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in those troublesome times.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Kings and Princes oftentimes
of their own noble nature, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
in policy, do accept that of their
Subjects as a gift, which they might exact
&amp; take as a duty, and therefore our most
potent and politique Kings have ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and accepted many things in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which they might have done in
their private Chambers by their own
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:93719:81"/>
prerogative, without any other Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony;
who ever made doubt of the
Kings Prerogative in establishing the
Standard of monies, and yet how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Acts of Parliament do we find tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Monies, in the times of King <hi>E.
1.</hi> and King <hi>Edw. 2?</hi> the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
in making &amp; establishing Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall
Law, was never yet in question,
yet are there Acts of Parliament tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
Musters, departures of Souldiers
without their Captains Licences, or
the like.</p>
               <p>The King only doth give Honours,
and places of precedency, yet King
<hi>Hen. 8.</hi> made an Act of Parliament,
whereby he rancked the great Offices
of the Crown in their severall places,
as well in Council as in Parliament.</p>
               <p>No man ever doubted but the King
being the Fountain of Justice, may
erect Courts or Justice by his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
yet we find the Court of Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations,
and the Court of VVards,
erected by Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in the time of <hi>Edw. 2.</hi> we
find an Act of Declaration of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
Prerogatives of the Crown of
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:93719:82"/>
                  <hi>England,</hi> were most undoubted and
clear, yet His Majesty was pleased in
his first Parliament to accept of an Act

               <argument>
                  <p>The Conclusion.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BY these reasons and demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which are before expressed, it
is evident, that the King of <hi>England</hi> by
vertue of an ancient Prerogative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent
to the Crown and Scepter,
may justly and lawfully set Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon Merchandizes, and may li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
and rate the quantity and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof by his own wisdom and
discretion, without Act of Parliament;
and this Prerogative is warranted and
approved by the generall Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and the Law Merchant, which is
a principall branch of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
by the Imperial Law, the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall

practice of the most prudent Kings
and Queens of <hi>England</hi> since the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest;
and that this Prerogative is
grounded upon many excellent rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and that the severall Objections
made against this Prerogative, are
but shadows and colours of reason,
and clearly removed and washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by the severall Answers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>A Comparison of the Impositions set and
taken in <hi>England,</hi> by the Kings Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
with the Exceptions and Gabells
in Forein States and Kingdoms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it will appear, that the Subjects of the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> do not bear so heavy
a burthen by many degrees, as the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of other Nations do bear in this
kind.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>ALbeit, indeed the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
being no Emperor, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
all Imperiall Rights within his
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:93719:83"/>
own Kingdoms, hath and ever had as
absolute a Prerogative <hi>Imponere vecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galia,</hi>
or to lay Impositions, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror
of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Germany,</hi> or any other
King, Prince, or State in the world,
now have, or ever had; yet let it be
truly said for the honor of the Crown
of <hi>England,</hi> That His Majesty that now
is, and all his Noble Progenitors, have
used and put in practice this Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
with more moderation and favor
toward the people, than any Forein
State or Prince in the world have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
and that in three respects.</p>
               <p>First, the King of <hi>England</hi> doth make
use of this Prerogative only, in laying
Impositions upon Merchandizes cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
the Seas, upon such onely, and
not upon any other goods which are
bought and sold within the Land;
neither doth he by his absolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
alone, impose any Tax upon Lands
or <hi>Capita hominum,</hi> or <hi>Capita animalium,</hi>
or upon other things innumerable,
whereof there are strange presidents
and examples, both Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern,
in other Countries.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the King doth not charge
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:93719:83"/>
all Merchandizes crossing the Seas,
with this Imposition now in question,
for in the Letters Patent whereby the
Imposition of twelve pence in the
pound over and above the Subsidie of
Poundage, is laid and limited, divers
kinds of Commodities are excepted,
especially such as serve for food and
subsistance of the Kings people, for
setting the poor on work, for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainance
of Navigation, and other
things of like nature, as before is
declared.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Impositions which are
laid by the Kings of <hi>England</hi> upon
Merchandizes, are not so high as the
Impositions and Exactions set and
taken by other Princes and States; for
the highest Imposition in <hi>Ireland</hi> is
but twelve pence upon the pound, or
but a single Poundage, which is but
five in the hundred, and is the lowest
rate in <hi>Christendome</hi> at this day, and in
<hi>England</hi> there is added but twelve
penee in the pound more, which is
but ten pound upon the hundred
pound, and yet divers sorts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes,
as I said before, are except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:93719:84"/>
and discharged of that Imposition
of the second Imposition of twelve
pence.</p>
               <p>But on the other side let us see the
practice of other Princes and States in
laying Impositions, and how far they
have extended and strained their
Prerogative in that point, beyond and
above the Impositions in <hi>England;</hi> I
will begin with the <hi>Romans,</hi> when
they had gained the Monarchy of the
World, so as all Kingly power did rest
in their Emperor.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iulius Caesars <hi>Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
                  </note> laid the first Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
upon Forein Merchandizes,
saith <hi>Suetonius, peregrinarum mercinm
portaria primus instituit,</hi> and that Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
was <hi>Octava rerum pars,</hi> which
was more by a fifth part than our
highest Imposition in <hi>England,</hi> for it
is two shillings and six pence upon the
pound. Next, <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> about
the time of our Saviours Birth, sent
out an Edict, whereby he did tax all
the world, and this Tax was <hi>Capitatio,</hi>
or an Imposition, <hi>super capita hominum,</hi>
though the quantity thereof doth not
appear; but the poll-money which
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:93719:84"/>
our Saviour did pay, and wrought a
miracle, it seemeth to be an high Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
for the peeces of money taken
out of the Fishes mouth, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>didrachma,</hi> or <hi>stater,</hi> is said to bee
worth two shillings and six pence ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
which being given for himself
and <hi>Peter, da illis pro me et te,</hi> shews that
fifteen pence sterling was given for a
Poll, which must needs amount to an
infinite thing, if it were collected over
all the World, then subject to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Emperor.</p>
               <p>

succeeded <hi>Augustus,</hi> took the hundred
part of all things bought and sold

was an Imposition of greater value
and profit than the other. <hi>Caligula</hi>

likewise imposed a number of <hi>Sester<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>

                  <note place="margin">Vespasian</note> in meaner and more home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier
matters, took by way of Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
a part of every poor Labourers
wages, and part of every Beggers alms;
he set likewise an Imposition upon
Vrine, and pleased himself with this
<hi>Apothegm, Dulcis odor lucri ex re qualibet.
Severus</hi> the Emperor did impose upon
the dishonest gains of the Stews, and
took part of the Prostitutes there, as
the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth at this day;
all the Emperors before <hi>Trajan,</hi> took
the twentieth part of all Legacies and
Lands descended, as things which
came unlooked for, and as a cleer gain,
and therfore the Heirs and Legatories
might easily spare a part to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror;
and <hi>Nicephorus,</hi> one of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
of the East, did not onely take
<hi>sumaria tributa</hi> Smoke-money out of
every Chimney, but he layd an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
upon every mans Estate that
grew suddenly rich, upon a presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that hee had found a Treasury
which did belong to the Emperor by
Prerogative. With a little more search
I might find out other Impositions of
severall kinds, set by the ancient Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:93719:85"/>
upon the heads of Beasts, upon
the tiles of Houses, and the like; I
might adde hereunto the Impositions
set by <hi>Lotrain,</hi> upon every pane of
Glasse in Windows; but these may
suffice how high they strained, and
how far they extended their Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
in this point of Impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being
over-come by the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalls,</hi>
and other barbarous Nations,
and thereby broken into Kingdomes
and Free States, their passed divers
ages before these Monarchies could
be well setled, and before peace bred
plenty, and plenty bred civility, and
before Trade, Traffique, Comerce,
and Intercourse could be established
between these States, and Kingdoms,
and therefore while these States and
Kingdoms were yet but poor, and
while there was a generall scarcity of
Gold and Silver in these parts of the
World, and so for want of money
there was but little Trade and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique
among the people, either at
home or broad, Kings and Princes
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:93719:86"/>
did not, neither could they make
that use of their Prerogative in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Impositions, as they had done in
those latter times; since all Arts and
Sciences have been encreased, all
Commodities improved, and the
Riches of the East and West <hi>Indies</hi>
have been transported into this He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misphere.
But now let us see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Kings and Princes of other
Countries round about us at this day,
make not a far more profitable use of
their Prerogatives in laying Imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon their people, than the
King of <hi>England</hi> doth, albeit his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
power be full as large as any of

of every Ship that passeth into
the <hi>Sound,</hi> taking advantage of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Straight between <hi>Elsmore</hi> and
<hi>Copman</hi> Haven; whereas the King of
<hi>England</hi> being the undoubted Lord of
the Narrow Seas, between <hi>Dover</hi> and
<hi>Callis,</hi> might take the like Toll if it
pleased him, and by the same right
might participate of the great gain of
Fishing which the Busses of <hi>Holland</hi>
and <hi>Zeland</hi> do make yearly upon the
Coasts of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we see by this comparison,
that the King of <hi>England</hi> doth lay but
his little Finger upon his Subjects,
when other Princes and States do lay
their heavy loins upon their people;
what is the reason of this difference?
from whence commeth it? assuredly
not from a different Power or Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,
for the King of <hi>England</hi> is as
absolute a Monarch, as any Emperor
or King in the world, and hath as many
Prerogatives incident to his Crown;
whence then proceedeth it? to what
profitable cause may we ascribe it?
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:93719:90"/>
certainly to divers causes profitable,
and principally to these causes, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
First, our King of <hi>England</hi>
hath alwayes gone before, and beyond
all other Kings in <hi>Christendome</hi> in many
points of Magnificency, and especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in this, That they have alwayes had
a more Rich and Royall Demean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
to the Crown, I mean more
large and Royall Patrimony in Lands
and Rents, than ever any Christian
King had before, or now hath at this
day; for it is certain, that the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of other Princes and States do
principally consist in such Gabells,
Impositions, and Exactions, as are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
remembred, and not in <hi>terra firma,</hi>
not in such a Reall and Royall Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
as hath ever belonged to the
Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Kings being lesse able to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
their Estates, or more covetous
in their own Nature, have laid heavier
Burthens upon their Subjects, than
ever the King of <hi>England</hi> hath layd, or
will do, or hereafter hath need to do,
God be blessed for it; the Kings of
<hi>England</hi> have had the Princes Portion
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:93719:90"/>
spoken of before in 45 of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezek. 45.</note> and
therefore they had no need so to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
the people.</p>
               <p>Again, we may ascribe this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to the bounty and noble nature
of our Kings, that they would never
descend to those poor and sordid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
which other Princes &amp; States
do take of their Subjects, <hi>Sordidum pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum
est aurum quod ex lachrimis ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
as a good Counseller told <hi>Vespa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, we may ascribe it to the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and policy of our Kings, who
would never follow the Counsell of
<hi>Rehoboams</hi> younger Counsellers, <hi>boni
pastoris est oves tondere non diglubere,</hi> as
<hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperor was wont to say,
<hi>Odi hortulanum</hi> (saith Alexander) <hi>qui
ab radice olera excindit; qui nimis emergit
elicit sanguinem,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Solomon.</note> they well
considered that the money levied by
Taxes and Impositions, is the blood
of the people, which is not to bee
let out in any great quantity, but to
save the life, as it were, of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth,
when she is sick, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted,
and in great danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:93719:91"/>
Again, it may be ascribed to their
Piety and Religion which moved
them to follow the counsell of the
Divine Rule, <hi>Deut. 17:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> where the King
is warned not to multiply upon him
much Gold and Silver, for that indeed
there doth seldome come good by
great Treasure heapt up by a great
Prince, for it doth but nourish Pride
and Ambition in him, and stir him up
many times to make an unjust Warre
upon his Neighbours; or if he leave
it unto his Successers, it makes them
luxurious and vitious, which draweth
with it sometimes the ruin of the
kingdome, <hi>sed optimus &amp; certissimus
thesaurus Principis est in loculis subdito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
saith the learned <hi>Buterus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Buterus contra Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavill.</note> in his
Book against <hi>Machiavill,</hi> let the King,
saith he, have a care to maintain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
and Justice, and Peace, in his
Kingdom, this will soon bring plenty,
with a continuall increase, and make
a rich and wealthy people; then shall
the King never want money to serve
his just, and necessary, and honourable
occasions; for it is impossible the
Soveraign should be poor when the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:93719:91"/>
Subjects are rich, and untill occasions
do arise, the Coffers of his Subjects
will be his best Exchequer; they will
be his Treasurers, they will be his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers,
his Tellers without fees or
wages, no bad Accomptant shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him, nor no Bankrupt Officer
shall deceive him, they will keep the
Treasure of the Kingdom so frugally,
as no Importunate Courtier shall be
able to withdraw the same from a
Prince, but that it shall still remain in
store to supply the necessities of the
Common wealth.</p>
               <p>Lastly, our Kings of <hi>England</hi> in their
wisdoms, well understood the natures
and dispositions of their people, and
knowing them to be a free, generous,
and noble Nation, held them not fit to
be beaten with <hi>Rehoboams</hi> Rod, estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
them too good to be whipt with
Scorpions, and therefore God be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
we have not in <hi>England,</hi> the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beller
standing at every Towns end;
we have not a Publican in every Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
we pay not a Gabell for every
Bunch of Reddish, or Branch of Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary
sold in <hi>Cheap-side,</hi> we have none
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:93719:92"/>
of those Harpies which do swarm in
other Countries, we have no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
in the streets, as is said in the
144. <hi>Psalm;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psa.144.</note> and therefore I may well
conclude with the conclusion of that
Psalm, Happy are the people that are
in such a case, blessed is the people
that have the Lord for their God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
in Heaven, and King <hi>Iames</hi> for
their King here upon Earth.</p>
