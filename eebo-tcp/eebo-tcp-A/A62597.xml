            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

THE
PRESIDENT,

And the rest of the worthy
Governours of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital
of Christ Church in

            <p>WHen upon the request
of some of the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Friends of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> deceased, and,
to speak the truth, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
with mine own inclination
<pb facs="tcp:56294:3"/>
to doe right to the memory of so
good a man, and to set so great
an Example in the view of all
men, I had determined to make
this Discourse publick; I knew
not where more fitly to address
it than to your selves who are
the living pattern of the same
Vertue, and the faithfull dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensers
and managers of one
of the best and greatest Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
in the world: Especially
since he had a particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to you, and was pleased
for some years last past, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any other consideration but
that of Charity, to employ his
constant pains in Catechising
the poor children of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spital;
wisely considering of
<pb facs="tcp:56294:3"/>
how great consequence it was
to this City, to have the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
of Religion well laid
in the tender years of so many
persons as were afterwards to be
planted there in several Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions;
and from a true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility
of mind, being ready to
stoop to the meanest office and
service, to doe good.</p>
            <p>I have heard from an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
Friend of his that he
would sometimes with great
pleasure say, that he had two
<hi>Livings</hi> which he would not
exchange for two of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
in <hi>England,</hi> meaning
<hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi>'s <hi>Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal:</hi>
Contrary to common ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
he esteemed every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb facs="tcp:56294:4"/>
of being usefull and
serviceable to God and men a
<hi>rich Benefice,</hi> and those his
best <hi>Patrons</hi> and <hi>Benefactors,</hi>
not who did him good, but who
gave him the opportunity and
means of doing it. To you
therefore as his <hi>Patrons</hi> this
Sermon doth of right belong,
and to you I humbly dedicate
it; heartily beseeching Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
God, to raise up many by his
example that may <hi>serve their
generation according to the
will of God,</hi> as he did. I am</p>

            <head>A
SERMON
Preached at the Funeral of
M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> THOMAS GOVGE,
With a short account of his Life.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>LUKE XX. 37, 38.</bibl>
               <q>Now that the dead are raised, ever
Moses shewed at the bush, when
he calleth the Lord the God of
Abraham, the God of Isaac, and
the God of Jacob. For he is not
a God of the dead, but of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:
For all live to him.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE occasion of these words
of our blessed Saviour was
an Objection which the
<hi>Sadduces</hi> made against the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:56294:5"/>
grounded upon a case
which had sometimes happened
among them, of a woman that had
had seven brethren successively to
her husbands. Upon which case
they put this Question to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour;
<hi>whose wife of the seven shall
this woman be at the Resurrection?</hi>
That is, if men live in another
world, how shall the controversie
between these seven brethren be
decided? for they all seem to have
an equal claim to this woman,
each of them having had her to his
wife.</p>
            <p>This captious Question was not
easie to be answered by the <hi>Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees,</hi>
who fancied the enjoyments
of the next life to be of the same
kind with the sensual pleasures of
this world, onely greater and more
durable. From which Tradition
of the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning a sensual
Paradise, <hi>Mahomet</hi> seems to have
taken the pattern of his; as he did
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:56294:5"/>
likewise many other things from
the Jewish Traditions. Now up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this supposition, that in the
next life there will be marrying
and giving in marriage, it was a
Question not easily satisfied, Whose
wife of the seven this woman should
then be?</p>
            <p>But our Saviour clearly avoids
the whole force of it, by shewing
the different state of men in this
world, and in the other. <hi>The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of this world</hi> (says he) <hi>marry,
and are given in marriage; but they
who shall be accounted worthy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that world, and the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the dead, neither marry,
nor are given in marriage.</hi> And
he does not barely and magisteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
assert this Doctrine, but gives
a plain and substantial Reason for
it; because <hi>they cannot die any more.</hi>
After men have lived a while in
this world they are taken away by
death, and therefore marriage is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:56294:6"/>
necessary to maintain a succession
of mankind; but in the other world
men shall become immortal and
live for ever, and then the reason
of marriage will wholly cease: For
when men can die no more there
will then be no need of any new
supplies of mankind.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour having thus cleared
himself of this Objection by taking
away the ground and foundation
of it, he produceth an Argument
for the proof of the Resurrection,
in the Words of my Text; <hi>Now
that the dead are raised, Moses
even shewed at the bush, when he
calleth the Lord the God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
the God of Isaac, and the God
of Jacob,</hi> That is, when in one of
his Books God is brought in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
to him out of the bush, and
calling himself by the Title of the
God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi>
and the God of <hi>Jacob.</hi> From
whence our Saviour infers the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:56294:6"/>
because <hi>God is not the
God of the dead but of the living:
For all live to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My design from these Words is,
to shew the force and strength of
this Argument which our Saviour
urgeth for the proof of the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.
In order whereunto I
shall,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> Consider it as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<hi>ad hominem,</hi> and shew the
fitness and force of it to convince
those with whom our Saviour dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I shall enquire, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be more than an Argument
<hi>ad hominem?</hi> And if it be, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the real and absolute force of it
doth consist?</p>
            <p>And then, I shall apply this
Doctrine of the Resurrection to
the present Occasion.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>First.</hi> We will consider it as
an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and shew
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:56294:7"/>
the fitness and force of it to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
those with whom our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
disputed. And this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
if we carefully consider these
<hi>four</hi> things.</p>
            <p>1. What our Saviour intended
directly and immediately to prove
by this Argument.</p>
            <p>2. The extraordinary venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the <hi>Jews</hi> in general had
for the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> above
any other Books of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</p>
            <p>3. The peculiar notion which
the <hi>Jews</hi> had concerning the use
of this Phrase or expression of <hi>God's
being any ones God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The great respect which the
<hi>Jews</hi> had for these three Fathers of
their Nation, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and
<hi>Jacob.</hi> For each of these make our
Saviour's Argument more forcible
against those with whom he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:56294:7"/>
               <hi>First.</hi> We will consider what
our Saviour intended directly and
immediately to prove by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.
And that was this, That
there is another state after this life,
wherein men shall be happy or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable
according as they have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in this world. And this doth
not onely suppose the immortality
of the Soul, but forasmuch as the
Body is an essential part of man
doth by consequence infer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of the Body; because
otherwise the <hi>man</hi> would not be
happy or miserable in the other
world. But I cannot see any suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
ground to believe that our
Saviour intended by this Argument
directly and immediately to prove
the resurrection of the Body, but
onely by consequence, and as it
follows from the admission of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
state wherein men shall be
rewarded or punished. For that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:56294:8"/>
Reason of our Saviour, that <hi>God is
not a God of the dead but of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,</hi>
if it did directly prove the
resurrection of the Body, it would
prove that the Bodies of <hi>Abraham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were raised to life
again, at or before that time when
God spake to <hi>Moses</hi> and called him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and
<hi>Jacob:</hi> But we do not believe this;
and therefore ought not to suppose
that it was the intention of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
directly and immediately to
prove the resurrection of the Body,
but onely (as I said before) a future
state. And that this was all our
Saviour intended will more plainly
appear, if we consider what that
Errour of the <hi>Sadduces</hi> was which
our Saviour here confutes. And
<hi>Josephus,</hi> who very well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the difference of the Sects
among the <hi>Jews,</hi> and gives a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
account of them, makes not
the least mention of any Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56294:8"/>
between the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and
the <hi>Sadduces</hi> about the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Body. All that he says,
is this. That the <hi>Pharisees</hi> hold
the immortality of the Soul, and
that there are Rewards and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in another world: But the
<hi>Sadduces</hi> denied all this, and that
there was any other state after this
life. And this is the very same ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
with that which is given of
them in the <hi>New Testament, ver.</hi> 27.
of this <hi>Chap. The Sadduces who
deny that there is any resurrection.</hi>
The meaning of which is more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
declared, <hi>Acts 23. 8. The Saddu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
say that there is no resurrection,
neither angel nor spirit; but the
Pharisees confess both.</hi> That is, the
<hi>Sadduces</hi> denied that there was any
other state of men after this life,
and that there was any such thing
as an immortal Spirit, either An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
or the Souls of men surviving
their Bodies. And, as Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:56294:9"/>
hath judiciously observed,
this is the true importance of the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>future</hi> or <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
state;</hi> unless in such Texts
where the Context does restrain it
to the raising again of the Body, or
where some word that denotes the
<hi>body,</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> The force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
against those with whom
our Saviour disputed will further
appear, if we consider the great ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
which the <hi>Jews</hi> in general
had for the Writings of <hi>Moses</hi> above
any other Books of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
which they (especially the
<hi>Sadduces)</hi> looked upon onely as Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications
and Comments upon the
Law of <hi>Moses:</hi> But they esteemed
nothing as a necessary Article of
Faith which had not some founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the Writings of <hi>Moses.</hi> And
this seems to me to be the true Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:56294:9"/>
why our Saviour chose to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute
them out of <hi>Moses,</hi> rather than
any other part of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
And not as many learned
men have imagined, because the
<hi>Sadduces</hi> did not receive any part
of the Old Testament but onely
the <hi>five</hi> Books of <hi>Moses;</hi> so that it
was in vain to argue against them
out of any other. This I know
hath been a general opinion, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
I think upon the mistake of a
passage in <hi>Josephus,</hi> who says the
<hi>Sadduces onely received the written
Law.</hi> But if we carefully consider
that passage, we shall find that <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi>
doth not there oppose the
<hi>Law</hi> to the <hi>other Books</hi> of the Old
Testament, which were also <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten;</hi>
but to <hi>Oral Tradition.</hi> For
he says expresly, that <hi>the Sadduces
onely received the written Law, but
the Pharisees, over and besides what
was written, received the Oral which
they call Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:56294:10"/>
I deny not but that in the <hi>later</hi>
Prophets there are more express
<hi>Texts</hi> for the proof of a future state,
than any are to be found in the
Books of <hi>Moses.</hi> As <hi>Daniel 12. 2.
And many of them that sleep in the
dust of the earth shall awake, some
to everlasting life, and some to shame
and everlasting contempt.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it seems very plain that holy
men among the <hi>Jews,</hi> towards the
expiration of the Legal dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had still clearer and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
apprehensions concerning a
future state than are to be met with
in the Writings of <hi>Moses,</hi> or of any
of the <hi>Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Law given by <hi>Moses</hi> did
suppose the <hi>Immortality of the Souls
of men,</hi> and the <hi>expectation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
life after this,</hi> as Principles of
Religion in some degree naturally
known; but made no new and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
Revelation of these things:
Nor was there any occasion for it,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:56294:10"/>
the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> being a Political
Law, not intended for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mankind, but of one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Nation; and therefore was
establish'd, as Political Laws are,
upon temporal promises and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings;
promising temporal prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the observation of its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
and threatning the breach of
them with temporal judgments and
calamities.</p>
            <p>And this I take to be the true
reason why arguments fetch'd from
another world are so obscurely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
upon under that Dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
not but that another life after
this was always suppos'd, and was
undoubtedly the hope and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of good men under the Law,
but the clear discovery of it was
reserv'd for the Times of the <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias.</hi>
And therefore as those Times
drew on, and <hi>the Sun of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
was nearer his rising, the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of the night began to be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:56294:11"/>
away, and mens apprehensions
of a future state to clear up; so that
in the time of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> good
men spake with more confidence
and assurance of these things.</p>
            <p>It is likewise to be consider'd, that
the temporal calamities and suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
with which the <hi>Jews</hi> were
almost continually harass'd from
the time of their Captivity had very
much wean'd good men from the
consideration of temporal promises,
and awaken'd their minds to the
more serious thoughts of another
world. It being natural to men
when they are destitute of present
comfort, to support themselves with
the expectation of better things for
the future, and as the Apostle to
the <hi>Hebrews</hi> expresseth it, <hi>c. 6. v. 18.
to fly for refuge to lay hold upon
the hope that is before them,</hi> and
to imploy their reason to fortifie
themselves as well as they can in
that persuasion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:56294:11"/>
And this I doubt not was the
true occasion of those clearer and
riper apprehensions of good men
concerning a future state, in those
times of distress and persecution;
it being very agreeable to the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and goodness of the Divine
Providence not to leave his People
destitute of sufficient support<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under
great trials and sufferings: And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the hopes of a better life
could have born up the spirits of
men under such cruel tortures.
And of this we have a most remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable
Instance in the History of
the <hi>seven Brethren</hi> in the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi>
who being cruelly tortured
and put to death by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> do
most expresly declare their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
expectation of a resurrection
to a better life. To which Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
the <hi>Apostle</hi> certainly refers.
<hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 35. when he says, <hi>others
were tortured, not accepting deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
that they might obtain a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:56294:12"/>
better resurrection:</hi> where the
word, which we render <hi>were tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd,</hi>
is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is
the very word used in the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees</hi>
to express the particular kind
of torture us'd upon them; besides
that being <hi>offer'd deliverance</hi> they
most resolutely <hi>refus'd</hi> to <hi>accept</hi> of
it, with this express declaration that
they hop'd for a <hi>resurrection</hi> to a
<hi>better</hi> life.</p>
            <p>But to return to my purpose,
notwithstanding there might be
more clear and express <hi>Texts</hi> to
this purpose in the ancient <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi>
yet our Saviour knowing
how great a regard not onely
the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> but all the <hi>Jews</hi> had
to the Authority of <hi>Moses,</hi> he
thought fit to bring his proof of
the resurrection out of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
as that which was the most
likely to convince them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:56294:12"/>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> If we consider further
the peculiar Notion which the <hi>Jews</hi>
had concerning the use of this phrase
or expression of <hi>God's being any ones
God.</hi> And that was this. That
God is no where in Scripture said
to be any ones God while he was
alive. And therefore they tell us
that while <hi>Isaac</hi> lived, God is not
called the God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> but the
<hi>fear of Isaac.</hi> As <hi>Gen. 31. 42. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the God of Abraham and the
fear of Isaac had been with me;</hi>
and <hi>ver.</hi> 53. when <hi>Laban</hi> made a
Covenant with <hi>Jacob,</hi> 'tis said that
<hi>Laban did swear by the God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
and the God of Nahor, and
the God of their Fathers,</hi> but <hi>Jacob</hi>
swore <hi>by the fear of his father Isaac.</hi>
I will not warrant this Observati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be good, because I certainly
know it is not true. For God doth
expresly call himself the God of
<hi>Isaac,</hi> while <hi>Isaac</hi> was yet alive,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:56294:13"/>
               <hi>Gen. 28. 13. I am the Lord God of
Abraham thy father, and the God
of Isaac.</hi> It is sufficient to my
purpose, that this was a Notion
anciently currant among the <hi>Jews.</hi>
And therefore our Saviour's Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from this Expression must be
so much the stronger against <hi>them:</hi>
For if the Souls of men be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
by death (as the <hi>Sadduces</hi>
believed) what did it signifie to
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> to have
God called <hi>their God</hi> after they
were dead? But surely for God to
be any ones God doth signifie some
great benefit and advantage; which
yet (according to the notion which
the <hi>Jews</hi> had of this Phrase) could
not respect this life, because, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to <hi>them,</hi> God is not said to be
any ones God till after he is dead:
But it is thus said of <hi>Abraham, Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac</hi>
and <hi>Jacob</hi> after their death, and
therefore our Saviour infers very
strongly against <hi>them,</hi> that <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:56294:13"/>
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished
by death, but do still
live somewhere: for <hi>God is not the
God of the dead, but of the living.</hi>
And then he adds by way of further
explication, <hi>for all live to him.</hi>
That is, though those good men
who are departed this life, do not
still live <hi>to us,</hi> here in this world,
yet <hi>they live to God;</hi> and are with
him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> If we consider the
great respect which the <hi>Jews</hi> had
for those three Fathers of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
They had an extraordinary opinion
of them, and esteemed nothing too
great to be thought or said of them.
And therefore we find that they
looked upon it as a great arrogance
for any man to assume any thing
to himself that might seem to set
him above <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> or <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob.</hi>
With what indignation did
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:56294:14"/>
they fly upon our Saviour on this
account? <hi>John 4. 12. Art thou
greater than our father Jacob?</hi> and
<hi>chap. 8. ver. 53. Art thou greater
than our father Abraham: whom
makest thou thy self?</hi> Now they
who had so superstitious a venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for them, would easily believe
any thing of privilege to belong to
them: so that our Saviour doth
with great advantage instance in
them, in favour of whom they
would be enclined to extend the
meaning of any promise to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most,
and allow it to signifie as
much as the words could possibly
bear. So that it is no wonder that
the <hi>Text</hi> tells us that this Argument
put the <hi>Sadduces</hi> to silence. They
durst not attempt a thing so odious,
as to go about to take away any
thing of privilege from <hi>Abraham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I have, as briefly as
the matter would bear, endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:56294:14"/>
to shew the fitness and force of
this Argument to convince those
with whom our Saviour disputed.
I come now, in the</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Second</hi> place, to enquire
Whether this be any more than an
Argument <hi>ad hominem?</hi> And if it
be, wherein the real and absolute
force of it doth consist?</p>
            <p>I do not think it necessary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that every Argument used by
our Saviour, or his Apostles, is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and in it self conclusive.
For an Argument which doth not
really prove the thing in Question,
may yet be a very good Argument
<hi>ad hominem;</hi> and in some cases
more convincing to him with
whom we dispute than that which
is a better Argument in it self.
Now it is possible, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
intention might not be to
bring a conclusive proof of the
Resurrection, but onely to confute
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:56294:15"/>
those who would needs be dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
with him. And to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
an Argument <hi>ad hominem,</hi>
which proceeded upon grounds
which they themselves could not
deny, might be very proper and
effectual. But although it be not
necessary to believe, that this was
more than an Argument <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem;</hi>
yet it is the better to us, if
it be absolutely and in it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive
of the thing in Question.
And this I hope will sufficiently
appear, if we consider these <hi>four</hi>
things.</p>
            <p>1. That for God to be <hi>any ones
God</hi> doth signifie some very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
blessing and happiness,
to those persons of whom this is
said.</p>
            <p>2. If we consider the eminent
faith and obedience of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to whom this promise is
made.</p>
            <p>3. Their condition in this world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:56294:15"/>
4. The general importance of
this promise, abstracting from the
persons particularly specified and
named in it, <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and
<hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First.</hi> If we consider, that for
God to be <hi>any ones God</hi> doth sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
some very extraordinary bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and happiness to those persons
of whom this is said. It is a big
word for God to declare himself to
be <hi>any ones God:</hi> and the least we
can imagine to be meant by it, is
that God will in an extraordinary
manner imploy his power and
wisedom to doe him good: that
he will concern himself more for
the happiness of those whose God
he declares himself to be, than for
others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> If we consider the
eminent faith and obedience of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob. Abraham</hi>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:56294:16"/>
left his Country in obedience to
God, not knowing whither he was
to go. And, which was one of
the most unparallel'd and strange
instances of faith and obedience
that can almost be imagined, he
was willing to have sacrificed his
onely Son at the command of God.
<hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> were also very
good men, and devout worshippers
of the true God, when almost the
whole world was sunk into Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
and all manner of impiety.
Now what can we imagin, but
that the good God did design some
extraordinary reward to such faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
servants of his? especially if we
consider, that he intended this gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
declaration of his concerning
them, for a standing encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to all those who in after Ages
should follow the faith and tread in
the steps of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and
<hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:56294:16"/>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> If we consider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>
in this world. The Scripture tells
us, that <hi>they were pilgrims and
strangers upon the earth;</hi> had no
fixed and settled habitation, but
were forced to wander from one
Kingdom and Country to another:
that they were exposed to many
hazards and difficulties, to great
troubles and afflictions in this
world; so that there was no such
peculiar happiness befell them in
this life above the common rate of
men, as may seem to fill up the
big words of this promise, that
<hi>God would be their God.</hi> For so
far as the Scripture History in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms
us, and further we cannot
know of this matter, <hi>Esau</hi> was as
prosperous as <hi>Jacob;</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> had
a great many more troubles and
afflictions in this life than <hi>Esau</hi> had.
But surely when God calls himself
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56294:17"/>
               <hi>the God of Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob,</hi> this signifies that God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
some very peculiar blessing
and advantage to them above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:
which seeing they did not
enjoy in this world, it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
to believe that one time or
other this gracious declaration and
promise of God was made good to
them.</p>
            <p>And therefore the Apostle to the
<hi>Hebrews, chap.</hi> 11. from this very
expression, of <hi>God</hi>'s being said <hi>to
be the God</hi> of <hi>Abraham</hi> and others,
argues that some extraordinary hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
was reserved for them in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
world: and that upon this
very ground I am now speaking of,
namely, because the condition of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> and some others, was
not such in this world as might
seem to answer the fulness of this
promise. <hi>All these,</hi> says he, <hi>died
in the faith, not having received
the promises, but having seen them
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:56294:17"/>
afar off, and were perswaded of them,
and embraced them, and confessed
that they were strangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
upon the earth.</hi> From whence
he reasons very strongly that these
good men might reasonably expect
something better than any thing
that had befallen them in this world.
<hi>For they,</hi> says he, <hi>that say such
things declare plainly that they seek
a Country;</hi> which at the 16. <hi>verse</hi>
he calls <hi>a better Country, that is a
heavenly. They that say such things,</hi>
that is, they who acknowledge
themselves to be strangers and pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
in the earth, and yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that God hath promised <hi>to be
their God,</hi> declare plainly that they
expect some reward beyond this
life. From all which he concludes,
<hi>Wherefore God is not ashamed to be
called their God, because he hath
prepared for them a City:</hi> Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that if no happiness had remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for these good men in another
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:56294:18"/>
world, this promise of God's <hi>being
their God,</hi> would shamefully have
fallen short of what it seemed to
import, <hi>viz.</hi> some extraordinary
reward and blessing worthy of God
to bestow; something more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
and lasting than any of the
enjoyments of this world: which
since God had abundantly perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to them in the happiness of
another life, his promise to them
was made good to the full, and he
needed not <hi>be ashamed to be called
their God.</hi> But if nothing beyond
this life had been reserved for them,
that Saying of old <hi>Jacob</hi> towards
the conclusion of his life, <hi>few and
evil have the days of the years of
my life been,</hi> would have been an
eternal reflexion upon the truth
and faithfulness of Him who had
so often called himself the God of
<hi>Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now, because to all this it
may be said, that this Promise seems
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:56294:18"/>
to have been made good to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in this world:
For was not God the God of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> when he took
such a particular and extraordinary
care of them, and protected them
from the manifold dangers they
were exposed to by such a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
and immediate providence, <hi>suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
no one to doe them harm, but
rebuking even Kings for their sakes?</hi>
Was not he <hi>Abraham</hi>'s God, when
he blest him so miraculously with a
Son in his old age, and with so
considerable an estate to leave to
him? Was not that Saying of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
a great acknowledgment of the
gracious providence of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him, <hi>with my staff passed I
over this Jordan, and now I am be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
two bands?</hi> And though it
must needs be a very cutting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
to him to lose his Son <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph,</hi>
as he thought he had done,
yet that was more than recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:56294:19"/>
to him in <hi>Joseph</hi>'s strange ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> whereby
God put into his hands the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of saving his Father and his
whole Family alive. And was not
God <hi>the God</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi>
and <hi>Jacob,</hi> in making them Fathers
of so numerous an off-spring, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
became <hi>a great Nation:</hi>
and in giving them a fruitfull Land,
and bringing them to the quiet
possession of it by such a <hi>series</hi> of
wonderfull Miracles? what need
then is there of extending this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to another world? doth it not
seem abundantly made good in
those great blessings which God
bestowed upon them whilst they
liv'd, and afterwards upon their
posterity, in this world? And does
not this agree well enough with
the first and most obvious sense of
these words, <hi>I am the God of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
Isaac and Jacob,</hi> that is,
I am he that was their God while
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:56294:19"/>
they were alive, and am still the
God of their posterity for their
sakes? I say, because the <hi>three</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Considerations are liable to
this Objection, which seems whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to take off the force of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument;
therefore for the full clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of this matter, I will add one
consideration more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> then, we will consider
the general importance of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
abstracting from the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
persons specified and named in
it, <hi>viz. Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi>
and that is, that God will make a
wide and plain difference between
good and bad men; he will be <hi>so</hi>
the God of good men as he is not
of the wicked; and some time or
other put every good man into a
better and happier condition than
any wicked man: so that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
importance of this promise
is finally resolved into the equity
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:56294:20"/>
and justice of the Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>And unless we suppose another
life after this, it will certainly be
very hard, and I think impossible,
to reconcile the History of the Old
Testament, and the common ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances
of things in this world,
with the justice and goodness of
God's Providence.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denyed, but that
<hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and
several good men in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,
had many signal Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies
of the Divine favour vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed
to them in this world: But
we reade likewise of several wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
men, that had as large a share
of temporal blessings. It is very
true that <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
had great estates, and were
petty Princes: But <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a
mighty Prince in comparison of
them; and the Kingdom of <hi>Aegypt,</hi>
which probably was the first and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:56294:20"/>
chief seat of Idolatry, was at the
same time one of the most potent
and flourishing Kingdoms in the
world; and was blest with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious
plenty, whereby they were
furnished with store of corn, when
good <hi>Jacob</hi> and his Family had like
to have perished by famine. 'Tis
true, <hi>Joseph</hi> was advanc'd to great
power in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and thereby had
the opportunity of saving his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
house, by settling them, and
feeding them in <hi>Egypt:</hi> But then
it is to be considered again, that
this cost them very dear, and their
coming thither was the occasion
of a long and cruel bondage to <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s
posterity; so that we see that
these good men had no such bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings,
but what were common
with them to many others that
were wicked: and the blessings
which God bestowed upon them
had great abatements by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture
of many and sore afflictions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:56294:21"/>
It seems then, upon the whole
matter, to be very plain, that the
Providences of God in this world
towards good men are so contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
that it may sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
to those who wisely consider
the works of God, that they are
not neglected by him; and yet that
these outward blessings are so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
dispensed, that no man
can certainly be concluded to be a
good man from any happiness he
enjoys in this life: And the prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of good men is usually on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
so shadowed and mixed with
afflictions, as may justly raise their
hopes to the expectation of a more
perfect happiness and better reward
than any they meet with in this
world.</p>
            <p>And is so, then the general im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
of this Promise, that <hi>God
will be the God</hi> of good men, must
necessarily signifie something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this world: Because in this
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:56294:21"/>
world there is not that clear diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
universally made between
good and bad men which the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
of the Divine Providence doth
require, and which seems to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in the general sense of this
Promise. For if this Promise
(though personally made to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob)</hi> be intended,
as the Scripture tells us it was, for
a standing encouragement to good
men in all Ages, then it still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
in it this general Truth, <hi>that
God will some time or other plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reward every good man,</hi> that
is, he will doe something far
better for him than for any wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
man: But it is impossible to
reconcile this sense of it with the
course of God's Providence, and
with the History of the Bible.</p>
            <p>And to make this out fully and
at once, I will onely produce that
single Instance of <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Cain.
Abel</hi> offered to God <hi>a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:56294:22"/>
sacrifice than Cain,</hi> and he <hi>had
this testimony, that he pleased God;</hi>
which was in effect to declare, that
<hi>God was the God</hi> of <hi>Abel</hi> and not of
<hi>Cain;</hi> so that by virtue of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
importance of this Promise,
it might justly be expected that
<hi>Abel</hi>'s condition should have been
much better than <hi>Cain</hi>'s: But if
there be no happiness after this life,
<hi>Abel</hi>'s was evidently much worse.
For upon this very account, <hi>that
he pleased God</hi> better he was killed
by <hi>Cain,</hi> who had offered to God
a slight and contemptuous offering.
And <hi>Cain</hi> lived a long time after,
and grew great, and <hi>built Cities.</hi>
Now supposing there were no other
life after this, this must have been
a most horrible Example to all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
from the beginning of the
world to the end of it, and have
made men for ever afraid to please
God upon such hard terms; when
they were sure of no other reward
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:56294:22"/>
for so doing, but to be oppress'd
and slain by the hands of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
So that if this were really
the Case, it would puzzle all the
Wit and Reason of mankind to
vindicate the equity and justice of
the Divine Providence, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scue
it out of the hands of this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
Objection.</p>
            <p>And thus I have as briefly as I
could, endeavoured to clear to you
the force of this Argument used by
our Saviour for the Proof of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection.
And have the longer
insisted upon it, because at first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
it seems to be but a very
obscure and remote Argument:
And yet so much the more neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to be clear'd, because this in
all probability was that very <hi>Text</hi>
upon which the <hi>Jews</hi> in our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's
time grounded their belief of
a future state, in opposition to the
errour of the <hi>Sadduces;</hi> and which
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:56294:23"/>
they call'd by way of eminency
<hi>the promise made of God unto the
Fathers.</hi> As will plainly appear,
if we consider what S. <hi>Paul</hi> says to
this purpose, when he appeals so
often to the <hi>Pharisees</hi> for his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with them in this Article of
the Resurrection, and likewise in
the ground of it from <hi>the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
made of God unto the fathers.</hi>
Acts 24. 14, 15. <hi>But this I confess
unto thee, that after the way which
they call heresie, so worship I the
God of my Fathers, believing all
things which are written in the
Law and the Prophets; and have
hope towards God, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
also allow, that there shall be
a resurrection of the dead.</hi> From
whence it is clear, that they both
grounded their hope of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
upon something <hi>written in
the Law and the Prophets;</hi> and
what that was he expresseth more
particularly <hi>c. 26. v. 6, 7. And now
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:56294:23"/>
stand, and am judged for the hope
of the promise made of God unto
our Fathers; unto which promise
our twelve Tribes, instantly serving
God day and night, hope to come.
By the promise made of God unto
the Fathers</hi> he means some promise
made by God to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi>
and <hi>Jacob;</hi> for so S. <hi>Luke</hi> more
than once, in this History of the
<hi>Acts,</hi> explains this phrase of <hi>the God
of their Fathers,</hi> Acts 3. 13. <hi>The
God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and
of Jacob, the God of our Fathers;</hi>
and <hi>c. 7. v. 32. I am the God of thy
Fathers, the God of Abraham, and
the God of Isaac, and the God of
Jacob.</hi> Now what was the great
and famous Promise which God
made to <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob?</hi>
was it not this of <hi>being their God?</hi>
So that it was this very Promise
upon which S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us the
<hi>Jews</hi> grounded their hope of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
state, because they understood
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:56294:24"/>
it necessarily to signifie some bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
and happiness beyond this
life.</p>
            <p>And now having, I hope, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
clear'd this matter, I shall
make some improvement of this
Doctrine of a future state, and
that, to these <hi>three</hi> purposes.</p>
            <p>1. To raise our minds above this
world and the enjoyments of this
present life. Were but men tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
convinced of this plain and
certain Truth, that there is a vast
difference between Time and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
between a few years and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Ages: would we but repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to our selves what thoughts
and apprehensions dying persons
have of this world; how vain and
empty a thing it appears to them,
how like a pageant and a shadow
it looks as it passeth away from
them: methinks none of these
things could be a sufficient tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:56294:24"/>
to any man to forget God and
his Soul; but, notwithstanding all
the delights and pleasures of sense,
we should be strangely intent upon
the concernments of another world,
and almost wholly taken up with
the thoughts of that vast Eternity
which we are ready to launch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
For what is there in this world,
this <hi>waste and howling wilderness,</hi>
this rude and barbarous Country
which we are but to pass through,
which should detain our affections
here, and take up our thoughts
from our everlasting habitation;
from that <hi>better</hi> and that <hi>heavenly
Country,</hi> where we hope to live
and be happy for ever?</p>
            <p>If we settle our affections upon
the enjoyments of this present Life,
so as to be extremely pleas'd and
transported with them, and to say
in our hearts, <hi>It is good for us to be
here;</hi> if we be excessively griev'd
or discontented for the want or loss
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:56294:25"/>
of them, and if we look upon our
present state in this world any
otherwise than as a preparation
and passage to a better life, it is a
sign that our faith and hope of the
happiness of another life is but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
weak and faint, and that we
do not heartily and in good earnest
believe what we pretend to do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
these things. For did we
stedfastly believe and were tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
persuaded of what our
Religion so plainly declares to us
concerning the unspeakable and
endless happiness of good men in
another world, our affections would
sit more loose to this world, and
our hopes would raise our hearts
as much above these present and
sensible things <hi>as the heavens are
high above the earth;</hi> we should
value nothing here below, but as
it serves for our present support and
passage, or may be made a means
to secure and increase our future
felicity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:56294:25"/>
2. The consideration of another
Life should quicken our preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for that blessed state which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
for us in the other world.
This Life is a state of probation
and tryal. This world is God's
school, where immortal spirits clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
with flesh are trained and bred
up for eternity. And then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is not an indifferent thing and
a matter of slight concernment to
us, how we live and demean our
selves in this world: whether we
indulge our selves <hi>in ungodliness
and worldly lusts,</hi> or <hi>live soberly,
and righteously, and godly</hi> in this
present world: No; it is a matter
of infinite moment, as much as our
souls and all eternity are worth.
Let us not deceive our selves; <hi>for
as we sowe so shall we reap: If we
sowe to the flesh, we shall of the flesh
reap corruption; but if we sowe to
the spirit, we shall of the spirit
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:56294:26"/>
reap everlasting life. Light is sown
for the righteous, and gladness for
the upright in heart. The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
hath hopes in his death. Mark the
perfect man, and behold the upright,
for the end of that man is peace.</hi>
But the ungodly are not so: who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
hath lived a wicked and vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
life feels strange throws and
pangs in his conscience when he
comes to be cast upon a sick bed.
<hi>The wicked is like the troubled sea</hi>
(saith the <hi>Prophet) when it cannot
rest;</hi> full of trouble and confusion,
especially in a dying hour. It is
death to such a man to look back
upon his life, and a hell to him to
think of eternity. When his guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and trembling Soul is ready to
leave his Body, and just stepping
into the other world, what horrour
and amazement do then seise upon
him? what a rage doth such a man
feel in his breast, when he serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
considers, that he hath been so
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:56294:26"/>
great a fool as for the false and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
pleasure of a few days to
make himself miserable for ever?</p>
            <p>3. Let the consideration of that
unspeakable Reward which God
hath promised to good men at the
Resurrection, encourage us to obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
and a holy life. We serve a
great Prince who is able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
us to honour; a most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
master who will not let the
least service we doe for him pass
unrewarded. This is the Inference
which the Apostle makes from his
large discourse of the Doctrine of
the Resurrection, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 58.
Wherefore, my beloved brethren,
be ye stedfast and unmovable, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
abounding in the work of the
Lord, forasmuch as ye know that
your labour shall not be in vain in
the Lord.</hi> Nothing will make death
more welcome to us than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
course of service and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:56294:27"/>
to God. <hi>Sleep,</hi> saith <hi>Solomon,
is sweet to the labouring man:</hi> so
after a great diligence and industry
in <hi>working out our own salvation,</hi>
and (as it is said of <hi>David) serving
our generation according to the will
of God,</hi> how pleasant will it be to
fall asleep? And as an usefull and
well-spent life will make our death
to be sweet, so our resurrection to
be glorious. Whatever acts of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
we doe to God, or of charity
to men; whatever we lay out up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the poor and afflicted and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitous,
will all be considered by
God in the day of recompences,
and most plentifully rewarded to
us.</p>
            <p>And surely no consideration
ought to be more prevalent to
perswade us to alms deeds and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to the poor, than that of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
to another life. Besides
the promises of this life which
are made to works of charity, and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:56294:27"/>
there is not any grace or vertue
whatsoever, which hath so many
and so great promises of temporal
blessings made to it in Scripture as
this grace of charity; I say, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the promises of this Life, the
great promise of eternal Life is in
Scripture in a more especial manner
entail'd upon it. <hi>Luke 12. 33. Give
alms,</hi> saith our Saviour, <hi>provide
your selves baggs which wax not old,
a treasure in the heavens that fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
not,</hi> and <hi>c. 16. v. 9. make to
your selves friends of the mammon
of unrighteousness, that when ye
shall fail they may receive you into
everlasting habitations.</hi> And 1 <hi>Tim.
6. 17, 18, 19. Charge them that are
rich in this world, that they be not
high minded,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that they doe good,
that they be rich in good works, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to distribute, willing to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate,
laying up in store for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a good foundation against the
time to come, that they may lay hold
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:56294:28"/>
on eternal life;</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
which our Translation renders
<hi>foundation</hi> according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
use of it, seems in this place
to have a more peculiar notion,
and to signifie the <hi>security</hi> that is
given by a <hi>pledge,</hi> or by an <hi>instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
or obligation of <hi>contract</hi> for
the performance of <hi>Covenants.</hi> For
besides that the phrase of <hi>laying up
in store, or treasuring up a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
seems to be a very odd jum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
of metaphors; this very word
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> almost necessarily requires
this notion as it is used by the same
<hi>Apostle,</hi> in his second <hi>Epistle</hi> to
<hi>Timothy,</hi> chap. 2. ver. 19. where
it is said, <hi>the foundation of God
stands sure, having this seal,</hi> &amp;c.
a <hi>seal</hi> being very improper <hi>to
strengthen a foundation,</hi> but very
fit <hi>to confirm a Covenant.</hi> And
then surely it ought to be render'd,
<hi>the Covenant of God remains firm,
having this seal.</hi> And so likewise
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:56294:28"/>
in the foremention'd Text, the sense
will be much more easie and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
if we render it thus, <hi>treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
up,</hi> or <hi>providing for themselves
a good security</hi> or <hi>pledge against the
time to come;</hi> I add <hi>pledge,</hi> because
that anciently was the common
way of security for things lent:
besides that the Apostle seems plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to allude to that passage, <hi>Tobit,
4. 8, 9. If thou hast abundance, give
alms accordingly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for thou layest
up a good treasure for thy self a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the day of necessity, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>,
for thou treasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
up for thy self a good pledge;</hi> to
which this of the Apostle exactly
answers <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
<hi>treasuring up,</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
for themselves a good pledge
or security,</hi> &amp;c. the sense however
is plain, that the charity of Alms
is one of the best ways of securing
our future happiness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:56294:29"/>
And yet further to encourage us
to abound in works of charity, the
Scripture tells us that proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the degrees of our charity
shall be the degrees of our reward;
upon this consideration the <hi>Apostle</hi>
exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
in their charity, 2 <hi>Cor. 9. 6. he
that soweth sparingly shall reap spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly,
but he that soweth bountifully
shall reap bountifully.</hi> So that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
we lay out in this kind is to
the <hi>greatest advantage,</hi> and upon
the <hi>best security;</hi> two considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which use to be very prevalent
with rich men to lay out their
money.</p>
            <p>We certainly doe it to the <hi>grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
advantage;</hi> because God will
consider the very smallest thing
that any of us doe in this kind.
He that shall <hi>give</hi> so much as <hi>a
cup of cold water to a disciple, in
the name of a disciple, shall not lose
his reward;</hi> these last words, <hi>shall
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:56294:29"/>
not lose his reward,</hi> are a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
and signifie much more than they
seem to speak, <hi>viz.</hi> that he shall
have a very great reward, infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
beyond the value of what he
hath done.</p>
            <p>And we doe it likewise upon the
<hi>best security;</hi> so <hi>Solomon</hi> assures us,
<hi>Prov. 19. 17. He that hath pity up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the poor lendeth to the Lord,
and that which he hath given will
he pay him again:</hi> and we may be
confident of our security where
God is surety; nay, he tells us that
in this case he looks upon himself
as principal, and that whatever we
doe in ways of mercy and charity
to the poor he takes as done to
himself. So our Lord hath told us,
<hi>Matt.</hi> 2. 5. 40. and we shall hear the
same from him again out of his own
mouth when he shall appear in his
Majesty to judge the World, <hi>Then
the King shall answer, and say unto
them, Verily I say unto you, inas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:56294:30"/>
as ye have done it unto one of
the least of these my brethren, ye
have done it unto me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And on the other side, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
no where passeth a more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
doom upon any sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
than upon those who have
no bowels of compassion towards
their brethren in distress. That is
a fearfull sentence indeed, which
the Apostle pronounceth upon such
persons,</hi> Jam. 2. 13. He shall have
judgment without mercy that hath
shewed no mercy. <hi>And this our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
represents to us in a most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
manner, in that lively de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
which he makes of the
Judgment of the great Day,</hi> Matt.
25. 31. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> When the Son of man
shall come in his glory, and all the
holy Angels with him, then shall he
sit upon the throne of his glory:
And before him shall be gathered
all nations, and he shall separate
them one from another, as a shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:56294:30"/>
divideth the sheep from the
goats. And he shall set the sheep
on his right hand, but the goats on
the left. Then shall the King say
unto them on the right hand, Come
ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the Kingdom prepared for you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the foundation of the world:
For I was an hungred, and ye gave
me meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave
me drink; I was a stranger, and ye
took me in; naked, and ye clothed
me; I was sick, and ye visited me;
I was in prison, and ye came unto
me. Then shall He say also unto them
on the left hand, Depart from me ye
cursed into everlasting fire, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for the Devil and his Angels:
For I was an hungred, and ye gave
me no meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these shall go
away into everlasting punishment;
but the righteous into life eternal.
<hi>And if this be, as most certainly
it is, a true and proper representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the process of that Day,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:56294:31"/>
then the great matter of enquiry
will be, What works of charity
and mercy have been done or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
by us, and accordingly a
Sentence of eternal happiness, or
misery, will be pass'd upon us: I
was hungry, did ye feed me or did
ye not? I was naked, did ye clothe
me or did ye not? I was sick and
in prison, did ye visit me or did ye
not? Not but that all the good or
evil of our lives, in what kind so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
shall then be brought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
But that our Saviour did
chuse to instance particularly, and
onely in things of this nature, should
methinks make a mighty impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon us, and be a powerfull
consideration to oblige us to have
a very peculiar regard to works of
mercy and charity, and to make
sure</hi> to abound in this Grace; <hi>that
when we shall appear before the
great Judge of the World we may
find that mercy from Him which
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:56294:31"/>
we have shew'd to others, and which
we shall all undoubtedly stand in
need of</hi> in that Day.</p>
            <p>And among all our acts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
those which are done upon
least probability and foresight of
their meeting with any recompense
in this world, either by way of
real requital or of fame and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
as they are of all other most
acceptable to God, so they will
certainly have the most ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
in another world. So our
Lord hath assur'd us, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
adviseth us, <hi>Luke 14. 12,
13, 14. When thou makest a feast
invite not the rich, because they
will recompense thee again: but call
the poor, the maimed, the lame and
the blind, for they cannot recompense
thee, but thou shalt be recompensed
at the resurrection of the just.</hi> If
we be Religious for worldly ends,
and serve God, and doe good to
men, onely in contemplation of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:56294:32"/>
some temporal advantage, we take
up with present payment, and cut
our selves short of our future re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward:
of such, saith our Lord,
<hi>verily I say unto you, they have
their reward;</hi> they are their own
security, and have taken care to
satisfie themselves, and therefore
are to expect nothing from God.
But let us who call our selves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
doe something for God, for
which we have no hopes to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compensed
in this world; that we
may shew that we trust God and
take his word, and dare venture
upon the security of the next world
and that <hi>recompense</hi> which shall be
made <hi>at the resurrection of the
just.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And how great and glorious that
shall be, our Saviour tells us imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
before my</hi> Text. They
that shall be accounted worthy to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that world, and the resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the dead, they can die no
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:56294:32"/>
more, but they are equal to the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
and are the children of God,
being the children of the resurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>If then we be heirs of such glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
hopes, and believe that he
who is <hi>the God of Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob,</hi> will also be our God;
let us live as it becomes the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
of heaven, and <hi>the children
of the resurrection,</hi> and such as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
believe another life after this,
and hope one day to <hi>sit down with
Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, in the
Kingdom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now that I have represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to you what encouragement
there is to well-doing, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
to works of Charity, from
the consideration of the blessed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
we shall certainly meet with
at the Resurrection of the just: I
shall crave your patience a little
longer, whilst I propose to you
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:56294:33"/>
one of the fairest Examples of
this kind which either this or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
any other Age could easily
present us withall: I mean our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceased
Brother to whom we are
now paying our last solemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects,
the Reverend Mr. <hi>THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS
GOVGE;</hi> the worthy
Son of a reverend and learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
of this City, Dr. <hi>William
Gouge,</hi> who was Minister of this
Parish of <hi>Black Friars</hi> six and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years; he died in 1653. and
still lives in the memory of many
here present.</p>
            <p>I must confess, that I am no friend
to Funeral <hi>Panegyricks,</hi> where there
is nothing of extraordinary worth
and merit in the party commended
to give occasion and foundation for
them: In such cases, as praises are
not due to the dead, so they may
be of ill consequence to the living;
not onely by bringing those of our
Profession that make a practice of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:56294:33"/>
it under the suspicion of officious
and mercenary flattery, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by encouraging men to hope
that they also may be well spoken
of, and even Sainted when they are
dead, though they should have done
little or no good in their life: But
yet on the other hand, to commend
those excellent Persons the vertues
of whose lives have been bright and
exemplary, is not onely a piece of
justice due to the dead, but an act
of great charity to the living, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
a pattern of well-doing before
our eyes, very apt and powerfull
to incite and encourage us <hi>to go and
doe likewise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon both these considerations,
first to doe right to the memory of
so good a man, and then in hopes
that the example may prove fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
and have a considerable effect
upon others to beget the like good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and charity in them, I shall
endeavour, in as narrow a compass
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:56294:34"/>
as may be, to give you the just
character of this truly pious and
charitable Man, and by setting his
life in a true light to recommend
with all the advantage I can so
excellent a pattern to your imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>He was born at <hi>Bow</hi> near <hi>Strat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
in the County of <hi>Midlesex</hi> the
19th. day of <hi>September</hi> 1605. He
was bred at <hi>Eton</hi> School, and from
thence chosen to <hi>Kings</hi> College in
<hi>Cambridge</hi> being about 20 years
of Age, in the year 1626. After
he had finish'd the course of his stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and taken his Degrees, he left
the <hi>Vniversity</hi> and his <hi>Fellowship,</hi>
being presented to the Living of
<hi>Colsden</hi> near <hi>Croyden</hi> in <hi>Surrey,</hi>
where he continued about 2 or 3
years; and from thence was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd
to S. <hi>Sepulchres</hi> in <hi>London,</hi>
in the year 1638. and the year af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
thinking fit to change his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
match'd into a very worthy
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:56294:34"/>
and ancient Family, marrying one
of the Daughters of Sir <hi>Robert
Darcy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus settled in this large
and populous <hi>Parish,</hi> he did with
great solicitude and pains discharge
all the parts of a vigilant and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Minister, for about the space of
24 years. For besides his constant
and weekly labour of preaching,
he was very diligent and charitable
in visiting the sick, and ministring
not onely spiritual counsel and
comfort to them, but likewise libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
relief to the wants and necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of those that were poor and
destitute of means to help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in that condition. He did
also every morning throughout the
year Catechize in the Church, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
the poorer sort who were
generally most ignorant; and to
encourage them to come thither to
be instructed by him he did once
a week distribute money among
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:56294:35"/>
them, not upon a certain day, but
changing it on purpose as he thought
good, that he might thereby oblige
them to be constantly present: These
were chiefly the more aged poor
who being past labour had leisure
enough to attend upon this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise.
As for the other sort of poor
who were able to work for their
living, he set them at work upon
his own charge, buying Flax and
Hemp for them to spin, and what
they spun he took off their hands
paying them for their work, and
then got it wrought into Cloth,
and sold it as he could, chiefly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
his friends, himself bearing
the whole loss. And this was a
very wise and well chosen way of
charity, and in the good effect of
it a much greater charity than if
he had given these very persons
freely and for nothing so much as
they earned by their work; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
by this means he took many
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:56294:35"/>
off from begging, and thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued
them at once from two of
the most dangerous temptations of
this world, <hi>Idleness</hi> and <hi>Poverty;</hi>
and by degrees reclaim'd them to a
vertuous and industrious course of
life, which enabled them afterwards
to live without being beholden to
the charity of others.</p>
            <p>And this course so happily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis'd
and begun by Mr. <hi>Gouge</hi> in
his own Parish, was I think that
which gave the first hint to that
worthy and usefull Citizen Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas
Firmin</hi> of a much larger design,
which hath been prosecuted by him
for some years with that vigour
and good success in this City, that
many hundreds of poor Children,
and others who liv'd idle before,
unprofitable both to themselves and
the publick, are continually main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
at work and taught to earn
their own livelihood much in the
same way: He being, by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:56294:36"/>
assistance and charity of
many worthy and well-dispos'd
Persons of all ranks, enabled to bear
the unavoidable loss and charge of
so vast an undertaking; and by
his own forward inclination to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and his unwearied diligence
and activity, extraordinarily fitted
to sustain and go through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible
pains of it.</p>
            <p>But to return to our deceased
Friend; concerning whom I must
content my self to pass over many
things worthy to be remembred of
him, and to speak onely of those
Vertues of his which were more
eminent and remarkable.</p>
            <p>Of his Piety towards God, which
is the necessary foundation of all
other Graces and Vertues, I shall
onely say this, that it was great
and exemplary, but yet very still
and quiet, without stir and noise,
and much more in substance and
reality than in shew and ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:56294:36"/>
and did not consist in censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
and finding fault with others,
but in the due care and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his own life and actions,
and in <hi>exercising</hi> himself <hi>continually
to have a conscience void of offence
toward God and toward men;</hi> in
which he was such a proficient, that
even after long acquaintance and
familiar conversation with him it
was not easie to observe any thing
that might deserve blame.</p>
            <p>He particularly excell'd in the
more peculiar vertues of conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in <hi>modesty, humility, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
cheerfulness,</hi> and in <hi>kindness</hi>
and <hi>charity towards all men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So great was his <hi>modesty,</hi> that it
never appear'd either by word or
action that he put any value upon
himself. This I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
in him, that the Charities
which were procur'd chiefly by his
application and industry, when he
had occasion to give an account of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:56294:37"/>
them, he would rather impute to
any one who had but the least
hand and part in the obtaining of
them, than assume any thing of it
to himself. Another instance of
his modesty was, that when he
had quitted his Living of S. <hi>Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres</hi>
upon some dissatisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the terms of conformity, he
willingly forbore preaching, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was no need of him here
in <hi>London</hi> where there were so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
worthy Ministers, and that he
thought he might doe as much or
more good in another way which
could give no offence. Onely in
the later years of his life, being
better satisfy'd in some things he
doubted of before, he had License
from some of the Bishops to preach
in <hi>Wales</hi> in his progress; which
he was the more willing to doe,
because in some places he saw great
need of it, and he thought he
might doe it with greater advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:56294:37"/>
among the poor People, who
were the more likely to regard his
instructions, being recommended
by his great charity, so well known
to them, and of which they had
so long had the experience and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.
But where there was no
such need, he was very well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented
to hear others perswade men
to goodness and to practise it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>He was <hi>clothed with humility,</hi>
and had in a most eminent degree
that <hi>ornament of a meek and quiet
spirit which,</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> says, <hi>is in
the sight of God of</hi> so <hi>great price:</hi>
So that there was not the least ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
either of Pride or Passion
in any of his words or actions.
He was not onely free from anger
and bitterness, but from all affected
gravity and moroseness. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation
was affable and pleasant;
he had a wonderfull serenity of
mind and evenness of temper, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:56294:38"/>
in his very countenance; he
was hardly ever merry, but never
melancholy and sad; and for any
thing I could discern, after a long
and intimate acquaintance with
him, he was upon all occasions
and accidents perpetually the same;
always cheerfull, and always kind;
of a disposition ready to embrace
and oblige all men; allowing others
to differ from him, even in opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
that were very dear to him;
and provided men did but <hi>fear God
and work righteousness,</hi> he lov'd
them heartily, how distant soever
from him in judgment about things
less necessary: In all which he is
very worthy to be a pattern to men
of all Perswasions whatsoever.</p>
            <p>But that Vertue which of all
other shone brightest in him, and
was his most proper and peculiar
character, was his cheerfull and
unwearied diligence in acts of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Charity. In this he left far
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:56294:38"/>
behind him all that ever I knew,
and, as I said before, had a singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
sagacity and prudence in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vising
the most effectual ways of
doing good, and in managing and
disposing his charity to the best
purposes, and to the greatest ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;
always, if it were possible,
making it to serve some end of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Religion; as the instruction
of poor children in the principles
of Religion, and furnishing grown
persons that were ignorant with
the <hi>Bible</hi> and other good Books;
strictly obliging those to whom he
gave them to a diligent reading of
them, and when he had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
exacting of them an account
how they had profited by them.</p>
            <p>In his occasional alms to the
poor, in which he was very free
and bountifull, the relief he gave
them was always mingled with
good counsel, and as great a tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and compassion for their souls
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:56294:39"/>
as bodies; which very often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
the good effect it was likely
to have, the one making way for
the other with so much advantage,
and men being very apt to follow
the good advice of those who give
them in hand so sensible a pledge
and testimony of their good will
to them.</p>
            <p>This kind of charity must needs
be very expensive to him, but he
had a plentifull estate settled upon
him and left him by his Father,
and he laid it out as liberally in
the most prudent and effectual
ways of charity he could think of,
and upon such persons as, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
considered, he judg'd
to be the fittest and most proper
objects of it.</p>
            <p>For about nine or ten years last
past he did, as is well known to
many here present, almost wholly
apply his charity to <hi>Wales,</hi> because
there he judg'd was most occasion
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:56294:39"/>
for it: And because this was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great work, he did not onely
lay out upon it whatever he could
spare out of his own estate, but
employ'd his whole time and pains
to excite and engage the charity of
others for his assistance in it.</p>
            <p>And in this he had two excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
designs. One, to have poor
children brought up to reade and
write, and to be carefully instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the principles of Religion:
The other, to furnish persons of
grown age, the poor especially,
with the necessary helps and means
of knowledge, as the Bible, and
other Books of piety and devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in their own Language; to
which end he procur'd the <hi>Church-Catechisme,</hi>
the <hi>Practice of Piety,</hi>
and that best of Books the <hi>Whole
Duty of Man,</hi> besides several other
pious and usefull <hi>Treatises,</hi> to be
translated into the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue,
and great numbers of them to be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:56294:40"/>
printed, and sent down to the chief
Towns in <hi>Wales,</hi> to be sold at easie
rates to those that were able to
buy them, and to be freely given
to those that were not.</p>
            <p>And in both these designs,
through the blessing of God upon
his unwearied endeavours, he found
very great success. For by the
large and bountifull contributions
which chiefly by his industry and
prudent application were obtain'd
from charitable Persons of all Ranks
and conditions, from the <hi>Nobility</hi>
and <hi>Gentry</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> and the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<hi>Counties,</hi> and several of
that Quality in and about <hi>London;</hi>
from divers of the Right Reverend
<hi>Bishops,</hi> and of the Clergy; and
from that perpetual fountain of
charity the City of <hi>London,</hi> led
on and encourag'd by the most
bountifull example of the Right
Honourable the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and
the <hi>Court of Aldermen;</hi> to all which
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:56294:40"/>
he constantly added two Thirds of
his own estate, which as I have
been credibly inform'd was two
hundred pounds a year: I say, by
all these together there were every
year <hi>eight hundred,</hi> sometimes a
<hi>thousand</hi> poor children educated as
I said before; and by this example
several of the most considerable
<hi>Towns</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> were excited to
bring up at their own charge the
like number of poor children, in
the like manner, and under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection
and care.</p>
            <p>He likewise gave very great
numbers of the Books above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
both in the <hi>Welch</hi> and <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi>
Tongues, to the poorer sort,
so many as were unable to buy
them and willing to reade them.
But which was the greatest work
of all, and amounted indeed to a
mighty charge, he procured a new
and very fair Impression of the
Bible and Liturgy of the Church
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:56294:41"/>
of <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Welch</hi> Tongue
(the former Impression being spent,
and hardly twenty of them to be
had in all <hi>London)</hi> to the number
of eight thousand; one thousand
whereof were freely given to the
poor, and the rest sent to the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Cities and Towns in <hi>Wales</hi> to
be sold to the rich at very reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
and low rates, <hi>viz.</hi> at <hi>four
shillings</hi> a piece well bound and
clasped; which was much cheaper
than any <hi>English</hi> Bible was ever
sold that was of so fair a print and
paper: A work of that charge, that
it was not likely to have been done
any other way; and for which this
Age, and perhaps the next, will
have great cause to thank God on
his behalf.</p>
            <p>In these good works he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all his time and care and pains,
and his whole heart was in them;
so that he was very little affected
with any thing else; and seldom
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:56294:41"/>
either minded or knew any thing
of the strange occurrences of this
troublesome and busie Age, such
as I think are hardly to be parallel'd
in any other: Or if he did mind
them, he scarce ever spoke any
thing about them. For this was
the business he laid to heart, and
knowing it to be so much and so
certainly the Will of his heavenly
Father, it was his meat and drink
to be doing of it: And the good
success he had in it was a continual
feast to him, and gave him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
serenity both of mind and
countenance. His great love and
zeal for this work made all the
pains and difficulties of it seem no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to him: He would rise ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and sit up late, and continued
the same diligence and industry
to the last, though he was in the
threescore and seventeenth year of
his age. And that he might ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the distribution of this great
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:56294:42"/>
charity with his own hands, and
see the good effect of it with his
own eyes, he always once, but
usually twice a year, at his own
charge travelled over a great part
of <hi>Wales,</hi> none of the best Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
to travel in: But for the love
of God and men he endured all
that, together with the extremity
of heat and cold (which in their
several seasons are both very great
there) not onely with patience but
with pleasure. So that all things
considered there have not, since
the primitive times of Christianity,
been many among the sons of men
to whom that glorious character
of the Son of God might be better
applied, that <hi>he went about doing
good.</hi> And <hi>Wales</hi> may as worthily
boast of this truly Apostolical man
as of their famous S. <hi>David;</hi> who
was also very probably a good
man, as those times of ignorance
and superstition went. But his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:56294:42"/>
goodness is so disguised by their
fabulous <hi>Legends</hi> and stories which
give us the account of him, that it
is not easie to discover it. Indeed
ridiculous miracles in abundance
are reported of him: as, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
occasion of a great number of
people resorting from all parts to
hear him preach, for the greater
advantage of his being heard a
mountain all on a sudden rose up
miraculously under his feet, and his
voice was extended to that degree
that he might be distinctly heard
for two or three miles round about.
Such phantastical miracles as these
make up a great part of his Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
And admitting all these to be
true (which a wise man would be
loth to do) our departed Friend
had that which is much greater
and more excellent than all these,
a fervent charity to God and men;
which is more than to <hi>speak</hi> (as
they would make us believe S <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:56294:43"/>
did) <hi>with the tongue of men
and Angels,</hi> more than to raise or
remove mountains.</p>
            <p>And now methinks it is pity so
good a design so happily prosecuted
should fall and die with this good
man. And it is now under delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
if possible, still to continue
and carry it on, and a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and charitable person pitched
upon for that purpose, who is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to undertake that part which
he that is gone performed so well:
But this will depend upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the former Charities
and the concurrence of those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and well disposed persons in
<hi>Wales</hi> to contribute their part as
formerly; which I perswade my
self they will cheerfully doe.</p>
            <p>I will add but one thing more
concerning our deceased Brother,
that though he meddled not at all
in our present heats and differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as a Party, having much better
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:56294:43"/>
things to mind; yet as a looker
on he did very sadly lament them,
and for several of the last years of
his life he continued in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
of our Church, and, as he
himself told me, thought himself
obliged in conscience so to do.</p>
            <p>He died in the 77th. year of his
age, <hi>Octob.</hi> 29th, 1681. It so plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God that his death was very
sudden; and so sudden, that in all
probability he himself hardly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it when it happened, for he
died in his sleep; and as it is said
of <hi>David, after he had served his
generation according to the will of
God,</hi> he fell asleep.</p>
            <p>I confess that a sudden death is
generally undesirable, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
with reason we pray against
it; because so very few are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
prepared for it: But to him,
the constant employment of whose
life was the best preparation for
death that was possible, no death
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:56294:44"/>
could be sudden; nay, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a favour and blessing to him,
because by how much the more
sudden so much the more easie:
As if God had designed to begin
the reward of the great pains of his
life in an easie death. And indeed
it was rather a translation than a
death; and, saving that his body
was left behind, what was said of
<hi>Enoch</hi> may not unfitly be applied
to this pious and good man with
respect to the suddenness of his
change; <hi>he walked with God, and
was not, for God took him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And God grant that we who
survive, may all of us sincerely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to tread in the steps of his
exemplary piety and charity; of
his labour of love, his unwearied
diligence and patient continuance
in doing good, that we may meet
with that encouraging commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which he hath already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from the mouth of our Lord,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:56294:44"/>
               <hi>Well done good and faithfull ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,
enter thou into the joy of thy
Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the God of peace that brought
again from the dead our Lord Jesus
Christ, that great shepherd of the
sheep, through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
covenant, make you perfect
in every good work to doe his will,
working in you always that which is
pleasing in his sight, through Jesus
Christ; To whom be glory for ever.
Amen.</p>
