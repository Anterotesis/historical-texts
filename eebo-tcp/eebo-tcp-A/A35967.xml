         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A most excellent Sudorifick Cordial, which cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth all sorts of Agues, and all Burnings or Purple Fevers, as also all sorts of Fluxes and Pyles. It is also excellent for the hot Gout.</head>
            <p>TAke Salt of Tartar one ounce, put it into a pint of French <hi>Aqua Vitae,</hi> let it stand in gentle warmth a day, then filter it through a gray paper.</p>
            <p>Take then good <hi>Opium</hi> well chosen, cut it into thin slices, and dry it very gently till it be a little friable; then cut it very small, and put it into a glass-bottle, and pour upon it a quart of <hi>Aqua Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae;</hi> stop the bottle well; and tie it with a bladder, and set it in the Sun in Summer, in the Winter in some gentle warmth to digest twenty four hours, or till the tincture be of a reddish brown, and the <hi>Opium</hi> be dissolved; then strain it through a gray paper, and put to it the dissolution of the Salt of Tartar, and infuse half an ounce of Saffron in it, then let it stand in a gentle heat six hours or more, then strain it through double paper so often till there remain no feces in the straining of it, then will the <hi>Opium</hi> be purified from all its venom, and is of great; vertue in the foresaid diseases, then let the patient take the following purge.</p>
            <p>Take the powder of the root Jallop twenty or twenty four grains, <hi>Cremor-Tartari</hi> ten or twelve grains, mixt with syrop of Roses for a dose in the morning. But when there is any looseness or bloody-flux, you need not purge, but take the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said prepared tincture, or Cordial; the dose of it is a spoonful and half, or two spoonfuls for strong
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58478:5"/>
persons, and for little children three or four drops mixt with the milk of the Nurse; then let the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient sweat in his bed. This medicine will make sweat sometimes a day and night, or only some hours. The manner of using this remedy is thus: Purge (for example) <hi>Munday</hi> morning, <hi>Tuesday</hi> night take the Sudorifick Tincture, drink nothing all night, unless the heat of your mouth perswade you to take a spoonful of Wine. In the morning when your sweat is over, take a Tost of Wine with Sugar, and lie yet, to see if you shall sweat again; which being quite past, eat and drink moderately of good things. <hi>Thursday</hi> morning take the purge again. <hi>Friday</hi> night take the Tincture again, or if you will (and that the day of the fit falls out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for that) take a dose of Antimony Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick upon <hi>Thursday</hi> in stead of the purge, and <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> night take the Tincture again. In fine, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern your self for purging, or taking either of the Diaphoreticks as you shall find best; and continue the Diaphoretick of Antimony as long as you think fit, after you have done with the other Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and with purging.</p>
            <p>This excellent medicine hath done great mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles upon persons that have had the Ague three years; it restoreth the spirits and strength lost; and comforteth the heart. It cureth likewise the Colick, the Tooth-ach, the Catarrhs, the violent Cough, the Griping in the Belly, and stayeth Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting. The use of it for the Tooth-ach is, to take half a spoonful, and hold it on the side where your Tooth aketh in your mouth, the space of a quarter of an hour, then spit it out, and take some fresh; if it needeth for the Gout, dip a feather in it, and foment the dolent part with it.</p>
            <p>When they rave and are frantick in their Fever,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:58478:5"/>
you may put eight or ten grains of Salt of Pearls into every dose of this Medicine.</p>

Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat this till the Powder giveth no more tincture, doing in such sort that you employ no more Spirit than is necessary to extract the Tincture; which filter so often till it leaveth no more feces. Then dissolve two ounces of Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> in a sufficient quantity of Spirit of Salt, then filter it, then mix these two tinctures together, and digest them eight days in a gentle heat, then separate it from the feces by filtration, and keep it in a Glass close stopped. The manner of using this liquor, is thus; Begin with a little dose, as two or three drops, so little a one that it may cause no sharpness of Urin. Take it in Hydromel or Small-Beer. The next day take one drop more, so increasing till you find a little sharpness; which you will do the third or fourth or fifth day. The next day rest and take some Diaphoretic, the next day purge. The next take again the same dose of the liquor as you did the last day; continue that three days. Then as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer time, resting and purging. Repeat this course till you are well; continuing always the same dose of the liquor, which by a little pricking of Urin you found to be the due one.</p>
            <p>The Purge which the Patient is to take, is thus; The day before, take Reifin of the Root of Jallap twenty or twenty four granes, Crystal or <hi>Cremor</hi> of <hi>Tartar</hi> ten or twelve granes; mix these with Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rup

            <head>For any kind of Tetters, Herpes, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>DIssolve two ounces of running <hi>Mercury</hi> in four ounces of the best <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> pour upon the solution a quart of fair water, in which is dissolved two handfuls of Salt, and then filtered. This will make the <hi>Mercury</hi> fall down to the bottom in a white Calx. When it is well settled, pour off the clear water; which keep for your use. Pour the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing milky thick substance upon one pound of Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grease melted in an earthen Pot. The Grease must be very hot when you pour in the dissolved <hi>Mercury;</hi> but take the Pot from the Fire when you pour the <hi>Mercury</hi> to it; and stir it well all the while you are pouring it in, and when it is all in, set the Pot upon the fire again to boil the Grease, till all the moisture of the Mercurial Substance and Solution is evaporated away; but be sure you stir it very well all the while; as also after you take it from the fire (which you do as soon as the moisture is gone) till the Grease is cold and hardned.</p>
            <p>The way of using this Ointment and Water to cure all sorts of Tetters or Herpes, or any scabby Itches, or inflamed red Faces or Noses is thus: First, if the evil be very great, purge and let bloud very strongly. Then begin with the Water: rub the Tetters and all about it with Linen dipped in the Water made as hot as you can endure it; and when you have rubbed and bathed it well, lay up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it Compresses wetted in the Water. Do thus
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:58478:36"/>
twice a day for two or three days or more, till you see it hath drawn out the Salt humor abundantly, and that the part is much inflamed and very sore, and hath little holes or ulcers eaten in it. Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the first washing it will grow very sore and inflamed; therefore you must not afterwards rub it so hard as at first, but very gently. Some Sores will require that you use the water five or six days, others more, tender ones two or three days. When you judge that the Water hath drawn out sufficiently the violent matter; then anoint with the Grease as hot as you can endure it, and lay on it a Plaster of the same Ointment, binding it on.</p>
            <p>This Ointment will presently asswage the pain, and take away the Inflammation. Dress it with it twice or thrice a day. Much matter will run from the Sore as from an Ulcer; and by little and little it will heal up. And that which is wonderful is, that whereas one would think that such deep holes as the Water will have eaten, should leave Scars, there will not appear the least mark of them; but a fine new tender natural skin will come over it all.</p>

To six ounces of this purified Mercury revivified, put one ounce of Leaf-Gold, making an Amalgame after the ordinary manner of Goldsmiths, which wash with many waters, till no more blackness comes from it; then (being very well dried) put it in a large Oven, and stop it but slightly with Cotton, and so digest it in Ashes or Sand without ever stirring the Fiol, till it be a red Precipitate (all but a very little, which will continue running Mercury) putting

down with a Raker from time to time what shall sublime to the sides of the Glass (but without shaking it) but you must have a care not to give too great heat to sublime much, but to be still in the next degree to Sublimation. The Mercury thus prepared, grows presently hard with the Gold, soon after it is put to digest.</p>
            <p>In the other way take a good Mercury distilled from Cinnabar, and make an Amalgame as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, with a sixth part of Leaf-Gold, and wash it very well; then put it to digest in a little Bolts-head for three or four days; then take it out, and wash it very well from new blackness that will grow in it: When the Water comes off clear, put it again to digest three or four days; then wash as before, and more blackness will come away. Continue these sharp Digestions and Wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, till no more blackness come away with washing, but your Amalgame is in a permanence of whiteness and clearness, which will take up five or six or seven months to bring it to that pass. Then put it to digest, as is said above.

When it is cold, take out the matter and grind it well, and pour hot water upon it to dissolve the Salt, and philter it off, and pour on more water, doing so till you have severed all the Salt from the Gold (as also a white earthy substance that will swim upon the water) then dry the Gold: which grind again with double its quantity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared Salt (the same Salt will serve again when the Water is distilled from it) and cement it, and work all as before, having a care always that the Gold settle well to the bottom, after you have stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it in the water.

Then cement it with double its quantity of pure Salt of Tartar, in the same manner as you did with the Salt, and do all as before. Repeat this two or three or four times, dulcifying it every time very well from the Salt. Then put upon it (being very dry) the <hi>Menstruum</hi> of Spirit of Urin mentioned hereafter, and it will be tincted bloud-red in twenty four hours: pour

Cohobate the same Spirit upon it till there remain only perfect Flegm in the bottom, and that all the Spirits and volatil Salt of the Urin be in the Spirit of Wine. This is a great Dissolvent and A'cahest; but it will be stronger if you work it again with new Spirit of Urin; and so you may make it as strong as you will.</p>

Loosen also the skin round about the neck, joyning the head, and skin it all; afterwards cut the body an inch above the Navil, and throw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the tail. Then take out all the entrails, putting the grease by it self, and the heart and liver like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; and cut the body or bulk upwards joyning the head, and cast away the rest. Prepare a great many Vipers after this fashion. After this, put the bulks of the bodies upon some Plate apart, and the hearts and livers by themselves upon another likewise; and the tongue upon another, without washing them at all; and put them to be dried gently in a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace that is but a little warm. All this must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the beginning; afterwards a little more heat is required, that so the humidity may be the sooner dried up, which otherwise might be the cause of their being spoiled. But after this first time, which may be perhaps a night; one needs not but to keep them in a dry place with so little a heat, that they may fully be dried, and hardned, to be fit for to be pounded; which will be done within eight or ten days. When they are fully dry, put all the parts to pounding, dropping upon them now and then a drop of <hi>Opobalsamum,</hi> or white oriental Balsam, or for want of the same, of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Balsom; and sometimes a drop of a compounded Balsom. But all this with so much discretion and heed, that the Balsoms may dry immediately, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:58478:60"/>
be sucked in by the powder, that is, a pounding, without discerning of any liquor; for this would make it come to be a paste, and will not afterwards be fit for to be pounded: But putting in the Balsom by little and little at a time, the heat of moving the Pestil dries it, makes it to be imbibed, and the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humidity to evaporate.</p>
            <p>Mark this, That there must be far less used of the natural Balsom, than of the compounded; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the greatest part of the humidity of this, doth evaporate through the heat of the pounding; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other side, the other Balsom, being vis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous remaineth: For example; To one pound of the substance of Vipers, one ounce, (or at the most, two ounces) of the natural Balsom may suffice: But of the other you may make to enter as much as you can; as for example, if you could spend a whole pound, it would be the better for it, provided the powder do not grow wet by it, nor like a paste. It must be now and then sifted what will pass through a hair cloth; but what will not, must be pounded again, dropping upon it from time to time of your Balsoms. And if so be there be any likelihood of any quantity of the powder, let it run again through the Sieve, what will go through, and pound again the rest with the Balsoms; doing this so long till all be passed through.</p>
            <p>The Author told me, that all will not pass, but that at the end there will remain a white powder, which cannot be pounded any more, which are the bones; and he throweth it away as useless: besides that there is but little of it, and your powder is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.</p>

            <p>THe first thing that buddeth out of these trees, is a long green excrescence, like slender Pine Apples, which is called their Flower. Distil the water of these, and keep it, throwing away the <hi>Caput-mortuum.</hi> Then when the Nuts are as big as Hasle-nuts, stamp them in a Mortar, and strain out the juyce; which distil till you have the <hi>Caput-mortuum</hi> of a thick consistence, like an extract; which keep, as also the water. When the Nuts are growing big and have but a gelly instead of a ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and would be half ripe within ten days, or a fortnight: then stamp them as before, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil their juyce to a like consistence, as the other. Mingle your three Waters together; and this is his Water of Walnuts, which is a great Cordial: and when he will make Cinamon-water, he useth this only, without Wine or any other liquor to the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, and holdeth it for a great Cordial. The two thick consistences (remaining after distilling the two juyces) he putteth together, and when he hath evaporated them to a fit heighth for making of Plaisters (if they were not so already by their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling) he putteth to them (removed from the fire) a little Venice Turpentine (an eighth or tenth
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:58478:69"/>
part, or a little more) and a little Powder of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon and Cloves, and a little Wheat-flower to thicken it, also a little Salt; and keep it in a Pot all the year (where it fermenteth) to make a Plaister of it for the Stomach, from the <hi>Sternum</hi> to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and six or eight fingers breadth; which let re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on as long as it will stick, taking it off some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to wipe a little water that sometimes it draweth.</p>
            <p>This comforteth and strengtheneth the Stomach wonderfully, when it digesteth not well. If you have none of this Composition ready, take two or three condited Wall-nuts (conserved black; not green, or white) and stamp them to a Pulp, and mingle with them about as much Turpentine as a Hasle Nut, and some Wheat-flower to thicken it and a little Salt, and a little Powder of Cinamon and Cloves; and make a Plaister of this for want of the other.</p>
            <p>You should so proportion your substances or Nuts, as to have about a like quantity of juyce of each; as also so much of the Flowers as to have as much distilled water as out of either of the Juyces. For crudities and Indigestions of the Stomach, when a Looseness followeth (which usually cometh from eating more than one can digest) he prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed two or three days very slender diet; and then to eat on mornings three or four condited Walnuts, and to drink a little Wine after them, eating a mouthful of Bread; this setteth the Stomach very right.</p>
            <p>The Nuts are conserved black, for those have all their bitterness and virtue in them (whereas, the white are pared; and the green are boiled in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Waters to make them sweet; and so lose their virtue) only rubbing off a little thin skin with a

            <p>He takes it often; as four or five times a day: about two <hi>Paris</hi> pints a day in all or better. If all day he taketh nothing but Milk, he finds it weakens him at length: therefore about noon, he eateth a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chet of fine light Bread, of about a penny price. But neither that strengtheneth him sufficiently; but he useth withal to eat then two dozen of good Damask Raisins (or more) eating first half his Bread, then twelve Raisins; then drinks a Porringer full of Milk upon it: Then he eats the rest of his Bread and Raisins, and drinks another Porrenger of Milk. With this course he groweth strong, fat and full of blood: but without Bread and Raisins, he becometh very faint, and cannot walk far: but with them he is fain to do much exercise, he finds his health require it, and he performs it with great ease. Every night at going to Bed, he takes a Pill

of five or six grains of his Composition of Aloes and Juyces of Herbs, in a spoonful of Milk, and drinks three or four more upon it: which giveth him but one Stool the next morning; after which he is free for all day: but without his Pill, his milk would constipate him much.</p>
