            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

They that partake Sacraments in a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church, may so farre notwithstanding be displeasing unto God: As 1. <hi>That</hi> all the Sacraments and Services, they take in hand may be accounted by God as Nullities, as no Sacraments, no Services at all. <note n="h" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20.</note>

                  <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 14.</note> sins and abominations, 3. <hi>That</hi> the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which were intended for spiritual benefit, shall become a spiritual mischief to their souls through their abuse. That the Lords, Supper instead of nourishing Grace <note n="k" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.27, 28, 29. <hi>John</hi> 13 2, 27.36.</note> should strengthen sinne; instead of sealing of Remission of our sinnes in Christs blood, should render us <hi>guilty of the body and blood of the Lord,</hi> even guilty of murdering the Lord of Life and Glory. 4. <hi>That</hi> by unworthy handling them, they may incurre many <note n="l" place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30, 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 11.30.</note> temporal afflictions

and chastisements in Gods displeasure. 5. <hi>Finally,</hi> they may enjoy Sacraments; and yet so farre displease God therein, as thereby to hazard <note n="m" place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29.</note> 
               <hi>their own Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and eternal <hi>Damnation,</hi> and lose Heaven it selfe for ever.

            <p n="3">3. Hence consequently these things are clear. I. <hi>That</hi> our bare enjoyment of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, is no infallible signe, either of Gods special love tow, or of our good spiritual state towards God. II. <hi>That</hi> it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe for Christians to rest themselves satisfied and contented with the meere having, or the meer using of Sacraments. It's the Right having and Due using of Sacraments, which will commend us, and our actions about them unto Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. III. <hi>That</hi> it singularly concerns all Gods people to endeavour so to enjoy and
<pb facs="tcp:44965:11"/>
use all Sacraments, and particularly the Lords Supper. Which is often to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as therein they may be well-pleasing and acceptable to the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now that we may acceptably and profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly manage the Lords Supper, these things are peculiarly necessary. 1. <hi>A due Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for the Lords Supper before we commmunicate. 2. A right use of the Lords Supper while we are communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. 3. A Christian conversation suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Lords Supper, after we have commmunicated.</hi> In reference to these three General Heads, seriously consider, and practically improve these brief <hi>Directions</hi> following.</p>

               <p>Thou wilt say, O that mine iniquities were pardoned, then should I be an happy soul. But how may I know that the Lord hath pardoned my sins, and will remember mine iniquities no more? <hi>Answer.</hi> Thou majest know that God hath forgiven thy sins, 1. If thou hast sincerely confessed, bewailed, and forsaken thy sins, and turned from all thine evil wayes; for thus hath God promised. <note n="c" place="margin">Prov. 28.13.</note> 
                  <hi>He that covereth his sins shall not prosper; but who so confesseth and forsaketh them, shall have mercy.</hi>— <note n="d" place="margin">Isa. 1.16, 17, 18.</note> 
                  <hi>Wash ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to doe evil.—Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD; though your sins be as Scarlet, they shall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimson, they shall be as Wool.</hi> And elsewhere most sweetly; <note n="e" place="margin">Isa. 55.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Let the wicked forsake his way, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous man his thoughts: and let him returne unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will multiply to pardon.</hi> 2. If thine heart be calmed and quieted through faith in Christ, so that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by thou art at peace with God. When we through faith have pardon and justification from God, we consequently have peace with God: <note n="f" place="margin">Rom. 5.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God.</hi> Is God pacified towards thee? doth he smile upon thee? doth he still thy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44965:18"/>
soul with true peace? this is an Argument of thy sins pardon. 3. If thine heart be singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inflamed with the love of Christ, through whom thy sins are pardoned, it's a great evidence thy sins are forgiven. The woman that <note n="g" place="margin">Luke 7.38, 47.</note> 
                  <hi>had many sins forgiven her by Christ, she loved him much</hi>; upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, <hi>She wept and washed his feet with tears, she wiped them with the hairs of her head, she kissed his feet, and anointed them with oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Nothing was too good, too dear for Christ, that had paid all her debts, forgiven all her sins. 4. If thou art earnest with God more and more for assurance of pardon, for purity of heart, and stablishment in the wayes of grace for time to come; it's a good signe thy sins are pardoned. God told <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> by <hi>Nathan</hi>; <note n="h" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.13.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord hath put away thy sin, thou shalt not die.</hi> Vpon this <hi>David</hi> prays so pathetically, <note n="i" place="margin">Ps. 51.1.2, 7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 8, 12.</note> 
                  <hi>Purge me with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sope, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter then Snow. Make me to hear joy and gladnesse.—Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit.</hi> 5. Finally, it's a signe thy sins are pardoned, if thy heart and soul, and all within thee be singularly inlarged to blesse and praise God for his pardons. So it was with <hi>David</hi>; <note n="k" place="margin">Ps. 103.1 2, 3.</note> 
                  <hi>Blesse the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, blesse his holy name. Blesse the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities, who
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44965:19"/>
healeth all thy diseases.</hi> If thine heart feel his pardons, thy mouth will sing his praises.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, they are parties to the New Covenant, that have Gods fear so implanted in the heart, as not to depart from him. <note n="l" place="margin">Jer. 32.40.</note> 
                  <hi>And I will make an everlasting Covenant with them, that I will not turne away from them to do them good: but I will put my fear in their hearts, and they shall not depart from me.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates and Back-sliders were never truly in Covenant with God.

               <p n="1">1. Hast thou not great need, often to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, strengthen and comfort thine inward man with all the graces and spiritual abilities thereof?

               <p>Behold now what need thou hast of the Lords Supper to these ends. For what nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishing ordinance is this Sacrament for all these purposes? For it's stiled <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lords Supper.</hi> It's <hi>A Supper,</hi> therefore, suitable to nourish the inward man; <hi>The Lords Supper,</hi> therefore sufficient to nourish it effectually. As the body and all its strength decays with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due corporal food; so the soul and its graces without due spiritual food.

The termes or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of them both were the same, <hi>viz.</hi> faith

in Jesus Christ the Mediatour, not works. 5.

                  <p>But they differ only in some <hi>Circumstances,</hi> and the <hi>manner of Administration.</hi> For 1. The Old Covenant was dark and obscure. All the spiritual mysteries therein being clouded in types and shadowes: A typicall <hi>Priesthood,</hi> typical <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> typical <hi>Altar</hi> and <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> typical <hi>blood,</hi> typical <hi>Mediatour,</hi> typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Sacraments,</hi> typical <hi>Canaan,</hi> all typical.

                     <hi>came unto black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and darknesse.</hi> But the new Covenant is <note n="r" place="margin">2.

The Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was more imperfect, according to the imperfect state of the Church in those times, (which the Apostle compares to <note n="y" place="margin">Gal. 4.1.2, 3.</note> 
                     <hi>A child in his non-age and minority.</hi>) And so it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed more and more clearly by degrees, as the Church grew riper and riper till Christs coming. But the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is perfect and full, never more to be enlarged or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased till the end of the world, it being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, in Christ fulfilled, and comne in the flesh already. 4 The Old Covenant was terrible in the manner of its dispensation, making not only the <note n="z" place="margin">Heb. 12.19, 20, 21.</note> 
                     <hi>People tremble but</hi> even <hi>Moses himselfe exceedingly to fear and quake.</hi> But the <hi>New Covenant</hi> is dispensed with all inviting amiableness, and alluring sweetness, every thing herein being sweet, pleasant, and delectable nothing at all terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: As appears in that admirable passage to the <note n="a]" place="margin">Heb. 12.22, to 25.</note>

was limited and restrained to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews onely, and to those that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Jewish Proselytes: Gentiles were all <note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 1.12.</note>

And no wonder; for true knowledge disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the odious sinfulness of sin, the severe justice of God against it, the manifold mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so sets the soul against it.</p>

                     <hi>The special difference,</hi> whereby Faith is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from all other saving graces, is in these words; <hi>whereby a man knowing and assenting to the truth of Gods record touching Christ, accepts him upon his own terms for salvation.</hi> Herein are expressed the three graduall acts of faith, <hi>viz. Knowledge, Assent,</hi> and <hi>Application. 1. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> which is the first and fundamental act of faith. We must know Gods Record be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can assent to it, we must assent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we can apply. Faith is sometimes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expressed by knowledge, <note n="z" place="margin">Isa. 53.11</note> 
                     <hi>By his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge shall my righteous servant justifie many</hi>; that is, by faith in Christ, whereby we know him: it is by faith that we are justified. <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 17.3</note> 
                     <hi>This is life eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Iesus Christ whom thou hast sent.</hi> 2. <hi>Assent</hi> to the truth of Gods Record touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Christ. This Act is the same with Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall faith, <note n="b" place="margin">1 Joh. 5.10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, because he believeth not the Record that God gave of his Son. And this is the Record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.</hi> The whole Scripture is Gods book of Record touching Christ, that he will save sinners by him, that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. 3. <hi>Application</hi> of Christ, when
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:44965:68"/>
after knowledge and Assent a man accepts Christ upon his own terms for salvation. The applying Act, is accepting or receiving of Christ. To receive Christ is to believe: <note n="c" place="margin">Joh. 1.12</note> 
                     <hi>To as many as received him, gave he power to become the Sons of God, to them that believe on his name.</hi> The manner of this applying and accepting Christ is upon his own termes, <hi>viz.</hi> Self-deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, bearing the Crosse, and following Christ, <note n="d" place="margin">Luke 9.23.</note> 
                     <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his Crosse daily, and follow me.</hi> The end of this accepting Christ, is for salvation by him. — <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 10.39.</note> 
                     <hi>That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to the saving of the soul,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This now is that true saving faith, fitting them that have it for worthy receiving of the Lords Supper.</p>

                  <p>Faith is tha <hi>spiritual Prospective,</hi> by which the soul can behold Christ sweating drops of clotted blood in the Garden, suffering many cruel things in the High-Priests Palace, and dying a painful, shameful, and cursed death, betwixt two theeves upon <hi>Mount Calvary.</hi> And further, faith can read and discern many <hi>strange Mysteries in Christ crucified,</hi> of high concernment to Christians, both in the Lords Supper, and in his whole life, <hi>viz.</hi> The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, sweetness, victories, triumphs, satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, expiations, purchases, priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of his Crosse for our sakes.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:44965:71"/>
acts of sin: but inward imaginations, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure inclinations to sin. A true believer as truly makes conscience of, and laments for the vileness of his heart and thoughts in the sight of God, as the enormity of his life and actions in the sight of men.</p>
                  <p>But how doth faith cleanse and purifie the heart? <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. By <hi>Augmentation</hi> from the word against sin, which discerns the odious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and danger of sin.

                  <p>Shew now thy faith by thy purity. A <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full soul cannot have a foul heart.</hi> As that soul that by faith looks upon Christ pierced for his sins, cannot chuse but be wounded and pierced with Christ: so that soul that's pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

to Idols, that they should be convinced of the mischief of those wayes, which should move them to return again to God; <note n="m" place="margin">Hos. 2, 6.7.</note>
                     <hi>Then shall she say, I will go and return to my first Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for then it was better with me then now.</hi> Thus the <note n="n" place="margin">Luke 15.17, 18, 19,</note> Prodigal had a true sense of his misery whereunto his sin had brought him, that he <hi>was perishing with hunger</hi>; and then resolves penitentially to <hi>return to his Father.</hi> And<note n="s" place="margin">Joh. 16.8, 9.</note>

In these respects true brotherly love is necessary before we communicate, to fit for worthy receiving.

                     <hi>Every one that loveth him that begat, loveth him also that is begotten of him</hi>: That is, he loves the godly for Gods sake, the spiritual Child for the Fathers sake.

                     <hi>By this we know that we love the Children of God, when we love God and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> So that, make sure thy love to God: this makes sure thy love to the Brethren.

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. True brotherly love is pure. It's seated
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:44965:97"/>
in, and flowes from <hi>a pure heart:</hi> an heart <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 15.9</note> 
                     <hi>purified by faith</hi> justifying, and by the <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 6.11.</note> spirit sanctifying. <note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.22.</note>

                  <p n="3">3. True brotherly love is spiritual. It is carried to Gods people in spiritual, not in carnal respects. To love Gods people for their greatness, wealth, beauty, wisdom, learning, friendliness, kindred, and like carnal conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is but to love them carnally; a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate may so love them.

                  <p n="1">1. As Gods Children. <note n="g" place="margin">1 Joh. 5.1, 2.</note>

When we love them principally for God, Christ, Grace, Godliness, Holiness, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which we apprehend to be in them. And when, as their graces grow, our love grows also more and more towards
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:44965:98"/>
them. This evidenceth the spiritualness and truth of our love. What may we think of them then, that most of all hate Gods people for their godliness, graces, &amp;c?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As Brethren in Christ. There's a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Brotherhood</hi> in Christ, wherein all his members relate to one another as Brethren, Christ being <hi>the first-born among many Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Now we have true love to the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, when we love them as Brethren, for their brotherhood. <note n="h" place="margin">1 Pet. 2.17.</note>

                     <hi>Love as Brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. As fellow-members. The Apostle at large shews, that all the members of Christs mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call body are also <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 12.12. &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>fellow-members to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> And that they are so placed in Christs mystical body, that they all have a mutuall dependence upon, and need of one another. Hence from this relation of member-ship, he urged a double act of member-like love, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. Mutuall member-like caring for one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note n="l" place="margin">Vers. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>The members should have the same care one for another,</hi> being mutually aiding and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting to one another, though never so mean: as the eye or hand will stoop down, to help the foot that's wounded or pained. 2. Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall member-like sympathy and compassion to one another. <note n="m" place="margin">Vers. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it: or one member be honoured, all the members rejoyce with it.</hi> A truly loving member not only rejoyceth with the rejoycing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so

grieveth with the grieved, smarteth with the pained, suffereth with the afflicted, want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the necessitated, is in bonds with the imprison'd, &amp;c. from this sympathizing dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Is thy love to the brethren such a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all love in these spiritual notions &amp; considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? 4. True brotherly love is universal: To one Christian, as well as to another, to all as well as to any, whether rich, poor, bond, free, male or female. <hi>Philemons</hi> love was commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Paul,</hi> that it was <note n="n" place="margin">Philem. Vers. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>towards all Saints.</hi> And upon the same ground, the <hi>Colossians</hi> love was matter of <hi>Pauls</hi> thankfulness to God; <note n="o" place="margin">Col. 1.3.4.</note> 
                     <hi>We give thanks to God,—Since we heard of your faith in Christ Iesus, and of the love which ye have to all the Saints.</hi> And no wonder; for he that loves one person truly for godliness and grace, he will love every person, wherein grace or godliness appears; those most, that discover most grace. For the like cause will produce the like effect. Those then that have the love of the brethren with respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; that love the rich Saints with their <hi>gold Rings, and gay Cloathings,</hi> but not the poor Saints with their <hi>vile raiment, &amp;c.</hi> they deal not sincerely in their love. For Christ is as truly precious and amiable for substance, in one Christian as in another.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. True brotherly love is sincere. The command is, <note n="p" place="margin">Rom. 12.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Let love be without dissimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> The practice according to this command was in these to whom <hi>Peter</hi> writes, who had

                     <hi>Christs sincere love to us,</hi> often urged to this end. Now the sincerity of our brotherly love, evidenceth it self prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally two wayes, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the reality of it. True brotherly love is not meerly verbal and complemental, in words and shows; but real and substantial, in deed and truth, The <hi>Hebrews</hi> not only loved the Saints, but loved them really. <note n="s" place="margin">Heb. 6.10</note> 
                     <hi>God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of Love, which you have shewed towards his name, in that ye have ministred to the Saints, and do minister. Iohn</hi> exhorts to this reality; <note n="t" place="margin">1 Joh. 3.17, 18.</note>

                     <hi>be courteous.</hi> The Greek word here used, seems to intimate such a sweet disposition, as studies and endeavours things grateful &amp; acceptable to Gods people, and to render it self well-pleasing to them.

gain by this Death of Christ? What pardons, Reconciliation, Peace with God, &amp;c. And all these confirmed to us in the Lords Supper, that lasting Monument of Christ crucified: Oh what manifold cause of thankfulness is here: 2. The outward matter of the Lords Supper, <hi>viz.</hi> the Elements of <hi>Bread and Wine,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the actions of <hi>taking, blessing, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, giving, eating and drinking them</hi>; affords also much cause of thankfulness, that Christ would thus condescend to our weakness, as to represent such heavenly mysteries to us by such homely elements and actions.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:44965:102"/>
How great thankfulness then is due for all of them together in the Lords Supper?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Tryal of our thankfulness, which is thus necessary for worthy communicating, comes next to be considered: and we may try the truth of our thankfulness, by the three eminent Acts or degrees of thankfulness, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Notice-taking or acknowledgement of bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings received.</hi> 2. <hi>Estimation of mercies receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acknowledged.</hi> 3. <hi>Retribution or render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again for mercies received, acknowledged and esteemed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Notice-taking</hi> or <hi>acknowledgement of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits received,</hi> is a first degree or Act of thank<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fulness. Till a man take notice of a benefit; and whence it comes, he can neither esteem it, nor render again for it as he ought. Thus when <hi>David</hi> would express his thankfulness to God for enabling him and his people to offer so willingly and liberally towards the building of the Temple, He takes notice of the benefit and whence it came, even all from God alone; <note n="a" place="margin">1 Chron. 29.13, 14, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Our God, we thank thee, and prayse thy glorious name. But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</hi> And in the Hebrew phrase, <hi>Giving of thanks,</hi> is most usually expressed by, <note n="b" place="margin">Ps. 105.1. and 106.1. &amp; 107.1. &amp; 136.1. and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the B. of Psalms.</note> 
                     <hi>Confessing to the Lord.</hi> For confessing and acknowledging what good we receive, and whence we have it, is a prime point of thankfulness. Contrariwise
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:44965:103"/>
it's a point of deep ingratitude not to observe and acknowledge the benefits, and whence they come. <hi>Israel</hi> is blamed for this, <note n="c" place="margin">Hos. 2.8.</note> 
                     <hi>She did not know that I gave her corn and new wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold.</hi> Such, like Swine, eat up and devoure the Acorns or mast, but never look up to the Oak whence they fall.</p>
                  <p>Dost thou now duly take notice of that mercy of mercies, Jesus Christ and his Death? how mysteriously the saving of sinners by him is contrived in Gods eternal Counsel, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Scriptures? How Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dost thou duly observe and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the mercy of the Lords Supper, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and applying Christ and his death, and how it was from Christs tender love and care of his Church that he instituted it?

                     <hi>The Lords Supper.</hi> Christ is the <hi>Master</hi> of the Feast: and Christ is the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Feast. His precious body is here tendered as <hi>bread of life</hi>: and his blood as <hi>water of life,</hi> to satisfie, strengthen, and enliven for ever every believing soul.

And if ever dainties will stirre up dul ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, these rarest provisions will excite spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual hungrings and thirstings after them.

                  <p n="1">1. A good sharp lively Communion-Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite would be often eating. Hunger bites and gnaws the sound stomack if but one meal be miss'd: The misse of this ordinance, paines and grieves the soul of an hunger-bitten Christian. The Primitive Christians had live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Appetites after this Supper; they desired it often, yea they had it often. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.25.26.</note> once and again, intimates a frequency of their communicating. And <hi>Luke</hi> seemes to insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, that it was their accustomed manner to communicate every <hi>Lords day,</hi> which is the first day of the week;—<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 20.7.</note> 
                     <hi>And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to break bread,</hi> Paul <hi>preached unto them.</hi> Had we such hunger and thirst after Christ as they had, we should desire the Lords Supper, as often as conveniently it might be had. What weak and bad appetites have they, that can content themselves with once communicating in the year, at <hi>Easter:</hi> yea perhaps with once in five or six yeares?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Such as have good appetites will be at paines and cost to obtaine food. <hi>Hunger</hi> (we say) <hi>breakes the stone walls</hi>; will make a man labour early and late, with sweat of his

brows to get his bread, and not grudge to lay out his money for necessary sustenance. Hunger made <hi>Iacob</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. He that hath a good spiritual appetite to this Feast, will be glad when Christ by his Ministers invites him thereunto. Meal-time is a gladning time to such as have good appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, because then their hunger and thirst shall be satisfied. It holds both in the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and spiritual appetite. <hi>David</hi> had many a sweet meal in Gods house, by Prayer, Hearing, and other Ordinances: therefore how was he affected, when opportunities of such refreshing were tendered! <note n="i" place="margin">Ps. 122.1.</note> 
                     <hi>I was glad
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:44965:109"/>
when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the LORD.</hi> He had a lively appetite, he was an hungry soul; that was gladned with such spiritual invitations. Hence (some think) the sound of the <note n="k" place="margin">Num. 10 2, to 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Silver Trumpets</hi> (which was among other uses for calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the Assemblies, and solemnity of their sacrifices) was called <note n="l" place="margin">Ps. 89.15.</note> 
                     <hi>The joyful sound</hi>: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it made them joyfull that had true ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites to the publick Ordinances. Now then art thou glad when the Sabbath comes, when the Sacrament approaches, when they say to thee, Come, let us go to the Table of the Lord, &amp;c? Here's a signe of a good appetite. But they that say, <hi>When will the Sabbath be gone,</hi> the Sacrament be done, &amp;c. having no kindly affectionate movings? shew their appetite is extream dull, and diseased, if any at all.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A good stomach retaines and closes fast with the food received, that it may con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oct it. When the stomach returnes and casts up its morsels, there is not only no appetite, but the Party is dangerously distempered: So here, the soule that's truly a thirst for Christ, when he hath received him in the Sacrament, or any other Ordinance, how doth he clasp and close with him, that he may digest and turn him into life, blood and spirits to the inner man, by Faith, Prayers, and Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? He holds fast his death and the benefits thereof, labours to walk as one in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

with Christ, and refreshed therewith. And charges all as the Church did once the daughters of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; <note n="m" place="margin">Cant. 2.7</note> 
                     <hi>I charge you— that you stirre not up, nor awake my love untill he please.</hi> But when men presently disgorge the Sacrament, forget Christ, his Death, his New Testament and Communion with him unto which they have sealed in the Lords Supper, returning to their lusts, covetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, worldlinesse, drunkennesse, &amp;c. as soon as they have turned their backs of the <hi>Lords Table,</hi> they have no true spiritual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, but are wofully diseased.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Finally, A man of a good appetite not only retains food received, but also findes strengthening, refreshment, comfort and much benefit by food retained. His hunger is sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; thirst quenched, crudities expelled, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing spirits revived, and decayed strength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored, whereby he becomes active for all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments: So here, he that hath a true spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual appetite to the Lords Supper, and to Christ crucified herein, he will extract and derive much spiritual strength, comfort and refreshing from that banquet.

Perhaps for present these benefits may not be so evidently discerned at communicating, as afterwards: As in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral repast, the stomack is oft-times little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed, yea sometimes becomes more sick by eating, yet afterwards the body is much advantaged by the food.

                  <hi>Come not</hi> to the Lords Supper for these wrong Ends; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Not</hi> to make the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a bond of iniquity. As the bloody Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists abused the Lords Supper to confirme themselves more strongly in carrying on the horrid <hi>Gunpowder-Treason.</hi> To take the Lords Supper to strengthen a mans resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in any evil practice, is blasphemously to make Christ a Patron to our sins, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament a stalking-horse to our corruptions. 2. <hi>Not</hi> for Superstitious purposes; as in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, for Idolatrous Adoration of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, carrying them about in Procession, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of them for healing of diseases in man or beast, for casting them into dead mens graves, &amp;c. These are abominable fooleries to be abhorred, utterly besides the intention of the Lords Supper. 3. <hi>Not</hi> for Conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or breeding Grace in a gracelesse heart. True, a man may possibly be converted at the Lords Supper by the Word then opened and applied, but not be converted precisely by the Lords Supper. For this sacrament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Christ as a spiritual Feast, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.20.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lords Supper</hi>; Therefore not to convert and give life to them that are spiritually dead, but to confime and nourish them that are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally alive: Not to breed Grace where there is none, but to feed Grace where there is. Again, Who shall be converted by the Lords Supper? either they must be Pagans from Paganisme to Christianity, or professed Christians from

Not <hi>professed Christians,</hi> for when they come to the Lords Supper, they either come worthily or unworthily; if <hi>worthily,</hi> then they are true believers already and need no conversion: if <hi>unworthily,</hi> then they are so farre from being converted, that they eat and drink their own condemnation. 4. <hi>Not</hi> for improving of Grace where Grace is, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> by the bare work done in communicating. The Lords Supper is not like Physick or Medicine that works a cure by a natural property there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in whether the Patient sleep or wake, &amp;c. but it is a spiritual Ordinance that through Gods blessing, in the right use of it, improves and increaseth Grace.

As many grains of wheat make one bread and many grapes one cup of wine: So they being many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers yet are but all one mystical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in Christ.

               <p>
                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:44965:114"/>These are the <hi>right Ends</hi> &amp; uses of the Lords Supper. In the <hi>Act of communicating,</hi> still keep thine eye intentively upon them: As he that shoots keeps his eie steadily on the mark or as he that runs directs his aims still to the Goal.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>In order to these excellent Ends manage the whole Sacramental Action according to Christs Institution.</hi> Sacraments are not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,</hi> but <hi>Instituted worship,</hi> and therefore wholly depend upon Institution in their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and are wholly to be regulated by Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in their use.

Therefore the institution must be the Rule and Standard for regulating the whole Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of communicating.

                  <hi>Do this,</hi> That is, <hi>Do this that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that I do in this Institution</hi>: follow ye my Precept, &amp; my Patterne herein all-a-long. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> intending to reform the grosse abuses and prophanations of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> calls them back to the first Institution thereof by Christ, from which they had turned aside, <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.23, &amp;c.</note> 
                  <hi>For I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto you, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore in thy Giving, or
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:44965:114"/>
Receiving the Lords Supper, keep close to the Institution: then thou walkest safely.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Elements which Christ used, were <hi>Bread and Wine.</hi>

What sort of Bread or Wine, is not prescribed particularly: but left to liberty. <hi>Papists</hi> deal sacrilegiously, who deny the Cup to the people, giving them only Bread.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Mysteries signified &amp;c. by these Elements, according to Christs Institution, are <note n="r" place="margin">Mat. 26.26, 27, 28.</note>

                  <hi>That all things be don decently, in order, and to edification.</hi> This singing Psalmes in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction being un-decent and disorderly, whilest one part of the Congregation is receiving, another part is singing, which makes a grosse confusion in the Church, and in the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exercises. And also unedifying, yea a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst edification, whilest the Communicants thoughts are hereby distracted, and drawn away from fruitful pondering and medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon the many mysteries of the Lords Supper: and their graces are disturbed and hindred from their free and lively actings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Christ crucified, the benefits of his death, his love therein to us, our reciprocal duties to him, &amp;c. enough to employ the quickest thoughts and graces throughout the whole action.</p>
               <p>But as for those <hi>Circumstantials</hi> about the Lords Supper, that were meerly <hi>accidentall</hi> and <hi>occasional</hi>; occasioned by the Paschal Supper, or otherwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

there being no private Christians amongst them: These being meerly accidental to the Lords Supper, and being occasioned by something besides the Lords Supper, they do not tie us to the observation of them. Thus manage the whole action of the Lords Supper according to Christs Institution.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Act and exercising lively, in Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, all those Sacramental qualifications and graces fore-mentioned,</hi> viz. <hi>Knowledge Faith, Repentance, New Obed<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

You have seen how necessary they are for a worthy Communicant. Stir them up therefore, and awaken them in your selves in Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. He that's to wrastle or run a race, must not only have strength and skill, but use them if he mean to prevaile. He that's cold must not only have fire raked up under the ashes, but must blow it up, if he means to be warm: so he that means to communicate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, must not content himself with the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Grace, but put forth the Acts of Grace. Gods children may receive unworthily, by not using of Grace: as wicked men receive unworthily by not having of Grace. Act and use therefore every Grace pertinently and properly according to their several natures respectively.</p>
               <pb n="210" facs="tcp:44965:117"/>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Act Knowledge,</hi> so as to have a right ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension, <hi>Of that God,</hi> with whom thou hast to do in this Ordinance: <hi>Of thy selfe,</hi> that dost Communicate, what thy spiritual state is: <hi>Of Christ and his death,</hi> the chief my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of this Supper: <hi>Of the New Covenant</hi> and the tenour of it, which is sealed in this Sacrament: <hi>And of this Sacrament it selfe,</hi> and the nature of it, which thou takest in hand.

               <p n="3">3. <hi>Act Repentance and godly Sorrow.</hi> When thou seest the bread broken, and the wine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the bread, think how Christs body was <note n="c" place="margin">Isa. 53.4, 5, 6.</note>
