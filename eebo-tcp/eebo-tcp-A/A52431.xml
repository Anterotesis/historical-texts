            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere having been seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Excellent things of a <hi>Devotional Nature</hi> Written for the Use and Benefit of <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> and <hi>Vnlearned</hi> Persons, but little or nothing for the pious entertainment of more <hi>refined</hi> and <hi>elevated</hi> Understandings, I thought I could not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my Pen to better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose than in writing some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the like Kind for the use of the <hi>Learned Reader,</hi> who, perhaps needs as much to be assisted in his <hi>Devotion</hi> as the more <hi>Ignorant</hi>; and
<pb facs="tcp:60055:6"/>
whose <hi>Heart</hi> may want as much to be <hi>Inflamed,</hi> as the others <hi>Head</hi> does to be <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged therefore that I now write only to those of the <hi>Learned Order,</hi> and not to all of them neither, but only to those who are not spoil'd by their <hi>Learning,</hi> and whose under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings are not <hi>Cramp'd</hi> by the cleaving Prejudices of <hi>Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastick Education,</hi> To those who have a genius for the the <hi>Contemplative Way,</hi> who have <hi>Patience</hi> enough to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue a long train of thoughts, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteness</hi> enough to discern their Order and Dependence, and (which is worth all) <hi>Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency</hi>

                  <p>It must indeed be confess'd, that there is nothing whereof we have or can have so little knowledge, as of these two things; and 'tis much to be lamented that <hi>there</hi> should lie our greatest <hi>Ignorance,</hi> where we are most concern'd to <hi>know.</hi> But thus it is: <hi>That</hi> of our selves, which we are best acquainted with, is

least of all our selves: and the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known</hi> part of this little World is much greater than the <hi>known.</hi> We know but little of our <hi>Bodies,</hi> but infinitely less of our <hi>Souls.</hi> God has not given us any <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>latter,</hi> and whatever we can bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from our <hi>Senses</hi> will never be able to supply that defect.

Nor by this acceptation do I stretch the word beyond what either from its rise it <hi>may,</hi> or by frequent use a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Learned it <hi>does</hi> signifie.

                  <p>They that make <hi>Ignorance</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Devotion,</hi> cannot suppose Contemplation any great friend to it. For the more a Man Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates, the more he will know, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60055:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the wiser he grows, the less apt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their supposition he will be for Devotion. But I would ask the Men of <hi>this fancy</hi> this one Question. Is Devotion a Rational thing, or is it not? If not, Why then do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend Ignorance or any thing else in order to it. For it may as well, nay better, be let alone. But if it be a Rational thing, then they must either say, that the more a Man considers, the less he will discover the Reasons of it; or that the more he discovers the Reasons of it, the less he will be persuaded to the practice of it. Both which propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions are absurd and ridiculous enough to be <hi>laught</hi> at, but too ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to be <hi>seriously refuted.</hi>

                  <p>But to shew how much Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation serves to the advantage of Devotion, we need only consider, that Devotion is an act of the Will, that the Object of the Will is good apparent, or good understood, and consequently that every act of the Will is influenc'd and regulated by

                  <p>I deny not but that <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> often go assunder, and the <hi>Wisest</hi> are not always the <hi>Devoutest.</hi> But then this is not owing to the natural and direct influence of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, but comes to pass only occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionally and accidentally, by reason of some other impediment: sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Pride, Lust, Covetousness, or some such indisposition of Mind, which is of <hi>more</hi> force and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency to <hi>lett</hi> our Devotion, than Knowledge is to <hi>further</hi> it. And then no wonder that the heavier Scale weighs down. But still Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge has a <hi>natural</hi> aptness to excite Devotion, and will infallibly do it

if not hinder'd by some other cause.

                  <p>This being granted, it does hence evidently follow, That that which is not first to be conceiv'd in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a thing, but supposes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what there before it in order of conception, cannot be the Idea of

that thing, tho' it be never so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily and inseparably joyn'd with it. For if it were, then something would be the Idea of a thing, which is not first in order of conception; which is against the definition of such an Idea.</p>

                  <p>Now that to be a Being absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perfect, is not the <hi>first conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> in God, but supposes something before it in the Divine Nature, is plain from hence, because it may be

proved a <hi>priori,</hi> or by way of a <hi>causal dependence</hi> from something in the same Divine Nature. That it may be thus proved I shall make appear in my second Contemplation, where I shall make it my profest business actually to prove it.

                  <p>If it be in the mean time objected, That to be a Being Absolutely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, is involv'd in the Notion of God; and that 'tis an Idea that can belong to no other Being, and that therefore it must be the Idea of God. To this I answer, 1. That a thing may be involv'd in the Notion of a thing either <hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Explicitly,</hi> or else <hi>Vertually</hi> and <hi>Implicitly.</hi>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:60055:18"/>
Whatever is involv'd Formally and Explicitly in any Idea, is Essential to that Idea. But not what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd only vertually and implicitly. Thus 'tis vertually and implicitly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the Idea of a Triangle, that it has three Angles equal to two Right ones, and yet we don't there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make this the Idea of a Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, because 'tis not there <hi>Formally</hi> and <hi>Explicitly,</hi> but only <hi>Vertually</hi> and <hi>Potentially.</hi> But now to be a Being Absolutely perfect is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in the Notion of God Formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Explicitly, but only Vertual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Potentially (as will appear in the next Contemplation) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently 'tis hence more rightly concluded, that the Idea of God does not consist in this, that he is a Being Absolutely Perfect.</p>

                  <p>To the second part of the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction I answer, that 'tis not enough to make a thing the Idea of a thing, because it can belong to no other Being. For then to be <hi>Circumscri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptively in a place</hi> must be the Idea of

                  <p>If then this be not the Idea of God, wherein shall we fix it? It must be in something which we <hi>first</hi> conceive in God, and which is the Basis and Foundation of whatever we ascribe to him, whatever we think or say of him.

                     <pb n="20" facs="tcp:60055:19"/>
that <hi>great Name</hi> whereby he reveal'd himself to <hi>Moses,</hi> and whereby <hi>Moses</hi> was to make him known to his <hi>own people,</hi> who were then ignorant of him? In this <hi>Name</hi> of God I suppose his Essence and Idea to be couch't.</p>

                  <p>Here therefore I find my self in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in these two considerations. First, Why the Idea of God should be lodg'd in his <hi>Name.</hi> Secondly, What this Idea of God is, which is there lodg'd. That the Idea of God is lodg'd in his Name, I am induced to believe upon these grounds. First, Because I think it highly reasonable to suppose in general, That when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>God</hi> gives a <hi>name</hi> to any thing, 'tis such as expresses its <hi>nature.</hi> Not that words signifie <hi>naturally,</hi> but that God makes choice of such a word whose signification natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expresses the thing, tho' 'twas through <hi>Arbitrary</hi> institution that it <hi>first</hi> came by such a signification. In this sense, I say, 'tis highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to believe, that God always names things according to their <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:60055:19"/>
For is it consistent with the Accuracy of Infinite Wisdom to <hi>mis-call</hi> any thing? No, as he knows the <hi>number</hi> of things, so is he as well skill'd in their <hi>natures.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, says the <hi>Psalmist,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 147.</note> 
                     <hi>He telleth the number of the stars, and calleth them all by their names.</hi> That is, by such <hi>significant</hi> names as express their several <hi>Powers</hi> and <hi>Influences.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I consider, That as 'tis highly decorous and reasonable in general, that God should call things by such names as express their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; so there is <hi>here</hi> a <hi>particular</hi> reason why he should express his <hi>own</hi> Essence in this his name. For thus stood the case: The Children of <hi>Israel</hi> had been now a <hi>long</hi> while conversant among the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> who were the greatest <hi>Idolaters</hi> and <hi>Polytheists</hi> in the World, there they had been used to variety of Gods, who were also call'd by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of <hi>names.</hi> Hereupon, says <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> to God, <hi>Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:60055:20"/>
them, the God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his Name? what shall I say unto them?</hi> Implying that it was necessary (as indeed it was) that God should notifie himself by such a Name, as would distinguish him from all the Gods of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> that is, by a <hi>Proper</hi> and <hi>Essential</hi> Name. Whereupon, says God to <hi>Moses, I am that am. Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I am hath sent me unto you.</hi>

                  <p>It being therefore concluded, that the Idea of God must be lodg'd in this his Name; let us now consider what this Idea of God is which is there lodg'd. And for this we must attend in the first place to the true sense and signification of this Name of God, <hi>I am that am,</hi> or, <hi>I am.</hi> Now this can signifie no other, but <hi>Being it self,</hi> or <hi>Vniversal Being,</hi> or <hi>Being in General, Being</hi> in the <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,</hi> without any restriction or li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation. As if God had said, You enquire who I am, and by what
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:60055:20"/>
Name I would be distinguish'd. Know then, that, <hi>I am he that am, I am Being it self.</hi> This therefore must express the <hi>Essence,</hi> and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this must be the <hi>Formal Conception</hi> and <hi>Idea</hi> of God.</p>

                  <p>But this must be further <hi>explain'd,</hi> before it be further <hi>confirm'd.</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which, I consider, that as, in every particular order or kind of Being there is a Universal Nature, under which all singulars are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and whereof they all partake: as for instance, there is the Nature or Essence of a Circle or Triangle in common, as well as this or that particular Circle or Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle. So in Beings consider'd as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, there is Being in general, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Being, Being it self, or the Essence of Being, as well as this or that Being in particular.</p>

                  <p>Again I consider, that all other U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversals or Abstract Essences are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally distinct from, and exist out of those singulars whose Essences they

                  <p>And now that the Essence and I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of God does consist in this <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self,</hi> or this <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>Being,</hi> will be further confirm'd from this Consideration, That as all other U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversal Natures or Essences are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

else (as I have already else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,<note place="margin">

                     </note> and shall hereafter again prove) but the Intellect of God, which as variously imitable, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipable, exhibits all the general Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Natures of things; so this Being it self, or this Essence of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, what can it be else, but the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Essence of God, containing in it the whole Plenitude and Possibility of Being, all that is, or can be?</p>

                  <p>And that this is the true Idea and Essence of God, to be Being it self, is further plain, because 'tis the first conceivable in God. For the proof of this, That it is the first conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in God, I might appeal to expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. For, let any Comtemplative Person try whether this be not the first thing he conceives when he hears the Name of God. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate it thus. The first thing which is conceivable in God, must be the first thing that can absolutely be conceiv'd. But Being it self is the first thing that can absolutely be conceiv'd. Therefore Being it

                  <p>The Assumption, I suppose, will pass unquestion'd with all. For what can we possibly conceive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Being it self? The Proposition I prove thus. God is the <hi>first</hi>; or, there is nothing before God And therefore the first thing which is conceivable in God, must be the first thing that can <hi>absolutely</hi> be conceiv'd. Otherwise there would be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before God, which is against the supposition. The conclusion therefore follows, That Being it self is the first thing which is conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in God; and consequently, that the true Idea God, is Being it self; which was the thing to be proved.</p>

The Idea of God, as we have shewn, is Being it self. Now I consider in the first place that Being it self contains in it <hi>all the degrees</hi> of Being, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently <hi>all possible Perfection.</hi> The Argument in form runs thus. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has all the degrees of Being has all Perfection.</p>
                  <p>But Being it self has all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Being.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60055:25"/>
then it plainly follows that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has all the degrees of Being has all Perfection. Now to prove that Perfection is nothing else but degree of Being, I consider first that all Perfection is by <hi>Addition.</hi> For the more Perfect any thing is, the more it has.

                  <p>This I confirm by considering further that every thing is perfect just so far as it <hi>is,</hi> and according to the mode of Being, so is the mode of perfection. Thus vertue is no otherwise the perfection of a Man than as he <hi>is</hi> vertuous, nor strength than as he <hi>is</hi> strong. And so in all other instances according as any thing <hi>is,</hi> so is its Perfection. And so on the contrary, all imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is want of Being, and every thing is just so far imperfect as it
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60055:25"/>
                     <hi>is not,</hi> some way or other. Now if every thing be so far perfect or imperfect respectively as it either <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>is not,</hi> then it clearly follows that perfection it self is nothing else but degree of Being.</p>

                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>Again I consider, that 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that perfection should be any thing else but degree of Being. For there is nothing in the world but <hi>Being.</hi> If therefore one thing be more perfect than another, it must be, it can be for no other reason but because it has more degrees of Being, there not being any thing else whereby it may exceed. For I think the case is here as in <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</hi> One number excceds another not by any vertue or quality of another kind, but only by the <hi>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication</hi> of the <hi>same units.</hi> And so one Being exceeds, or is more perfect than another, not by any thing which is not <hi>Being,</hi> but <hi>only</hi> by having more <hi>units</hi> or <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Being.</hi> Bare, meer Being is as 'twere an <hi>unit,</hi> the lowest perfection; and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60055:26"/>
the only way to make it more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is <hi>multiplication,</hi> by adding to it more of the same units. And consequently perfection is nothing else but degree of Being.</p>

                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <p>This Proposition being sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear'd, that Perfection is nothing else but a Degree of Being, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the other, that whatever has all the degrees of Being has all Perfection; let us now consider whether Being it self has all the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Being. That it has so, will thus appear: Being it self is <hi>indeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate</hi> in being, and consequently has all the degrees of Being. The Argument reduced to Form is this: Whatever is indeterminate in being has all the Degrees of Being.</p>
                  <p>But Being it self is indeterminate in being: Therefore Being it self has all the degrees of Being.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <p>And first, that whatever is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate in being has all the degrees of Being is certain, for the whole Power and Plenitude of Being can be
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60055:26"/>
but indeterminate or infinite, there is nothing beyond that, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that which is indeterminate in being, is adequate to the whole Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Plenitude of Being; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently has all the Degrees of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="8" type="section">
                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>And now that Being it self is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate in being is as certain. For what should bound it. Nothing can be bounded but by something that is <hi>before</hi> it: Which I thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate. To bound or limit a thing is to give it such a definite por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Being and no more. Now to give such a definite portion of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and no more, implies giving of Being <hi>Simply,</hi> and that is the same as to be a <hi>Cause,</hi> and every Cause is before the effect, and consequently nothing can be bounded but by something that is before it. But now what is before Being it self? Being it self is the first thing that can be conceiv'd: And therefore as that which is First in any kind, cannot be bounded by any thing in <hi>that</hi>
                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:60055:27"/>
kind, so Being it self, which is <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely First,</hi> cannot be bounded by any thing at all, because 'tis before all things. Indeed this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Being may well be bounded, because it partakes so much and no more of Being it self, or the Essence of Being. But Being it self having nothing before it from whence it might receive limits, must of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity be unlimited in being, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently have all the Degrees of Being.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="9" type="section">
                  <head>IX.</head>
                  <p>And that Being it self has all the Degrees of Being, I further deduce from this Consideration; All Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and Universal Natures or Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences, have all the Perfection of their respective Orders and Kinds. And it cannot be otherwise, since they are <hi>abstracted</hi> from particular Subjects, whose deficiency in <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> is the ground of all that defect and imperfection which is in all <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete</hi> Entities. Thus this or that particular Musical Composition, or this or that particular Vertuous
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60055:27"/>
Man, are of a limited excellence, because they partake of Harmony and Vertue to such a certain Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. But now suppose Harmony it self, or Vertue it self, should exist Separately in the very <hi>Essence,</hi> they would necessarily have all the possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble degrees of <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi> And accordingly 'tis as reasonable to conclude that Being it self has all the degrees of Being. Whence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that Being it self has all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and consequently that God, who is Being it self, is Absolutely perfect.</p>

                  <p>Now if to this it be Objected, That those things which <hi>only are,</hi> are the most imperfect, and that therefore Being it self is most imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and that therefore if God be Being it self, he will be so far from being Absolutely Perfect, that he will be the most imperfect Being of any. I answer, That if those things which only are, were therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect because of the imperfection of <hi>Being Absolutely,</hi> as the Objection
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:60055:28"/>
supposes, the Consequence would then be as is objected. But they are therefore only imperfect, because they partake of Absolute Being, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its most imperfect degree, which is <hi>only</hi> to exist. They are not therefore imperfect as they <hi>are,</hi> but as they <hi>are not.</hi> As they <hi>are</hi> they are <hi>Perfect,</hi> for to <hi>be</hi> is to be so far Perfect, and to be <hi>Absolutely</hi> is to be Absolutely Perfect. God therefore who Absolutely <hi>is,</hi> is Absolutely Perfect.</p>

                  <p>The same Conclusion I further demonstrate by this Order or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning: That must needs be Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely Perfect which has no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: All imperfection is want of Being, and therefore that must needs have no imperfection which is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed from not being, and that must needs be utterly removed from not being which has all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that must needs have all Being, which is Being it self; and therefore that which is Being it self must needs be absolutely Perfect;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:60055:28"/>
God therefore who is Being it self, is also an absolutely Perfect Being. Which was the Proposition to be proved.</p>

                  <p>IN the preceeding Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it has been shewn, that the Essence and Idea of God consists in Being it self, and that therefore God is a Being absolutely Perfect. I now further consider, that from the same ground it may be concluded, that all the Perfections of particular Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings exist in God, and that after a more excellent manner than they do in particular Beings themselves. And first that all the Perfections of particular Beings do exist in God.</p>

                  <p>This I collect thus from the Idea of God. If Being it self be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore absolutely Perfect because it has all the degrees of Being, as has been proved, then by the same propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it plainly follows, that if Being it self has all the degrees of Being that are in all particular Beings, it must have all the Perfection that is in all particular Beings. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence I say is undeniable, because Perfection is nothing else but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Being. And that Being it self has all the degrees of Being that are in all particular Beings, might be sufficiently concluded from this, That it has all the degrees of Being Simply and Absolutely; which was proved before. But I further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it thus:</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>Being it self is the cause of all particular Beings, for all particular Beings are what they are by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Being it self: And if Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self be the cause of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Beings, then it must be also
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60055:31"/>
the cause of all the degrees of Being that are in particular Beings, for these can no more rise up into act from themselves, than the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Beings themselves can. And if Being it self be the cause of all the degrees of Being that are in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Beings, then it must have in it self all those degrees; for nothing can communicate what it has not. The short is, Whatever is in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect must pre-exist some way or other in <hi>that</hi> cause upon which it <hi>wholly depends.</hi> But now if Being it self be the cause of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Being that are in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Beings, then particular Beings <hi>wholly depend</hi> upon Being it self; and consequently whatever Perfection is in particular Beings, must exist in Being it self, which was the first proposition to be proved.</p>

                  <p>The next is, That the Perfections of particular Beings do exist in God after a more excellent manner than they do in the particular Beings themselves. For the Prerogative of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60055:31"/>
God above his Creatures does not consist meerly in this, That there are more Perfections in God than he ever <hi>did,</hi> or <hi>will,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to his Creatures, but that he has also those very Perfections which they have in a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent manner.</p>

                  <p>And 'tis highly reasonable, that there should be a great deal of Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Creation, since the World was made by him who is Being it self, and consequently Beauty it self, and who must needs imprint his <hi>own likeness</hi> upon the things which he has made. For if God must have all the Perfections which are in the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:60055:32"/>

And therefore it may be said, That God made not only Man, but the whole World, in a larger sense, after his own Image: and as Art imitates Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, so Nature imitates God. The short is, If God has <hi>All</hi> of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then the Creature must have <hi>something</hi> of God, and therefore must in some degree resemble him.

Thus that Beauty which charms the Eyes of the Amorous, exists more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in God than in the sweetest Face which they admire. And that Harmony which dissolves the Soul into Raptures and Extasies, has a much more perfect Existence in God than in the most agreeable Sounds that can possibly conspire together.

                  <p>And that things should thus fall short of God, even in that very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect wherein they resemble him, is no more than what Reason will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude necessary. For God being the very Essence of Being, or Being it self, and therefore indeterminate in Being, and therefore also in Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it follows that he has not only all Kinds of Perfection, but that every Kind of Perfection which he has must needs be as excellent as is possible in that Kind.

                  <p>THis may be very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd to the advantage of Devotion. For the great Let to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion is our Love of <hi>Particular</hi> and <hi>Sensible</hi> good. 'Tis a Charge that may be fasten'd upon the best of us all, more or less, that we are <hi>Lovers of Pleasure more than Lovers of God.</hi> And the Love of Pleasure Naturally alienates us from the Love of God. And therefore says St. <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 2.15.</note> 
                     <hi>Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.</hi> And to shew the great inconsistency that is between the Love of the World and the Love of God, he further tells us, <hi>If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</hi> But now if we could be but once perswaded that all the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of Particular Beings exist in

God, and not only so, but after a more excellent manner than they do in Particular Beings themselves, we should certainly be very much taken off from the love of Particular and Sensible good; we should not be such gross Idolaters as we are in adoring Created Beauty, but should adhere to God with more Unity and intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Affection. Sure I am that there is great Reason we should do so, when we consider, that let the good of the Creature be never so Charming, the very same we may find in God with greater Perfection. We can propose nothing to our selves in the Creature, but what God has more <hi>perfectly</hi> and more <hi>abundantly.</hi> To what purpose then should we go off from him, since Change it self can give us no variety, and we can only <hi>Court</hi> a <hi>New Object,</hi> not <hi>find</hi> a <hi>New Happiness.</hi>

                  <head>I.</head>
                  <p>COncerning the Attributes of God in general, I have no more to offer than what is commonly taught in the Schools; from which I find no reason to vary, and of which this I think is the summ and substance, <hi>first,</hi> That the Essence of God is in it self, one only general, simple and intire Perfection, and that therefore the Divine Attributes are not to be consider'd as Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents <hi>really</hi> distinct from the Divine Essence, and if not from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence, then not from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves neither.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>But however, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Since this Divine Essence which in it self is one and the same general Perfection, does exert and display it self various<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its Operations, by reason of the Diversity of Objects, the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of God are by us conceiv'd distinctly. Not that they are so in respect of God, with whom they are really one and the same, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently so also among themselves, but only with respect to our manner of conception.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>III.</head>
                  <p>For, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Essence of God displays it self variously (as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd before) according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of Objects. But now the narrowness of our Faculties will not permit us to represent such a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and manifold <hi>display</hi> of Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in one, simple and adequate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. We are fain therefore to supply this defect, by framing seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>inadequate</hi> conceptions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we represent God partially and imperfectly; and which we found
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:60055:38"/>
upon his different Operations; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of which is conceiv'd as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a different Perfection in God, corresponding to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Operation.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <p>Now tho' this diversity be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with respect to God, who is one and the same Nature, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position or complication of Being, but only with respect to variety of Objects and Modes of Operation, yet this is a sufficient ground for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct conceptions; every one of which may admit of a peculiar de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition or explication. The summ is, The Attributes of God are all one and the same as to the <hi>thing sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifi'd,</hi> but not as to the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>signification.</hi> Or, to word it more Scholastically, they may be mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally affirm'd of one another <hi>in sensu identico,</hi> but not <hi>in sensu formali.</hi> And thus must we be contented to think and talk of God while we see him here in a Glass darkly, till he shall reveal himself to us more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and we shall see him as he is,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:60055:38"/>

                  <p>This being premised concerning the Attributes of God in general, I proceed now to Contemplate some of those particular Attributes of his, which may derive the greatest in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon our Piety and Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And among these, I first con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>Vnity</hi> of God, by which I understand not a Generical, or Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifical, but a <hi>Numerical Vnity,</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to Plurality or Multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. That is, That there is One, and but One Onely God.</p>

               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <p>The <hi>Vnity</hi> of God has been ever more question'd than his <hi>Existence,</hi> and there have always been more <hi>Polytheists</hi> than <hi>Atheists.</hi> But for my part, I should sooner be an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist</hi> than a <hi>Polytheist,</hi> for I think it a greater absurdity, that there should be more Gods than one, than that there should be none at all. And I can't imagine how such a wretched absurdity as <hi>Polytheism</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:60055:39"/>
should ever obtain so much as it has both in the <hi>Gentile</hi> and <hi>Christian</hi> World, since without the assistance of any other considerations, it may abundantly be refuted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded impossible from the very Idea and Formal conception of God.</p>

                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <p>The Idea of God, is Being it self, and Being it self can be but One; which I thus demonstrate. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever is Infinite in Being, can be but One, but Being it self is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Being; therefore Being it self can be but One. That Being it self is Infinite in Being, we have prov'd in the Second Contemplation. The <hi>Proposition,</hi> That whatsoever is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite in Being can be but One, is plain. For if there were <hi>more</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites, one must be <hi>distinguish'd</hi> from another, otherwise they could not be more: for not to be <hi>distinguish'd,</hi> is to be the <hi>same.</hi> And if one must be distinguish'd from another, then one must have some degree of Being which the other has not; For by what else can any thing be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish'd?
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60055:39"/>
And if one must have some degree of Being, which the other has not, then to every one of these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed Infinites, some degree of Being must be wanting namely, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are destinguish'd. And if so, then none of them would be infinite in Being. Therefore Plurality of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finites in Being, is a contradictious self inconsistant Notion, and such as cannot be admitted by any person that knows what he affirms.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="8" type="section">
                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>But further, Being it self has all the degrees of Being, as all other Abstract and universal Natures have all the perfection of their respective Orders. But now what has all the degrees of Being cannot possibly be multiplied. For 'tis a flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction that more than one should have all the degrees of Being. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it may be <hi>communicated,</hi> and there may result as many Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Derivative Beings, as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self is capable of being <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated.</hi> But it cannot be <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,</hi> because it has all the degrees
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:60055:40"/>
of Being. And thus 'tis in all other Abstract Essences, they may be <hi>Communicated,</hi> but they can't be <hi>multiplied.</hi> Thus there may be many Particular Beauties by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious participation of Beauty it self. But suppose Beauty it self to exist, it could not be multiplied; there can be but one Beauty it self, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it has all the degrees of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection belonging to its Nature. And beyond all there is nothing.</p>

                  <head>IX.</head>
                  <p>For to him that would add ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Beauty it self, I would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose this Question. Has this super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added Beauty all the Perfection of the first, or has it not? If not, then 'tis not Beauty it self, for that is supposed to have all the Perfection belonging to Beauty. If it has, then 'tis the very same with the other, and consequently 'tis impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible there should be any more than one Beauty it self. And why is the multiplication of <hi>Individuals</hi> impossible, but only for this reason, because every Individual has all the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60055:40"/>
Perfection belonging to <hi>that Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duated Nature.</hi> Which therefore does not admit of Plurality or Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication. And consequently Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self having as much all the degrees of Being as any Individual has all the Perfection of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuated Nature, is no more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Plurality or Multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than any Individual is.

                  <p>Now in treating of God's Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, I shall do two things, First, prove that he is Omniscient, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, represent the manner of his Omniscience. To shew that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60055:43"/>
God is Omniscient, I must first consider what <hi>Knowledge</hi> is in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. Now this I define to be in short, a <hi>Comprehension of Truth.</hi> For the clearer understanding of which, the Distinction of Truth must be attended to. Truth then is either of the Object, or of the Subject. And both these are again subdivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. For Truth of the Object is either Simple, whereby a Being is really what it is. Or Complex, which denotes those necessary Habitudes or Respects, whereby one thing stands affected toward another as to Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation or Negation. Then as for Truth of the Subject, we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand by it either a just Conformity between the Understanding and the Object, which is <hi>Logical</hi> Truth, or between the Words and the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which is <hi>Moral</hi> Truth or Veracity.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>IV.</head>
                  <p>The Truth with which we are here concern'd, is Truth of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For to know is so to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend things both as to their Simple
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:60055:44"/>
Natures, and as to their Habitudes and Relations, as to Compound what is really Compounded, and to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide what is really Divided. To have our Understandings thus ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the Respects and Habitudes of things, is <hi>Knowledge.</hi> As for Truth of the Subject in the second sense, as it signifies a Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between the Words and the Understanding, we have here no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with it, as being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther foreign to our present purpose. And in the first acceptation, as it signifies a just conformity between the Understanding and the Object, 'tis but another word for <hi>Knowledge.</hi> For Truth of the Subject in this sense is the conformity of the Mind to Truth of the Object. And so also is Knowledge. To Know therefore, is to think of things conformally to their Simple Natures and Mutual Habitudes, or, as I first defined it, to <hi>Comprehend Truth.</hi>

                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>This being premised, That Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is nothing else but a Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension of Truth, that is, the having things in the <hi>Mind</hi> with the same Relations of Composition or Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as they stand mutually affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>themselves,</hi> I thus argue: That Being which Comprehends all Truth is Omniscient.</p>
                  <p>But God Comprehends all Truth.</p>
                  <p>Therefore God is Omniscient.</p>
                  <p>The first Proposition is plain from the Definition of Knowledge. The Conclusion therefore depends whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the proof of the Second; namely, that God comprehends all Truth.</p>

                  <p>Now for the Demonstration of this Proposition, I desire but this one <hi>Postulatum,</hi> that there are Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Necessary Truths, that is, that there are eternal and immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relations and Habitudes of things toward one another, by way of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation or Negation. This is what, I suppose, any body will give
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60055:45"/>
me for the <hi>asking,</hi> tho I have no great reason to be over-thankful for it, it being a thing so very unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionable, and withal a Proposition of this <hi>unlucky</hi> Quality, that 'tis as much establish'd by the Denial of it, as by the Affirming it. For should any Sceptical Person be so hardy as to say that there is no such thing as Eternal and Necessary Truth, I would ask him this Question: Was that Proposition always true, or was it not? If it was not always true, then there was once Eternal and Necessary Truth, and if once so; then ever so: But if it was always True, then by his own Confession, there is such a thing as Eternal and Necessary Truth. This therefore must be allow'd.</p>

                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <p>It being therefore supposed that there are Eternal and Necessary Truths, the next Proposition that I shall lay down is this, that the simple Essences of things must be also Eternal and Necessary. For the proof of which Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60055:45"/>
I consider first, that as Truth of the Subject depends upon, and necessarily supposes Truth of the Object, so Truth of the Object Complex depends upon, and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily supposes Truth of the Object Simple: That is in other Words, The Habitudes and Relations of Simple Essences, depend upon and necessarily suppose the Reality of their respective Simple Essences. As therefore there can be no such thing as Truth of the Subject, without Truth of the Object, to which it may be conformable; so neither can there be Truth of the Object Complex without Truth of the Object Simple, that is, there can be no mutual Habitudes or Relations of things as to Affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Negation, without the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the things themselves.</p>

               <div n="8" type="section">
                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>For I consider that these Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and Respects, as to Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Negation, wherein consists objective Truth Complex, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult from the Simple Essences, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60055:46"/>
can no more subsist by themselves than any other relations can; for the existence of which the Schools themselves make it necessary that they have their <hi>subject</hi> and <hi>term,</hi> upon the Position of which they immediately result, and upon the destruction of which they as imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately cease. As other relations therefore cannot subsist without the existence of <hi>subject</hi> and <hi>term,</hi> so nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can these habitudes as to Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or Negation, subsist without the real existence of the <hi>Essences</hi> themselves so related.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="9" type="section">
                  <head>IX.</head>
                  <p>But this perhaps will be better il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated by a particular Instance. Let then this be the objective Truth Complex, <hi>Two Circles touching one another inwardly cannot have the same common Centre.</hi> This is a true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position. But I here demand, How can it possibly have this certain ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude of Division or Negation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less there be two such distinct sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Essences as Circle and Centre. Certainly there can be no Reference
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60055:46"/>
or Relation where there is nothing real to support it.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="section">
                  <head>X.</head>
                  <p>This Point therefore being gain'd, That truth of the Object Complex depends upon, and necessarily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses truth of the Object Simple, and that there can be no mutual habitudes or relations of Essences, as to composition and divisition, without the Simple Essences them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: hence it will necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that whensoever the one does exist, the other must exist also; and consequently, if the one be Eternal, the other must be also Eternal. And thus (to recur to the former In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance) if this be a Proposition of Eternal Truth, <hi>viz. Two Circles touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another inwardly cannot have the same common Centre,</hi> then the two distinct Simple Essences of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Centre must have an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and necessary existence. The short is, there can be no connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or relation between things that are not, or that do not exist, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this or that habitude to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60055:47"/>
another thing, implies <hi>simple Being,</hi> and for one thing to be another, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers and supposes it <hi>to be simply.</hi> And if there can be no connexion or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between things that are not, then also there can be no <hi>Eternal</hi> connexion or relation between things that have not an <hi>Eternal</hi> Existence. For things cannot be related before they are. But there are such Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal habitudes and relations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the simple Essences of things are also Eternal. Which was the Proposition next to be proved.</p>

                  <p>I know very well this is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetic</hi> School, which has long since condemn'd it as Heretical Doctrine, to say, that the Essences of things do exist from Eternity. But I have Meditated much upon these things, and I must needs say, that I think it a very certain and very useful Theorem, and that 'tis utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to give an intelligible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the <hi>Stability</hi> of <hi>Science,</hi> or how there should be <hi>Propositions</hi> of

                  <p>I know they endeavour to do it by telling us (and 'tis the only Plea they have to offer) that these habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes are not attributed <hi>absolutely</hi> to the simple Essences as in actual being, but only <hi>Hypothetically,</hi> that whensoever they shall exist, they shall also carry such relations to one another. There is, says the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetic, only a <hi>conditional</hi> connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the Subject and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate, not an <hi>absolute</hi> position of either. This goes smoothly down with the young Scholar at his <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic Lecture,</hi> and the Tutor applauds his distinction, and thinks he has thereby quitted his hands of a very <hi>dangerous Heresie.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <head>XIII.</head>
                  <p>But now to this I return the same Answer (for I need give no other) that I have in my <hi>Metaphysical Essay.</hi>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60055:48"/>
First, I say, that these habitudes are not (as is supposed) only by way of Hypothesis, but absolutely attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the simple Essences, as actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally existing. For, when I say, for instance, that every part of a Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is equally distant from the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre; this Proposition does not hang in <hi>suspence,</hi> then to be actually ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifi'd when the things shall exist in <hi>Nature,</hi> but is at <hi>present</hi> actually true, as actually true as ever it will or can be; and consequently I may thence infer, that the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves already are. There is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, I confess, they should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ist in <hi>Nature,</hi> which is all that the Objection proves, but <hi>exist</hi> they must. For of nothing there can be no affection.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="14" type="section">
                  <head>XIV.</head>
                  <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Suppose I grant what the Objector would have, that these habitudes are not absolutely attributed to the simple Essences, but only by way of Hypothesis. Yet I don't see what he can gain by this concession. For certainly thus
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60055:48"/>
much at least is attributed to the simple Essences at <hi>present,</hi> that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever they <hi>shall</hi> exist, such and such habitudes will attend them. I say, thus much is attributed <hi>actually,</hi> and at <hi>present.</hi> But now let any Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetic of 'em all tell me how any thing can any way be said of that which is not. And besides, 'tis a weak evasion to say that things are not related thus or thus as actually existing, but only conditionally, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing their existence. For I deny that any thing can be any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated that does <hi>not actually exist.</hi> And 'tis as good as a contradiction to say otherwise. When therefore the Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patetick talks of a <hi>conditional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion</hi> between the Subject and the Predicate, and that neither is put <hi>absolutely,</hi> I say, that the connexion is as absolute as it can or ever will be, and that a non-existing subject cannot have any Predicate, or be any way related. And all this I bind upon him by a principle of his own, that <hi>of nothing there can be no affection.</hi> And let him unwind himself if he can.</p>

                  <head>XV.</head>
                  <p>Having thus far clear'd our way by making it evident, that the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Essences of things are Eternal. The next thing that I consider is, that since they are not Eternal in their <hi>Natural subsistencies,</hi> they must be Eternal in some other way of subsisting. And that must be in some understanding, or by way of <hi>Ideal subsistence.</hi>
                  </p>

               <div n="16" type="section">
                  <head>XVI.</head>
                  <p>For there are but two conceiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ways how any thing may exist, either <hi>out</hi> of all understanding, or <hi>within</hi> some understanding. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the simple Essences of things are Eternal, but not <hi>out</hi> of all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, it remains they must have an Eternal existence in some understanding. Which is what I call an <hi>Ideal subsistence.</hi> There is therefore another way of existing besides that in <hi>Rerum Natura,</hi> name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>Mundus Archetypus,</hi> or the Ideal World, where all the <hi>Rationes rerum,</hi> or simple Essences of things have an Eternal and Immutable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,

before ever they enter upon the Stage of Nature.</p>

                  <head>XVII.</head>
                  <p>I further consider, That this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding wherein the simple Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences of things have an Eternal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, must be an Eternal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. For an Essence can no more Eternally exist in a Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry understanding, than a Body can be infinitely extended in a finite space. Now this Eternal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing can be no other than the understanding of God. The sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Essences of things therefore do Eternally exist in the understanding of God.</p>

                  <head>XVIII.</head>
                  <p>But the mode of this must be further explain'd. For it being an unquestion'd Truth, that God is a simple and uncompounded Being; and consequently, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in God that is not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self: as the Schools also rightly have pronounc'd, We must not conceive these simple Essences as accidents in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering in God, or as Beings really
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60055:50"/>
distinct from God, this not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting with the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Divine Nature.</p>

                  <p>These simple Essences of things therefore can be nothing else but the Divine Essence it self consider'd with his Connotation, as variously representative or exhibitive of things, and as variously imitable or partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable by them. As the Divine Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence is thus or thus imitable or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takeable, so are the Essences of things distinguish'd <hi>specifically</hi> one from another; and according to the <hi>multifariousness</hi> of this Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, so are the <hi>possibilities</hi> of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

                  <p>And what if I should further say, that this Ideal World, this Essence of God consider'd as variously ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitive and representative of things, is no other than the Divine <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every Life first ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates its offspring within it self be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it does abroad without it self, and by how much the more excellent the Life is, by so much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to its self does it generate its offspring. So the vegetative life both in Trees and in Animals generates first the Seed, and the Animal within its own Body, before it casts forth either abroad. So the Sensitive, which is more excellent than the Vegetative life, brings forth by the fancy an Image or Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things in it self, before it moves the Members, and forms them in External Matter. But this first Birth of the fancy, because 'tis in the very Soul, is therefore nearer to the Soul than the Birth of the Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive life, which is not in the Soul, but in the Body. So again, the Rational life, which is more excellent than the Sensitive, brings forth in it self the Reason both of things, and of it self, as it were an offspring, before it brings it into the light, either by Speech or Action. This first Birth of Reason is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60055:52"/>
nearer to the Soul than the Birth of Fancy. For the Rational Power is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon its own Birth, and by that upon it self, by seeking, knowing, and loving its own act and it self, which is not done by the Fancy. So again, the Angelical life, which is more excellent than the Rational, brings forth in it self, by a kind of Divine Instinct, the Notions of it self and of things, before it discharges them upon the Matter of the World. This Birth is more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to an Angel, than Reason is to her, because 'tis neither derived from External Objects, nor changed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Divine life being the most eminent and fruitful of all, must needs generate an Offspring more like her self than any of the rest: and this it generates in it self by understanding, before it brings forth any thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. God therefore perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing himself, and in himself all things, he conceives in himself a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Notion of himself, and of all things, which is the equal and full Image of God, and the more than full Exemplar or Pattern of the World, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>Thus is this Notion of the Ideal World, or of the Essence of God, being variously exhibitive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative of the Essences of things, made use of by this <hi>great Theorist,</hi> to explain both the Nature of the Second Person of the Trinity, and the Mode of his Eternal Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

St. <hi>Iohn</hi> speaking of the second Person of the Trinity, says, <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God.</hi> He says also that all things were made by him, or according to him <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. And he further says that <hi>he is the true light, that lightens eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man that cometh into the world.</hi> Now what can this signifie but this <hi>Ideal World,</hi> or the Essence of God as variously exhibitive and represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of things?

                  <p>I have the longer insisted on this to shew not only the <hi>Truth</hi> of this <hi>Ideal World,</hi> and that the Essences of things have <hi>eternal</hi> Existence in it, but also how very <hi>useful</hi> this Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is for the Establishment of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of Christ, and for the expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his <hi>Eternal generation</hi> from the Father, which is also a further confirmation that the Notion is true and Solid.

                  <p>Hence also we may be instructed how to understand that common Axiom of the Schools, <hi>that the Truth of every thing is its confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Divine understanding.</hi> This must by no means be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:60055:55"/>
of the Mind of God as <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive,</hi> that is, as reflecting upon himself as Exhibitive, for the Truth of the Divine Intellect as <hi>Concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi> depends upon its conformity with the truth of things, not the truth of things upon that. But it must be meant of the Mind of God as <hi>Exhibitive,</hi> that is, of this <hi>Ideal World,</hi> for upon this all Truth depends, and every thing, and every Proposition is so far true as 'tis conformable with it. For indeed the Intellect of God, as <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitive</hi> is the <hi>Cause</hi> and <hi>Measure</hi> of <hi>all Truth.</hi>

                  <p>And, 'twas for want of the help of this Notion that that Keen Wit, <hi>Discartes</hi> blunder'd so horribly in stating the dependence of Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Eternal Truth, upon the Intellect of God. He saw it 'twas necessary (as indeed it is) to make God the cause of Truth, and that truth must some way or other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him. But then he makes it depend upon the Mind of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:60055:55"/>
God as <hi>Conceptive,</hi> and that things are so only because God is pleas'd so to conceive them. And this he carries so high, as to say, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a Triangle, three Angles would not have been equal to two Right ones, had not God been pleased so to conceive and make it. Now I am for the dependence of truth upon the Divine Intellect as well as he, but not so as to make it <hi>Arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Contingent,</hi> and Consequently not upon the Divine Intellect as <hi>Conceptive,</hi> but only as <hi>Exhibitive.</hi> That is, that things are therefore True in as much as they are conformable to those <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding</hi> and <hi>immutable Ideas,</hi> which are in the mind of God as Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and Representative of all the whole Possibility of Being.</p>

                  <head>XXXI.</head>
                  <p>Now if after all, this Ideal way of things subsisting from all Eternity in God, should seem strange (as I suppose it will to those who are unexercised in these Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) I shall only further say, First,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:60055:56"/>
that it must be infinitely more strange that there should be Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Truths, that is, Eternal Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Habitudes of simple Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or things, without the Co-eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal existence of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves so related. For what should support such Relations? The sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Essences therefore must exist eternally, if their Relations do? and where can that be but in the Mind of God?</p>
               </div>
               <div n="32" type="section">
                  <head>XXXII.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, I say that this Ideal way of subsisting, ought not to seem such a Bugbear as some make it, since 'tis necessary not only for the salving of Propositions of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Truth, before their Subjects exist in Nature, but even when they do. For even while things have a Natural subsistence, the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning them are not, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be verifi'd according to their <hi>Natural,</hi> but according to their <hi>Ideal</hi> subsistencies. Thus we demonstrate several Propositions concerning a Right Line, a Circle, &amp;c. when yet
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:60055:56"/>
in the mean time 'tis most certain, that none of these are to be found in Nature, according to that exactness supposed in our Demonstration. Such and such Affections therefoe do not belong to them, as they are in <hi>Nature,</hi> and therefore they must belong to them as they are in the <hi>Ideal World,</hi> or not at all.</p>

               <div n="33" type="section">
                  <head>XXXIII.</head>
                  <p>And if this be true in Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whose Subjects exist in Nature, much more is it in Eternal Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, whose simple Essences have not always a Natural existence. These can no otherwise stand, but by supposing the Co-eternal existence of Simple Essences in the Ideal World.</p>

                  <p>I shall add but this one Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration more upon this Head, that there is no greater sign of the soundness of a Truth, than when its profest Adversaries do unawares fall in with it. And this I take to be the case here. The Schoolmen who stand devoted to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:60055:57"/>
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> do notwithstanding by a kind of <hi>blind Parturiency,</hi> light oftentimes upon such Notions, which if thoroughly sifted must needs come to the same with what we have hitherto contended for. For I would fain know what they can mean else by the celebrated <hi>Glass</hi> of the <hi>Divinity</hi>? What can this be but the <hi>Ideal World</hi> representing all the Essences of things? And what else can they mean when they say (as they commonly do) of <hi>Science,</hi> that it is not of <hi>Singulars,</hi> as being flux Temporary, mutable and contingent, but of <hi>Abstract</hi> and <hi>Vniversal</hi> Natures? What is this but in other words to confess the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Eternal Essences or Ideas existing out of and before those Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulars whose Essences they are, in order to the salving the <hi>stability</hi> of <hi>Science</hi>? Thus do these Men stumble upon Truth blindfold, but not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her through he veil, they let her go again.</p>

                  <head>XXXV.</head>
                  <p>Nay, even <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself after all his zealous opposition of <hi>Plato</hi>'s Ideas has in the fourth of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphysics come about to him again, and cross'd the very Road which he studied so carefully to avoid. For discoursing against the <hi>Sceptics</hi> who allow'd no certainty of Science, he first shews the ground of their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to consist in this, that they thought <hi>Singulars</hi> and <hi>Sensibles</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isting without, to be the only Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Science. His words are, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>The Original of these Mens mistake was this, because Truth is to be lookt for in things, and they conceiv'd the only things to be Sensibles, in which it is certain there is much of the Indeterminate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore they perceiving all the Nature of Sensibles to be moveable, or in perpetual flux and mutation, since nothing can possibly be verified or constantly affirm'd concerning that which is not the same, but changeable, concluded that there could be no Truth
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:60055:58"/>
at all, nor certainly of Science. Those things which are the only objects of it, never continuing the same.</hi>

                  <p>Thus having open'd the grounds of this Sceptical Doctrine, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, he thus adds, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>we would have these Men therefore to know, that there is another kind of Essence of things, besides that of Sensibles, to which belongeh, neither motion, nor corruption, nor any generation at all.</hi>

                  <p>Observe here, that <hi>Aristotle</hi> does not deny the <hi>Consequence</hi> of the <hi>Sceptic</hi>'s Argument. No, he allows if the Essences of things are not steddy and immutable, that there can be no certainty of Science. But he denys his <hi>minor Proposition,</hi> and tells him that he goes upon a wrong Hypothesis, in supposing that there are no other Essences of things but Singulars and Sensibles, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to which he says, that there are other Essences of things
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:60055:58"/>
which are immovable, incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and in generable. And that 'tis upon these that all Science is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Now who would desire a better Establishment of <hi>Platonic I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas,</hi> than what <hi>Aristotle</hi> himself has here given? Let any Intelligent Person judge whether this be not a plain giving up the cause. So hard is it for a Man not to contradict <hi>himself,</hi> when once he comes to contradict <hi>Truth.</hi>

                  <head>XXXVIII.</head>
                  <p>It being now from the Premises sufficiently concluded, that the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas or Simple Essences of things have an Eternal existence in God, and the manner of this their exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence being sufficiently explain'd, the next advance of my Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation is this, that since all the Simple Essences of things do exist in the mind of God, <hi>there</hi> must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so be the Repository of all their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Habitudes and Respects, these naturally arising from the other, by way of Natural Result. For as the Relations of Essences cannot exist
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:60055:59"/>
without the Essences themselves, so neither can the Essences exist with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being accompany'd with such their Essential Relations. And as before we argued from the Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Habitudes to the Position of the Simple Essences, so now we may as well argue from the Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Simple Essences to the Position of their Habitudes.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="39" type="section">
                  <head>XXXIX.</head>
                  <p>Thus for instance, as from this Eternal Habitude, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Circle of such a determinate Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence will have such a determinate Diameter, I may conclude, that the Essence of such a Circle does eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally exist, so again supposing such a Circle to exist, 'tis as necessary it should retain such a <hi>Diameter.</hi> And so in all other instances, the Essence argues and infers the Habitude, as well as the Habitude does the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence. For 'tis here as in all other Relations which immediately result upon the position of the <hi>Subject</hi> and <hi>Term.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>This admitted, I now consider that there is now nothing wanting to infer the Omnisciency of God. For since the simple Essences of things do all exist in God, and since these are ever accompany'd with all their Habitudes and Relations, and since these are nothing else but <hi>Truth,</hi> it follows that all Truth is in God. I say God comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding within himself all the Ideas and Essences of things with all their possible references and Respects, comprehends <hi>all Truth,</hi> the whole <hi>field</hi> of Truth within himself, which is the same as to be <hi>Omniscient,</hi> Knowledge being nothing else but a <hi>Comprehension of Truth,</hi> as was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore defined.</p>

                  <p>The Omnipresence of God has been more question'd than any one of his Attributes, both among the <hi>Antients,</hi> and among the <hi>Moderns. Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Metaphysics</hi> says that the first Mover must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be either in the <hi>Centre,</hi> or in the <hi>Circle</hi> or <hi>Circumference.</hi> That is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, either in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Earth, or in the Extreme Heaven. And the latter has by most of the old Philosophers been
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60055:61"/>
assign'd for his Residence. In the <hi>Church,</hi> the more Antient <hi>Iews</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd him to the Temple of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi> And of late years this Doctrine of the Partial and limited Presence of God has been renew'd by <hi>Vorstius,</hi> Professour of Divinity at <hi>Leyden,</hi> who asserts that God is only in Heaven as to his Essence, and elsewhere only in respect of his Wisdom, Power and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>

                  <p>But that God is every where Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially Present, both in every part of the World, and also in all <hi>Extra mundan</hi> Spaces, is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from the very Idea of God. 'Tis impossible that Being it self should be excluded from any part of Being. For every part of Being partakes of, and subsists in and by Being it self.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:60055:61"/>
Being as the Act of it, and to exist indeterminately is the same as to be Omnipresent. God therefore who is Being it self, is also an Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Being.</p>

                  <p>Cncerning the manner of this Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onipresence of God I think I may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determine that he is every where present, not only <hi>Vertually</hi> and <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficaciously</hi> by his Wisdom and Power, but also <hi>Substantially</hi> and <hi>Essentially.</hi> For Power and Wisdom is not any thing really different from the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God.

'Tis a consideration, this, That if well heeded, and attended to, would give a <hi>Law</hi> to our privacies and retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, compose the <hi>inmost recesses</hi> of our Minds, and not suffer a Thought or Passion to rebel.

For, indeed, to him that considers God as every where pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and a strict observer of him and his actions, every place is a <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and accordingly he will put off his Shooes from his Feet, cleanse and purifie his affections, because the place whereon he stands is <hi>Holy Ground.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus advantagious is the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of these two Considerations to good life in general; as for their special usefulness to Devotion, we may hence collect, <hi>First,</hi> That we ought to have our Minds always in a Divine Frame and Temper, and always composed with the greatest Awefulness and Reverence, Serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Gravity and <hi>Silence</hi> of Spirit, as being ever in the Presence, and under the direct Inspection of the Great God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That we ought to pray to him with all Humility and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, both of Soul and Body, and with an humble confidence of being heard by him where-ever we are, or however we deliver our

selves, whether by <hi>Vocal</hi> or <hi>Mental</hi> Prayer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That we ought in our Prayers to use great fixedness and attention of Mind, without any wandrings, or impertinent mixtures of foreign thoughts, which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more ready to croud into our Minds, than when we are at our Devotions, and yet are never so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd as then.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That we ever commend our Cause to God, who sees and knows all things, and be well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfi'd with his Judgment and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, when ever our Innocence is falsly charged by the World.</p>
                  <p>And, <hi>Lastly,</hi> That we ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to repine, or be discontented at the Affairs of the World, but rather trust and rely upon the All-wise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of him who sees from end to end, knows how to bring Light out of Darkness, and disposes all things sweetly.</p>

If I climb up into Heaven, thou art there, If I go down to Hell, thou art there also. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and remain in the uttermost parts of the Sea, even there also shall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand shall hold me. If I say, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture the Darkness shall cover me, then shall my Night be turn'd to Day.

The first of these I call Possible, the second I call Impossible. Possible, therefore in this sense, is the same as that which involves no repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.

                  <p>This <hi>Iustice</hi> of God is the same in the <hi>moral</hi> World, as <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi> is in the <hi>Natural.</hi> 'Tis gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to every thing its due place and station, and disposing it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its Nature and Condition. For as the Beauty of the <hi>Natural</hi> World arises from <hi>Proportion,</hi> so does the Beauty of the <hi>Moral</hi> World arise also from due <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>; and as God has strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd this Rule in the <hi>making</hi> of the World, having made all things in Number, Weight and Measure, so we may be sure he proceeds by the same Standard in the <hi>Government</hi> and conduct of it, though the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness of this latter is not so obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to our observation, as that of the former, nor are we so well able to judge of the <hi>Moral,</hi> as of the <hi>Natural Geometry</hi> of God.</p>

                  <p>Now that God is thus Just, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acting according to true <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Proportion,</hi> may sufficiently be made out from this single Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:60055:70"/>
All Order and Proportion (as every one I suppose will readily grant) is, in it self consider'd, love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and desirable. If so, then it cannot be nill'd or refused for it self, or as such. If so, then whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it is refused, it must be refused for the sake of some other greater good. If so, then this other grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter good must be, either the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interest of the Refuser, or some other Private Interest, or the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Interest. But neihter of these can here find any admission. It cannot be for the Private Interest of the Refuser, who is here supposed to be a Being absolutely Perfect; and consequently not capable of proposing to himself any self-end. And cannot be for the Publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, for the greatest Interest of the Publick consists <hi>in Order</hi> and <hi>Proportion.</hi> Neither can this Order be violated for the Interest of any other Private Person, because that is not a greater, but on the contrary, an infinitely less good, Order and Proportion being the good of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60055:70"/>
Publick, which is always greater than any Private whatsoever. Since therefore Order and Proportion cannot be violated by God for any of these ends, nor for its own sake, it being <hi>as such</hi> lovely and desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as was supposed, it follows that Order and Proportion cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be violated by God at all, and consequently 'tis necessary that God should always effectually Will <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Proportion,</hi> which is the same as to be <hi>Iust.</hi>

                  <p>By this Justice, or Will of follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Order and Proportion, God stands ingaged not to punish an Innocent Creature, or to afflict him with any evil greater than that good which he has conferr'd upon him: Within that compass indeed he may, for that is only to deduct from that Happiness, every degree of which was a free favour. But he cannot impose the least grain or scruple of evil upon him beyond the good conferr'd, without some demerit of the Creature. Much
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:60055:71"/>
less will this Justice of God permit that he should predetermin an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Creature, without respect to any Crime, meerly for his own will and pleasure, to everlasting mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery. He that can make this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with God's Justice, or any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in the World, had need be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good <hi>Reconciler.</hi>

                  <p>But now whether God's Justice obliges him <hi>to punish</hi> the <hi>Sinner,</hi> as well as <hi>not to punish the Innocent,</hi> is a thing that will admit of more questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This has been argued with great Contention between some Schools, and is too disputable to be posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively determined. For my part I am more inclined to think that the Nature of God obliges him to punish sin some where or other, and that <hi>vindicative Iustice</hi> is <hi>Essential</hi> to him.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <p>That it is so far Essential to him that he cannot but punish an <hi>impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent</hi> Sinner, few I believe will question. For nothing in the World
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:60055:71"/>
can be imagined more against Order and Proportion than that a Sinner should be <hi>pardon'd</hi> without <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> But further, 'tis highly <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable</hi> that sin could not have been, pardon'd even <hi>with</hi> Repentance, had there not also been <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made to God for it. 'Tis plain <hi>de facto,</hi> that God <hi>would not</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit sin without satisfaction, and that too the highest imaginable: Which makes it very probable that he <hi>could</hi> not. For is it reasonable to think that God would deliver up his only and beloved Son to that <hi>bitter dispensation,</hi> if, with the safety of his Justice, he could have pardon'd us, meerly for our <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> without such a costly <hi>sacrifice?</hi> And that he could not, does not that Prayer of our Saviour argue, which he used in his Agony? <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:</hi> Which is as much as if he had said, <hi>Father if the sin of Man may be remitted any other way than by way of suffering, I desire I may not suffer.</hi> This I think is the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:60055:72"/>
Obvious sense of the Words. But this Prayer of his, was not gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the removal of the Cup, and may I not thence conclude that 'twas impossible it should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved?</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <p>And I further consider that God necessarily hates sin with an infinite hatred, as a thing that is diametrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly opposite to his own Essential sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to those great Ends which he cannot but propose in the regulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the universe. But how he should thus hate it, and yet not shew this his hatred by punishing it, is not easie to conceive. And besides, it seems agreeable to the Laws of Order and Proportion, that so great a <hi>Dis-harmony</hi> as <hi>Sin,</hi> should never go <hi>wholly</hi> unpunish'd, but that the Publick happiness, of which Sin is a <hi>violation,</hi> should be both <hi>repair'd,</hi> and <hi>secured</hi> by the exaction of <hi>some</hi> satisfaction.</p>

                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>If it be said, that every one may remit as much as he please from his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:60055:72"/>
own Right, and that then much more may God. I answer, that Right, is either Right of <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> or Right of <hi>Office.</hi> From Right of Dominion, when alone, no doubt any person may remit what he pleases, but not from Right of Office, or from Right of Dominion, when joyn'd with Right of Office. Now there is great reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the exacting of Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for sin, is not in God a Right of Dominion only, but also a Right of Office; that is, that God does not punish only as <hi>supreme Lord,</hi> but as a <hi>Iudge</hi>; and as a <hi>Iudge,</hi> 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous to suppose that he may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to punish. Obliged, not by any Law or Power superiour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but by the Essential Rectitude of his own Nature and Will: Which by obliging him to regard the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Order and Interest, may by consequence oblige him to animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert upon those who transgress against it.</p>

of God's goodness to Man may be distributed into these two Kinds in general, <hi>Giving</hi> and <hi>Forgiving.</hi> Those of giving again are of two sorts: Either such as are to be conferr'd upon us after our Work is done, by which I understand the Rewards of Heaven, or such as are given us by way of Earnest, or Anticipation.</p>

                  <head>X.</head>
                  <p>I begin with the last of these, where the first thing that offers it self to our consideration is the <hi>Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Being</hi>; which I do not understand as it is generally taken in the Schools, namely, For naked and abstract Existence, For thus to <hi>Be</hi> Absolutely has no manner of intrinsic good in it, but is only a Foundation or Capacity of a good or evil State Indifferently. And this methinks is so very plain, that I should much wonder how so many Metaphysical Heads could espouse the contrary, were it not found to be a convenient Device for the Maintenance of that absurd Paradox, <hi>that 'tis better to Be, tho in Extreme Misery, than not to be</hi>;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:60055:79"/>
which Proposition was also intended for the support of another, every whit as absurd, <hi>viz.</hi> That God may consistently with his Goodness and Justice, inflict eternal Misery upon an Innocent Creature. For since he may (as all grant) Annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late an Innocent Creature, 'twill follow that he may with less appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Injustice, inflict on him eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Misery, Annihilation (according to these mens Metaphysics) being the greater evil of the two. And that for this notable Reason, because he that <hi>is,</hi> tho never so miserable, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys some good, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence, whereas he that is not, has none at all.</p>

                  <p>But now, besides that the good of Simple being, may be outweigh'd by Super-induced evils, and that then to <hi>Be</hi> all consider'd, would not be good but evil, as I could easily shew were it my present concern further to ingage in that Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie; I say, besides this, I do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Truth of the first Assertion,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:60055:79"/>
that to be has any intrinsic good in it. And therefore when I begin the Catalogue of the Divine Favours, with the Collation of our Being, I do not understand by the Phrase meerly our being brought into Act indefinitely (existence as such inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neither good nor evil in it) but our being made such certain Essences or Natures, consisting of such Powers and Faculties as are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to constitute such an Order of Beings as according to such a Mode of Imitability or Idea, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in the Divine Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and which we distinguish by the Name of Mankind.</p>

                  <p>Now the Nature of Man involves much good and perfection in it, and consequently for God to give it Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence is an Act of <hi>Goodness</hi> as well as of <hi>Power.</hi> For tho there be (as I suppose) little or no deference to be paid to that popular Argument, which would derive an Obligation of gratitude upon Children toward their Parents, from their receiving
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:60055:80"/>
their Being from them, because there is no kindness here design'd to those Persons who in the <hi>Event</hi> (perhaps) are <hi>profited,</hi> but before were not so much as <hi>known</hi>; yet our case is quite otherwise, as to our receiving our Being from the Father of Spirits. For he both knew whom he was to oblige, when he gave us Being, and <hi>intended</hi> it as a kindness to <hi>us,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Interest of his own to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote by it.

                  <p>Now both these Requisites being eminently found in God, it follows that his Kindness in giving us Being, receives its Estimate from the value and excellency of the thing bestow'd, which cannot appear little if we consider, that such was the Dignity and Excellency of Humane Nature, that it occasion'd <hi>deliberation</hi> in Heaven, and was thought worthy of the <hi>Council</hi> of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> If we consider, that Man is the most

Noble part of all the visible Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Abstract and Compendium of the Universe. That he is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture form'd after the Image of the Great God, endow'd with an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and immortal Spirit, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling his Maker, as in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, so in some measure in this, that he can and must needs be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py both in the <hi>direct</hi> Operations of his Nature, and in the <hi>reflexive</hi> acts of Contemplation upon the dignity of his Essence. To give therefore Being to such an accomplish'd Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this, is <hi>ipso facto,</hi> without Consideration of any further design, a very signal act of Love and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence.</p>

                  <p>Another very signal instance of the Divine Goodness to Man is our <hi>Preservation,</hi> whether we consider it in the more Metaphysical way of the Schools, as that uninterrupted Influx, which they call Continued Creation, whereon we depend as Essentially as the Image in the Glass does upon the Object; or whether
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:60055:81"/>
we consider it after the more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar acceptation, as it denotes the Conduct and Superintendency of God's Providence, whereby he so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses of the Events and Issues of things as either to keep off from us what would incommode our wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, or to work out a more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant good from those evils which he suffers to befal us.</p>

                  <head>The use of this to Devotion.</head>
                  <p>HAving now <hi>tasted and seen</hi> in some Measure how <hi>good and gracious</hi> the <hi>Lord is,</hi> let us now apply this speculation to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of Devotion. This I shall do, First, by considering what may be collected to this purpose from the Goodness of God in General; Secondly, by the shewing how the several Instances of the Divine Goodness point out to us the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of several Devotional vertues. And first since God is so <hi>good a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and so good to <hi>Man,</hi> 'twill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us in the first place to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish all superstitious slavish Fears and jealous apprehensions of him, considering that 'tis more for the Honour, and more according to the Will of so Good a Being, to be <hi>heartily loved,</hi> than <hi>servilely fear'd,</hi> and that 'tis <hi>Love</hi> and not <hi>Fear</hi> that has the Honour to fulfil the whole Law.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="153" facs="tcp:60055:85"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> God being so Good, and having shewn so much Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to us, 'twill highly become us in the next place to acknowledge this his Goodness by all the ways we can, especially by these Three, <hi>Praying to him, Depending on him, and Praising him.</hi> By every one of these, we acknowledge God's Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, either directly, or by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but most of all by the <hi>last,</hi> which ought therefore to be principally regarded. This I the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take notice of, because 'tis a thing wherein we are generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, for we are all apt to be more zealously affected in our <hi>petitionary Prayers,</hi> than in our <hi>giving Thanks.</hi> And the reason, I suppose, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause our <hi>Prayers</hi> are for <hi>our selves,</hi> but <hi>giving Thanks</hi> is to <hi>God.</hi> But certainly this is a great fault, and proceeds from that root of all evil, <hi>self-love</hi>; we ought rather to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress our selves to God with more Application and Devotion in our <hi>Praises</hi> than in our <hi>Prayers.</hi> For he that Praises, glorifies God more
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60055:86"/>
than he that Prays; for he that Prays, does only hope that God <hi>will</hi> be good to him, but he that Praises, does <hi>actually</hi> acknowledge that he is already so. There is more excellence in <hi>Praise</hi> than we are commonly aware of. To <hi>Believe, Pray</hi> and <hi>Trust</hi> is the work of Earth, but to <hi>Adore</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> is the work of Heaven. But not so as to be reserv'd till we come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No, we must begin it here, or we shall never do it hereafter. 'Tis the only retribution God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects from us for all his Goodness, to be blessed for his Blessings; and unless we do this, we shall be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the highest injustice and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude imaginable, and of such a vileness, as all the <hi>Praying</hi> in the World will never countervail.</p>
                  <p>But as we are obliged to act thus from God's Goodness in general, so the several Instances of the Divine Goodness point out to us the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of several Devotional Vertues. For example, when a Man consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders God as the Author and Preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

he has a goodly Heritage, what is more naturally to be inferred than that he offer up to God the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Thanksgiving, for all the Methods, Conveyances and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Bounty, and that he trust his Providential care for his fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maintainance.

                  <p>IN Man, as thus consider'd, I find these four things involv'd, First, That he was once Nothing. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That from Nothing he became Something. Thirdly, That he was made Something, and is what he is by and from God. Fourthly, That he so depends upon Gods continual Influence for the continuation of that Being which he receiv'd from him, that should God but never so little withdraw it, he must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall back into his first Nothing.</p>

                  <head>II.</head>
                  <p>First, then I consider that Man was once Nothing, which is the same as to say, That once he was
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:60055:91"/>
not, or that he was not always. This is too acknowledg'd a Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to need any <hi>laborious</hi> Proof, but however for satisfaction sake, I thus demonstrate it. If Man were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways he would be a necessary Being. For since every thing is necessary while it is, and since there is no assignable Point of Duration wherein that which always is, is not, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that if man were always, he would be a necessary Being. But now that Man is not a necessary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I prove thus.</p>

                  <p>Man has not his Being from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but from some other Being; For if he had it from himself, he would never have limited his own Being, and consequently would have had all other Perfections as well as Existence. But that he has not is plain, because he is an <hi>Amorous</hi> and <hi>Desiring</hi> Being, and is continually reaching out and aspiring to some further Excellence, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Argument of <hi>Indigency.</hi> Whence it follows that he had not Being from himself.</p>

                  <p>He must therefore have it from some other Being, that is, He must therefore exist, because some other Being will have him to exist. If then the Ground and Reason of mans existing be the Will and Pleasure of some other Being, then Man must so far exist necessarily, as 'tis neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that that other Being should will his existence. Since the necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Effect depends upon the necessity of the Cause: To shew therefore that Man does not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily exist, 'twill be enough to shew that 'tis not necessary that any such Being should will his Existence; which I do thus.</p>

                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>'Tis not necessary that any Being should effectually will that which is not necessarily Lovely. But Man is not necessarily Lovely; therefore 'tis not necessary that any Being should effectually will the Being of Man. The first Proposition is Self-evident. The second will be made so, by considering that necessary
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:60055:92"/>
Loveliness is the highest degree of Loveliness, and the highest degree of Loveliness, supposes the highest degree of Excellence; that which is <hi>lovely</hi> in the highest degree, must be <hi>excellent</hi> in the highest degree, every thing being lovely so far as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. But now man is not Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in the highest degree, because he aspires to higher excellence (as was said before) and therefore neither is he Lovely in the highest degree, and therefore not Necessarily Love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Which was the Minor Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Conclusion therefore fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that 'tis not necessary that any Being should effectually will the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Man. And therefore also 'tis not necessary that Man should exist, the reason of Mans existing being founded upon the will of some other Being, as was supposed. And if Man does not exist <hi>necessarily,</hi> then he did not exist <hi>always</hi>; and if not <hi>always,</hi> then once he was not, which was the thing to be here made out.</p>

                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <p>The next thing to be consider'd is that Man became Something from Nothing: Which is the same as to say that he was not made out of any Pre-existent Matter or Substance. This, tho it be more strictly veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd of the <hi>Soul</hi> of Man, which in no sense was raised into being from any pre-existent substance, but came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Nothing to be what it is, yet it is also verify'd to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purposes in respect of his <hi>Body,</hi> which tho it be not <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> from Nothing as the Soul is, yet <hi>Mediately</hi> it is, it being form'd not from matter eternally Pre-exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but from Matter which once was Nothing, it being impossible that there should be any eternally pre-existing matter, or that Matter should always have been, for the very same Reason that Man could not have been always; which having al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready set down, I shall not again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it.</p>

                  <p>The third thing involv'd in Mans
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:60055:93"/>
being a Creature, is that he was made something, and is what he is by and from God. This will be thus Demonstrated. All Being is either Being <hi>Essentially,</hi> that is, Being it self, or Being by <hi>Participation.</hi> Now Being it self is God, as has been shewn before: And there can be but one Being it self, as was also shewn before. Therefore all Beings besides this one Being it self, besides God, are Beings by <hi>Participation.</hi> Now whatever is in any thing by Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation, is caused in it by that to which it Essentially belongs. Man therefore being a Being by Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, must necessarily be from and by Being it self; that is, from and by God.</p>

                  <p>Should it be here Objected that Nothing hinders, but that a thing may be found without that which is not of the Reason or Essence of it, as a Man suppose without Learning. And that this Habitude of being caused by Being it self, or God is not of the essence of Beings, because
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:60055:93"/>
they may be conceiv'd without it. And that therefore nothing hinders but that there may be some Beings that are not from God. To this I answer, That tho this Habitude does not make any part of the Idea or Essence of those beings which are caused, yet it is necessarily conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to it. For to be a Being by Participation does as much vertually involve its being caused, as a Trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle involves this Affection, that any two sides of it taken together are greater than the third. So that such a Being can no more exist without being <hi>caused,</hi> than a Triangle can exist without this Affection. But whereas the Habitude of being cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is not of the Reason of <hi>Being Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, or as such,</hi> therefore there is a <hi>Certain</hi> Being that is not caused, which is God.</p>

                  <p>The same Conclusion, that Man has his Being from God, may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proved from this Consideration, that none can possibly Create but God, The truth of which Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:60055:94"/>
is generally founded upon the Distance that is between Being and not Being, which they say is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, and therefore it must require an Infinite Power to educe a thing from one to the other. But this is an obscure way of arguing, and I must profess that I do not so clearly understand it as to be satisfy'd whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be conclusive or no; and therefore I shall rather chuse to say, that the most universal effect must have the most universal cause. But now among all Effects, to make a thing to <hi>be Simply</hi> is the most Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal. And this is <hi>Creation,</hi> which implies not only a production of this or that Being, or of a Being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this or that Nature or Quality, (for this is also done in <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> and <hi>Alteration</hi>) but also of Being Absolutely: For the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Terms of Creation are from <hi>not being</hi> to <hi>be,</hi> and then afterwards comes in to be <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that, thus</hi> or <hi>thus.</hi> Creation therefore is the most Universal Effect that is, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it must be reduced into the
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:60055:94"/>
most Universal Cause that is, which is God. Therefore God only can Create, therefore all Creatures are from God, and consequently Man receives his Being from no other but God.</p>

               <div n="10" type="section">
                  <head>X.</head>
                  <p>'Tis now further to be consider'd, that as man receives his being from God, so he depends upon God's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual influence for the continuation of it, insomuch, that should God never so little withdraw it, he must necessarily fall back into his First Nothing. For besides, that to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in being is as much an <hi>Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Effect</hi> as to make to be, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently must be resolv'd into the same Universal Cause, which is God. I further consider, that Being by Participation is wholly and intirely from Being it self. Now every Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect depends upon its Cause as far as it is its Cause. If a Partial Cause, then it depends upon it Partially, if an Intire Cause, than it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it Intirely. Since therefore Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Participation is wholly and
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:60055:95"/>
intirely from Being it self, it follows that it must depend wholly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely upon it, and if so, then it must depend upon it for every minute of its Existence, as well as for the very first Instant of it; otherwise it would not depend upon it wholly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely (as is supposed) there being something in reference to which it would be Independent.</p>

I say, it does no way fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that because we existed a little before, we shall therefore exist now; or that because of our existing now, we shall exist afterwards, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no necessary Connexion between the Moments themselves, whereof our Duration is made up. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we do exist in several Instants or <hi>Nows</hi> of Time, this must be from
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:60055:95"/>
some Cause which conserves us, and as it were gives us being in every one of those <hi>Nows</hi> or <hi>Moments.</hi> But this cannot be our selves, first, for the reason alledg'd by <hi>Cartesius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are not <hi>Conscious</hi> of any such Power, which undoubtedly we should be, if we had it. And Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because we might then have given our selves the <hi>First Now</hi> or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of existence as well as any of the <hi>Rest.</hi> For the First Now of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence differs no otherwise from any of the rest but only as to <hi>Novitas Essendi,</hi> or the <hi>Newness</hi> of <hi>existing,</hi> which is only an extrinsical Relation, and such as adds nothing to the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty or greatness of the Effect; which being the same on both hands, the Cause must also be of equal Force and Vertue. But we could not give Being to our selves (as was before proved) and therefore neither are we able to Conserve our selves in being. The Cause therefore by which we are Conserv'd in being, must be the same which gave us Being, that is, God; without whose continued In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence

And so 'tis with us, we are not only at first brought into being by God, but do also all along so depend upon his Influence for the carrying on our being through the several Distinct Moments of time, that should this Influence but never so little be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn or intercepted, we should immediately sink down into our <hi>First Nothing.</hi>

Here therefore I shall shew, <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>Kinds</hi> of human Knowledge; <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> the <hi>Mode</hi> of it.

Truth, so many ways he may be said to know. Now a Man may comprehend Truth, either as to <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Essences,</hi> or as to their <hi>Complex Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitudes,</hi> or as to the <hi>Dependence</hi> that is between one Habitude and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The first of these is what we usually call Apprehension, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is what we call Judgment, and the last is what we call Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Thus we are authorized to speak by the Schools, who ascribe Judgment and Discourse to the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding; tho' I am rather of Monsieur <hi>Malebranche</hi> his mind,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>De inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend. verit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 2.</note> that there is no other Operation of the <hi>Intellect</hi> but only <hi>Perception,</hi> and that Judgment and Discourse more properly belong to the <hi>Will,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an embracing of, and an adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to Truth. But then, withal, it must be acknowledg'd, that there is a threefold Perception. One whereby I perceive a simple Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, without any relation which may be call'd a simple Perception. Another, when I perceive the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of simple Essences, which may
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:60055:101"/>
be called a Judicial Perception. And a third, when I perceive the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is between those relations, which may be call'd a Rational Perception. This is the whole La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and full Compass of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect, and that which belongs to Intellect in common, whether Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or Divine.</p>

                  <p>For I think it no absurdity to say, that in this sense God has <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>Discourse.</hi> For 'tis most certain that he does not only perceive the simple Essences of things, and their relations, but also the relation that is between those relations. Only there is this difference, that God perceives all this at once, with one intire simple view; whereas Man is fain to <hi>open his prospect</hi> by degrees, by advancing step by step from one proposition to another in the <hi>field</hi> of Truth. Which, tho' it has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to it self the name of <hi>Reason,</hi> yet I think it does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>nature</hi> of Reason in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> but is rather an <hi>accidental de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi>

of it, such as proceeds from the <hi>narrowness</hi> of <hi>created,</hi> or of such or <hi>such</hi> created Capacities. This must not therefore be made necessary to <hi>Reason</hi> (that being sufficiently salv'd in perceiving the relation that is between the Habitudes of things) but only to <hi>human Reason.</hi>

                  <p>And thus much as to the <hi>Kinds</hi> of human Knowledge. I come now to explain the <hi>Mode</hi> of it, by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how Man understands. This perhaps will appear a desperate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking at first sight, but I think the difficulty proceeds more from the prejudices of our Education than from the remoteness of the Theory. For were we not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise prepossest from the Principles of the vulgar Philosophy, what would be more familiar and obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than to conclude that we see and know all things in <hi>God?</hi> This is a Notion which I very early light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, by the <hi>Natural Parturiency</hi> of my own mind, before I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted with any Authors that might
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:60055:102"/>
imbue me with it. But afterwards I met with some that <hi>confirm'd</hi> me in it.

I shall therefore, for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Argument, first give a short and summary account of what that excellent Person has meditated upon it, and then subjoin some fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther considerations of my own to the same purpose.</p>

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:60055:102"/>
by themselves, but by the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Ideas.</hi> This Proposition is most unquestionable, taking Ideas in a large signification for Images or Representations of things. For things that are perceiv'd must be some way or other Present to the Soul, either by <hi>themselves</hi> or by the <hi>Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi> And since they are not by themselves, they must by their Ideas.

                  <p>This premised, he thus proceeds. It is therefore necessary that these Ideas which we have of Objects without, should either proceed from those Objects: Or that our Mind has a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Producing those Ideas. Or that God should produce them with the Mind when he creates it, or that he should produce them as often as we think of any Object. Or that our Mind should possess in it self all the Perfections which it sees in things. Or lastly, that it be united to some Absolutely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:60055:103"/>
Being, that includes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self all the Perfections of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Beings. By one of these ways we must necessarily perceive what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we perceive.</p>

                  <p>The first is according to the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Philosopy, which teaches that external Objects send forth certain Species like themselves, and that these Species are carried by the external Senses to the <hi>common Sensory,</hi> and that then they are resined, and spritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alized by the help of that which they call <hi>Intellectus Agens,</hi> and so become <hi>Intelligible,</hi> then are receiv'd into the <hi>Intellectus Passivus,</hi> and then are <hi>actually understood.</hi> This certainly is either very profound sense, or very profound nonsense, one of the two, and is rather like the <hi>Anatomical</hi> Account how the <hi>Chyle</hi> is turn'd into <hi>Blood,</hi> than like a <hi>Metaphysical</hi> account of the <hi>way of understanding.</hi> But that this Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis cannot be true, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor shews from the impossibility of Objects sending sorth such Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:60055:103"/>
which he proves first from the <hi>Impenetrability</hi> of <hi>Bodies.</hi> Which must needs hinder that these Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which are nothing else but <hi>Corporeal effluvias,</hi> should possess the <hi>same Vbi,</hi> which yet must be, if, by them Objects are render'd visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because the whole Medium, and every part of it, must be supposed full of them.</p>

                  <p>This he proves, Secondly, from the <hi>change</hi> or <hi>variation</hi> of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. For 'tis most certain, that the nearer the Object, the greater it shews. But now what should after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards diminish this Species, and what is become of those parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it consisted, when it appear'd greater? And what is it that so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly augments it, when 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held through a <hi>Telescope</hi>?</p>

                  <p>The same he proves further from the consideration of a <hi>perfect Cube,</hi> all the <hi>Species</hi> of whose sides are unequal, and yet the <hi>sides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi> are equally square. And Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:60055:104"/>
he sensures it as an unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable supposition, that a Body should continually send forth Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies every where, so as to fill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Point of such vast spaces, and yet not be <hi>sensibly</hi> diminish'd.

                  <p>The second is, that our Mind has a Power of Producing these Ideas. This he also shews to be false from the Absurdity that would thence follow, which is that Man would then be able to <hi>Create.</hi> The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence he proves by shewing that these Ideas are <hi>Real Beings,</hi> because they have real Properties, and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer one from another, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent things really different. And that they are also <hi>Spiritual Beings,</hi> and that then Man would be able to Create more Noble Entities than the <hi>Material World,</hi> which is the workmanship of God.</p>

                  <p>Our Author further shews that our Mind would not <hi>use</hi> this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Power, though She had it, from the <hi>Instance</hi> of a <hi>Painter.</hi> For as a Painter, though never so skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, cannot represent a Creature which he never saw, and whereof he has no Idea; so a Man cannot form the Idea of an Object, unless he first knows it, that is, unless he has an Idea of it, which does not depend upon his own will. Now if he already has the Idea of that Object, certainly he knows it, and then it is to no purpose for him to form again a <hi>new</hi> Idea of it. 'This Power therefore of Produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Ideas is given to Man in vain, therefore it ought not to be given, therefore this second Hypothesis is not true.</p>

                  <head>XIII.</head>
                  <p>The third is, that God produces these Ideas, either with the Mind, or whenever we think of any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. That this cannot be true as to the first part, he shews from the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:60055:105"/>
                     <hi>Infinite number</hi> of Ideas which must be supposed in proportion to the Infinite number of things, which he exemplifies in <hi>Mathematical fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures,</hi> and the <hi>Combinations</hi> thence arising. 'Tis not in the first place probable that God should create so many things with every Soul; But Secondly, suppose he should, and the Mind, were a <hi>Magazine</hi> of all manner of Ideas, yet 'twould be an invincible Difficulty to shew how the Mind among such an Infinite number of Ideas, should be able, and that so readily, to pick out those which it has occasion for. It ought not therefore to be said that Ideas are <hi>Created with us.</hi>

                  <head>XIV.</head>
                  <p>And there is as little ground to suppose that God does every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment produce in us as many several Ideas, as we conceive things. For besides that this has already been sufficiently overthrown in the other, 'tis further to be consider'd, that we must then always actually have in us the Ideas of all things, seeing
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:60055:105"/>
that at all times we can will to think of all things: Which we could not do if we had not already a <hi>confuse</hi> Perception of them, that is, unless an Infinite number of Ideas were continually before our Minds. For we can not be willing to think of that whereof we have <hi>no</hi> Idea. But we cannot have all this Infinity of Ideas at once in our selves, therefore this third Hypothesis is not true.</p>

                  <p>The fourth is that the Mind needs no other thing but <hi>it self</hi> for the Perception of Objects, and that by Contemplating <hi>it self</hi> and her own Perfections, She can perceive all <hi>External</hi> Objects. This is the boldest Assertion of all, and is full of <hi>Impiety</hi> as well as <hi>Absurdity.</hi> They that will maintain this must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to say that the Mind of Man has in it self the Perfections of all things, since it cannot <hi>see</hi> in it self what it <hi>has</hi> not in it self, and then they would do well to consider whether this be not to make a

                  <p>Having thus overthrown these four Hypotheses concerning the Mode of our understanding, Our most Ingenious Author proceeds to the remaining one, <hi>that we see all things in God.</hi> Which though it be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently establish'd in the overthrow of the rest, yet he goes on to a more immediate and direct proof of it. In order to which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises two <hi>Postulatums</hi> which he had before prov'd, First, that God has in himself the Ideas of all things. This he had before concluded from Gods creating all things, which he could not do without having in himself the Ideas of all things. And this I have also demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in my fifth Contemplation, by a distinct Argument taken from the being of <hi>Necessary and Eternal Truths.</hi> The second <hi>Postulatum</hi> is that God is intimately by his Presence uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:60055:106"/>
to our Minds, so that God may be said to be the <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Spirits,</hi> as <hi>Space</hi> is the Place of <hi>Bodies.</hi> These two things being supposed, it is most certain that the Mind may see all things in God, if God will be pleased to display these Ideas to her, there being then nothing to hinder it. And that 'tis the will and Pleasure of God so to do, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than create an Infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Ideas in every Mind, he thus proves.</p>

               <div n="17" type="section">
                  <head>XVII.</head>
                  <p>First, from the <hi>general Oeconomy of the universe,</hi> wherein 'tis obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that God never does that by <hi>difficult</hi> ways, which may be done by <hi>simple</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> ways: that is, God never does any thing <hi>in vain,</hi> and without Cause: When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God may by himself open and exhibit to us all things barely by willing that we should see those Ideas which are in him, 'tis no way probable that to obtain the <hi>same</hi> end, he should produce such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Multitude of Ideas as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:60055:107"/>
to that variety and multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Knowledge, that is in all Created Minds.</p>

                  <p>This Mode of Intelligence our Author further recommends, by considering that by this way Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Minds are placed in the <hi>greatest dependence</hi> upon God that can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be. For upon this Hypothesis we cannot only see nothing but what God will let us see, but we can also see nothing but what God <hi>exhibits</hi> to us to be seen. Neither can our Minds be said sufficiently to depend upon God in all its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, if they are supposed to have all that is necessary for action, that is, to have in themselves the Ideas of all things always present.</p>

                  <head>XIX.</head>
                  <p>This again he more strongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces by an Argument taken from the <hi>Manner</hi> of our Minds <hi>perceiving</hi> all things. For we all find by certain experience that when we are mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think of any particular thing, we first cast our eyes about upon
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:60055:107"/>
all Beings, and then at last, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the consideration of that Object, which we intended to think upon. Now 'tis past all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion that we cannot desire to see any Object, but we must see it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, although <hi>Confusely,</hi> and after a <hi>general</hi> kind of a way. So that since we can desire to see all Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, now this, now that, hence it will certainly follow, that all Beings are Present to our minds. But now all Beings cannot any other way be present to the mind, but because <hi>God</hi> is present to it, who in the Simplicity of his Being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all beings. The same may be further confirm'd from the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of <hi>Vniversals.</hi> Which the mind could not well be supposed able to represent unless it saw <hi>all</hi> Beings included in <hi>One.</hi> For since every <hi>Created</hi> thing is an <hi>Individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi> no one can say that he perceives any thing <hi>Created,</hi> when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, suppose, a <hi>Triangle</hi> in <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> This well deserves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</p>

                  <p>Again our Ingenious Author ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues from the <hi>Idea</hi> which we have of <hi>Infinite.</hi> For 'tis plain that we <hi>perceive</hi> Infinites, though we do not <hi>comprehend</hi> it, and that our mind has a very Distinct Idea of God, which it could not have but by its union <hi>with</hi> God.

                  <p>He further Considers that the Mind has not only an <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite,</hi> but that it also has it <hi>before</hi> it has any Idea of <hi>finite.</hi> For we conceive <hi>Infinite</hi> Being, barely by conceiving <hi>Being,</hi> without consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it be <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>Infinite.</hi> But now to conceive any <hi>finite</hi> Being, we must <hi>detract</hi> something from that <hi>general</hi> Notion of Being, which by consequence must be <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent.</hi> Our mind therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives nothing but <hi>in</hi> the <hi>Idea</hi> which it has of <hi>Infinite.</hi> And this Idea is so far from being form'd
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:60055:108"/>
from a <hi>Confuse</hi> heaping together of the Ideas of <hi>special</hi> Beings, as Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers commonly pretend, that all those Special Ideas are nothing else but <hi>Participations</hi> from the <hi>general</hi> Idea of <hi>Infinite.</hi> Even as God does not hold his Being from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but all Creatures subsist only by him.</p>

                  <p>He adds one Argument more which he thinks will go for Demonstration, with those who are used to Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract ways of Reasoning. It is impossible that God in any of his actions should have any <hi>Principal End</hi> different from <hi>himself.</hi> This is a Common Notion with every Attentive Thinker. And the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture suffers us not to doubt but that God made all things for himself. It is necessary therefore that not only our Natural Love, that is, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he produces in us, should tend towards himself, but that more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that <hi>Knowledge and Light,</hi> which he bestows upon our mind should open and exhibit to us something
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:60055:109"/>
that is in <hi>himself.</hi> For whatsoever comes from God cannot be for any other besides God. If God should Create a Mind and give it the Sun, suppose, for its Idea, or immediate Object of Knowledge, God would then make that Mind for the Sun, and not for himself.</p>

                  <p>God therefore cannot make a mind to know his Works, unless that mind do in some manner see <hi>God</hi> when it sees his Works; so that I may venture to say, that if we did not some way or other <hi>see God,</hi> we should <hi>see nothing</hi> at all. Even as if we did not <hi>love God</hi>; that is, if God did not continually impress upon us the love of good in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, we should <hi>love nothing</hi> at all. For since this Love is the same with our will, we cannot Love or will any thing without him, since we cannot love Particular goods but by determining towards those goods that motion of Love which God gives us towards himself. We <hi>love</hi> therefore nothing but by that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary

love by which we are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved towards God, and we <hi>see</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but by that Natural Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which we have of God.

                  <p>That it is so, besides what Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur <hi>Malebranche</hi> has offered upon this Argument, I further prove by considering, first, That since Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is comprehension of Truth, if the Truth which I comprehend be in God, and in him only, then I must be said to see and know what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:60055:111"/>
I see and know in God. This is a plain and easie consequence. And that the Truth which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend is in God only, I thus make out.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="29" type="section">
                  <head>XXIX.</head>
                  <p>The nature of Truth consists in a certain mutual respect or habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of simple Essences one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But these relations which I comprehend, and which are the same with <hi>Truth,</hi> are not verified of the simple Essences, as they are in their <hi>External</hi> and <hi>Natural subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stencies,</hi> but as they are in the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Idea's.</hi> I deny not but that there may be relation between things in their <hi>natural subsistencies,</hi> but I say that is not the relation which I <hi>primely</hi> and <hi>directly behold</hi> when I contemplate Truth. For, first, things according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural subsistencies are <hi>Temporary,</hi> and once were not, but the relation which I behold is <hi>Eternal,</hi> and was from everlasting; and consequently cannot be the relation of things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their subsistence in <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                     <pb n="205" facs="tcp:60055:111"/>
Again, the Essences of things, as to their <hi>Natural</hi> subsistence, may <hi>cease</hi> to be, but the relation which I behold is <hi>Immutable</hi> and <hi>Immortal,</hi> and will be ever the same. Again, things as they are in <hi>Nature,</hi> are not, even while they are, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that <hi>exactness</hi> according to which we discern some certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to belong to them. Thus for instance, when I define a right Line to be that which lies equally between its two Points, is there, can there be any such Line in Nature to which this relation may belong? This relation therefore is not the relation of any <hi>Line</hi> in <hi>Nature,</hi> but of a Line in <hi>Idea.</hi> And so 'tis in all other instances; the relations which we behold are not the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of any <hi>Natural,</hi> but of <hi>Ideal Entities.</hi> These are the things which are <hi>properly</hi> related, other things are so only by <hi>accident</hi> and <hi>redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively</hi> as they come under these. And 'tis the relation of these which we properly <hi>discern,</hi> and which are the <hi>prime, direct,</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:60055:112"/>
of our Perception, the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of other things come under a <hi>secondary discernment,</hi> and they are only so far beheld, as they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held in these.</p>

                  <p>But to proceed, if the Truth which we see be not in God, I would fain know whence has it its <hi>Vnity</hi> and <hi>Identity,</hi> its <hi>Steddiness</hi> and <hi>Immutability,</hi> its <hi>Everlastingness</hi> and <hi>Perpetuity?</hi> Whence is it that 'tis alike discern'd by <hi>different minds,</hi> and by the <hi>same</hi> mind at <hi>different times?</hi> We have nothing in our <hi>selves</hi> but what is flux and mutable,

and the things without us are as mutable and uncertain as we our selves. Again, whence is it that Truth is present in all <hi>places,</hi> and that <hi>independently</hi> upon our <hi>thinking or knowing?</hi> For, suppose all the Men and Angels in the World should suspend thinking, yet the existence of Truth would not be thereby suspended, but remain as it was before. For by thinking we do not <hi>make</hi> Truth, but only per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it as it is in <hi>it self,</hi> by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Light which shines up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and is intimately present with us. Truth therefore will exist and be always the same, whether we think or no; which is a plain Argument that tho' it be <hi>in</hi> us, yet 'tis nothing of <hi>ours,</hi> nor is at all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon our understandings, but only upon his who <hi>is necessarily,</hi> and is in <hi>all places,</hi> and is <hi>Truth it self.</hi>

<pb n="209" facs="tcp:60055:113"/>
I find in my mind certain Idea's of a fix'd and unalterable Nature, such as I can neither add any thing to, or at all diminish from.

                  <p>This, again, may be further ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, from our <hi>desire</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and from the <hi>manner</hi> of our <hi>attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> to it. As to the desire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I remark this, That among all the things which are <hi>knowable,</hi> there is not one which I may not, nay, which I do not actually desire to know. But now I cannot have any desire of that whereof I have no manner of Knowledge. For de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire proceeds from Knowledge, and consequently pre-supposes it. I must therefore be supposed to have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>some</hi> Knowledge of all that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know; that is, I must have a <hi>confuse</hi> Knowledge of that which I desire to know <hi>clearly</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly.</hi> And therefore since I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know, or may desire to know every thing clearly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly, I must be allowed to have a <hi>confuse</hi> Knowledge of every thing. But, now, how can this be, but by my having all things actually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to my mind? And how can this be, but by my having a <hi>confuse
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:60055:114"/>
glance</hi> of that Being in whom are all things, and who is <hi>All?</hi>

                  <p>Then as to the <hi>manner</hi> of our <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi> to Knowledge, 'tis a thing in the first place worth considering, How a Child comes to learn his first Language. To know a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, is to know that such a word is to go as a sign for such a thing. Now of words there are some to which the thing that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers is <hi>material</hi> and <hi>sensible.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, again, there are to which the things that answer are <hi>purely Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual.</hi> This premised, I demand how a Child comes to understand the first Language which he learns? You will say, by frequent hearing the word repeated, when at the same time the thing is pointed to, he begins at length to collect that such a word is to go for such a thing; and so to call a Table, a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and a Stool, a Stool. True, this serves well enough to explain how we may learn the meaning of such words to which something
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:60055:115"/>
                     <hi>sensible</hi> answers. But this won't at all help us out in accounting for the understanding words which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>pure Intellectual Notions.</hi> For these cannot be <hi>pointed</hi> at when I hear the word, as in the other case, because not <hi>present,</hi> nor <hi>sensible,</hi> and therefore should the word be never so often said over to me, I might indeed grow familiar with the <hi>sound,</hi> but I should never be able thence to understand that this word is to be joined as a <hi>sign</hi> to such an <hi>Idea.</hi> As for instance, should I hear this word <hi>Vertue</hi> repeated to me daily, I should in a little time come to be acquainted with the sound, so as to know it again from any other sound; but sure were I to hear it to Eternity, I should never thence be instructed among all those Intellectual Idea's which I have, which was signifi'd by that word, neither of them being to be pointed to when I heard the sound. And yet we find by experience that Children do make a shift to find out this, and that they learn the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:60055:115"/>
meaning of such words whose I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea's are <hi>Intellectual,</hi> almost as soon as they do the <hi>other,</hi> and that at an Age when their <hi>observation</hi> is next to none at all. But how they come to do this is an amazing thing to consider. And truly I have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way to solve the difficulty, but by supposing that as often as they hear such words to which the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that answer are <hi>purely Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual</hi>; and consequently not be pointed at when the word is spoken: God then, who is never wanting in <hi>necessaries,</hi> supplies the part of the <hi>Teacher,</hi> by exhibiting such a part of the <hi>Ideal World</hi> to the mind of the Child, as is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by such an arbritrary sign. And this <hi>exhibition</hi> being thus oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casionally vouchsafed by God when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever such words are repeated, has the same effect to make the Child understand the meaning of words, whose Notions are <hi>purely Intellectual,</hi> as <hi>pointing</hi> to the sensible Object has to make him know the meaning of words which signifie things <hi>material</hi> and <hi>sensible.</hi>

                  <p>Pass we next from knowledge of <hi>words</hi> to knowledge of <hi>things.</hi> This knowledge we get and increase by <hi>Study.</hi> Now Study is nothing else, but a close application of mind to the speculation of Truth. The more intent we are in our view of Truth, the more we discover of it. And not only so, but the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensly we speculate it, the more uniform we are in our judgments about it. The more we <hi>think,</hi> the more we come to <hi>agree</hi> in our <hi>thoughts.</hi> Now this plainly argues, that Truth is one absolute and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Nature, independing upon our understandings; and, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, intimately and constantly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to them: For, otherwise, how could it be thus in our power at any time to apply our minds to the speculation of it? Now, what can this one independing, and ever-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Nature be, but God? To know <hi>Truth</hi> therefore is to know God: and <hi>Divinity</hi> is a larger <hi>Study</hi> than we are aware of.</p>

                  <head>XXXVII.</head>
                  <p>Further, I consider, that since God has made Man after <hi>his own Image and likeness,</hi> 'tis highly ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to believe that we imitate him in our <hi>Vnderstandings</hi>; Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being one of the principal parts of Man. And how can we duly imitate him in our Understandings, unless we be supposed to know and perceive after the same general way that God knows and perceives. But now the mode of the Divine Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, is by consulting the <hi>Ideal World,</hi> that is, <hi>himself</hi> as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously imitable and exhibitive of things. Thus 'tis most certain God knew and perceived before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of this <hi>Ectypal</hi> World, there being then no other mode of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception imaginable. And thus he must be supposed to perceive <hi>now</hi> and <hi>ever,</hi> there being <hi>no varying or shadow of turning</hi> in God, much less from <hi>better</hi> to <hi>worse,</hi> as it would be, should God be supposed <hi>before</hi> the Creation to know by and in himself, and <hi>afterwards</hi> by any
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:60055:117"/>
created or foreign Ideas. It is therefore congruous to suppose that as God knows and perceives all things in himself, so Man who is after the Divine image knows and perceives all things in <hi>God.</hi>

               </div>
               <div n="38" type="section">
                  <head>XXXVIII.</head>
                  <p>Again, 'tis highly rational to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we Know and Perceive <hi>Now</hi> after the same manner, though not in the same degree, as we shall <hi>hereafter</hi> in Heaven. As the eye sees after the same manner, though not in the same measure, by night as it does by day. For the state of Glory is not the <hi>Destruction,</hi> but only the <hi>Perfection</hi> and <hi>exaltation</hi> of the state of Nature. But now 'tis certain this shall be the mode of our Vision and Preception <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> we shall then see all things in God, for says the Psalmist, <hi>With thee is the well of life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>and in thy light shall we see light.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may with reason conclude that this is the mode of our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Intelligence,</hi> and that now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so we <hi>see Light</hi> in the <hi>Light of God.</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:60055:117"/>
And accordingly says the Apostle, <hi>now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face</hi>: where observe that our <hi>Present Vision</hi> does not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from our <hi>Future</hi> as to the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> but only as to the <hi>Degree</hi> of <hi>Charity.</hi> God is the <hi>Object</hi> of both, only now he is seen through a <hi>Glass,</hi> that is through the Veil of our <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Flesh,</hi> whereas then the Veil shall be remov'd, and our vision of him shall be <hi>Clear</hi> and <hi>Perfect.</hi>

                  <p>Lastly, I consider that I always think of <hi>Being in general.</hi> Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Beings indeed I think of, or not think of at Pleasure, but Being in general is ever before my mind, and I cannot possibly remove it from me. For there is the same Proportion in our <hi>understanding</hi> that is in our <hi>Love.</hi> There is variety and vicissitude in our love of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> goods, sometimes we love them, sometimes we do not love them, sometimes we love this, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times that, sometimes more, and sometimes less; but our love of good
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:60055:118"/>
in <hi>general</hi> is necessary, constant, and uniform. And there is the same measure in our <hi>Thinking. Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Beings we think of by intervals and with variety. But we always and uncessantly think of Being in <hi>general.</hi> And when we think of <hi>Particular</hi> Beings, we don't so much depart from <hi>Being in general,</hi> as confine and determin our minds to some <hi>certain</hi> Perfections of it. Nay when we think that we think of <hi>nothing,</hi> our mind is then most full and Pregnant of wandring, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinate, Indefinite Idea of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in general. This I evidently experiment in my self, and I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion not that whoever attends to the operations of his mind will find the same: Now I demand whence should this come to pass that I am thus necssarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd at all times, and in all Places to think of Being in general, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from this, that Being in general is inseparably united to my mind, and intimately Present to it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>always,</hi> and <hi>every where.</hi>

                  <p>But now Being in general is the same with <hi>God,</hi> as has been shewn in the Former part.

And if God be so inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately united to my Soul, how can I otherwise conclude but that 'tis in him that I see all that I see? For in what else <hi>can</hi> I see it, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being so intimately Presenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to me as God? And in what else <hi>need</hi> I see it, God having in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Ideas of all things, as was before proved.</p>

                  <p>Now as to <hi>Scripture-Authority,</hi> besides what <hi>Monsieur Malebranche</hi> has alledged, I further offer to be consider'd, First, that God is not only said to <hi>enlighten</hi> our minds, and all our <hi>Illumination</hi> is every

                     </gap>, the word or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conception of God, or the Ideal World. Thus in the 8<hi>th</hi> of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> there is described a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial Wisdom (which can be no other but the Divine <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

I was set up from everlasting, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> (and so St. <hi>Iohn, In the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the word</hi>) <hi>or ever the earth was: When there were no Depths I was brought forth</hi> (there's the Eternal Generation) <hi>when there were no Fountains abounding with Water. Before the mountains were settled; before the Hills was I brought forth. While as yet he had not made the Earth, nor the Fields, nor the highest part of the dust of the World. When he prepared the Heavens I was there, when he set a Compass upon the face of the Deep.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:60055:119"/>
When he establish'd the Clouds above. When he Strengthen'd the fountains of the Deep. When he gave to the Sea his Decree, that the waters should not pass his Commandment, when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Foundations of the Earth. Then was I by him, as one brought up with him, and I was daily his delight, rejoycing always before him.</hi> This I think will readily be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleg'd to be a plain and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Description of the Divine <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>I might add a great deal more to this purpose, but I think that from these considerations, joyn'd with those of Mr. <hi>Malebranche,</hi> 'tis clear, even to Demonstration that Man is not his own Light, or a Light to himself, and also that no other Creature can be a Light to him, but that he sees and knows all things in the Divine <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now as to the <hi>First,</hi> I say that the general nature of Love consists in a <hi>motion of the Soul towards good.</hi>

                  <p>As to the <hi>Second,</hi> That there is such a motion in Man, I need say no more, but that we are intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conscious of it, as much as we are of the motion of our Heart, or Lungs, or of any other Physical Impression in or about us. All there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that I shall further insist upon

shall be the two last things: <hi>First,</hi> What is the proper cause of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Man.

               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>V.</head>
                  <p>As to the cause of this motion in Man, which we call Love or Desire, I consider that it must be the same that is the cause of all the Physical motion in the Universe. Now Physical motion is resolv'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a double cause, an <hi>occasional cause,</hi> and an <hi>efficient cause.</hi> The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional cause of Physical motion is <hi>emptiness</hi> or <hi>vacuity.</hi> For in that which is <hi>absolutely full</hi> there can be no motion, because of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrability of Bodies. The effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cause of Physical motion is either particular or universal. The particular is, the pressure or impulse of particular Bodies one against a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. The universal is, no other than God himself, who in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:60055:124"/>
of the World (as the <hi>Cartesian</hi> Philosophy rightly supposes) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spenced a certain portion of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and rest to matter, which he still preserves the same by his Almighty Power. So that if one part of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cease to be moved, so much motion as was in that is transferred to another part: And if the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of one decreases or be dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, it is compensated in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And so the same measure of motion is always conserved in the Universe. And unless God be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be the Author of motion, 'twill be impossible to give any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Original of it. For neither can Bodies move themselves, nor can they be moved by one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on to Infinity. We must there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at last come to a <hi>first Mover unmoved,</hi> which is God. And so <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> calls God, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the first Mover unmoved.</hi>

               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>VI.</head>
                  <p>And thus in the same Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the motion of Love is also re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solvable into a double cause, an <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casional</hi>
                     <pb n="232" facs="tcp:60055:125"/>
cause an an <hi>efficient</hi> cause. The occasional cause of this moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as of the other, is <hi>emptiness</hi> or <hi>vacuity.</hi> For Love or Desire is founded upon <hi>Indigence</hi> and <hi>Self-insufficiency</hi> of the Soul, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not within it self enough to content it, is forced to go out of it self for supplies. And so <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his <hi>Ethics, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, Desire is the fulfilling of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digence.</hi> And accordingly we find that the more weak and indigent any Person is, still the more abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in desire. Thus Children are more profuse in their desires than Adult Persons, Women than Men, and the Sick more than those who are in Health. This is well sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed forth in <hi>Iotham</hi>'s Parable, wherein the <hi>Bramble</hi> is represented as more <hi>ambitious</hi> than either the <hi>Olive-tree,</hi>

                     <hi>Fig-tree,</hi> or the <hi>Vine.</hi> For he presently accepted of that Empire which they had all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. Where there is no Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence there is no room for Desire; and accordingly God, who is an
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:60055:125"/>
absolutely <hi>full</hi> Being, can no more admit of desire, than a place that is absolutely <hi>full</hi> can admit of <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>

                  <head>VII.</head>
                  <p>As to the <hi>efficient cause</hi> of this Moral motion, it is also double, as in Physical Motion. It is either Particular or Universal. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular efficient cause, are particular goods, whether Sensual or Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual. Which act upon the Soul, and answer to the pressure or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulse of particular Bodies in Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motion. The Universal effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause, is the Universal Good, or God, whom we suppose to have imprinted a certain stock of moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the <hi>Intellectual</hi> World, as he did upon the <hi>Natural.</hi> Which he also conserves and maintains by his Omnipotence, as he does the other.</p>

                  <head>VIII.</head>
                  <p>For, I consider, that there is the same necessity of a <hi>first Mover</hi> in Moral, as there is in Natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And upon the very same
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:60055:126"/>
grounds. But now tis impossible that there should be any other <hi>first Mover</hi> besides God. And therefore whatever intermediate causes there may be of this motion, it must at last be resolved into an impression of God upon our Souls, whom therefore I call the <hi>Vniversal effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cause of Love.</hi>
                  </p>
               </div>
               <div n="9" type="section">
                  <head>IX.</head>
                  <p>And so much for the cause of this motion in Man. I come now to consider the last Enquiry, namely, after what peculiar manner this motion has it self, or how it stands proportioned to its cause. I do not mean its <hi>occasional</hi> cause, that being not so properly a <hi>cause</hi> as a condition, but its <hi>efficient</hi> cause. Now this being double, Particular and Universal Good; the question in more explicite terms will be, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what peculiar manner our Love stands affected or proportioned to Particular and Universal Good.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="section">
                  <head>X.</head>
                  <p>Now in answer to this, I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, first, That since God is the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:60055:126"/>
                     <hi>first Mover</hi> in the motion of Love, he must necessarily determine this motion toward himself, or make himself the term of this motion. And the only term too; it being impossible that God should act for any end different from himself. Whence it follows, that Universal good, or good in general, is the only good to which we are <hi>directly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> moved by God.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="11" type="section">
                  <head>XI.</head>
                  <p>Hence again it follows, that good in common, or God, must be the Primary and Adequate Term or Object of Love. This being the only good to which we are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved by God. I say <hi>directly,</hi> for God moves us to particular goods only by moving us to good in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which is not to move us to them <hi>directly,</hi> but by <hi>accident</hi> and <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly.</hi> God cannot move us <hi>directly</hi> to any thing but himself, that is to Universal good, or good in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which therefore must be the Primary and Adequate Term or Object of Love.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="12" type="section">
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:60055:127"/>
                  <head>XII.</head>
                  <p>And this we <hi>sensibly experiment</hi> as well as <hi>rationally conclude.</hi> For 'tis plain that we are conscious to our selves of our loving good as good, or good according to its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature, before we love this or that good in particular. And we are further conscious, that when we do love any particular good, 'tis only for the sake of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal good. We love it only because we find in it something of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Nature of good, and the more we find of that, the more we love it. So that 'tis by that love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we love good in common, that we love any particular good. And were it not for this Universal good we should be able to love nothing. Which by the way is a plain argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>real existence</hi> of such <hi>Vniversal good,</hi> and consequently that <hi>there is a God.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <head>XIII.</head>
                  <p>For, indeed, to speak out in short what I would have, as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all things in God, so 'tis in
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:60055:127"/>
God we love whatever we love. And as when we <hi>understand,</hi> the Divine Ideas are that which we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and properly perceive, and Created Beings are only so far per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd as they are of a similar nature with those Ideas, and so vertually contain'd in them. So when we <hi>Love,</hi> universal good, good in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, or God is that which we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and properly love, and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted goods, or Particular goods are only so far loved as they resemble and participate of the nature of that universal good, to which the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our love is Directly and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily determined. So that <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular goods</hi> are as much <hi>loved</hi> in the <hi>universal good,</hi> as <hi>Particular Beings</hi> are <hi>seen</hi> and <hi>perceiv'd</hi> in the <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Being.</hi>

                  <head>XIV.</head>
                  <p>I further consider that as we are determin'd to good in general <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily</hi> and <hi>Directly,</hi> so also the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby we are by God deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to it is <hi>necessary, invincible</hi> and <hi>irresistable.</hi> There is nothing in
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:60055:128"/>
nature more necessary, no nor <hi>so</hi> necessary and invincible as that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereby we are carried forth to good in general. Here the Soul must not pretend to the least sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Liberty, having no more command over this motion, than she has over the motion of the Sun. 'Tis not easie to conceive how <hi>God himself</hi> should <hi>fix</hi> this motion, but 'tis plain that <hi>Man</hi> cannot any way <hi>command</hi> it.</p>

                  <p>But there is not the same neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of Determination in our moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on towards <hi>Particular</hi> good. I say not the same. <hi>M. Malebranche</hi> will allow <hi>none,</hi> but 'tis plain that <hi>some</hi> there is. For since we are invincibly determin'd to the Love of good in general, we must needs love good as such, and consequently in every degree of Participation, the general Reason of good being in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or other found in every degree of Particular good. Loving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good as good we are necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:60055:128"/>
determin'd to love every degree of good, and consequently every particular good, with a <hi>Natural Love,</hi> so far as we consider it as good.</p>

                  <head>XVI.</head>
                  <p>But because this Particular good is not the Greatest good, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently in some junctures may come into competition with a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hence it comes to pass that we may upon the whole have more reason to will and refuse it, than to will and embrace it, and so are not determin'd necessarily to an <hi>Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute,</hi> effectual and thorough love of it, though yet we must love it as good with a <hi>natural</hi> love as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>

                  <head>XVII.</head>
                  <p>For 'tis impossible that we should ever <hi>nill Good,</hi> as we <hi>nill Evil,</hi> any more than we can <hi>will Evil</hi> as we <hi>will Good.</hi> But as our willing of Evil is always with a mixture of <hi>willing,</hi> though willing may in some jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures <hi>prevail,</hi> so our nilling of good is always with a mixture of <hi>willing,</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:60055:129"/>
though in some junctures nilling may <hi>prevail:</hi> we cannot hate good with a <hi>Pure Hatred,</hi> though it be only a <hi>lesser</hi> good, any more than we can love evil with a <hi>Pure Love,</hi> though a <hi>lesser</hi> evil.</p>

                  <p>Whenever therefore by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of goods we are ingaged to nill any Particular good, we do also will it at the same time. But in different respects. We will it as good, and we nill it as a lesser good, we will it <hi>secundum quid,</hi> according to a certain respect, and we nill it simply and Absolutely: that is in other words, though we have <hi>some</hi> reason to will it, namely its proper good, in which respect we <hi>necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> will it, and consequently <hi>always,</hi> yet we have <hi>more</hi> reason to nill it in the present juncture, as standing in competition with a greater good, and the stronger motive takes place as to <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Effectual</hi> love or choice.</p>

                  <p>This I cannot better illustrate than by the example of <hi>Weights</hi> in a <hi>Ballance.</hi> For though that Scale which has most weight in it, weighs <hi>down,</hi> yet it must needs be allow'd that the other Scale does also weigh and press <hi>downwards,</hi> though not effectually, because otherwise as much weight would be required to make it weigh effectually down as if it were quite empty. And thus 'tis in the present case. Though for the Prevalency of Reasons in some junctures the Scale may weigh down for the nilling of good, yet the other Scale also presses, though not effectually. And this is what the Schools term a <hi>Velleity,</hi> or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Inclination. And 'tis with this Velleity, or natural inclination, that we are necessarily determin'd to love even Particular good; but we are not necessarily determin'd to love it absolutely and effectually, because there is no particular good, but what may come in Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a greater, and then there
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:60055:130"/>
will be <hi>more</hi> Reason to <hi>nill</hi> it than to <hi>will</hi> it, and the heaviest Scale will weigh down.</p>

                  <p>And thus have I shewn after what peculiar manner our Love stands affected or proportion'd to Particular and Universal good. The difference consists in these two things. <hi>Vniversal</hi> good is the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary</hi> and <hi>Direct</hi> Object of our Love, but our Love tends towards <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular</hi> good only <hi>secundarily</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly,</hi> for the sake of what it has of the Universal. Then again there is Difference as to the <hi>Necessity</hi> of the Determination, as well as to the <hi>Primariness</hi> of it. There is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Necessity on both sides, but not in <hi>like manner.</hi> We are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily determin'd to Love universal good <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Thoroughly.</hi> The Scale does not only <hi>weigh</hi> here, but <hi>weighs down.</hi> But we are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to love any Particular good <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Thoroughly,</hi> but only to love it with a <hi>Natural Inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:60055:130"/>
or <hi>Velleity.</hi> And to such a love of it we are as necessarily deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, as we are to the love of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal good; but the <hi>Actual Choice</hi> of it is not necessary, there being no Particular good to the <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Effectual</hi> love, of which we are invincibly determin'd.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Amorousness</hi> of Humane Nature, as we have here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd it, contains in it many and great incitements to Devotion. For First, since the Occasional Cause of our love is Indigence and Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, we have great reason to be humble and lowly in Spirit, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially considering that we are continually admonish'd of this our Indigence, as often as we are Conscious to our selves that we love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:60055:131"/>Again, since God is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Efficient Cause of Love, and the first mover in all Moral as well as Natural motion, it is highly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that he should be Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally loved by us from whom we receive our Love, and that we should be mighty careful how we pervert this <hi>Divine Impression</hi> to any undue object.</p>
                  <p>Again, since God moves us Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and Primarily only to <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> and since universal good is therefore the <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>Direct</hi> Object of our Love, hence it will follow that we ought also to make God the <hi>Primary</hi> and <hi>Direct</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our Love, and that we ought to Love nothing for <hi>it self,</hi> but only <hi>in</hi> and <hi>for God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And lastly, since we are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily determin'd to love good in general, <hi>Absolutely</hi> and <hi>Effectually,</hi> by such a motion as we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>resist,</hi> nor any way <hi>Command</hi> or <hi>Moderate</hi>; hence it appears
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:60055:131"/>
how highly necessary it is that we should <hi>expllicitly</hi> fix all that Love upon God, as having all that good in him to which we aspire with a <hi>Blind, Confuse</hi> and <hi>Indefinite,</hi> though <hi>Necessary</hi> Appetite.</p>

Thou hast a <hi>Right,</hi> O my God to all my Love, for I cannot love thee with any Love but what is <hi>thy own.</hi> O then do thou Regulate this thy own <hi>Divine Impression,</hi> and grant I may never sin against thee, by the abuse of that Love which thou hast given me. <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth,</hi> for doing so much towards the guidance and Regulation of my Love, as to carry me Directly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Universal good, thereby teaching me that I ought to make thee the only <hi>Direct</hi> and <hi>Primary</hi> Object of my Love. My God, I will love as thou teachest me, the First and Direct Motion of Love shall be towards thee, and whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I love besides thee, I will love only in and for thee.</p>
                  <p>I thank thee, also My God, for that thou hast made it so necessary for me to love universal good. Thou, O God, art this universal good, and I ought to love thee with the very same Love where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with

I love <hi>Happiness</hi> it self. O that I were as necessarily inclined to love thee, as I am to love Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness!

                  <p>Now thus to consider Man, is to consider him as an <hi>Irregular Lover.</hi> And to do this fully, and to the purpose intended, Three things will be requisite. <hi>First,</hi> To shew what it is to be an <hi>Irregular Lover.

                  <p>In relation to the first, if it be demanded, What it is to be an <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular Lover?</hi> I answer in one word, That 'tis to be a <hi>Fool.

And we are taught in the <hi>Schools</hi> of <hi>Morality,</hi> that every

                  <p>As for the absurdity of his choice, 'tis the greatest that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. For what is it that he chuses?

good and equitable, and in keeping of which there is <hi>present,</hi> as well as <hi>future</hi> reward. 'Tis to act against the Frame of his Rational Nature, and the Divine Law of his Mind: 'tis to disturb the Order and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Creation, and by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-lineal motions to violate the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Interest of Society. 'Tis, <hi>lastly,</hi> to incur the Anger of an Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and Just God, and to hazard falling from his Supreme Good and the last end of his Being, and the being ruined in his <hi>best</hi> Interest to all Eternity.</p>

                  <p>All this the <hi>Irregular Lover</hi> part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actually incurs, and partly puts to the hazard in every wrong mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Love. And for what is all this? Is it for any considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble interest, for any thing that bears something of proportion, and may pretend to competition and a rival Weight in the opposite Scale of the <hi>Ballance?</hi> No. 'tis only for a shadow, for a trifle, for the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:60055:135"/>
of some baser appetite, for the acquirement of some little interest, which has nothing to divert us from adhering to that which is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our best, but only that poor ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of being <hi>present,</hi> tho' at the same time its <hi>vanity</hi> be present with it.</p>

                  <p>And now is this a choice for a <hi>wise Man,</hi> for a Man of <hi>common Sense</hi>? Nay, is it a choice for a Man in his <hi>right Wits</hi> to make?

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:60055:135"/>
irregularity of Love is founded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ignorance and mistake. For as 'tis impossible to chuse evil as evil in general, so is it no less impossible to chuse or will any <hi>particular kind</hi> of evil, as evil; and consequently, 'tis impossible to will the evil of <hi>sin</hi> as such, (the Devil himself can't love sin as sin.) If therefore it be chosen, it must be chosen under the appearance of good, and it can have this appearance no otherwise than as considered as a <hi>lesser evil,</hi> (for that's the only way whereby an evil may appear good or eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible.) And so it must be consider'd before it be chosen.</p>

                  <p>He therefore that chuses sin, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siders it at the instant of commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as a lesser evil. And therein consists his error and mistake. He is either <hi>habitually</hi> or <hi>actually</hi> ignorant. He either has not the habitual knowledge of all those things which should preserve him in his duty, or at least he has not the actual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration

of them. For 'tis that which must bring him to <hi>repentance.</hi> And 'tis impossible a Man should sin with the very same <hi>Thoughts, Convictions</hi> and <hi>Considerations</hi> about him, as he has when he <hi>repents.</hi> This I say is no more possible than for a Ballance to move to contrary ways with the same <hi>Weight,</hi> and in the same <hi>Posture.</hi> He therefore that sins, wants that consideration at least to <hi>keep</hi> him <hi>in</hi> his <hi>duty,</hi> which when he <hi>repents,</hi> brings him <hi>to</hi> it.

For, if <hi>Irregular Love</hi> be so monstrous a deformity, and so great a folly, and if Man be so very prone to <hi>Irregular Love,</hi> and is also himself the Author of that proneness, what stronger <hi>Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Argument can there be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, for <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Lowliness</hi> of
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:60055:139"/>
Spirit. For this is the worst that can be said of any thing, and is the <hi>Sum</hi> and <hi>Abstract</hi> of all that's base and vile.</p>
                  <p>It may also, Secondly, be argued from the great evil of <hi>Irregular Love,</hi> and from our great proneness to be guilty of it, that it highly concerns us to have constant recourse to God in Prayer, for his Divine aid and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance, against falling into that which is so great a <hi>Folly,</hi> and so great a <hi>Mischief,</hi> and which by an Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our own contracting we are so very <hi>apt</hi> to fall into.</p>

                  <p>TO thee, O my God, belongs <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Adoration,</hi> for endowing me with those excellent Powers of <hi>Vnderstanding</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> but to me Shame and Confusion of face, for <hi>misapplying</hi> the one, and <hi>not attending</hi> to the Dictates of the other.</p>
                  <p>I blush, O my God, and am asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to think that my nature should stand so much inclined to irregular
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:60055:140"/>
Love, a thing so full of Mischief and Folly, but much more that I my self should bring my self into such a state of impotence and depravation. My heart sheweth me the great Foulness and Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableness of Sin, and yet I find my self over prone to commit it. <hi>So Foolish am I and Ignorant, and even as a Beast before thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I desire, O my God, to be yet more vile. I am not vile e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in my own eyes, though too much so in thine. Nor can I ever be vile enough in my <hi>Opinion,</hi> for being so vile in my <hi>Nature.</hi> Strike me then I beseech thee with a deep, and with a lively sense of my own Wretchedness, and make me as <hi>Humble</hi> as I am <hi>Wicked.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And since, through the Infirmity of my flesh, I am so apt to err in the conduct and application of my Love, <hi>O hold thou up my goings in thy Paths, that my Footsteps slip not.</hi> Make me always to attend to that <hi>Divine Light</hi> of thine within my Breast, and let the <hi>victorious sweetness</hi> of thy Grace <hi>out-charm</hi>

all the relishes of sensible good. But above all, <hi>Keep thy Servant from Presumptuous sins, lest they get the Dominion over me.</hi> And let all these <hi>words of my mouth,</hi> and this whole <hi>meditation of my heart be always accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in thy sight,</hi>
