            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHTE worſhipful and excellent yong Gentle man, mayſter Henry Compton Eſquier, his faythful and dailye Orator Nicholas Hawarde, wiſheth longe helth, with encreſe and affluence of all worſhyp.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough of long tyme ſithe, (ryghte worſhipfull,) I had in my hart profeſſed a greate zeale and reuerens towardes you, whiche from time to time, day by day. I ſought me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to ſignifye to your good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſhip, yet there neuer wanted ſom occaſion which might w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>hold me from y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mi ſaid inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; purpoſe.
<pb facs="tcp:1929:3"/>
For why, waying mine own caſe and condition of fortune, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering your worthye eſtate and degree of worſhip, I did alwaies with my ſelf yet hitherto, diſalow my former attempted enterpryſe. But on the other ſide, ſetting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes, and beholding the exceding great gentlenes, whych from your very youthe ye haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundauntly towards all men in all places declared, (whiche you as inheritaunce claime from your auncetors,) and alſo the no ſmall fauoure and zeale which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually haue profeſſed towardes learning, where in I my ſelfe am able not a litle to teſtify how you haue profyted. For omitting here, your diligent ſtudye employed at Oxford, whyche is to diuers not vnknowen, I my ſelfe doo well remember that longe tyme before that, ye had attayned the Laten

tounge, (and that well nyghe in your verye childhoode:) whyche thinges being ſo, I was embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,) preſuming vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> your paſſing great fauour) now at laſte wyth certaine confidence to declare to your goodneſſe my pore harte to you long time ſince wholy addic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: vpon which ſnre affiaunce ſo repoſed in your worſhyp, I haue here preſented vnto you this ſmal treatiſe. Vppon the fyniſhinge wherof, I haue employed for the moſt part ſuche vacant time as I had, (not defraudinge my other ſtudies,) bering in memorye ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and ſaying of Plinie, who thoughte all that his time to be loſt, whyche hee beſtowed not at booke.

my baſhfulneſſe in this behalf, as did Octauius Auguſtus to one, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had finiſhed a boke, (like as I this,) which he would haue deliuered to Auguſtus, and was come in preſence before him, with trembling hand, he did both profer and withdraw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hys boke again, which thing Auguſtus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiuing, accepted the gift, and reprehending y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> baſhful and timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſneſſe of the geuer, ſaid: what thinckeſt thou, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou doeſt nowe erhibite a mite to an Elephante? Such clemency and familiaritye was there in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> mighty Emperor. The like of which, alſo promiſeth this your worſhips countenance: which hath now exiled, and clean put to flight, the cloudy miſtes of my former baſhfulneſſe: So that now wythout feare or drawinge backe, I haue heare preferred to your worſhip theſe my ſymple tra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uailes,
<pb facs="tcp:1929:4"/>
which I choſe amonge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to employ vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this author, as chefe for ſondry cauſes. Thone is, for the ſubſtaunce and matter, which he writeth of, whiche as it is of time and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuans antique, ſo is it of all men far before other hiſtories to be embraced &amp; deſired to be knowen. An other cauſe is, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> where diuers Hiſtoriogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers aſwell Grekes as Latines haue vttred to their poſteritye in wryting therploits &amp; feats atche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the Romaines, as well in peace, as in warre, yet among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al, are there few which in ſo good order haue placed the ſame: and as for breuitye and compendiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I am aſſured noone there are, but of force muſte graunte hym the pryce. And all be it that as Tullye ſayeth, and as expery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence teacheth vs, dyuers there are endued wyth very excellente
<pb facs="tcp:1929:5"/>
wittes by nature, whyche wittes are aided by preceptes and perfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by experience, which experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s is alone the maiſtres of al things, who inſtructeth and teacheth vs how to demene and gouern both our ſelues and our doings by iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ging thynges preſent, and calling to memory thynges whyche are paſt: yet amonge all thoſe whych are indued with ſuche pregnante wittes by nature, eche one hathe not attained ſuche perfectyon in learning, that they of them ſelues are able inough to attain fully to the knowledge and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge of the geſtes and factes of dyuers moſte victorious nations &amp; peoples: the examples of whom may aminate and encourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to endeuour and laboure to purchaſe and attaine ſuche lyke fame and praiſe, as thoſe others haue done, ſo muche as nothynge

<pb facs="tcp:1929:6"/>
the ſame Hiſtoryes for wante of learninge, had bred to dyuers of thys our country. By whiche ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of theirs, I was the more hardye to attempte thys enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pryſe, as one ryghte gladde if by oughte that lyeth in me, (whyche eaſelye I confeſſe, and graunte how ſlender it is,) any one myght take eyther furtheraunce or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Which my ſimple trauayles I haue preſumed to exhibyte to your worſhip, not for any the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes afore ſayde, (knowinge that you are in ſuche ſtudies, as ye are alſo in all other good ſcyences ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye exactlye ſeene and parfecte,) but onelye to ſignifye, and as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumente to teſtifye the good wyl whyche to my power my poore harte vnto your worſhyppe, as of duetye doothe owe: whyche then at lengthe ſhall be fullye ſatiſfyed,

            <p>And all thoughe it maye be graunted that experyence of thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges maye bee attayned wythout learnynge, yet is experyence pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by learnynge, to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before that other ſo muche as quietneſſe is more to be regarded then trouble.</p>
            <p>For as Phillip de Comines a Frenche wryter affyrmeth: a manne ſhall ſee more experyence in three monethes, by readynge of bookes, then twentye menne ſhall in Proceſſe of tyme, the one of theym lyuynge after the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Where by a manne ſhall allſo vnderſtande the vſage and

Now the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines waxed mighty: they warred wyth the Samnites well nyghe an C. and .xxx. miles diſtant from Rome whiche are ſituate in the mid waye betwene Picennm, Campania, and Apulia.

Within a few yeres after, the armies of the french men ioyned wyth the Thuſcianes, and Samnites againſte the Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: but as they marched towardes Rome, Cnaine Cornelius Dolabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la encountringe wyth them, ſlewe them: At that time warre was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claymed <note place="margin">Warre pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed agai<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſt the Taren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines.</note> agaynſte the Tarentines whiche inhabited the fartheſt partes of Italye, for that they had iniuryed the Legates of the Romaines. The Tarentines deſired Pyrrhus kynge of Epirus to aſſyſte theym agaynſte the Romaines, who forth wyth came to Italye.</p>
            <p>Thys Pyrrhus was deſcended of the line of Achilles. Thys was the fyrſte battaile that the Romaynes <note place="margin">The fyrſt bat<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tayle that the romaynes wa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged wyth for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayn enemye.</note> waged with anye foraine ennemye. To this battaile was Publius Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerius Leuinus ſente: who when he had apprehended the eſpyes of Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1929:27"/>
he willed that they ſhoulde be led through the camp, and that al the armye ſhoulde be ſhewed to them, and ſo be diſmiſte, to the ende they might recount to Pirrhus howe the <note place="margin">The ſtoutnes of the romay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.</note> Romaines did demeane them ſelues in all poyntes.

After this, Pyrrhus aſſociated vnto him the Samnites, the Luca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and the Brutians, and marched ſo forward toward Rome deſpoiling all as he went with fier and ſworde. He prayed through all Campania, &amp; came to Preneſte whiche was diſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t but .xviii. miles from Rome, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired hee backe againe to Campania for dreede of the Conſuls, who came wyth a great army againſte hym.

whome he receiued honourably, and ſent to Rome ſuche priſoners as he had, wythout receiuinge anye raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for them. And amonge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidewe of the Romaine Legates, Pyrrhus was ſo muche affectyoned towardes one Fabricius, that wher as he vnderſtode the ſayd Fabricius to be but a very pore man, he profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to geue him the fourths parte of his kingdome, if that he woulde for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake <note place="margin">Howe dear the Romains eſtemed theyr country.</note> Rome, and come to hym. But Fabricius refuſed that hys offer, Where vppon Pyrrhus not a lyttle meruailinge at the Romaines, ſente the chiefeſt of all his bande, one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Cyneas on embaſſade to Rome, <note place="margin">Pyrrhus prayed peace.</note> to intreat for peace, vpon indifferent conditions, ſo that Pyrrhus myghte ſtyl detayne that part of Italye whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che he had ſubdued by battail, which profer of peace miſliked the Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes: and woorde was ſente backe to Pyrrhus from the Senate, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

Then the Romains <note place="margin">The ſtout an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſwer of the ro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>maynes.</note> commaunded that all thoſe whyche Pyrrhus had taken priſoners, ſhuld be reputed as infamed perſones, for that they would be taken priſoners <note place="margin">The ſeuerity of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes.</note> when they might haue defended the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues by force of armes: And more ouer, that they ſhould not agayne be reſtored to theyr former eſtate, vntyl ſuche tyme as they broughte wyth them the like ſpoiles of theyr enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

When he and king Pyrrhus had pitched theyr tentes neare the one to the other, Pyrrhus his Phiſition cam by night to Fabricius, offring that he woulde deſtroy Pirrhus with poyſon, if Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricius would geue him any thynge for his laboure: whome Fabritius <note place="margin">The Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes hated tre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſon.</note> apprehended, and cauſed to be bound and caried to Pyrrhus, and to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>declared

Thus in the .xvii. yere all Italy was deliuered from the terrour of Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.

And when they hadde ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned their cauſe to the Senate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was made to them, that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the aduiſe of Scipio, peace ſhould be graunted them, referryng the matter wholly to Scipio: by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it was graunted vpon theſe condity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.

            <p>While theſe things wer in talk, Annibal as he retourned into Africk, infringed the league, for he and hys armye wroughte diuers thynges by <note place="margin">The lege bro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ken by Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.</note> the way as they wente, contrarye to the peace concluded vppon, and as ennemyes.

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:1929:47"/>
But they were by the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Scipio ſtraightway diſmiſte againe. Not long after, Annibal him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſelfe being ſore wearyed with thoſe contynuall battailes, deſired peace: <note place="margin">Annibal deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red peace.</note> whiche when it came to bee treated of, it was graunted vppon the ſame conditions as it was before: and to the precedent conditions of payment of .v.

through the tentes, and that all hys army ſhould be ſhewed them. Then that they ſhuld be feaſted, and ſo diſmiſt, to the end they mighte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to Anniball, what they hadde ſeene amonge the romaynes. In the meane time, preparaunce of battaile was made by the captaines on cche partye, ſuche as vnneth anye man coulde euer remember the lyke. At whyche time bothe thoſe expert men of warre and valiaunte captains led forthe theyr armies into the fielde.

In the yeare folowing, Lucius Manlius fought a battaile in Spain, wyth good ſucceſſe. And after hym, Marcellus the Conſull hadde good chaunce there alſo.

Aſdruball a captain of the Carthaginiens was ſente forthe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and Famea an other of theyr captaines had the conductynge of the horſmen: At that time, Scipio who was neue we to Scipio Africa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, was by the Romaynes deputed generall of the army.

            <p>Sone after, Lucullꝰ required him to deliuer his ennemy, whom he had put to ſlyght. Whiche requeſt when he withſtode and denyed the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of Mithridates, Lucullus forthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with inuaded kynge Tigranes hys realme, and wanne there Tigra no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certa the chiefeſt citye of Armenia, and hauinge but .xviii.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with that which he had in the Greke tong. He was very eloquent, and of a very redy &amp; prompt memory.

Nor yet that former concluding of peace on that condition, had bene greatly to be miſliked wythal, if that afterwarde, ſo ſoone as he had bene able, he had infringed that league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, whiche before of neceſſity and force, he was conſtrayned to make: lyke as the Romaynes dyd in all thoſe battailes whiche I haue before recited.
