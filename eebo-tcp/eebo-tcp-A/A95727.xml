            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Dearly beloved in the Lord,</salute>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was for your ſakes that I firſt ſet my thoughts on this enſuing Treatiſe; For, having lived and laboured ſo many years amongſt you already, I cannot look to abide long with you, and therefore have thought it meet to do my endeavour, that you may be able, after my deceaſe, to have thoſe things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in remembrance which you have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly and continually taught <note n="a" place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 12, 13, 14.</note>: Divers of which you will meet with in the reading of this Book, whereof, becauſe I am willing to give you a taſte, I ſhall reckon them up unto you in that order where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you ſhall find them hereafter handled.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> You know I have laboured much with you <note place="margin">1.</note> for the reading of Scripture, and to train up your children to be able to read it; Let me now leave it with you, not only to ſet your Eyes upon this Word of God, but to ſet your Hearts unto it, and (as much as in you lies) to draw and win the hearts of thoſe belonging to you to it; for it is <hi>your life, and their life</hi>

                  </gap>. 46, 47.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:151789:4"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I have taken much pains, (both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, <note place="margin">2.</note> and from houſe to houſe <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 20. 20.</note>,) to teach you, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh you, and perſwade you to a reverent recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the Lords Supper: And now ſhall deſire you to keep in mind that which you often have been minded of, which is, that they who come to that Sacrament ſhould be before God twice; the firſt time, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, the ſecond time, receiving: Neglect not to prepare for Sermons (eſpecially on the Lords-Day) but double your preparation at Sacraments, becauſe there is a double work to be done, in regard of the meeting of two diſtinct Ordinances, that is, the Word and Sacrament to be partaked in together. Waſh your hearts, (as you do your Veſſels every day), but ſcour them, and make them bright for the Lords uſe on Sabbath, and Sacrament-dayes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have heard (eſpecially in late times, wherein the ſhameful and ſhameleſs miſuſing of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, <note place="margin">3</note> hath enforced them to plead for their Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, I ſay, you have heard) many things to move you to a due eſtimation of the Miniſtry; concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which I ſhall ſay no more here, but only this; Take heed of eſteeming too much of ſuch Teachers as are not lawfully called, or too little of ſuch as are. If painful teaching be not continued unto you, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you had it; If it be, do not deſpiſe it; If you cannot have it at home, be not content to be without it; look not one upon another, but where you ſee there is Corn, repair thither <note n="d" place="margin">Gen. 42. 1.</note>. Better ſtir, then ſtarve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Of our Lords Sabbath-day, very much hath been ſpoken to you; the holy obſervation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <note place="margin">4</note> being the Seed-plot and ſupport of all Piety. It is
<pb facs="tcp:151789:4"/>
not a day of idleneſs, but of ſpiritual action <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sabbatwn, non ocii, ſed ſpiritualis acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis materia eſt.</hi> Chryſoſt. <hi>Conc.</hi> 1. <hi>de</hi> Lazaro.</note>. And you that have need to work for your Bodies and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies all the ſix dayes, have the more need to lay all other work aſide on the Sabbath-day, and to look after your ſouls; making it your great, and even your only work then, to labour, not after the food that periſheth, but the meat that endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life <note n="f" place="margin">Joh. 6. 27.</note>. To be very diligent all the Week dayes, and to idle out the Lords-day, is, to be good Husbands and bad Chriſtians; and ſuch bad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are never good Husbands, for they will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done at laſt <note n="g" place="margin">Ames 8. 5, 6, 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> You have ſtill ſeen that I have made Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſing <note place="margin">5.</note> your Children and Servants, one part of my work, of which I ſhall ſay but a word now, namely, that it is ſo hard a thing to get any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſenſe of Religion into the heads and hearts of ancient people, that therein all may ſee, (and you that are Parents and Houſholders ſhould take notice of it) what a neceſſary thing it is, to begin betimes with thoſe that are young, and to inſtruct them in that knowledge and fear of God, which is the beginning of wiſdom.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Family-Prayer hath been often taught <note place="margin">6.</note> and ſought amongſt you; for, How can Houſholders expect the protection and ſucceſs of their perſons and labours in the day, or the ſafe keeping of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their children, ſervants, and ſubſtance in the night, yea, comfort and welfare day or night, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God? or, How can they look to enjoy God without Prayer? for, He will be ſought by the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">Ezek. 36. 3<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>, and (we may ſay) by every houſe in <hi>Iſrael, Zech.</hi> 12. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:151789:5"/>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Repetition of Sermons amongſt you hath been my continual cuſtom; that the things pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely <note place="margin">7.</note> delivered might be better underſtood, better remembred, better ſettled in your hearts; and that the power thereof might be more and better expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in your lives (which, you know, hath been the uſual Prayer before Repetition).</p>
            <p>Laſtly, I have encouraged and excited you to the duty of Singing of Pſalms; And of late, it hath been <note place="margin">8.</note> my manner, in publike, to give you a ſhort Expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every Pſalm, before the ſinging of it, that you might better underſtand and mind the matter contained in it.</p>
            <p>Now, all theſe things I do here recommend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, and again ſet before you, becauſe ſpiritual things, though delivered often to weak hearers, are not quickly underſtood, are hardly committed to memory, are ſoon forgotten, or miſtaken; when a printed Paper may eaſily be looked upon, ſeriouſly thought upon, and by often recourſe to it, a fruitful and more full uſe, may be made of it.</p>
            <p>And whatſoever the things I here communicate (and do, as it were, bequeath to you, as my dear children in the Lord) ſhall be found, in themſelves; yet the relation of Paſtor and People under which we ſtand (and which is now of forty and four years ſtanding), hath (I truſt) ſuch an endearment in it, as to render what I have written more profitable to you, by being more acceptable, more helpful, by being more grateful, and by your looking upon it with an Eye of Love.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned the time of my abode among you, It ſhall not be tedious to me, nor wil it (I hope)
<pb facs="tcp:151789:5"/>
be grievous to you, to review, and run over, in a generality, what hath paſſed in it; And therein will be found, ſomething to be obſerved and marked; ſomething to be humbled for; and ſomething to praiſe God for.</p>
            <p>That which I invite you to take notice of, may be reduced to two heads:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Lords caſting my lot amongſt you, <note n="1" place="margin">1.</note> and calling me to you by a more then ordinary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence: for it was by the free, and (as far as I know) unſollicited naming of me to it by a Perſon of Honour <note n="i" place="margin">L. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Elleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>w<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>re.</hi>
               </note> in whoſe gift it was; and the news of it was ſent unto me then, when (being a Student in <hi>Oxford)</hi> neither this, nor any other Miniſterial charge, was by me, either ſought or thought of; which I mention (and mind you of) the rather, becauſe, though I have had divers earneſt invitations to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to other places of more publike imployment; yet Gods more then uſual Call to this Place, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made me to fear to forſake it, and I have ſtill found much inward ſatisfaction in forſaking all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cleaving to this. For God is the wiſeſt diſpoſer of his Servants, and He knows beſt in what part of his Vineyard to place his Labourers. Yet I condemn not all removals (if they be not ſelf-remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals), but ſet a mark upon ſpecial diſpoſals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> You may not paſs over, without ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous obſervation, another remarkable Providence which is, that whenſoever I have been forced from you, God hath provided otherwiſe for you. Twice (you remember) I have been taken off;</p>
            <p n="1">1. By ſuſpenſion for three years ſpace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I could not be reſolved to read the Book
<pb facs="tcp:151789:6"/>
of Liberty for Sports on the Lords-day.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the diſtractions of the late ſad times of Civil War, about ſo many years more. Yet in both theſe ſeparations from you, God ordered it ſo, that ſuch were preſent with you in all the time of my abſence and reſtraint, by whom you were diligently and profitably inſtructed; which, as it is to be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the one ſide, to ſhew how God provides ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes in the neceſſitated abſence of Paſtors; ſo, on the other ſide, it concerns you, (unto whom this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit hath been vouchſafed) to take notice, that, though you have not ſtill had the ſame Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet God hath not ſuffered you to want that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual husbandry, which, if it be lacking but for a time, Bryars and Thorns grow up, and the envious man ſuddenly ſows his Tares. Remember how much you are bound to that God that hath not left you without a teaching Miniſter, and without Law <note n="k" place="margin">2 Chr. 15. 3.</note>; how much you are bound to be thankful, who have had the heavenly Manna in the Wilderneſs of this World forty years, and upwards; how much you are bound to be fruitful, who have had dreſſers of the Lords Vineyards ſo many years to dig and dung, and by all means to ſeek for fruit <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 13. 7, 8, 9.</note>; and, laſtly, how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable you will be, if the door of your hearts be not opened, at which Chriſt hath ſtill ſtood knocking, four and forty years together.</p>
            <p>In the next place, I muſt not diſſemble, that there is matter of humiliation for us on both parts: for, as <note place="margin">2.</note> on my own part I willingly acknowledge much weakneſs, and want of beſtirring my ſelf among you, with that care, courage, compaſſion, diligence, and reſolution that belongs to a Paſtor; ſo you, on the
<pb facs="tcp:151789:6"/>
other part, have cauſe to take to heart that unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs, whereby, though there hath been precept upon precept, line upon line <note n="m" place="margin">Iſa. 28, 10.</note>, yet ſo little is learned; Not but that I think, and hope that (for the generality) it will be found, that there is more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with Religion in this, then in divers other Congregations that conſiſt of poor and unlearned people; but yet it is to be lamented, that divers know ſo little in compariſon of what they ſhould and might have known, and have much need of milk ſtill, becauſe of their unskilfulneſs in the Word of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 6. 13.</note>. But, beſides this want of knowledge, I may ſay, My God hath humbled me <note n="o" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 21.</note> among you, and given cauſe of bewailing the great want of the power and practiſe of godlineſs. I confeſs, you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me with a conformity to the Ordinances and the Exerciſes of Religion. The matter of grief is, that there hath not been, in ſome, that ſobriety in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; in others, that diligence and laboriouſneſs in their Callings; and in many, that Chriſtian patience that there ought to have been, but in ſtead thereof, many angry, and unbrotherly contentions, which is obſerved to be the diſeaſe, and is indeed, the great ſin <note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 4. 31.</note> and diſhonour of this place, albeit I grant, there have been, of late, more occaſions then ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it; And it's true alſo, that the Devil is very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to make them worſt that are taught moſt: Hence it is, that it is not to be wondered at, neither is Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or the Profeſſion thereof, to be worſe thought of for it, if here, or otherwhere, where the Goſpel is preached, there be breakings forth not only into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and bitterneſs, (which yet is very bad, and a giving a place to the Devil <note n="q" place="margin">Eph. 4. 27.</note>, who plays his pranks,
<pb facs="tcp:151789:7"/>
and works his will very much in a paſſionate heart) but alſo into far fouler evils, as ſwearing, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, going to Witches and Wiſards, (which is a going to Hell for help, when people be under the hand of Heaven). Theſe more hainous offences I only name to you, becauſe I believe divers, that have been guilty of ſome of them, have truly repented, and am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hope that others that are yet faulty in any of them, (being convinced in their Conſciences of the evil and danger of things ſo horrible, and forbearing them more then heretofore) will not only leave them altogether, but abhor them and themſelves for them: Which I deſire the Lord to give them grace to do before it be too late.</p>
            <p>I am weary of this ſad work, and therefore ſhall add only this; It had been a happy thing (my Brethren) both to you and to me, if divers aged perſons had (as I perſwade my ſelf ſome have) become young Chriſtians, and grown ſo wiſe, as not only to live ſoberly and righteouſly (which makes them good Neighbours, but not good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians), but alſo to live godly, that is, to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God, and to aim in all things at the glory of God; O how little is there of this in many that are going into their grave? Nay, in ſtead of this comfort in older people, I have often, with much grief, obſerved, that by ſundry of the younger ſort, who have given ſome good hopes, in the beginning of their time, of their doing well, by their appearing in Catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, Hearing, and Noting Sermons, and Reading ſomething of Scripture at home, as they have been
<pb facs="tcp:151789:7"/>
call'd to it; yet afterwards being grown up, and come to diſcover their diſpoſitions, reading Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath been laid aſide, Catechiſing ſhaken off, Noting Sermons neglected, the vain faſhions of the world followed; and ſo the upſhot and concluſion is, the living of a dull worldly life, with little ſenſe of Religion, and loſing that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with God which they ſeemed to have, or which it was hoped they would have had. The Lord open the eyes of ſuch; and, Bleſſed be God, there are divers young ones that are not ſuch.</p>
            <p>After all this, I ſhall ſay, and may truly ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I write not theſe things to ſhame you,</hi> or as if I thought there were not the like (or greater) cauſe of complaint in other places; <hi>but</hi> I write them <hi>as to my beloved Sons</hi> and Daughters <hi>to warn you</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 14.</note>, and to ſtir up both my ſelf and you, that it may be yet better, by our making the beſt uſe we can of the little, and uncertain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of time of our being together as Paſtor and People.</p>
            <p>I gladly paſs from this, (which is diſpleaſing to me, but I thought needful for you to affect you with your eſtate, that you might never reſt till you be in a good eſtate); And come now to the third, and more comfortable thing, which <note place="margin">3.</note> is matter of Praiſing God, whereof there is much; and that, Not only becauſe I hope, and know, that the great God, (without whom, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters can do nothing, are nothing <note n="ſ" place="margin">Joh 15. 5. 2 Cor. 12. 11.</note>,) hath been pleas'd to make my Miniſtry profitable to divers neighbouring Pariſhes (at my firſt coming
<pb facs="tcp:151789:8"/>
hither, leſs provided for)—but eſpecially for the good effect of it among you of this Congregation; The ſame Lord of the Harveſt that hath brought (I may ſay) laborious preaching into this place, (where there was ſo little ſo long time before), hath bleſſed it here alſo ſo far as that, I doubt not, divers are gone to Heaven that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed it, and are going thither who now enjoy it; Not ſo many (God knows) as were to be wiſhed, but ſo many, as that it ſufficiently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that God had a gracious work to do when he ſent his Word hither, upon the ſouls of poor people in this place.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here forget that which may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm what I have ſaid, and be a ſign of the hearty entertainment of the Goſpel, which is, That you did ſo generally, lovingly, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire my return unto you, after I had been for ſome longer time abſent, and when I was much deſired otherwhere; This new Invitation I took as a ſecond Call, and a new encouragement to ſettle with you: and therefore forſaking all other, I have kept my ſelf (or rather, God hath kept me) only unto you, to ſpend and be ſpent for you <note n="t" place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 15.</note>.</p>
            <p>Here alſo, I do with comfort remember, your greater reſpect to the Lords-day, more knowledge of, and preparation for the Lords-Supper, then is to be found in every place where the Word hath been, together with ſome more reverence of the preſence and ſervice of God in the publike Aſſembly; you do not uſe to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>run the bleſſing (as divers that make it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb facs="tcp:151789:8"/>
but it is a very profane cuſtom, to go away before the Bleſſing be pronounced) but abide the whole time of divine Service; <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>I will not let thee go from me</hi> 
               <note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 32. 26.</note>. They do well, that ſay, and reſolve, Lord, I will not go from thee, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou bleſſe me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But amongſt, and above divers other things, there is great cauſe of bleſſing God for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in attending Gods Word and Ordinances in the late Erroneous and Congregation-ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times, wherein ſo many Chriſtians have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably and fearfully faln from the truth and wayes of God, from whom, I know you have not wanted tentations to depart with them (up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the pretence of greater light, and more holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) from that written Word of God, which they that leave, or croſs and contemn, have no morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-light in them <note n="x" place="margin">Iſa. 8. 20.</note>, and with a reverend and unfained reſpect whereunto, the greateſt godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and holineſs is ever-joyned, for it is a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine according to godlineſs <note n="y" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 3. Tit. 1. 1.</note>, that is, which requires true godlineſs, and ſtirs up and brings men thereunto: But by ſuch tentations many have departed. To that God be glory, who is able to keep you, and hath kept you from ſo falling, <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 24, 25.</p>
            <p>I have little more to ſay, O that I could take off ſome of that which I have ſaid, that is, all former Complaints, by ſeeing that done at laſt, which hath not been done at firſt; I mean, by ſeeing thoſe that have lien in ignorance, become at length, knowing Chriſtians: thoſe that have been wordly minded, ſpiritual Chriſtians, thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:151789:9"/>
that have been looſe and given to drinking, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Chriſtians; and thoſe who have been only ſober, truly godly Chriſtians! O that they that are old, (too like <hi>Nicodemus</hi> that dreamed of entring into his Mothers womb again) might be ſo far awakened and enlightened, as to enter (as it were) into the womb of the Church <note n="z" place="margin">Iſa. 66. 7. 8.</note>, and know experimentally what the great myſtery of Regeneration means by having Chriſt, through the travail of the Miniſtery formed in them <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 4. 19.</note> to the glory of God, the ſealing of the Miniſtry, and the ſalvation of their pretious Souls in the day of Jeſus Chriſt, unto which they do ſo much haſten, and for which they muſt prepare now, or periſh then.</p>
            <p>And (to ſpeak yet again) O that you that are younger, would make conſcience of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring your Creator in the dayes of your youth <note n="b" place="margin">Eccl. 12 1.</note>, and make it your buſineſs to grow in grace as you grow in years, not being ever the elder, the lower, but the taller Chriſtian! It's a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thing when a young man grows in nothing but in height, or in hair, (O how that grows in theſe diſſolute dayes!), or in ſtrength, or in wit, without having the wit to grow in the knowledge and fear of God: I ſay, this is a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable and moſt dangerous thing; for young men may die as well as old; if the Tower of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loe</hi> fall, it kills the youngeſt on whom it falls, as well as the oldeſt <note n="c" place="margin">Luk 13. 4.</note>. In thoſe lead-mines where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in many of you labour, how many younger and ſtronger men have periſhed on a ſudden? Now, if they that dye (whether they be old or young)
<pb facs="tcp:151789:9"/>
do not live in Jeſus while they live, how ſhall they die in Jeſus <note n="d" place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4. 14.—17.</note> when they die? and then, how ſhall they live with him when they are dead? And, Is it your mind, that the Lord Jeſus ſhould be in one place and you (when you are dead, and may die to morrow) in another, and that a contrary place, He in glory, and you in tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that for evermore? Beloved, I am perſwaded better things of you, and pray for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things in you; even things that accompany Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; though (becauſe I would have you to hear) I thus ſpeak <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 6. 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak but once more, and I hope they that hear worſt will hear me; Are you ſure there is an Heaven? Do you believe there is an Hell? Do you know the Soul is Immortal and never dieth as the Body doth? And are you further perſwaded, that where this never-dying Soul lodgeth and lyeth the firſt night after your death, (whether it be in Heaven or in Hell) there it and you muſt lodge for ever? I ſay, Do you think all theſe things to be true? Let me then beſeech you to ſhew your ſelves Chriſtians, or to ſhew your ſelves Men <note n="f" place="margin">Iſa. 46. 8.</note>, and live not ſecurely in that looſe courſe, walk not ſtubbornly in that wide way, which will certainly bring to the worſe place; but, on the contrary, Strive to enter in at the ſtraight-gate, and go in that narrow way (though it be againſt the hair, I mean, your own corrupt and undoing hearts) by walking wherein, you ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly come at laſt to the better place, and poſſeſs that everlaſting life, which is the gift of God, through Jeſus Chriſt <note n="g" place="margin">Rom 6. 23.</note> our Lord.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:151789:10"/>
For this purpoſe I have written theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Directions and Admonitions, as not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Guides, or Goads <note n="h" place="margin">Eccl. 12. 11.</note> you will have, unto that which is good, when I am gone; but the better you obſerve theſe and all other godly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, the more hope you may have to have more of them, mean-while I leave theſe with you: which, if you have not other helps, will be the more needful; and, if you have other helps, will make them the more uſeful.</p>
            <p>That I might be more profitable to you, I have endeavoured plainneſs; yet, I confeſs, there is not ſo much of it as I intended or deſired: for all men have not that gift of making known their mind to others in a plain and familiar way; And, (beſides that), ſomething muſt be yielded to more ripe Readers; and, in divers things, the matter hath carryed me above the capacity of many of you; but the better uſe you make of that which you do underſtand, the ſooner you will underſtand the reſt; and you being acquainted ſo long with my way of teaching, and manner of ſpeaking, may know and find out (better then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) what my meaning is.</p>
            <p>To conclude, Remember, that what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour long ſince ſaid to prove himſelf the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, is fulfilled to you, which is this, <hi>The poor have the Goſpel preached to them</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, with Luk. 4. 18.</note>, or they are the perſons that are Goſpel-lized, that is, the Goſpel is theirs with all the comforts of it; but know alſo, that this is not meant of the poor in ſtate only, but (which a poor ſtate oft is, and ever ſhould be, an help unto) of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:151789:10"/>
that are poor in ſpirit <note n="k" place="margin">Matth. 5. 3.</note>, that (though they have lived honeſtly among their neighbours) ſee themſelves undone without a Saviour; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when they have little or nothing elſe (or whether they have or no) make ſure to have Him; labour you to be in the number of thoſe that are thus ſpiritually poor, (as by the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, many of you are outwardly low). It's a lamentable thing when they that have little in this world, ſhall have nothing in the world to come, not ſo much as a drop of water to cool their tongue in that place of torment <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 16. 24.</note>. That it may not be ſo with you, Let me beſeech you to ſtudy your Souls, to eſteem the words of Gods mouth (whether you read them, or hear them <note n="m" place="margin">2 Chr. 36. 12.</note>,) more then your neceſſary food <note n="n" place="margin">Job 23. 12.</note>; to account one thing neceſſary, which is to ſit at Jeſus feet, and hear his Word from thoſe whom he ſends to ſpeak to you <note n="o" place="margin">Luk. 10. 39, 41. <hi>with</hi> Luk. 10. 16.</note>. This will not hinder you from labouring for your living, for the Word of Chriſt binds you to it <note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 4. 28.</note>, but it's neceſſary to know there is a more neceſſary labour, that is, to know what God would have done firſt, and to do it after; For your aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance wherein, I deſire you to make conſcience of the holy Exerciſes of Religion which are here commended unto you, that ſo you may be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for bringing forth the fruits of godlineſs in your whole converſation; Conſider what I have ſaid, and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things <note n="q" place="margin">2 Tim. 2, 7.</note>, and ſo bleſs unto you theſe, and all other Inſtructions, that you may thrive in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, grow in grace, and perſevere in faith and

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lbeit, the enſuing Inſtructions were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely framed for my own Charge, yet finding them to grow under my hand to a more full Treatiſe then was at firſt in my thoughts, and that now they are like to come into many hands, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it needful to ſay ſomething by way of Preface, that what I have written may be more uſeful to any that ſhall think fit to read it.</p>
            <p>That which I have to ſay, concerneth the matter hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the manner of writing.</p>
            <p>The matter is wholly practical, ſave that neceſſity hath compelled me for the eſtabliſhing of practical Truths, to mixe here and there that which is ſomething controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal.</p>
            <p>All (as you may ſee) is referred unto two heads, that is, <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Family-</hi>duties; Of each ſort there are four. I ſhall, before-hand, give you a taſt of them all.</p>
            <p>The firſt, of the firſt ſort, is the reading of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, <note place="margin">1.</note> which may well be put in the firſt place, becauſe the written Word, is not only the Foundation of our Faith <note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 2. 20.</note>, and the well-ſpring of ſaving wiſdom <note n="b" place="margin">2 Tim. 3 15.</note>, but alſo
<pb facs="tcp:151789:12"/>
the ground of Godlineſs <note n="c" place="margin">Tit. 1. 1.</note>, the guide of Practiſe <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 1. 10, 11.</note>, and a divine Directory for the performance of every good du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereby not only the Miniſter and Man of God, but the People of God, the Sons and Daughters of the Lord God Almighty, are educated unto, and throughly furniſhed for, every good work <note n="e" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 17.</note>. For the Scriptures are compoſed, not as the writings of Heathens, for vain-glory, but for mens Salvation; and the Spirit of God hath written them in a plain language, that all may eaſily ſee what is ſaid (at leaſt, as far as fufficeth, for the guiding of their faith and carriage, and the ſafety of their ſouls,) and that no ſimple men (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſpeaks <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Concione.</hi> 3. <hi>De Lazaro.</hi>
               </note>,) might make this excuſe that the Scriptures are hard: for though there be difficulties therein, to take down mens pride; yet there is enough ſo plain, that not only Gods workman <note n="g" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 15.</note>, (that is, the Miniſter) but any workman may ſee the way to Heaven, if he have eyes to ſee it; for, to ſee, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ſight as well as light.</p>
            <p>In the next place, there is more particular Inſtructions given concerning the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, and <note place="margin">2.</note> that not without need; For where Salvation lies at the one end, and Damnation at the other, there's great need of Direction; that where we ſeek for the better of theſe, we may not find the worſe.</p>
            <p>In the handling of this Subject, I have been conſtrained unto a little further ſearch, both to give an account of my own ſollicitouſneſs about that Sacrament; and withall, by reaſon of the different perſwaſions of ſome learned and godly men, who I hope, will candidly interpret my Diſcourſe, becauſe I have endeavoured to ſpeak accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſenſe of Scripture, the conſentient judgement of the Church of God, and with declaration of due reſpect to thoſe from whom I ſomewhat diſſent.</p>
            <p>This Sacrament-doctrine I have, in the cloſe, digeſted into Queſtions and Anſwers; not only becauſe that way of teaching is moſt eaſie and familiar, but alſo to lend ſome aſſiſtance unto godly Chriſtians for the better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring of thoſe belonging to their charge for that great
<pb facs="tcp:151789:12"/>
Ordinance, by the inſtructing and catechiſing of them before-hand in thoſe things which it concerns ſuch as would be worthy Communicants to be acquainted with; what I have now publiſhed for this end, I have long ſince framed, and have ſtill uſed in the viſiting of the Families of thoſe committed to my care, that they might come to the Sacrament with more knowledge and conſcience: But that which I conceived fit for them, will not be, (I ſhall hope), unprofitable to others. How many wayes have painful Paſtors uſed to acquaint the People of this Nation, with God and his Ordinances, and to work in them a reverent reſpect thereunto, ſome one way, and ſome another? But whether it be <hi>I or they</hi> 
               <note n="h" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 11.</note>, it's the ſame thing for ſubſtance, and (perhaps) ſome may think ſo well of this way as to receive ſome benefit by it, and then I have what I aim at in it.</p>
            <p>The third Chapter concerneth the Miniſtry, and may ſerve alſo as an help and incitement to a religious and profitable <note place="margin">3.</note> hearing of the Word, albeit I make not a diſtinct Head of that Argument; for neglect of ſerious hearing of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ariſeth from a low or no account of thoſe that preach them: As the preaching of the Word by men formed out of the clay <note n="i" place="margin">Job 33. 6.</note>, and called to that high office is Gods Ordinance for mans Salvation <note n="k" place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 21. 2 Cor. 4. 6, 7.</note>; ſo the holding of ſuch in reputation is mans aſſiſtance for the receiving of the benefit of it, it being very unlikely that men ſhould be guided and ruled by thoſe whom they do not regard. As long as there was any hope of the Jews, the Preface to their profiting was this, They will <hi>reverence</hi> my Son <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 21. 37.</note>; and a baſe opinion of him, or his being without any honour among them, made him uſeleſs to them <note n="m" place="margin">Mark. 6. 3, 4, 5.</note>.</p>
            <p>The thing much thought of in this part of the Treatiſe, was, and is, to help to reduce (if God pleaſe ſo far to bleſs poor endeavours) thoſe many Chriſtians, who, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſtemper of the times (for I am more willing to fix it upon that, then to think that ſo diſmal a thing as their departure is, ſhould ariſe out of their own hearts), I ſay, who by reaſon of the diſtemper and tentation of the late
<pb facs="tcp:151789:13"/>
times, have ſo dangerouſly forſaken a duely called Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, which God hath in ſingular mercy and compaſſion to mankinde <note n="n" place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 15.</note> appointed, and, to the worlds end <note n="o" place="margin">Matth, 28. 20.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in his Church, for the perfecting of the Saints, by their work, and for the edification of the body of Chriſt, and in particular, for the preventing of their being toſſed <hi>to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the ſleight of men, and cunning craftineſs whereby they lie in wait to deceive</hi> 
               <note n="p" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 12, 13, 14.</note>. Into which evil of being wafted away from God and his wayes, they have ſadly fal'n, who have fal'n away from an <hi>Ordained</hi> Miniſtry, and therewithall from all Gods Ordinances; but if God love them, and they love God, he will certainly bring their hearts back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, <note n="q" place="margin">1 King. 18. 37.</note>. If they be Children they cannot alwayes want bread, nor refuſe to receive it from thoſe Officers and Stewards, whom the Lord hath made Rulers of his Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, to give them their portion of meat in due ſeaſon <note n="r" place="margin">Luk. 12. 42.</note>. But howſoever it fall out with ſome of them, who under a pretence of being more perfect Saints, diſdain that Miniſtry, whereby (if God ſpeak true) Saints are to be perfected, and that till they come to a perfect man <note n="s" place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 13.</note> or to a perfect manly knowledge, which will never be till they come to heaven <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 11.</note>; I ſay, however it be with ſome ſuch (as namely, thoſe that have forſaken the written Word of God, of whom there is leaſt hope) Yet, the things here laid down will ſerve (I truſt) to confirm thoſe who through the great goodneſs of God have been upheld, and held in a right and regular way, notwithſtanding all ſolicitations and tentations to the contrary. As for others, all I ſhall ſay, is this, that perhaps ſome right Church-government, or ſome grievous Church-chaſtiſement, will at length, bring thoſe Profeſſors of Religion, and godlineſs toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whom a vaſt and too-unlimited a liberty, (good both for doing and undoing, as men were right or light) hath ſet ſo far and fearfully aſunder.</p>
            <p>It's more then time for me to haſten to the fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral head, wherein I have treated of the Chriſtian or <note place="margin">4.</note> Lords-day Sabbath purpoſely, but in order thereunto have
<pb facs="tcp:151789:13"/>
ſpoken ſomething of the Sabbath in generall.</p>
            <p>The great difficulty that there is in this Argument, I do with all humility, and deep ſenſe of my own weakneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and therefore deſire not that any thing here af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed ſhould be received but according as by Scripture, and Scripture-reaſon, it ſhall be found confirmed. But withal, I muſt crave leave to put the Reader in mind, that to judge rightly of, to reverence, relliſh and receive, this, and divers other practical Truths, (namely thoſe mentioned in this Treatiſe), two things are very needful,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A due reſpect to the General Rules of Holineſs laid down in the Word of God. And</item>
               <item>2. A Principle of Grace in the Heart (for the natural man receiveth not ſpiritual things <note n="u" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note>,) that ſo there may be a conſenting and cloſing with the Reaſon of Scripture, and the wiſdom of God in the generalities thereof. Let all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians therefore in the fear of God, and ſetting the Word of God before their eyes, indifferently and conſcientiouſly conſider thoſe four things which I ſhall now propound, and preſent unto them.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Whether it be not more for Gods glory, the preſerving and perpetuating of Religion, and the intereſt and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity <note place="margin">1.</note> of the Souls of men, to have a ſet and intire day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to meet together in publike Worſhip for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, acknowledging, ſerving and enjoying of God, then it is to have no ſuch day?</p>
            <p n="2">2. If ſuch a day be granted, Whether it be not needful <note place="margin">2.</note> and beſt, that it ſhould be within that proportion of time, which God himſelf hath deſcribed and preſcribed in the fourth Commandement, that is; Whether it muſt not be a weekly day, or whether it will ſerve as well (for the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named ends) to have it left to men to lay out for their God, a day of their own deviſing, and within ſuch a circuit of time as they think fit? If any will reſt a matter of ſo great a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon Eccleſiaſtical conſtitution, I wonder what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men may or will aſſume ſo much to themſelves as to appoint a day in their own deviſed diſtance, and impoſe it to be obſerved on the whole Community of Chriſtians;
<pb facs="tcp:151789:14"/>
And if there be not in all the Chriſtian world the ſame ſet day, how will the honour of God be diminiſhed, which by the meeting of all the people of God together, to do hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to him, at one and the ſame time, is ſo remarkably heightened?</p>
            <p n="3">3. If there muſt be a weekly day of Gods own Inſtitution, whether there be any other day of the week that can lay ſo <note place="margin">3.</note> good a claim to that ſacred Inſtitution, and that hath ſuch a divine Character put upon it, as the firſt day of the week, on which our Saviour reſted from all his work; and compleated the Redemption of Man-kind in his glorious Reſurrection, on which our great Lord hath ſet his own Name, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture <note n="x" place="margin">Rev. 1. 10.</note>, wherein alſo the holy Obſervation thereof is preſented in Chriſtian meetings, and ſuch acts and exerciſes as ſuit with the ſolemn time of Chriſtians aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves together <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 20. 7. &amp; 1 Cor. 16. 1,</note>, And which is generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to be an Apoſtolical Preſcription, and ſo amounts to a divine Inſtitution <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 37.</note>?</p>
            <p n="4">4. This day being divinely inſtituted, whether God will <note place="margin">4.</note> not be, that day, better ſerved, and the ſpiritual profit of Chriſtians better provided for, by making it an intire day of Reſt holy to the Lord and to ſpiritual uſes; or by mixing our work with Gods, and Play with Piety.</p>
            <p>Such things as theſe, (and more weighty communications of better Writers) being ſeriouſly conſidered, will, I doubt not, work on thoſe who deſire to walk with God, willingly and thankfully to ſequeſter themſelves from all other things to enjoy a bleſſed communion with their Lord every Lords-day, and one day in ſeaven to be (as it were) in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Thus of the firſt part of this little Tractate, and of the Chriſtian duties therein contained.</p>
            <p>The Second part treateth of Family-duties.</p>
            <p>I begin with Family-Catechiſing, an exerciſe exceeding needful &amp; uſeful, that they that are young may be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">1.</note> with God betimes, and thereby, if they die ſooner, may be fitter for his Kingdom, and fitter for his ſervice, if they live longer. God would have all to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth <note n="a" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 4.</note>; but, as blind Paſtors and
<pb facs="tcp:151789:14"/>
People, ſo blind Houſholders and Houſholds, fill hell <note n="b" place="margin">Mat. 15. 14.</note>; And mean while make the World much worſe then elſe it would be; For, Families are the original of all other greater Societies; and want of Religious Education there, is the cauſe why there are ſo few good ſervants; for how ſhal an ignorant Son or Daughter that hath no knowledge or conſcience, be a good Servant? And why there are ſo few good Wives and Husbands; for how ſhall they be good to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that were never bred up to be good aſunder? Yea, is it not from hence, that there are ſo many leſs ſound, or leſs godly Miniſters, namely, becauſe they have not been ſo trained up as young <hi>Timothy</hi> was, who from a child had known the holy Scriptures <note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note>? Its true, that ſometimes Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is in the houſe, and yet not in the heart (at leaſt, of moſt in the Houſe) but, if it be in the heart, I am ſure it will be in the houſe <note n="d" place="margin">Deut. 6. 6, 7. Joſh. 24. 15. Act. 10. 1, 2.</note>: Yea, (as there ſhall be occaſion) in every houſe <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 20. 20.</note>; for, the grace that is in a ſincere and right heart, is like the oyntment of ones right hand, which bewrayeth it ſelf <note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 27. 16.</note>, being ever un-ſatisfied, unleſs it diſperſe and ſend abroad the ſweet ſavour of the knowledge of Chriſt in every place <note n="g" place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 14.</note>, eſpecially, the Vicinity, but moſt of all the Family.</p>
            <p>I proceed from this, to the thing I principally aimed at, and indeed, only intended when I firſt ſet upon this work, <note place="margin">2,</note> namely, to ſet forward the Duty of Family-Prayer; For, though God will do much for the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and for every houſe in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet his Will is, to be ſought that he may do it for them <note n="h" place="margin">Ezek. 36. 37.</note>. Heaven is a rich ſtorehouſe, and we have a <hi>Joſeph</hi> there that is willing to nouriſh us, leſt we and our houſhold, and all that we have come to poverty <note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 47. 11.</note>; yet its neceſſary for us to go thither with our ſuits and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications (as the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> went into <hi>Egypt</hi> with their ſacks) that ſo opening our mouths wide; the Lord Jeſus may fill them <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 81. 10.</note>. Ther's treaſure enough in God's Houſe for us and for our houſes; but when God hath put a Key into our hand (that is, Prayer) to open the door, we muſt either turn the Key, or not expect the Treaſure; men luſt, and have not; labour, and have not; fight and ſcramble for the world,
<pb facs="tcp:151789:15"/>
and yet they have not (or have not in mercy, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13. 11.) becauſe they ask not <note n="l" place="margin">Jam. 4. 2.</note>. Now becauſe ſome weak Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may ſay with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Behold, I cannot ſpeak (I cannot pray) for I am a child <note n="m" place="margin">Jer. 1. 6.</note>, therefore I thought it would be profitable for their help and education (as it were) to the duty of Prayer, to put ſome Prayers into their hands (thought it be God only that muſt put a ſpirit of Prayer into their hearts <note n="n" place="margin">Zech. 12. 10.</note>.) This is a courſe that heretofore hath found acceptance, but now it needs an Apology, conſidering that in late times, Forms have been ſo much out of requeſt, that God's external Ordinances and holy Inſtitutions, of one kind and another, have paſſed and ſuffered reproach, and that with divers of better report heretofore (but None but God knows who are his <note n="o" place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19.</note>) under the contemptible name of Forms of Religion, too low for Chriſtians of the upper Form. Now, if any yet there be, that count themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Ordinances, I muſt leave them, as far above my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. But as for modeſt Chriſtians, who, howſoever they may be ſomewhat doubtful about the uſe of Forms of Prayer, yet are teachable and capable of ſatisfaction, I ſhall endevour to give it them; And therefore I willingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg (and would have both thoſe of my own Charge, and other Chriſtians to know) that ſuch Forms are not ſo properly intended for grown and exerciſed Chriſtians (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit (they being humble) will know they may receive help, and improvement from them) but they are compoſed for young Beginners; and for them alſo, not to tie them up, but to train them up (as they uſe to do little Children) to go firſt by a Form, that leaving the form, which was a great help at firſt, they may go, at length, on their own legs, without leaning on ſuch Supports.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed <hi>Bradford,</hi> that high and humble Martyr, when he was in Priſon, wrote a prayer for his Mother that ſhe might learn how to pray for him, and deſired her to get it by heart, and to ſay it dayly; and he wrote another for all her houſe, to make uſe of in their Evening Prayer <note n="p" place="margin">

            <p>Unto which I add, that although poor and low, yea, the loweſt, Chriſtians may and ſhould take more liberty in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb facs="tcp:151789:15"/>
between God and themſelves, and not be afraid or backward to groan out their deſires before the Lord; yet the aſſiſtance and ſupplies of Prayers made to their hands, is, for ſuch, needful to enable them to appear before others, and to be their mouth in the duty of Prayer: I ſay, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that neither the ſervice may be contemptible to thoſe that be bad, nor unprofitable and tedious to thoſe that be better. Briefly, <hi>Formes of Prayer</hi> (whereof the ea<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e many in Scripture <note n="q" place="margin">Numb. 6. 23. Hoſ. 14 2, 1 Chron. 16. 7 Luke 11. 2. Mat. 26. 44.</note>,) being framed according to Scripture, cannot be juſtly condemned; but I muſt add one thing more, and that is, that <hi>formal praying</hi> which idle Chriſtians, by the abuſe of forms, may ſoon fall into, can never be juſtified.</p>
            <p>The third Family-duty is Repetition of Sermons, which, being carefully done, is the preſervative of a right Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <note place="margin">3.</note> for why are people ever learning, and never come to the knowledge of the truth, or are eaſily carryed from it but becauſe they take Miniſters words, without Miniſters grounds? and ſo, when other Teachers bring them a new Doctrine, they like the laſt and the new Teacher, and ſell the former and the old truth; whereas, if they did review what they hear, and (as the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note>,) ſearch the Scriptures, quoted by Miniſters, and ſo find by examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that what they have heard, is founded on the Word of God, and upon the credit of a divine Teſtimony, they would not change their mindes (having grace in them) becauſe it is impoſſible for God to change His; nor can any word come from Him that is not perfect, and of perpetual verity. This recalling and repeating of Sermons, and endevouring that the Houſhold may ſee how they agree with Scripture, hath ever been the character of more Religious Families, and a great means to make all in it (eſpecially if they be called to give account of what they have heard, and heard again) to profit in Religion; For, as he that repeateth a matter ſeparateth very Friends <note n="ſ" place="margin">Prov. 17. 9.</note>, to wit, becauſe the repetition makes it freſh in memory, cauſeth a greater obſervation, and leaveth a greater impreſſion; ſo he that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peateth profitable matters, edifieth very Weaklings, and helpeth much the hearers, to underſtand, mark, and mind what hath been formerly delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:151789:16"/>
But whileſt I thus perſuade you to repetition, the ſaying of an excellent Servant of God <note n="t" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Preſton.</hi>
               </note> comes to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which is this in effect, that as Kine and Sheep return not to their owners, graſs and hay, but, milk, and fleece, and fleſh; ſo Sermons are not to be returned and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only by reading notes, but Chriſtians are to repeat them in their lives, by being ſound in opinion, growing in grace, and godly in all their carrage.</p>
            <p>The laſt duty is, Singing of Pſalms, to be uſed principally on our Lords Sabbath day <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 92. title.</note>, but every other day, need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; becauſe every day hath its mercy, for which God is to be praiſed; or if it hath its affliction, in that alſo God is to be bleſſed <note n="x" place="margin">Job 1. 21.</note>, and there are Pſalms ſutable to every affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction—to ſanctifie it unto us by miniſtring matter of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction—and to bear up our ſpirits in it, by affording matter of Conſolation. It is every day likewiſe, a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Exerciſe, becauſe the Book of Pſalms containeth in it abundant matter of heavenly meditation, and ſpiritual edification. And as it is both needful and profitable; ſo it is an exerciſe very pleaſant, for it awakeneth the ſoul, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſpirits, cheareth up the heart, and generally revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth both the inward and the outward man Other duties are a Chriſtians work, This is his holy recreation, begun here, and to be compleated in heaven. I cannot leave this, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reciting what Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> (that hath done ſuch eminent ſervice to the Church of God) relateth of himſelf; it's this, <hi>When by the goodneſs of God I hnd willingly forſaken my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and all that I had that I might freely ſerve Chriſt, it came to paſs at my firſt entry into the publick aſſembly of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that the company did ſing this (that is, the</hi> 91) <hi>Pſalm; by the ſinging whereof, as though I had heard God himſelf calling me particularly, I felt my ſelf ſo comforted that I have kept it ſince that time moſt dearly graven in my heart: and I may truly wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs this before God, that I have received marvellous comfort by it, both in ſickneſs and in ſorrow, not only by meditating it when I was ſmitten with the Peſtilence, and the ſame plague had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected my Family, even four times, but alſo in other moſt grievous tentations</hi> 
               <note n="y" place="margin">See this and more in <hi>Beza</hi> his argument of the 91 Pſalm prefixed before his Paraphraſe upon it.</note>. Let all profit by his experience, and obſerve their own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:151789:16"/>
Thus have I given a Summary account of the matters handled in this Treatiſe: Concerning each of which, I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire the Reader to caſt his eye upon the Margent, to ſearch the Scriptures alleaged, and weigh the Reaſons annexed: for I ſhall eaſily grant that a mans conſtitution is apt to inſinuate it ſelf into his meditation and diſcourſe, perhaps too much (for in every conſtitution, as there is a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or an help to vertue; ſo a danger alſo) and divers other things may lead a man aſide before he is aware; Albeit therefore, I am not conſcious to my ſelf of offering any thing, but that which (as far as my underſtanding reacheth) is right, and do abhor to impoſe upon the conſciences of men, which God alone can bind; yet, let the Reader, in the reading of mine, or any mans words elſe, ſet ſtill before him the Word of God.</p>
            <p>The manner of Writing (which is the other thing I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) I have ſpoken ſomewhat to in the former Epiſtle. It is not ſo plain and perſpicuous as (in regard of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort of Chriſtians) I intended, but the Babes of Chriſt will here find milk; that is, many things fitted to their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and if there be any ſtronger meat, it will ſuit better with more mature Chriſtians. All men know, or may know, that Miniſters are neceſſitated to extend ſuch abilities as God hath given them, to the utmoſt (which is hardly done without ſome obſcurity) for the pleading of the cauſes of God: And that becauſe, as fleſh and bloud riſeth up in arms, &amp; muſtereth all its forces againſt the truth of God; ſo doth it alſo againſt the way of godlineſs; whereby, tho the adverſaries thereof, cannot deſtroy it, yet they prevail ſo far as to darken it, and to caſt ſo many miſts before mens eyes, that it is not eaſie for the ordinary Traveller to diſcern the right way, nor for their Guides to clear it up unto them.</p>
            <p>However, I hope they that have good and honeſt hearts, will hereby receive ſome good; and from others, that write of the ſame things, they may receive more; and by humble and faithful Prayer to God, with diligent ſtudying of his Word, moſt of all.</p>
            <p>I crave pardon for being ſo tedious in this Epiſtle, which
<pb facs="tcp:151789:17"/>
becauſe it may ſerve, not only for an introduction, but as a Supplement alſo to that which followeth; the Reader may pleaſe the rather to bear with it.</p>
            <p>I have nothing now to do, but to leave with Chriſtians this one neceſſary Admonition; that is, not to content themſelves with thoſe outward exerciſes of Religion that they ſhall here find urged, but to ſtudy, and by theſe helps, to ſtrive after the power of Godlineſs. For though a man cannot be Pious and Religious, without obſerving the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means of Godlineſs, the principal whereof, was the Sanctification of the Sabbath (as one that was not ſo good a friend to the Sabbath as he ſhould have been, notes well <note n="t" place="margin">Primr.</note>) yet all outward duties loſe their end and their eſtimation, yea, they ſerve as ſad witneſſes againſt them that uſe them moſt, if the reality of Religion, and the power and exerciſe of grace, doth not appear in their converſation; for, <hi>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of Religion, are for the exerciſe,</hi> and are not to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (much leſs to be reſted on) in ſtead of Godlineſs <note n="u" place="margin">
                  <hi>Sicut ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diè concionum au litum, cujus finis eſt pietas, mulli pro ipſa pietate habent, &amp;c.</hi> Scult. &amp; Bockſtad. in Epiſt. ad Rom. cap. 10. v. 5.</note>, but to nouriſh Godlineſs, and to ſtead us in the way of Holineſs.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> plants, and <hi>Apollo</hi> waters, the Lord give the increaſe! And ſo ſanctifie unto you theſe poor labours, that thereby one cubit may be added to your ſpiritual ſtatute.</p>
            <p>May I attain that end, and obtain your earneſt prayers for the paſſing of the little remainder of my pilgrimage here in fear, and faith, and faithfulneſs; you will abundantly recompence him, who is, and ſhall remain,</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is one of thoſe faithful and joyful ſayings of Scripture that are <hi>worthy of all accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi>

                  <note n="b" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 8.</note>.</p>
               <p>But then we muſt conſider, that as Godlineſs hath the Promiſes, ſo the Promiſes will have Godlineſs; and bind thoſe that <hi>have them, to cleanſe themſelves from all filthineſs both of fleſh and ſpirit, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect holineſs in the fear of God</hi> 
                  <note n="c" place="margin">2 Cor. 7. 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>The promoting of this Holineſs is the purpoſe of this Treatiſe; which propoundeth, recommendeth, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for, divers ſuch <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and <hi>Family</hi>-duties, as are the wayes and means appointed of God for the improving of godlineſs.</p>
               <p>Thereunto the <hi>Reading of the Word,</hi> (which in the <hi>firſt Part</hi> and place is mentioned) much availeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Doctrine of the Word is <hi>the Doctrine which is</hi> according to godlineſs <note n="d" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 3. Tit. 1. 1.</note>; it is <hi>the ground and guide of godlineſs.—</hi>As alſo an often and prepared <hi>receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper,</hi> the ſpiritual nouriſhment whereof is for <hi>the growth of Godlineſs;</hi> The <hi>Miniſtry</hi> likewiſe makes much for Piety, for that's <hi>the School of Godlineſs</hi> 
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 43 11. 1 Sam 12. 23</note>.—And the religious <hi>obſerving of the Lords-day-Sabbath,</hi> for that's <hi>the ſupport</hi> of the Trade <hi>of Godlineſs;</hi> as Market, and Fair-dayes are of ordinary Trading.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:151789:20"/>
The four <hi>Houſhold duties,</hi> deſcribed in the <hi>Second Part,</hi> aim at no other but the very ſame end, that is, the advantage and advancement of Godlineſs; For, By <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Catechiſing,</hi> Godlineſs <hi>ſpreadeth</hi> 
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Gen 18. 19. 2 Tim. 2. 2.</note>; By <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-Prayer, it</hi> (and every thing elſe) proſpereth: By <hi>Repetition of Sermons</hi> (as by whetting <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 6. 7.</note>,) <hi>it is ſharpened</hi> (hath a better edge);—And by <hi>ſinging of Pſalms it is ſweetned,</hi> for thereby not only the heart is more holy, but all other good exerciſes and aſsiſtances of godlineſs are leſs heavy.</p>
               <p>I hope therefore that they that look after godlineſs (and in vain do they look for heaven who look not after it), will accept of theſe Helps; for, albeit I willingly grant, that ſome of theſe means of godlineſs may be uſed by thoſe that are not truly godly (Hypocriſie being the Ape of Sincerity), yet I may boldly affirm (on the other ſide) that all that are truly good, will be afraid to omit <note n="h" place="margin">
                     <hi>What is ſaid of Prayer, is true of all the reſt,</hi> Every one that is godly will pray, <hi>Pſal. 32. 6.</hi>

it belongs to all Chriſtians as well (though not as much) as to a Miniſter, to <hi>exhort and admoniſh</hi>

I do not mean as intruding to the office of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but in a way of charity and brotherly aſſiſtance; And moreover, ſince it belongs to Saints <hi>to contend for the faith</hi> committed to their truſt <note n="p" place="margin">Jude v. 3.</note>, it will follow from thence, that they ſhould have ſome convincing skill alſo for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maintaining of the truth of God, which is to be had by reading and ſearching the Word of God, by which <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> were enabled to inſtruct <hi>Apollo</hi>

                     <p>Thirdly, The reading of Scripture is commanded the People of God generally, for unto them it is ſaid, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>

                        <note n="ſ" place="margin">Mal. 4. 4.</note>. The intent of which Scripture is this, that ſince they were to be many years, without <hi>Prophets</hi> to preach to them <hi>(Malachi</hi> being the laſt Prophet of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment): therefore, that they might neither loſe their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, nor <hi>forget their conſolation,</hi> they ſhould diligently read and ſtudy the Scriptures, which are called <hi>the Law of Moſes,</hi> not as excluding the Prophets, (for under the name of the <hi>Law</hi> the Prophets are alſo contained, inſomuch that what was written in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and in the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> is ſaid to be written in the <hi>Law</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Joh. 10. 31. 1 Cor. 14. 21.</note>; but as making the <hi>Law</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Prophets were the Interpreters and Appliers) the ſum of the Old Teſtament-doctrine, to be <hi>remembered</hi> (and therefore to be read, the often reading thereof being the beſt way to keep it in mind) and that by the generality of Gods people when their Teachers were gone.</p>
                     <p>Unto this we may add, that when there were again Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet our Saviour ſaith, (and he ſaith it to the <hi>Jews</hi> generally <note n="u" place="margin">Joh. 5. 16,</note>) <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> Joh. 5. 39. meaning the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament; And they that are bound

and commanded to <hi>ſearch</hi> a Book, are—(ſure) therewithal, bound and commanded (if they can) to ſee and read it; We ſay, He's well <hi>read</hi> in a Book that hath well ſearched it.</p>
                     <p>And for the New Teſtament, and Goſpel-Word, the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> counſel and command to Chriſtians is, <hi>Let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly</hi> 
                        <note n="x" place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note>. Now, though the Word may dwell plentifully in a good Hearer, yet by hearing and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both, it muſt needs dwell in him more <hi>richly;</hi> Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhews that religious Readers are rich and ripe in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-knowledge.</p>
                     <p>Thus for <hi>Scripture-commands;</hi> Now for <hi>Scripture-reaſons</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Scriptures are written for the uſe of the whole Church; either for their uſe, or to leave them without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe: <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 1.</note> and therefore it's urg'd as a great aggravation of <hi>Iſraels</hi> ſin, <hi>I have written to himthe great things of my Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing</hi> 
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Hoſ. 8. 12.</note>. God might have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to make known his mind (as at firſt he did) by <hi>tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and delivering his Will by word of mouth from one to another, had it not been for this (as for one reaſon), that by writing, the Word of God might be more expoſed to the veiw of Miniſters and People, that both might read it, and ſo the better ſtudy it, and meditate upon it. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did the Apoſtles write their Epiſtles to ſeveral Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, if it were not the duty of Chriſtians to whom they wrote to read them? Hence the <hi>Apoſtle Paul</hi> (after he had written to the <hi>Epheſians)</hi> ſpeaks thus, <hi>Whereby when ye read</hi> (which ſhews they were to read) <hi>ye may underſtand my knowledge in the myſtery of Chriſt</hi> 
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Ephe. 3. 4.</note>. Unto this purpoſe the ſame Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle otherwhere ſaith, <hi>When this Epiſtle is read among you, cauſe that it may be read alſo in the Church of the</hi> Laodiceans; and mark what follows, <hi>and that ye alſo read the Epiſtle from</hi> Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea <note n="a" place="margin">Col. 4. 16.</note>. Now it's true that thoſe Epiſtles were to be read before the Churches in their publick meetings: but for the ſame reaſon for which they were to be read <hi>to</hi> them they were (if they could have them in private) to be read <hi>by</hi> them, that is, that they might the better make uſe of them:

Of this nature alſo is that other Scripture wherein the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi> chargeth the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that this Epiſtle be <hi>read to all the holy brethren</hi>

                     <p>And amongſt us, Chriſtians heretofore (though now that firſt love be lamentably loſt) were inquiſitive how much they ſhould read every day, that ſo the Scriptures might be read over in a year, which ſhewed they were in the way to be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, becauſe the Scriptures make wiſe to Salvation; and if they did read them with reverence and delight, that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be good already, it being uſed as a good reaſon to prove the Scriptures are the Word of God, becauſe there was never any Book that had wiſdom in it, but natural wiſe men liked it, unleſs it were Gods Book (or Books framed out of that): which ſhews that none can like the Word of God but by the Spirit of God, and that they that like it, have that Spirit; yea, we may count it a clearer ſign of grace to delight in reading Scripture then in hearing Sermons, <hi>viz.</hi> in this reſpect, becauſe in Sermons there is a mixture of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſufficiency, and ſo it is not ſo eaſily diſcerned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which draws the ear and heart of the Hearer, be Gods Word or mans wit; but to read, and to be ſatisfied (as it were with marrow and fatneſs) with the pure Word of God (who though he condeſcends to Readers weakneſs, yet never condeſcends to their wantonneſs), this ſhews a man or woman to be much after Gods heart.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> The efficacy of Scripture read, is an effectual argument for the reading of Scripture. Famous is the ſtory <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5.</note> of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whoſe converſion was wrought, or at leaſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in this way; for he on a time, full of grief, and lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his heart to God, ſaying, <hi>How long Lord? How long wilt thou be angry with me? Why ſhall not this hour put an end to my filthineſs?</hi> at length he heard a voyce (as from Heaven) calling to him in theſe words, <hi>Take up and read,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Tolle lege, toll lege.</note> 
                        <hi>take up and read;</hi> Thereupon, he took the Book, opened it, and read, in that Chapter which he firſt caſt his eye upon,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:151789:25"/>
theſe words, <hi>Not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envying; But put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make no proviſion for the fleſh to ſatisfie the luſts thereof</hi> 
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 13. 13, 14.</note>, and then read no further, nor was there (ſaith he) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny need: for as he had made an end of reading that ſentence, all his doubts and darkneſſe did (as by a light caſt into, and clearing up, his heart) ſuddenly vaniſh away. Upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion he remembred and relates the ſtory of <hi>Antonius,</hi> who happening to read ſome part of the Goſpel, was admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that what he read was ſpoken to him, and it was this, <hi>Go ſell that thou haſt, and give to the poor, and thou ſhalt have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in heaven, and come and follow me,</hi> and upon this he was forthwith converted. <hi>Aug. confeſſ. lib.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 12</p>
                     <p>But we need not go further then Scripture to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the power of Scripture, being reverently read. Upon the reading of the Law, by <hi>Shaphan</hi> the <hi>Scribe, Joſiah rent his clothes</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">2 King. 22. 10, 11, 19.—</note>, and his <hi>tender heart was</hi> much <hi>humbled,</hi> for his <hi>ear affected his heart</hi> 
                        <note n="ſ" place="margin">Lam. 3. 51.</note>, and ſo may their eyes that read it themſelves: Yea, in ſo bad a time as that was wherein <hi>Jeremiah</hi> lived, yet the Princes, hearing the words of the Lord read by <hi>Baruck,</hi> were <hi>afraid both one and other</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Jer. 36. 16.</note>. And (after they were come out of the captivity) we find that <hi>all the people wept when they heard the words of the Law.</hi> It's true, <hi>the ſenſe was given, and they</hi> were made <hi>to underſtand the reading:</hi> but that hinders not the buſineſs in hand, but ſheweth the power of the Word when it is read with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and that the better it is underſtood, the more powerful it is. Now if the Word ſo work upon the heart when it is read by others, why may not the ſame effect be wrought when a man reads it himſelf? yea, rather then; becauſe he may read it over and over again, and hath more time to ponder upon it. Hereunto we may add, that when Chriſtians heard that read which the Apoſtles decreed for the Churches reſolution, <hi>they rejoyced for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation</hi> 
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Act. 15. 31.</note>.—And O how many in our dayes, dwelling in the duſt, and in a moſt dejected condition, have found themſelves ſtrangely revived by reading ſome place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which the hand of Providence hath directed them

unto? And what did the <hi>Martyrs</hi> in <hi>Queen Maries dayes,</hi> for their mutual comfort, but write over and over in their Letters thoſe Scriptures that made moſt for conſolation and conſtancy, that by the reading of them they might hold up and hold out in their honourable but hard condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sixthly,</hi> It makes much for reading and ſtudying Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <note place="margin">

It's true, it is not only ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that readeth,</hi> but alſo, <hi>they that hear and keep the words of that Propheſie;</hi> but yet the reading is named, and hath a part in the bleſſedneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, to wit, as it is (together with hearing) a means of keeping. And this we ſee God made to be the way to the <hi>Eunuchs</hi> bleſſedneſs. The reading<hi>-Eunuch</hi> that could not at firſt ſee <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Scripture he read; yet ſaw ſo much by the help of <hi>Philip</hi> (whom God ſent to him when he was reading) that he believed with all his heart <note n="z" place="margin">Act. 8. 37.</note>, and came to <hi>Jeſus</hi> (by Baptiſm) unto eternal life; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and bleſſedneſs, comming to Chriſt and life, go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 45, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 40. &amp; 20. 31.</p>
                     <p>After theſe reaſons of reading Scripture, I ſhall proceed to the anſwering of ſome Objections, the firſt whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns thoſe that are higher; the other ſuch as are meaner and lower.</p>
                     <p>Object. 1. <hi>Men that have their heads and hands full of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, may (perhaps) plead that they have no time to read Scripture,</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>in regard of their many and preſſing imployments.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. They who frame this Objection had need to take heed, that it be not made a protection for omitting <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> Prayer alſo, and ſo letting paſs ſome dayes without having any thing to do with God; ſuch may know, that it is to be but <hi>peny-wiſe</hi> to be ſo thrifty of time for worldly buſineſs as to have no leiſure to look up to God; If they did read Scripture well, they would find ſuch good Husbandry put under the head of <hi>Vanity;</hi> for, <hi>Except the Lord build the Houſe, keep the City,</hi> (and ſo, carry on and proſper mens

affairs) <hi>it is in vain to riſe early, to ſit up late,</hi> or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a mans labour in them <note n="a" place="margin">Pſal. 127.</note>. A man had better gain ſome time from his ſleep, then to have no time for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God; and to leave ſome buſineſs undone, then to have all ill-done; or to be undone, becauſe he proſpers ſo well without God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 32.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer, That although Chriſtians will find it both profitable and needful to ſet apart certain times (and that <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2.</note> (ordinarily) every day) for reading Scripture, leſt there be a loſs of the duty for want of an appointed time to do it in; yet I ſhall not preſcribe any particular time, nor how much of Scripture any ſhould read at that time, (the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Scriptures into Chapters will help that way): but that which I preſs as neceſſary, is the thing it ſelf, and that every Chriſtian be a ſerious <hi>Reader of Scripture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I deny not, but ſome are ſo hurryed with the neceſſary occaſions of their Calling, that it is not eaſie for them to have a time (perhaps in a whole day) to read a Chapter; I mean, to have a time <hi>at times,</hi> and on ſome days: but yet at other times they may, (and by enjoying a freer opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) make themſelves and their ſouls ſome recompence in regard of former omiſſions; which I adviſe them to do, and withal, wiſh them to remember, that it is (as hath been ſaid) the mark of a bleſſed man to meditate in Gods Word day and night, and that <hi>David</hi> (that was ſtill taken up with the perſecutions of a King, (that is, of <hi>Saul)</hi> or with the imployments of a King, when he was King himſelf and a man of War alſo, yet was very much in the meditation of the Law of God, yea, it was his meditation <hi>all the day</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 97.</note>, that is, he took all occaſions to exerciſe his thoughts in it; reading it (no doubt) as Kings were commanded to do, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17. 19. and then reading it in his heart in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current meditations according to all opportunities. There is but one thing that hinders <hi>Davids</hi> imitation, and the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing of ſo good an example, and that is, the want of <hi>Davids</hi> affection, which breathes and breaks out in this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exclamation, <hi>O how I love thy Law</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 97.</note>, and thence fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows his <hi>meditation all the day:</hi> Love deſires union, and longs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:151789:26"/>
to be much with the thing loved. Gods great complaint is, <hi>I have written to him the great things of my Law, but they were counted as a ſtrange thing</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Hoſ. 8 12.</note>. Divers now a dayes look ſtrangely upon Scripture, their countenance (as it is ſaid of <hi>Laban</hi> in regard of <hi>Jacob)</hi> is not towards it <hi>as it was yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and the day before</hi> 
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Gen 31. 2.</note>; but would they claim kindred of it, and ſay unto <hi>Wiſdom, thou art my Siſter, and to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, thou art my Kinſwoman</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 6. 4.</note>, and ſo grow into an holy familiarity with it, then, as neer kinred love to look much one upon another, ſo would they look often and with delight into the Book of <hi>God;</hi> and by the frequent reading of it, ſupply themſelves with the matter of that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meditation which the Scripture marks in, and makes the marks of, the choiſeſt ſervants of <hi>God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I come now to the Objections of the other ſort, and which ordinary people uſe to make, to whom I do eſpecially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect this diſcourſe.</p>
                     <p>Object. 2. <hi>We hear the Scriptures read in the Congregation, and may not that ſuffice for us who muſt of neceſſity follow our</hi>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. We cannot but think that the <hi>Eunuch</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to worſhip, <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 27. heard the Scriptures <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> read there, that being one part of the ſervice performed at their <hi>Feaſts,</hi> as is expreſly declared at the Feaſt of the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, when it is ſaid that <hi>Hezekiah ſpake comfortably to the Levites that taught the good knowledge of God</hi> 
                        <note n="g" place="margin">2 Chron. 30. 22.</note>. In which teaching, reading is preſuppoſed, for we find it expreſs'd otherwhere, and namely, that in the Feaſt of <hi>Trumpets,</hi> the <hi>Law was brought before the Congregation, and was read from the morning until the mid-day</hi> 
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Neh. 8. 1. 2, 3.</note>. And it is more like it was read at the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> to which the Eunuch came, becauſe in that Feaſt, they remembred the ſingular benefits of the Lords giving of the Law in <hi>Mount Sinai</hi> unto them at that very time, and their freedom from the cruel Laws of the <hi>Egyptians</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 16. 12.</note>, under which they had lived before. But though the Law were thus read, and heard read in publick; yet a good man (though a great man) is not content to ſit and hear the Word read in the Congregation (which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:151789:27"/>
is, I grant, a great duty <note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 31. 12.</note>, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8. 3. but he reads alſo in private: yea, the Eunuch returning from the Feaſt, and the Reading there, reads alſo ſitting in his Charet, and <hi>Philip</hi> is ſent to joyn himſelf to the <hi>reading-Charet</hi>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2.</note> have ſo much the more need to read Scripture, that in the crowd of earthly cares and concernments they may not loſe their God and their Souls. It's true, that ruder peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ready to reſolve that it is to be left to <hi>Miniſters</hi> and Monks (as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> relates their words) to read Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>I have wife and children, and houſhold care</hi>

                        <note n="n" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 17.</note>, for which though they may be competently enabled (and ſo as to make a good ſhift) by ſearching the Scripture (as they have occaſion) <hi>for their buſineſs;</hi> yet they will never be ſo compleatly habituated for it, unleſs the ordinary reading and ſtudy of Scripture be made <hi>their buſineſs.</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters therefore are in ſpecial bound to give themſelves to reading and meditating Scripture, <hi>that their profiting may appear to all,</hi> yea, that's (in a manner) their <hi>whole work</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> Our Saviour ſhews us, that a Servant that comes weary from work is call'd to wait upon his <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Maſter, before he eat and drink himſelf, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. 7, 8. and that may teach us, that we may not neglect rhe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our <hi>great Lord,</hi> though we come from the field weary. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Reading ſome part of Scripture is a work of another kind, and may be accounted a recreation, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of hard bodily labour. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is alſo a time (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter labour) of refreſhing (in the uſe of the creatures) by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151789:28"/>
which nature may be ſo recovered as to be fitted for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He works very hard that will not read a Letter from his Friend, from his Prince, before he takes his reſt. If any ſay, The caſe is not alike; for ſuch Letters as come to our hand day by day, we have not ſeen before, and therefore we read them without delay, but having once peruſed them, we do not ſtill read them; Now the <hi>Bible</hi> we read ſometimes our ſelves, and we hear it read often, no need therefore to be ever reading it. To this I anſwer, that they that read the <hi>Book of God</hi> well, and they that read it moſt, will never make this objection: for they know by good experience, that the holy Scripture is ſo full and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomleſs, that every new reading of it (with reverence and lifting up their hearts to God, that he would <hi>open their eyes to ſee wonders out of his Word</hi> 
                        <note n="z" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 18.</note>,) I ſay, every ſuch new reading of it, brings a new light into the underſtanding; a new heat into the heart and affections; and puts a new life into an holy life. As for thoſe who know not this, let them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take themſelves to the diligent and dutiful reading of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that they may at length know it. And they that look upon reading as the receiving of their food, will be ready to read often, as they receive often the ſame ſort of food: The truth is, Mens faſting takes away their ſtomack; I mean, it is their <hi>not reading</hi> that makes them unwilling to read: for duties well performed bring in that delight which will make them ſtill, and make them eaſily performed. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> Luk. 8. 18.</p>
                     <p>Lay aſide therefore (dear Chriſtians) all carnal excuſes, and do not uſe your <hi>Bible</hi> as you do your better clothes, that is, on the Lords-day, and then lay it aſide till the next Lords-day; but look upon the <hi>words of Gods mouth</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> did, that is as upon, yea, <hi>eſteeming them more, then your ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary food</hi> 
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Job 23. 12.</note>; and that will be a motive to you to uſe it as you do your food, to read ordinarily as you feed ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, that is, twice a day, though ſomething may ariſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily to hinder the one or the other. I know there is a difference between Servants, and thoſe that be Maſters of their time; They that are at their own hand (as they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151789:29"/>
ſay) may take a time as they pleaſe; but they that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the power of others, muſt do as they may; and yet they alſo, though they cannot <hi>take,</hi> yet ſhould <hi>make</hi> a time, that is, make hard ſhift for a time to ſee what the <hi>Lord God</hi> ſayes <note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 85. 8.</note>, and learn to be ſo provident as to place themſelves there where the Governours, knowing the benefit of the Word themſelves, will therefore give thoſe that belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them the more liberty to look into it.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall conclude all that I have to ſay concerning this argument, with the adding of two Motives (which the times wherein we live may much mind us of) to this neceſſary duty of being well-read in Scripture; the one drawn from our doubtful condition (in this world and in this land) outwardly; the other from our dangerous condition ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe the Scripture it ſelf points unto, giving this as a reaſon why it is a bleſſed thing to read and hear <note place="margin">1.</note> and keep it, to wit, <hi>becauſe the time is at hand</hi> 
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Rev. 1. 3.</note>, that is, times will come (and how near they be at any time none can tell) wherein there will be ſo great affliction, that they only will be found bleſſed perſons, who have read, obſerved, and laid up Scripture-conſolatons: <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs thy Law had been my delights</hi> (ſaith <hi>David), I ſhould have periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my affliction</hi> 
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Pſ. 119. 92. 49, 50.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>later</hi> of theſe alſo the ſame Word of God layes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, foretelling that <hi>in the laſt dayes</hi> (which were come then, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 11. and are come much more now) <hi>perilous times ſhall come</hi> 
                        <note n="d" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 1. 7, 8, 15, 16.</note>, and that in ſpecial by ſeducing Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who will certainly prevail over poor ſilly creatures that are <hi>ever learning,</hi> for they be the hearers of many and different Teachers, and deſirers of new things, but are <hi>never able</hi> (becauſe they take not the right courſe to ſettle, but the right courſe to unſettle <note n="*" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 3, 4.</note>) <hi>to come to the knowledge of the truth.</hi> Now, How ſhall this be helped? That <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, by recommending the Scriptures in the later part of the chapter, as the <hi>armour</hi> and <hi>antidote</hi> in infecting and truth-reſiſting-times, minding <hi>Timothy</hi> therefore of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them from a child (which was (as is ſhewed before)
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151789:29"/>
by the reading of them, though other means be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded). That of our Saviour, <hi>Ye err, not knowing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi>

And let all obſerve, that they that turn their hearts from <hi>Miniſters</hi> firſt, grow to a contempt of Scripture it ſelf at laſt. I ſhall not doubt, to put all this upon the account
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:151789:30"/>
of neglecting to read, or of the negligent reading of, the Word of God; elſe would never ſo many Chriſtians have run away from God and his Ordinances, as in theſe dayes they do. If any ſhall ſay, they be the <hi>Bible-bearers</hi> that are fallen away (for ſo ſome profane perſons will be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſcorn the Profeſſors of Religion): To this I anſwer, That it is one thing to bear a <hi>Bible,</hi> another to read it with reverence, and to ſearch it with diligence, and to pray (when they read) for the knowledge of Gods mind in it, with all humility and ſenſe of their own weakneſs and unworthineſs; It is ſuch, and not every reading that will ſerve the turn. I grant, that Chriſtians have brought their Bibles to Sermons; but when they have done that, they have not (as the <hi>Beroeans</hi> did) brought Sermons to their Bible; but have taken <hi>Preachers</hi> words without the grounds which they brought out of Gods Word, and therefore have been carryed away by the pleaſing (but poyſoning) words of contrary Teachers. My advice therefore in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion (to ſuch Chriſtians as are yet capable of counſel, and ſpecially to thoſe of my own charge) is briefly this; As you hear with your own ears, ſo ſee with your own eyes, and be much converſant with God in the ſerious reading of Scripture: And ſeeing there were never ſo many helps for a right underſtanding of Scripture as there are now, by ſundry ſound Expoſitions and Annotations publiſhed (of late) in our own Language; Do we that are able, make uſe of ſuch helps, that ſo being prepoſſeſſed with the Word of Chriſt dwelling richly in you <hi>in all wiſdom</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note>, that is not only <hi>richly,</hi> but <hi>rightly,</hi> and in the true ſenſe and meaning of it; there may be no room for the contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſubtile and ſeducing men, but ſuch a reſolute retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth of God as may render you capable (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it go with us in this Land, or in this World) of that heart-ſecuring promiſe, <hi>Becauſe thou haſt kept the Word of my patience, I will keep thee from the hour of tentation,</hi> that is, either from being in it, or from being hurt by it; unto which I add that which followeth, <hi>Behold I come quickly, hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy Crown,</hi>

                  <p>I Now come to the ſecond thing, that is, <hi>Plain Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for a reverent and profitable receiving of the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may (perhaps) ſeem much to ſome, that I ſhould be ſo ſollicitous about this Ordinance; and therefore, for their ſatisfaction, and the confirmation of the duty of <hi>Sacrament-preparation,</hi> I ſhall give account of it in the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Preparation to the Lords Supper is to be ſtood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:151789:31"/>
ſhould give an account of their knowledge and faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they receive it: for though a neceſſary, fundamental, and more remote right thereunto, be preſuppoſed in their Baptiſm; yet, becauſe they themſelves were then uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of making any promiſe and profeſſion in their own perſons; therefore their clear, full, and next right to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the Lords Supper, ariſeth from their declaration, with their own mouths, of their knowledge of, conſent unto, and true purpoſe to perform what their Baptiſm bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them unto, or was then promiſed by others in their behalf. Without this (though I grant it may be in ſeveral wayes required and performed) how ſhall their fitneſs for this Ordinance we ſpeak of, be diſcerned? or the Church (whereof they are Members, and with which they are to communicate) be ſo well ſatisfied? But in this, (it being learnedly and largely ſpoken to by others <note n="*" place="margin">See Mr. <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation: and Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
                     </note>) I ſhall not need to move any further: This only I add, that for the help of the weaker ſort of thoſe of whom I here ſpeak, to give a reaſon of their faith and fitneſs for the Lord Table; I have compoſed theſe enſuing Directions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another reaſon may be taken from the weight that the Scripture lays on this work of Sacrament-preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 2.</note> in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 27, 28, 29, 30. Where may be noted <hi>firſt,</hi> a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Precept for Examination, <hi>Let a man examine, and ſo</hi> (and not otherwiſe) <hi>let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup;</hi> which ſhews that a ſpecial &amp; diſtinct Preparation is required for <hi>that Bread, and that Cup,</hi> that is, that diſtinct Ordinance. <hi>Secondly,</hi> This command is charged upon the Conſcience, by laying before the Unworthy Communicant, two heart-affecting and affrighting things. 1. On the one ſide, the greateſt ſin, and the moſt horrible guilt. <hi>For whoſoever ſhall eat this Bread, and drink this Cup of the Lord unworthily, ſhall be guilty of the Body and Bloud of the Lord.</hi> How high is that Lord? How dreadful therefore is that Guilt? 2. On the other ſide, there's the greateſt danger, and ſaddeſt doom; <hi>For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body;</hi> that is, eternal damnation (without repentance), and temporal
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:151789:31"/>
judgement, though that be prevented: <hi>For this cauſe many are weak and ſickly among you, and many ſleep.</hi> Thus is that great Precept of Examination, before Sacrament-partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, environed (as it were) on both hands, that it may be more effectually guarded againſt all gain-ſayers, urged on all Communicants, and obſerved by all Chriſtians to ſtrike into their hearts a reverence of that Ordinance.</p>
                  <p>Here I do not deny, but there are the ſame things (for ſubſtance) ſet before us in regard of the <hi>hearing of the Word,</hi> whileſt it is ſaid, <hi>He that believeth not, ſhall be damned,</hi> Mar. 16. 16. and he that heareth and <hi>lets it ſlip</hi> ſhall not eſcape, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 1, 2, 3. (and therefore People had need not only to hear, but to <hi>take heed how they hear,</hi> and prepare for it, <hi>Eccleſ</hi> 5. 1.): But yet I do not find that ſo much is ſpoken (all at once), and ſo fully ſpoken, and ſo fearfully ſpoken concerning <hi>miſ-hearing</hi> only, as concerning this <hi>miſ-recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;</hi> the reaſon whereof may be (as I humbly conceive) becauſe in unworthy partaking of the Lords Supper there is a <hi>cumulative</hi> abuſe or a double in; that is, not only the Sacrament is abuſed, but that Word of God alſo is contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned which makes it a Sacrament <note n="*" place="margin">Accedat Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum ad elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, &amp; ſit Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum.</note>; as alſo becauſe the Body and Bloud of Chriſt (though offered alſo in the Word, yet) are not in ſuch a manner preſented as in the Lords Supper, as will further appear in the next reaſon. Mean while (to cloſe up this) Chriſtians may conſider, that when God is pleas'd to ſpeak more plainly, preciſely, diſtinctly, more fully and dreadfully; then he juſtly expects, that what he ſaith ſhould affect us more, and be of more effect with us. Read <hi>Jer.</hi> 25. 30. <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6. 8. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 42, 43. with <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 41. to the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A ſerious Preparation, proper to the Sacrament of the Body and Bloud of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther urged; becauſe the ſame thing, that is, <hi>Chriſt</hi> with all his benefits is offered unto us in a different way in the Word and Sacrament, which makes it a diſtinct Ordinance, and ſo impoſeth a peculiar preparaton for it; which, I do not at all ſpeak to ſet one Ordinance of God againſt another; or to leſſen the reverence of the Word Preached (which is
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:151789:32"/>
that <hi>great</hi> Ordinance of God whereby men are converted and ſaved) or to give way to an unprepared coming to the Word (which I fear is the fault or many, who ſeem to come with high reverence to the Sacrament): but what I ſay, is only to put Chriſtians in mind, that every diſtinct Ordinance of God is to have its due and diſtinct reſpect, and therefore that there is ſome other and further good frame of heart to be endeavoured, when the Sacrament is to be received, then when the Word only is to be heard; and that becauſe (that I may come to the matter I intend) Chriſt with all his benefits is offered in the Sacrament very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly or ſingularly, and very plainly and ſenſibly.</p>

In preaching we ſpeak generally, yet comprehending par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons, but not ſingling them out; whereas in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament Chriſt is offered perſonally, that is, to particular perſons, and is put as it were (Sacramentally) into every ones hand. Now when God deals with particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons hand to hand, offering them ſo great a gift as Chriſt is <note n="b" place="margin">Joh. 4 10.</note>, there is therefore more reaſon of reverence, and of care that ſuch a gift from ſuch a giver, be not taken with unwaſhen hands and hearts. We find that when <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> were to appear perſonally before Kings, <hi>he ſhaved himſelf, and changed his rayment</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 41. 14.</note>; and <hi>ſhe put on her royal Apparel</hi>

And ſhall we make our perſonal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to God without ſome ſpecial teſtimony of the low thoughts we have of our ſelves, and the high thoughts we have of Him? Well may it (then) be ſaid, <hi>Offer it now to thy Governour</hi>

When that poor woman, that was heal'd of her bloudy iſſue, was hid amongſt a great company, it was well enough; but when ſhe ſaw ſhe was not hid, but ſingled out to look Jeſus Chriſt in the face, then ſhe <hi>came trembling and falling down before him</hi> 
                     <note n="f" place="margin">Luk. 8. 47.</note>. Much cauſe have we to do the like, conſidering what we are; and what Chriſt is, from whoſe hands (as it were) though by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of mean men, we come (each of us) to take into our own hands things of ſo high a nature.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> In the Sacrament Chriſt is offered more plainly and ſenſibly then in the Word, though in the ſubſtance both Ordinances agree. Indeed in the ſound of the Goſpel Chriſt appears, and is ſet forth to the ſenſe of hearing, by faithful Teachers very evidently, and as it were to the eye <note n="g" place="margin">Gal. 3. 1.</note>, but not properly to the eye as in the Sacrament: for when <hi>Paul</hi> tels the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that Chriſt was ſet forth before their eyes, his meaning is only this, that Jeſus Chriſt was clearly held forth to them by his Preaching, as that is which is ſet before mens eyes; which ſhews that things expoſed to the eye are moſt evident and moſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative; for it is the eye that (in a more ſpecial manner) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the heart <note n="h" place="margin">Lam. 3. 31. <hi>Segniùs irritan: animos demiſſa per aures, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>. Whence it is that <hi>Moſes</hi> makes this a great argument to move the people to obedience, that he did not ſpeak to them that had not <hi>ſeen,</hi> but to ſuch as had <hi>ſeen the great acts of the Lord,</hi> Deut. 11. 2. 7. Now, God offering himſelf to us in the Sacrament in a more plain and familiar way, ſetting us (as it were) at his Table, and ſetting before our eyes all the good things of his Houſe; this miniſtreth an argument of more abundant reverence: for, Whence was it that <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> were commanded to <hi>put off their ſhoos from off their feet,</hi> Exod. 3. 5.

The preſſing therefore of ſpecial Sacrament-preparation no way dero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates from the Word, but rather heightens the eſtimation of it, inaſmuch as the Sacrament is founded on it. And yet this dependance of the Sacrament on the Word hinders not the truth of that which <hi>Calvin</hi> affirms, (and confirms out of <hi>Auſtin),</hi> which is, that <hi>the Sacraments have this peculiar to them above the Word, that they do repreſent unto us to the life the promiſes of God, even as if they were pictured in a Table before our eyes</hi>

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151789:33"/>
was much ſtrictneſs uſed, and ſuch ſent away, when the Communion was to be adminiſtred, who had committed notorious ſins, and not ſufficiently teſtified their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. And when the Miniſter was about to reach out the Sacrament of the Lords Supper to the people, he cryed with a lowd voyce, <hi>Holy things to holy perſons.</hi> Accordingly our own Church, ever ſince the Reformation, hath provided that open and notorious livers ſhould not preſume to come to the Lords Table till their open declaring of their true repentance and amendment.

                        <hi>Rubrick</hi> before the Communion.</note>.

                     <hi>I muſt confeſs, if you will ſay, that ſome are ſo groſly ignorant, that they are not capable for the preſent to learn, or be inſtructed by publick teaching, then may you have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for me to number them amongſt Ideots, and ſuch as have not the uſe of reaſon, and ſo deal with them accordingly,</hi> that is (as he ſaith after) except, and exclude them. It's true, that the Author (in relation to theſe ignorant perſons) ſeems to build much upon their receiving inſtruction when they are at the Sacrament; but the queſtion he e is not, What they may poſſibly attain when they be there, but, What they have attained before, that they may be <hi>regularly</hi> there. Will not <hi>preſent</hi> groſs ignorance weigh more to refuſe them, then <hi>poſſible</hi> knowledge to receive them? I ſay <hi>poſſible</hi> but not <hi>probable;</hi> for it is not like they ſhould learn much by being at a Sacrament, who have heard many Sermons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Sacraments, and yet have learned (in a manner) nothing. Unto this, I muſt further add, that the queſtion here, is not, Whether theſe groſly ignorant perſons are ſo far uncapable as to be numbred among Idiols (for they are wiſe enough <hi>in their generation</hi> and element); but, Whether they are not ſo far unteachable and intractable, as that they cannot be juſtly numbred among diſcerners of the Lords Body? to wit, <hi>becauſe they know not, neither [WILL] they underſtand</hi> 
                     <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 82. 5.</note>. Indeed if they would yield themſelves to inſtruction, and endeavour to attain Sacramental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (ſuitable to their parts and breeding) then (though diſmiſſed formerly) they might be received freely. But that being not done, (when as diſcerning and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are ſo near <note n="x" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 29.</note>,) Who can bid them <hi>draw near?</hi>

Yet I do not find, that the <hi>Church</hi> excludes ſuch as he doth, that is, as accounting them (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently) the objects of Excommunication, but as not think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them fit ſubjects (in that ſtate) for Sacrament-recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. That clauſe therefore [as, <hi>ipſo jure,</hi> excommunicate] would be a little further weighed; which (if I miſtake not) the Author adds to keep intire his Tenet of free-admiſſion to the Lords Supper, that is, of all that are Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; He was provident (therefore) in declaring thoſe ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous oftenders (which he deſcribes) to be excommunicate, that is, to be indeed, or in right, no Members <note n="z" place="margin">See <hi>pag.</hi> 81. the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count no mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note>, and ſo his free-admiſſion of all Members will ſtand the better.</p>
                  <p>But here I have theſe things to Reply.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the before-deſcribed notorious perſons are (notwithſtanding) members, becauſe not yet actually caſt <note place="margin">1.</note> out; for, Was not the inceſtuous perſon, notwithſtanding his horrible ſin, and the common fame thereof (when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 1.</note>,) I ſay, was not he yet a Member?

                     </note> wiſely conſidering, gives this account of it, <hi>Even ignorant and profane, till con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed and excommunicate [not only</hi> de jure, <hi>but</hi> de facto], <hi>have a right; for, that not keeping company with fornicators, covetous,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 5. 11. <hi>is intended no otherwiſe but upon a ſentence, and judgement fore-going, afore which they might;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151789:35"/>
for its unreaſonable, a puniſhment ſhould be inflicted before a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Thus he.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p>Now, if this be not juſtly faſtened upon ſcandalous of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, that they are preſently excommunicate <hi>[de jure],</hi> then ſo much is yielded as that ſome Church-members may be ſecluded (at this or that time) from the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: which ſerves to confirm what I intended to ſhew, which is, that it is agreed upon, on all hands, that there may be a reſtraint in Sacrament-admiſſion, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Church-memberſhip, in caſe of groſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and notorious ſcandal: And that's all I aim at, it being not in my thoughts to preſs ſuch a ſtrictneſs as will hinder acceſs to the Sacrament in its juſt extent; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to repreſs ſuch profuſe conceſſions as tend to the abuſe of that Ordinance, and the danger and diſcomfort both of Receivers and Admitters.</p>
                  <p>I have enlarged thus far (much beyond my firſt purpoſe) partly to clear my way to that which followeth, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to make tryal (being neceſſitated thereunto by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this diſcourſe) whether my weak thoughts might contribute any thing to a right ſenſe in this much-debated argument.</p>

                  <p>Of the Office of Miniſters I ſhall ſay no more, but (to make the better way to peoples duty) muſt needs grant, that if a Miniſter perform not, takes no care to perform, makes no conſcience of performing theſe parts of his office, then (though honour be alwayes due <hi>to his calling,</hi> yet) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives himſelf of that honour which otherwiſe would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue and be due <hi>to his perſon</hi> in reference to that calling; for the honour is tied to the <hi>well-performing</hi> of the office: <hi>The Elders that rule well,</hi> are they that are <hi>worthy of double honour</hi>

To omit other parts of a Miniſters calling, it were well if it were known, That the preaching of the Word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to them only; yet, I ſhall not deny, but that in ſome extraordinary caſes, (as in time of perſecution, and when Miniſters cannot be had) and on ſome ſpecial occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (as for tryal of thoſe that are towards the Miniſtry) and with ſome extraordinary caution, that is, there being hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers able and appointed to judge of what they ſpeak; I ſay, in ſuch caſes ſomething may be granted, and there may be ſome allowance to ſpeak in publick given to perſons uncalled, or not yet called <note n="o" place="margin">And yet none of theſe ſpeak with that authority that an ordained Miniſter hath; ſo there is a difference in that ſtill.</note>. But ordinarily and when there is a ſetled ſtate of things, a Miniſters calling is diſtinct from all other callings as to the matter of publick preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as appears evidently by thoſe Scriptures which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the preaching of the Word as the principal and moſt conſiderable part of a Miniſters work; for to them it is that Jeſus Chriſt (who hath all power given him) giveth out power and commiſſion to <hi>go and teach,</hi> as well as admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments <note n="p" place="margin">Matt. 28. 18, 19.</note>; ſo that others may no more teach (as Gods officers do) then baptize; yea, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt hath ſent me not to baptize, but to preach the Goſpel</hi>

Nor can they be (ordinarily) able to do it, being not educated to it, and having (or being ſuch as ought to have) other callings, ſo that they cannot give themſelves wholly to this work (as a Miniſter is bound to do <note n="y" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 15. 2 Tim. 2. 4.</note>; and therefore cannot ſufficiently and conſtantly perform it: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially conſidering that when it comes to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a common priviledge to appear in publick teaching, the more inſufficient will ſtep up firſt.</p>

                  <p n="1">1.

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers are loſers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And a <hi>danger</hi> alſo; for if they happen to deliver any thing unſound, as ſuch divers times do (either through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <note place="margin">2.</note> or faction) then common hearers (as we ſee by ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in theſe late times) will be more ready to receive an Error from them then a Truth from a Miniſter; and when they have received it, they do ſo eagerly run away with it,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:151789:45"/>
that there will hardly be any prevailing means to get it out: For, ſuch is the corruption of nature, and ſo doth Satan put on, becauſe it makes for his Kingdom, that an uncalled perſon is by many better accepted then one cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and the novelties and curioſities which ſuch uſe to vent, take more with them, then the ſolid doctrine, and plam and ſaving truths, delivered by the Lords Meſſengers.</p>
                  <p>But (may ſome ſay); It is not good that the Church ſhould want <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>the benefit of their gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That beſides the making uſe of them in their <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Families (a duty, I fear, too much neglected by thoſe that are forward to ſhew themſelves in publick) they have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liberty and opportunity to exerciſe them in Chriſtian meetings and conferences,; And yet there alſo is a danger, for weak Chriſtians that have honeſt hearts are ſoon miſſed by men high in their parts (but not right in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor low in their hearts), if there be not Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, or others ſound in the faith, preſent in the meeting to prevent infection. Unto this I add, That if there be (indeed) any private Chriſtians that are eminently gift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Preſs is open, though the Pulpit be ſhut.</p>
                  <p>Thus far of the firſt thing, that is, of <hi>knowing</hi> Miniſters with a knowledge of obſervation in <hi>regard of their calling,</hi> wherein I have been more large, becauſe of the experience we have had (of late) of the extreme evils of arbitrary and licentious preaching, which hath fill'd the Land with abſurd and dangerous Errors, from the one end of it to the other; yea, and other Countries alſo. I come now to ſpeak of the obſerving</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Of their Doctrine;</hi> The Apoſtle is plain in this, when he ſaith, <hi>Conſider what I ſay</hi>

3. There ſhould be an obſerving <hi>of their carriage;</hi> of this knowledge the Apoſtle ſpeaks, when writing, to <hi>Timothy,</hi> he tells him, <hi>Thou haſt fully known,</hi> not only <hi>my doctrine</hi> (which belongs to the former branch), but alſo <hi>my manner of life,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="i" place="margin">2 Tim 3. 10.</note>.

And ſo one good uſe of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their carriage is diſcovered, which is thereby to be confirmed in this, that they are faithful Miniſters, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to be reſpected.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the knowledge of <hi>Obſervation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Miniſters are to be known with a knowledge of <hi>approbation;</hi> And thus this word [know] is often uſed <note place="margin">II.</note> in Scripture, as when it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous,</hi> that is, approves it <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 1. <hi>ult.</hi>
                     </note>; and <hi>David, I will not know a wicked man,</hi> that is, ſhew him any counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance <note n="n" place="margin">Pſal. 101. 4.</note>: ſo ſaith <hi>Paul, That which I do, I know not,</hi> that is, I allow not <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 7. 15.</note>. In like manner, the word uſed here, doth not ſignifie ſimply to know, (that's ſoon done) but to acknowledge <note n="p" place="margin">1 Cor. 16. 18.</note>, own them, and to ſee that be given them every way which is due to them in their places. In ſuch a ſenſe the original word here uſed, is taken 2 Cor. 5. 16. <hi>We know no man after the fleſh,</hi> that is, do not eſteem, reckon or judge of him according to his outward and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal relations: In like ſort, a Miniſter is not to be judged of according to the outward appearance <note n="q" place="margin">Joh. 7. 24.</note>, but to be known and look'd upon with all approbation, in regard of his Office, if he be duly called; and of his doctrine, if it be the Word of God <note n="r" place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 13.</note>, and his carriage, if it be according to that Word, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There ſhould be alſo a knowledge of <hi>imitation:</hi> thus <hi>Timothy</hi> was to know <hi>Paul's manner of life</hi> 
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 10.</note>, or, ſo <note place="margin">3.</note> as to imitate it, and make <hi>Paul</hi> his pattern; Thus all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians are to remember and obſerve Church-guides, ſo as to <hi>follow their faith</hi> 
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Heb. 13. 7.</note>, and <hi>mark</hi> them ſo as to be like them

                     <p>This is the more conſiderable, becauſe divers ſeem to eſteem good Miniſters much, when, as it is not from love, ſo neither is it for their works ſake; For, It may be,</p>

                     <p>That I may draw to a concluſion of this diſcourſe, Think not (beloved Chriſtians) that it is out of an affectation of ſelf-advancement that this eſtimation is thus urged; we deſire to ſpeak the Apoſtles words with the Apoſtles ſpirit, It is <hi>not that we ſhould appear approved; but, that ye ſhould do that which is honeſt, though we be as Reprobates,</hi> that is, in mens account, (for otherwiſe) <hi>I truſt that ye ſhall know that we are not Reprobates</hi>

If you regard them not, Remember how far the diſeſteem reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that deſpiſeth you deſpiſeth me, and he that deſpiſeth me, deſpiſeth him that hath ſent me</hi> 
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Luk. 10. 16.</note>.

                  <p>If any ask, How all this came to paſs? <hi>Nehemiah</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gives an account of it, when he ſaith, <hi>All this while was not I at Jeruſalem,</hi> v. 6.

                  <p>Firſt, In a Sabbath, <hi>reſt</hi> is required, and that ſo as to do <hi>no manner of work;</hi> the meaning is not, that we are to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain <note place="margin">1.</note> from <hi>ſinful</hi> works only, which though they be <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently</hi> unlawful on that day, yet are <hi>truly</hi> unlawful any day, and are forbidden in all the other Commandements, Nor is it the meaning, that we ſhould abſtain from <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile</hi> work only, that is, worldly works painful and gainful, (which are allowed on other days); for howſoever ſuch works be in ſpecial manner forbidden, as being named in the fourth Commandement, yet that's but by a <hi>Synechdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che,</hi> or a figure, whereby more is meant: for if they only <note place="margin">O Ecolamp. in Iſa. 58. 13. <hi>Opus factum in ſide ad utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem proximi, Sabbatum non violat, hoc enim eſt opus Dei; ſed ſi proprium in eo commodum ſpecies Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum violas.</hi>
                     </note> were forbidden, then the Sabbath might be ſpent in things eaſie, liberal, and ingenuous without blame; and then God ſhould have the day no more, or little more, then if it were ſpent in ſervile works, when yet it muſt be a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath <hi>of, or to the Lord;</hi> The thing therefore required, is, that all manner of work be forborn, (by what name or title ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be called) that is <hi>ours</hi>

holineſs which is intended in the Sabbath or day of reſt.</p>
                  <p>Of this Reſt there are divers reaſons. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>ſolemnity</hi> of the day (for it's one of Gods <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn dayes,</hi> Pſal. 81. 5.) that the celebration thereof may be more fair and full by laying aſide all work, and the whole Creation (as it were) to wait on the Creator, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit.</hi> 23. 3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As in point of ſolemnity, ſo, <hi>In point of mercy,</hi> for the relief, refreſhing and taking breath of the toiled crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after ſix dayes labour; which is ſaid of God himſelf, after his work, but it is ſpoken after the manner of men, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 17. <hi>On the ſeventh day he reſted, and was refreſhed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. And eſpecially, <hi>In point of Piety,</hi> for the ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the day, in the holy ſervices thereof; and that not without need: For, if we look to innocent <hi>Adam,</hi> albeit ſome queſtion, Whether the Law of the Sabbath were given to him before the Fall; yet there's no cauſe to queſtion, but that it would have been uſeful to him, though he had not faln: becauſe he could not, at once, dreſs and keep the Garden, and have that compleat and indiſtracted communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, which it was eaſie for him to enjoy, in a time of reſt and ſeparation from all ſuch earthly and hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal imployment.</p>
                  <p>But now, man being faln, this Reſt is of more abſolute neceſſity, becauſe both humane infirmity and corruption ſo compaſs and cleave to us, that we cannot with full in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind be in Heaven and Earth both at once; that is, we cannot, at the ſame time, apply our ſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to matters of ſo different a nature and operation as heavenly and earthly things are, which apparently carry our hearts contrary wayes: whereof there needs not fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof then the dayly experience we have of the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of our hearts, and the withdrawing of them from things ſpiritual, or, at leaſt, the eclipſing of them, by the interpoſition of earthly things; which, if they be earthly thoughts, hinder ſpiritual thoughts, and diſturb hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly meditations; if they be earthly words, they cool
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:151789:57"/>
ſpiritual communications (a man cannot ſpeak two differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent languages both at once); and if they be earthly Actions, they weaken ſpiritual exerciſes, and thruſt aſide heavenly tranſactions.</p>
                  <p>For this reaſon, Play alſo and Sports are forbidden: for God forbids not work for the <hi>thing,</hi> (He likes work better then play), but for the <hi>end;</hi> to wit, becauſe it hinders the intire imploying of the day in holy things, which Play doth much more, becauſe of a greater delight in it, and for that the heart is more taken up with it, and ſtollen (as the hearts of the men of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were by <hi>Abſaloms</hi> kiſſes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. 5, 6.) from the ſon of <hi>David,</hi> the Lord of the Sabbath, by it.</p>
                  <p>Now, Albeit there might be ſome reſt (out of the fourth Commandement) appendant to the <hi>Jews</hi> day, and proper to them, as appertaining to their Education, (which, I conceive, it will be hard to find; that which is produced for it, being as probably anſwered as urged <note n="a" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Bownd</hi> 1 Book. p. 136. <hi>Cawdr.</hi> Part. 1. p. 86, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>:) yet all that reſt which is enjoyned in the Commandement, and is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Sabbath-ſanctification, belongeth to us as well as to them: for, As the obſervation of the Sabbath (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the fourth Commandement) being ſpiritual, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth the Law that requireth it to be both moral and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; ſo, with reſpect thereto, the bodily reſt alſo becometh moral <note n="b" place="margin">Mr <hi>Crookes</hi> Characters, <hi>p.</hi> 552.</note>, and therefore a common and continuing thing to us as well as to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor need this reſt ſeem tedious, if we conſider what works God requireth and alloweth on the Sabbath-day; As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Works of Religion]</hi> Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, and do all [thy] work, ſaith the Commandment <note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 20. 9.</note>, but on the Sabbath-day, we may and muſt do <hi>Gods work.</hi> Hence, it's ſaid, <hi>The Prieſts profane the Sabbath,</hi> that is, <hi>materially,</hi> by doing thoſe works that would profane it, if God had not commanded them for his ſervice: but being that he hath ſo done, thoſe Prieſts <hi>are blameleſs</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 12. 5.</note>, becauſe thoſe works, though ſervile in their nature, yet were ſacred in their end and application. Such a work was the infirm mans car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying his bed on the Sabbath when Chriſt had heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:151789:57"/>
him <note n="e" place="margin">Job. 5. 8.</note>. The bearing of burthens, on that day, for worldly lucre, is one of the things that <hi>Nehemiah</hi> here contends againſt; but that mans carrying his bed became a religious action, by being an appurtenance of the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and an open declaration to all men (who on that day did more flock together), of the grace and power of God by which he was cured; under this head may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended thoſe bodily proviſions that are <hi>truly</hi> needful and helpful for our more able and vigorous performance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious duties, or for the glory of God ſome other way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Works of neceſſity]</hi> to wit, real, not feigned; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and apparent, not poſſible only, and which may be or not be: To this we may refer the Diſciples plucking and eating the ears of corn <note n="f" place="margin">Mar. 12. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note>, whom Chriſt excuſeth, becauſe, at that time, they (as <hi>David)</hi> needed ſuſtenance <note n="g" place="margin">
                        <hi>Diſcipulos excuſat, quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am humanam opponit neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem quaſi de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precatricem.</hi> Tertul. adverſ. Marc. lib. 40.</note>. And add thereto the other plain inſtance of a Sheeps falling into a pit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 11. which they that ſo quarrel'd with our Saviour, made no ſcruple to pull out on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Works of mercy]</hi> as the healing of the woman bound by Satan, <hi>Lo eighten years,</hi> Luk. 13. 15, 16. A Saviour ſo mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful would not ſtand upon healing on the Sabbath day in a caſe ſo pitiful; for, <hi>The Sabbath is made for man,</hi> Mar. 2. 27. that is, the reſt of the Sabbath is to give place to mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; And though God propound to us his example of reſt on the ſeventh day for our reſting, yet we have his example of working alſo for mans benefit; for (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>my Father worketh hitherto</hi> 
                     <note n="h" place="margin">Joh. 5. 17.</note>, (no Sabbath day excepted) to wit, in the preſervation, government, and for the good of his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the firſt thing belonging to a Sabbath, to wit, <hi>reſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The thing further and chiefly required, and <note place="margin">2.</note> which is intended in this reſt, is <hi>holineſs,</hi> Remember the Sabbath day, <hi>to keep it holy;</hi> wherein is contained,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A reverent opinion of it]</hi> to wit, as the <hi>Lords holy and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:151789:58"/>
honourable day</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Iſa. 58. 13.</note>, There will never be a good obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it in our practiſe, without an eſtimation of it in our judgement. Men will not leave the world (with which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cloſeth) nor cloſe with God in thoſe holy things which nature is oppoſite to, and in the beſt, too averſe from; I ſay, they will not do this on a day (and that every week) which they care not for; on which they ſee no divine chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; and in the ſervice whereof they expect no divine bleſſing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A dear affection to it] calling it a delight</hi> 
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Iſai. 58. 13.</note>, and loving to be <hi>in the ſpirit</hi> on that day, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>[No delight]</hi> is the companion of contempt <note n="l" place="margin">Jer. 6. 10.</note>, but Delight is ſo far from deſpiſing ſervice, that it doubleth it <note n="m" place="margin">2 Chr. 30. 23.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>An holy imploying of the reſt]</hi> and beſtowing of our ſelves in the duties belonging to ſuch a day. This is well expreſs'd, in thoſe conſiderable Articles of <hi>Ireland,</hi> thus, <hi>The firſt day of the week, which is the Lords day, is wholly to be dedicated to the ſervice of God; and therefore we are bound there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to reſt from our common and daily buſineſs, and</hi> (mark what followeth) <hi>to beſtow that leiſure upon holy exerciſes both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and private</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Publike</hi> exerciſes are the principal; In reference to which publike worſhip eſpecially, the Sabbath is (as I conceive), ſaid to be a <hi>Sign,</hi> that is, an open declaration, <hi>Whoſe we are, and whom we ſerve,</hi> Jona. 1. 9. Act. 27. 23. For it doth not follow from the word [Sign] that the weekly Sabbath is a typical Ceremony: If it were ſo, then it ſhould be a ſin to obſerve a Sabbath now, ſince all Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies end in Chriſt, in whom (notwithſtanding) the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Sabbath begins (as to the day) and by whom it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed as it is a weekly day, (which the fourth Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement requireth) becauſe he declareth that he came not <hi>to deſtroy the Law,</hi> but to <hi>fulfill it</hi> 
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Mat. 5. 17.</note>. It is not therefore a ceremonial ſign (any more then the ſigns in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151789:58"/>
are ceremonial) but rather a moral and real ſign and demonſtration how things ſtand between God and his people, which will further appear by looking more narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into that place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where it is called a <hi>Sign,</hi> for thus the Prophet expreſſeth it, <hi>I gave them my Sabbaths to be a ſign between me and them, that they might know that I am the Lord that ſanctifie them</hi> 
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Ezek. 20. 12.</note>, which words are alſo mentioned and applyed to the weekly Sabbath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 13. 15, 16, 17. When the Sabbath is ſaid to be a <hi>ſign,</hi> the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is (as ſome do moſt probably expound it <note n="q" place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> &amp; <hi>Trem.</hi> in Exod. 31 13.</note>,) that it is a document or an inſtructing Sign, and that <hi>between</hi> God and his people <hi>[me and you]</hi> 
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Exod. 31. 13.</note>, ſaith the Lord; it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and ſheweth that which is common to us both, to wit, on my part, that I am your Creator and Sanctifier; on your part, that you are a people, by Me created and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; And that it is thus an inſtructing ſign, appears by the words following, <hi>that ye may know;</hi> as if the Lord had ſaid, Look on the Sabbath as a monument of the relation between me and you; I would have you know and obſerve it ſo to be. Upon a nearer view of the words, it will be found a teaching ſign of theſe three leſſons:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That <hi>God is the Lord</hi> 
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">Lev. 19. 30. <hi>Ye ſhall keep my Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, I am the Lord.</hi>
                     </note>, that is, that Lord who is the only true God, <hi>(Jer.</hi> 10. 10.) and that, becauſe <hi>he hath made the Heaven and the Earth,</hi> v. 11, 12. Which the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Sabbath, that is, reſting a ſeventh day every week in relation to ſix dayes work, clearly holdeth forth; for it is in imitation of that God, who <hi>in ſix dayes made Heaven and Earth, and reſted the ſeventh,</hi> who can be no other then the true God, and Lord of all.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> leſſon is, that this great Lord, is <hi>the God of his Church,</hi> or a God in Covenant with them: for thus the Lord ſpeaks; <note n="t" place="margin">Ezek. 20. 19, 20.</note> 
                     <hi>I am the Lord</hi> [your God]<hi>—Hallow my Sabbaths, and they ſhall be a ſign between me and you, that ye may know</hi> (and learn this leſſon) <hi>that I am your God;</hi> for, Why do they wait upon him a whole day, every week, but to ſhew that they own him as their God, and that they believe he owns them as his people? Hence the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>They ſit before thee [as my people] and hear thy words</hi> 
                     <note n="u" place="margin">Ezek. 33. 31.</note>.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="78" facs="tcp:151789:59"/>
The <hi>third</hi> leſſon is, that <hi>he is the Lord that ſanctifieth them;</hi> which may be underſtood two wayes;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Of a ſanctification to himſelf by a ſeparation from the world <note n="x" place="margin">Thus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification is conceived to be taken, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. [Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied] from the world, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to God by Calling and Covenant, common to all viſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, <hi>Dickſon in loc.</hi>
                     </note>, ſo as to enjoy the priviledg of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; and ſo the Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>Ye ſhall be holy to me, for I the Lord am holy, and have ſevered you from other people that ye ſhould be mine,</hi> Lev. 20. 26. Exod. 33. 16.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And alſo of an internal renovation, and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>in ſpirit, and ſoul, and body,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5, 23. by the Word preached on that day through the operation of the Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 32. &amp; 26. 18. So that God hath not only made the Sabbath an holy day, but alſo make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth men holy by his Ordinances, on that day (principally) diſpenſed.</p>
                  <p>I have been the longer in this, becauſe hereby it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth what a neceſſity there is of a weekly Sabbath, as being a moſt ſignal Declaration and Repreſentation of what God is in himſelf, that is, the maker of Heaven and Earth (his diſtinguiſhing character <note n="y" place="margin">Jer. 10. 11, 12.</note>, and what he is to his Church, that is, a God in Covenant with them, and every way, a Sanctifier of them, and that's their diſtinguiſhing chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 16. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. 19. Now (to return to the thing in hand) ſince the Sabbath becomes of this uſe, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the general and ſolemn meeting of Gods people to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to Publike Service, (as Prayer, Reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, Preaching, adminiſtration of the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> therefore the reſt and leiſure we have on that day, is prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to be beſtowed in, and ſanctified by, ſuch duties; And therefore, the Sacrifices appointed for the Sabbath day were full double to thoſe appointed for every day, <note n="z" place="margin">Num. 28. 9.</note> for <hi>the Sabbath being a ſign of more then ordinary favour from the Lord, he required greater teſtimonies of their thankeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſanctification</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">
                        <hi>Aynſw.</hi> on Numb. 28. 9.</note>; And the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſtate of the Church in the time of the Meſſiah, under the figure of legal Ordinances, mentioneth a yet greater oblation, to be offered on the Sabbath day <note n="b" place="margin">Ezek. 46. 4, 5. <hi>vid.

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:151789:59"/>
being greater then that of the Old: Now if we bring this greater ſervice to the great day of ſervice, that is, the <hi>Lords day,</hi> it will fairly follow, that the reſt of that day ſhould be fill'd up with holy duties, eſpecially in publique; for in thoſe duties the Sabbath is moſt a (ſign) of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions betwen God and us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Private</hi> duties alſo are neceſſary, becauſe the whole day cannot be ſpent in publike ſervice conveniently, and yet it is to be ſpent holily; <hi>Before</hi> we come to the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation therefore, (conſidering how holy a God that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom we come, and how ſerious a ſervice that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which we come) there is great need to ſpend ſome time in repentance, eſpecially of the ſins committed the week before <note n="c" place="margin">

I have thus far enlarged in deſcribing the Sabbath, out of a deſire to eſtabliſh the holy obſervation of the Lords day, which will beſt be diſcerned by that reſpect, reverence and obſervance that is due to the weekly Sabbath according to the fourth Commandement.</p>
                  <p>Now, when we know what is meant by [Sabbath], and by the obſervation of it; it's eaſie to know what is meant by the <hi>profanation</hi> thereof (mentioned before); which is, the applying of it to common uſe as we do the other ſix dayes, when God hath ſet it a part for holy and heavenly imployments: ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 15.</p>
                  <p>This profanation muſt needs be (as I have ſaid) an evil thing, becauſe it is a tranſgreſſion of the moral Law of God <note n="y" place="margin">1 Joh. 3 4.</note>, which Law, though it be ſhort, yet the Precept concerning the Sabbath is full and large. If that law be holy, and juſt, and good <note n="z" place="margin">Rom 7. 12. See <hi>Perkins Serm of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on Zeph.</hi> 2. 1, 2. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation of the Sabbath is a common, yet ſo great a ſin; that where it reigns, in that Countrey, Congregation, Family, Man, or Woman, there is no fear of God, nor any true grace in them.</note>, then the profanation oppoſite to it muſt needs be evil: Hence the Lord himſelf ſaid of old, when that which was commanded on the Sabbath was not obeyed, <hi>How long refuſe ye to keep my Commandements and my Laws?</hi> Exod. 16. 28. &amp; Ezek. 22. 18. <hi>Thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned my Sabbath,</hi> is in the catalogue of their ſins.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe there are two things about the Chriſtian Sabbath much diſputed; one, the divine inſtitution and appointment of a Sabbath day in every week, for all ages, by vertue of the fourth Commandement; the other, the divine conſtitution, or Gods ordaining of that weekly day for a Sabbath which we now obſerve, that is, the firſt day of the week, commonly called the Lords day: I ſhall therefore endeavour (as I am able) to ſpeak ſomething, in way of reſolution, to theſe two propoſals, that ſo, Sabbath-doubts may not hinder Sabbath-duties. For the former of theſe I propound this queſtion.</p>

                  <p>If it be ſaid, <hi>That doth not follow, becauſe ſomething of that Commandement remains, and is in force for ever, to wit, that ſome time ſhould be ſet a part for the publike worſhip of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, That it is manifeſt to him that reads the fourth Commandement, that the thing required in it, is not <hi>a time at large</hi> (which the ſecond Commandement, that preſcribeth the Worſhip of God, ſuppoſeth; becauſe nothing can be done, unleſs there be a time ſet apart for the doing of it) but that which is enjoyned, is <hi>a day;</hi> Nor is it a day at large, but <hi>a day in every week,</hi> for it is oppoſed to ſix working dayes; Nor is it a day in a week <hi>at large,</hi> but ſuch a day as may challenge this title, <hi>The Sabbath of the Lord thy God,</hi> that is, it muſt be a day of Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, When a Maſter ſaith to his ſervant, wait on me eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry week in the day I appoint you, and lay before him great reaſon for it; If the ſervant ſhould ſay, My Maſter looks for no more but that I ſhould wait on him one time or other, it would be but a poor account.</p>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> is not ſilent; for it granteth a God; and that that God is to be worſhipped; and therefore that a time muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be ſet a part for it; and that, a <hi>convenient</hi> time, and in ſuch a diſtance, that we may neither neglect our God, nor our affairs; And, taking it for granted, that the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is known, that is, that God did make the world in ſix dayes, and reſt the ſeventh; Nature hath a fair copy to write by, and a glorious example before it to work upon, and to take a light from, to work and to reſt in ſuch a proportion of time; I ſay, <hi>to reſt,</hi> for Nature ſpeaks out this fully, that the time conſecrated to God muſt be a time of reſt; becauſe we cannot ſerve God in holineſs, and be about profane and common imployment, both at once.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If we take in, to the light and principles of Nature, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2.</note> the aſſiſtance of divine Revelation, then Nature will ſay all that needs to be ſaid for a Sabbath, to wit, that it is fit God ſhould appoint his own time for his own ſervice, and therefore he in his Word having appointed a weekly time, ſuch a time ought to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Setting aſide all the <hi>natural</hi> morality that may be pleaded for a weekly Sabbath, it ſufficeth that the ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3.</note> of one day in ſeven in holy Reſt, is enjoyned by the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive</hi> Law of God; for, why ſhall not the Law of the God of Nature (revealed from Gods mouth, or) written in the Word, bind as well, and as much as the Law of Nature writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the heart? eſpecially conſidering that what is ſpoken or written by God (eſpecially by his own finger, as the Ten Commandements were), is pure and incorrupt, as that is not which is written in mans heart, though it were ſo when it was firſt written. Yea, Why may we not ſay (in ſome reſpect) that it is worſe to diſobey a poſitive law, then a law of Nature? and that becauſe, where Nature ſaith no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but God ſaith all; there's a greater tryal whether Gods Word, his naked Will, and Prerogative Royal, is of any weight with us or no; and in the deſpiſing of ſuch a command, a greater indignity is offered to the Supream Law-giver; as if a Law of his mouth were not worth the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:151789:64"/>
marking, unleſs Nature and Reaſon open their mouths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; unto which we may add, that he who diſobeyeth a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive law, alwayes diſobeyteh a natural, to wit, this, that it is meet and neceſſary, that God ſhould have his will, and retain his ſoveraignty, which by tranſgreſſing a plain precept, wherein Nature can ſay nothing, is more violated. Hence, that firſt ſin, in eating the forbidden fruit, for the forbearing whereof (being conſidered in it ſelf) Nature had not what to ſay, did undo us all, there being thereupon, this charge drawn up againſt all mankind, in the firſt man, <hi>Haſt thou eaten of the Tree whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldeſt not eat</hi>

As, in like manner our firſt-day-Sabbath is grounded on the fourth Commandement, becauſe it is that one of ſeven which God hath appointed to be obſerved ſince Chriſts Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection.
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:151789:65"/>
The ſum is; The <hi>genus,</hi> or general name of <hi>Sabbath</hi> is common to each Sabbath day of Gods inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo comprehends both the Jews Sabbath and ours.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I anſwer, (as before), that, otherwiſe then thus, the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4.</note> fourth Commandement requireth not any particular day; but that which it commandeth, is, (to come more cloſely to the queſtion) <hi>one day in ſeven in relation to ſix working dayes,</hi> as the Commandement it ſelf expreſſeth, ſaying, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labour,—but the ſeventh is the Sabbath;—</hi>as if it had been ſaid, Divide the week, and there being ſeven dayes in it, take thou the ſixth, and give me the ſeventh, and namely, that ſeventh, which I appoint and give order for. And that the Commandement is thus to be interpreted, may appear both by the firſt words thereof, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy;</hi> (he ſaith not, the ſeventh day, but the Sabbath day): as alſo, by the laſt words, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord bleſſed, and hallowed,</hi> (not the ſeventh day, but) <hi>the Sabbath day,</hi> which ſheweth, that the main drift and intent of the Commandement, was not the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Jews ſeventh, or any other particular day, but of a weekly Sabbath, or of one day in every week: ſuch as then was, or afterward was to be, ſpecified, and declared of God to be his day of reſt; yet ſuch as may be called the ſeventh day, becauſe it muſt be the ſeventh part of the weekly time.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>But it is ſaid in the latter part of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and brought in alſo as a reaſon to obſerve it that</hi> God <note place="margin">Object.</note> reſted the ſeventh day, <hi>whence it is thus argued: That day is meant, in the body of the Commandement, as the day enjoyned to be the Sabbath or day of Reſt, wherein God himſelf reſted; But that was the ſeventh in order from the Creation; Therefore that's meant by [ſeventh day] in the body of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yea, in the whole Commandement, for God bleſſed and ſanctified that day for the Sabbath whereon himſelf reſted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I grant that God reſted <hi>that</hi> ſeventh day; and that he bleſſed and ſanctified it, but How? Not meerly <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:151789:65"/>
as that particular ſeventh, but <hi>as a Sabbath,</hi> for ſo (as it was but now ſaid) the Commandement expreſſeth it <note n="k" place="margin">God rested the ſeventh, and bleſſed the Sabbath.</note>; only the bleſſing and ſanctification was, at firſt, fixed on the ſeventh from the Creation, becauſe that was the day ſet a part to be the Lords Sabbath for that firſt age of the world.</p>
                  <p>I grant alſo, that Gods reſting is brought in as a reaſon of the Commandement. But then, the queſtion is, Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the force of that reaſon lyeth? To which I ſay, that it is not brought in as a reaſon of reſting on that individual and preciſe day, wherein God reſted, (ſave only under this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſideration, that it was the day at that time, and for that firſt world, appointed of God to be his Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath) For, it is not a cogent, or inforcing argument, We muſt reſt one day in every week, and never work more then ſix, becauſe God reſted the laſt day of the week: but this is a ſtrong and convincing reaſoning, We muſt reſt one day in ſeven perpetually, and work but ſix, becauſe God our great Lord and Maker, did only work ſix dayes, and make the remaining day (which was then the ſeventh in order) a Sabbath, holding forth that his example for our imitation.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſay this over again in ſome other words, more fully to open my mind, and the matter in hand, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore expreſs it thus, The argument drawn from Gods Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, is not for the ſame day, that is, for that very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth (wherein He reſted) <hi>determinately,</hi> as if it reached and extended it ſelf to no other day in the week; but it is for [a] ſeventh, or for the day wherein God reſted, as a ſeventh <hi>comparatively,</hi> that is, in relation to his ſix working dayes, and therefore they are compared together both in the body of the Commandement, where it is ſaid, <hi>Six dayes ſhalt thou labour, but the ſeventh, is the Sabbath;</hi> and, in the concluſion, wherein it is not barely ſaid, <hi>God reſted the ſeventh day,</hi> but it is brought in with this, <hi>In ſix dayes the Lord made Heaven and Earth,</hi> that is, <hi>ended his work</hi> 
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 2. 2, 3.</note>, and reſted the ſeventh; Sanctifying that day as his Sabbath for thoſe times, and therein, any other
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:151789:66"/>
ſeventh which Himſelf ſhould appoint for his Sabbath in after-times; for any other day of the week may be called the ſeventh day, as it is ſet againſt ſix working dayes <note n="m" place="margin">Suarez <hi>de dieb.

                     </note>. To conclude, the reaſon is not for that <hi>peculiar portion of time</hi> wherein God reſted, as if God meant no more but to reaſon men into the obſervation of that ſeventh day (for then the fourth Commandement is gone, or elſe the Saturday-Sabbath is to be obſerved ſtill): but it is for <hi>the proportion of time,</hi> that is, for a weekly day, or one day in a week; and for the portion and particular day, only accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods appointment: which appointed time, to the Jews was Saturday; to us now, it is the Lords day. <note place="margin">See <hi>Haman L'eſtrange</hi> of Gods Sabbath, <hi>p.</hi> 43. <hi>The ſeventh is the Sabbath.</hi> The ſeventh, What ſeventh? he ſaith not, the ſeventh from the Creation, he nameth no day; if he had, it would have reſtrained the Law to that day: but becauſe he meant the day ſhould change, and yet the Law continue, he ſaith only, the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> that is, the ſeventh after ſix, or one in a week.</note>

If we would know why it is called the Lords-day, the like name <note n="z" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 20.</note> given to the Sacrament of the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, may inform us. Its true, it may be ſaid to be the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> becauſe our Lord roſe on it; and ſo the Euchariſt, the Lords Supper, becauſe our Lord is remembred in it: But beſides this, As we know the Sacrament to be the Lords Supper, becauſe he inſtituted it for the remembrance of his Paſſion <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 23.</note>; So we have great cauſe to think, that the firſt day of the week is called the Lords-day, becauſe our Lord appointed and took order to have it ſet apart for the remembrance of his Reſurrection and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; for the <hi>Lords-day</hi> doth not only imply an acting on it, but an owning of it for his uſe <note n="b" place="margin">It being not called <hi>Dies Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini,</hi> but (which is more) <hi>Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> not of the Lord, but, which is the Lords.</note>: even as the old Sabbath day, being ſaid to be the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day <hi>of the Lord,</hi> Exod. 20. 8, 10. was ſo called, becauſe God did appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate it to himſelf as the ſpecial time of his ſervice: And this is the more confirmed, becauſe <hi>the Service of God was already uſed among the Chriſtians on that day inſtead of the Sabbath, as all the ancients Doctors witneſs, and is to be gathered beſides from Act.</hi> 20. 7. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 2. <note n="c" place="margin">

                     <p n="3">3.

I add laſtly, that if the Apoſtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the Churches to this day, as being guided by that extraordinary and un-erring Spirit that they had, then it was ordained and appointed by Chriſt himſelf; for of that guiding Spirit it is, that our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf,</hi> (that is, not of himſelf only without the Father and the Son) but, <hi>whatſoever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak;</hi> And again, <hi>He ſhall receive of mine,—take of mine, and ſhew it unto you,</hi> Joh. 16. 13. 14, 15.

                     <p>For the confirming of which, that the tranſlation of the Sabbath from the Jewiſh day to the firſt day of the week, was by the Lord himſelf, or divine Authority, I thus argue:</p>

And (ſure) that weekly day of our ſolemn appearing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our God, ought to be honourable in our account: That is a ſign and aſſurance that we are Gods Covenant-people, and peculiar treaſure; for therein lies our ſafety <note n="r" place="margin">Jer. 2. 3.

                        <p>It's very obſervable, that Gods people, reckoning up in their miſeries, Gods mercies, do mention (as the chief there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) Gods Commandements, and among thoſe Laws and Commandements, ſingle out the Sabbath, ſpeaking thus honourably of it, in reference to their Fathers, <hi>And madeſt known unto them thy holy Sabbath</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">Neh 9. 14.</note>, as if there were an eminency in that above other Laws; as indeed there is, in this regard, becauſe as on Fairs and Markets men are furniſhed with commodities of all ſorts, ſo on this day principally, all ſpiritual good things are offered with an invitation to the buying, and for the enjoying of them <note n="x" place="margin">Iſa 55. 1, 2. Mat. 22. 1, 2, 3. Rev. 3. 17, 18.</note>, and that good knowledge of God is more aboundantly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed, whereby all other Commandements are better performed. O, How little is God known to them to whom no Sabbath is made known, or that will not be made to know any Sabbath? The reaſon whereof is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe on that day of Reſt and Religion, there is an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity offered of the freeſt, fulleſt and higheſt Communion with God, without thoſe interruptions that we have on other days, by the crowding in of our earthly occaſions, yea, and that into the inner chamber and cloſet of our hearts, which is the retiring room, wherein God is pleaſed to communicate himſelf abundantly to the faithful ſoul when all worldly things and thoughts are had out, and diſmiſſed for that day; yea, charged, and (as it were) conjured, not

And the truth is, that in the Sabbath all Religion is wrapt up; for God is eminently <hi>acknowledged, worſhipped, profeſſed and praiſed</hi> (as the three firſt Commandements require) upon that day; And all
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:151789:75"/>

But we may not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake here; for albeit it be ſuppoſed, that all Religion is ſpoken to, yet it doth not follow from thence, that the Sabbath day (in the ſetting forth whereof the Text is ſo full) is to be excluded; nay rather, it is thereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eſtabliſhed. As when a Father takes order in his laſt <hi>Will,</hi> that his Son ſhall go to the Univerſity, his meaning is, that his Son ſhall be a Scholar: but (withall) his mind is, that he ſhall go to the Univerſity, becauſe that's the way to make him a Scholar, and therefore he expreſſeth nothing but that, for that contains the other. So it is here.</p>
                           <p>We may obſerve, (caſting our eye upon this whole chapter) that as in the former part of it, the Prophet ſhewed their Religion was not to be placed in <hi>faſting;</hi> ſo here he declareth that the obſervation of the Sabbath, is not to be placed in <hi>reſting</hi> (to which the Jews uſed to aſcribe ſo much) but in the ſpiritual ſanctification of that reſt, which (indeed) hath and ought to have an influence, and to extend its vertue, into our whole life, to make it the more holy: But now mark, that as the Prophet before, in his Doctrine of a Faſt, and his diſciplining of their Faſt, did not exclude the day of their Faſt (and the obſervation thereof); but ſaith plainly <hi>[In the day of your Fast,</hi> v. 3. ſo neither doth he here, where he delivereth the doctrine of the Sabbath, ſhut out the <hi>day</hi> of the Sabbath, but only ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Reſt and leiſure of that day, is to be beſtowed in ſpiritual things appertaining to the ſubſtance, and tending to the furtherance of true Religion.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Some others may ſay, that if the Text be to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the weekly Sabbath, yet it ſpeaks to the Jews <note place="margin">2.</note> only, not to us; and of their day, not of ours: Unto which, it may ſuffice to ſay, that as the fourth Commandement belongs to us as well as to Jews, and the holy obſervation required there, belongs to us, in regard of our Sabbath, as well as to them, in regard of theirs; ſo in this Scripture,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:151789:75"/>
and in the whole Scripture of the Old Teſtament, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thing is Spiritual and of an Evangelical nature, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to us as well as to them, and may upon juſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts be more preſſed on us then on them, becauſe it is our happineſs to have more means for, and therefore out duty to make further progreſs in, all things appertaining to godlineſs. It were very ſtrange to ſay, or think, the Jews were to abſtain from their <hi>own,</hi> ſelf-pleaſing thoughts, words, and actions on their Sabbath; and yet that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may think, ſpeak, and do as they pleaſe on the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Sabbath.

And that this is here comprehended, (for I do not exclude words ſimply evil, but reckon them on this day moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable; I ſay, that this is here comprehended, to wit, the prohibition of common as well as condemned <hi>words)</hi> may appear, becauſe here is a day, evidently ſeparated
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:151789:77"/>
and marked out from common dayes, on which (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) there muſt be none of our own, that is, no ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful words, and therefore it's reaſonable and congruous to conceive the meaning in this place to be, that we muſt ſpeak none of our own words, that is, of our <hi>every dayes</hi> words <note n="m" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Bownd, Doctrine of Sabbath,</hi> I. Book, p. 272, &amp;c.</note>, but that a more holy and refined language is to be uſed on that holy day. Brieſly, no words are to be ſpoken that day which are meerly our own, and not ſome way <hi>Gods,</hi> and relating to his honour and ſervice, whoſe day it is: It is not a day to make Bargains, take Accounts, to talk of Kine, Horſes, Hawks, Hounds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (which on other dayes there's liberty to do), but all the leiſure we have for communication, (or otherwiſe) ſhould be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for the <hi>Reſt</hi> muſt be <hi>holy</hi> the whole day. Yet, I do not mean, that every word is unlawful on the Sabbath that is in its nature earthly, or an expreſſion of ſome worldly thing; for our neceſſities require ſome ſuch words: and works alſo, as are in themſelves, of a worldly and common nature (as about Apparel and Dyet, or other incidental things). But that which I humbly conceive is required, is this, That on that day, our diſcourſe and conference ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſhould be of a more holy and heavenly ſtrain; and that if other <hi>working dayes</hi> words be uſed, it may truly be put on the account of neceſſity, mercy, Chriſtian civility, tending to the honour of Religion, the doing of good, the winning of others to goodneſs, or ſome other end fit to be intended on that day, and which cannot be ſo well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but in that way, that is, by uſing vulgar and common-words, no way to be numbred among ſpiritual expreſſions, unleſs in regard of the end, which an heart wherein there is an habit of holineſs directs them unto. And whoſoever give themſelves leave to talk of what they pleaſe (aſſoon as they are out of Church) will be like to find leſs good by their having been in it, and leſs fitneſs to return again profitably unto it <note n="n" place="margin">Thus by giving way to ordinary words, the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Duries of the Day are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther marr'd or maim'd.</note>, or to be about any private religious Exerciſe, which that holy Day calleth' them unto; for as evil communications corrupt mens minds and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 33.</note>, ſo worldly diſcourſe uſeth to make the heart
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:151789:78"/>
more worldly, and leſs apt for things heavenly, becauſe prepoſſeſſed with earthly: which agreeing better, then that which is better, with our natures, the heart is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more hardly won from them to a due attending to, and affecting of, the things of God.</p>
                           <p>Thus this later part of the verſe expounds the former; for <note place="margin">O Ecolampad.</note> he truly turns not away his foot from the Sabbath, who in word, thought, and work, doth not his own will, but the will of God. Now all this eaſily paſſeth from the <hi>day</hi> to the <hi>way</hi> of God, and that ſubſtance of Piety which is every day a neceſſary duty; yet ſo, as that the ſpiritual obſervation of Gods <hi>holy day,</hi> is a ſpecial means thereof, and help thereunto; I ſay, <hi>the ſpiritual obſervation,</hi> and deſire that ſhould be obſerved, becauſe they who ſpeak more meanly of the Sabbath day? do ſeem to take the word <hi>Sabbath</hi> in a ſtrict ſenſe, and to mean thereby an exact (but idle) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of a day of reſt, without further reference, end due reſpect to that ſanctiſication of the Reſt which the fourth Precept plainly expreſſeth <note n="p" place="margin">Calv. in Iſa. 58 13. <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiùs ſpectavit quàm and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam cae emoni am, hoc eſt, oti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um &amp; quietem; in quo judaei ſanctitatem ſummam ſitam eſſe putabant,—Quod nimis craſſum eſt; admonet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim Propheta</hi> Pſal. 92. <hi>Titulo: &amp;</hi> v. 2, 3, 4. <hi>Sabbatum non rectè coli feri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ando, ſed ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum eſſe ut celebretur Dei nomen,</hi> Calv. in Pſalm. 92. 2.</note>. I ſay, I ſuppoſe they that ſpeak leſs honourably of the day of the Sabbath, look at that empty Sabbatizing; for (otherwiſe) if any man ſhall plead for a reſting from ſin, and the practiſe of holineſs every day, with the ſleighting of the weekly Sab<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bath (as it ought to be obſerv'd) he plainly deſtroys what be pretends to build, and weakeneth Religion every day by weakning the reverence of that day; the which Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-reverence and real reſpect to all Religion, are ſo linked together, that (howſoever there is a difference in regard of the degree, yet) few or none are found to regard either, who regard not both; As they regard not Learning that regard not Schooling, nor Houſe-keeping, that keep not Market-dayes; ſo they regard not godlineſs any day, who regard not the Sabbath-day wherein it is taught, and wherein all proviſions are laid up for a godly life; And (on the other ſide), As they go not to School as they ſhould, but loiter there, that get no learning; nor ſpend their time well at the Market, that bring home no Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; ſo they never keep the Sabbath day rightly, whoſe
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:151789:78"/>
deſire and care is not to live every day religiouſly and Chriſtianly. I ſhall add only this, They who carry this Text to mens general carriage, ſay, There is an alluſion in it to the Sabbath-day; and ſaying ſo, they muſt needs (I think) grant that the Sabbath, to which the Prophet alludeth had theſe things in it (that is, holineſs of heart, tongue, and carriage) as in the Epitome, which are (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward) to be ſpread forth at large, in all godlineſs of life, all the days of the week and of our life; only with this difference, that things lawful on other days, by the allowance of Scripture (and needful alſo,) are on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-day, unlawful, becauſe of the diſtinction made in the fourth Commandement, between the Reſt and holineſs of that weekly day, and the work and imployment of the ſix working-days; On all days we ſhould be ſober, righteous, and godly <note n="q" place="margin">Tit. 2. 12.</note>; but on the <hi>Lords-day</hi> we ſhould be <hi>in the Spirit</hi>

2. In the adorning of thoſe perſons who reverence and carefully obſerve this day of God, and ſo thrive in god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and the fear of God; There is no reaſon (here) to lay aſide the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah, chap.</hi> 56. 3.—to <hi>v.</hi> 9. eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally conſidering that it hath a reſpect to the times of the New-Teſtament, wherein Gentile-ſtrangers were received into the Church <note n="g" place="margin">Compare Iſa. 56. 5, 7, 8. with Joh. 10. 16. &amp; Rom. 9. 24, 25, 26. Eph. 2. 12, 13.</note>. Now in that Propheſie the Lord ſaith to Strangers and Eunuchs, <hi>that keep the Sabbath, and chuſe the things that pleaſe him, and lay hold on his Covenant,</hi> (all which are like a golden Chain, of divers links, inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the one from the other; the keeping of the Sabbath from the reſt, and the reſt from that); I ſay, the Lord ſaith to ſuch, (though they be ſtrangers, and have no name in the Church; though they be Eunuchs, and ſo can have no children to preſerve their name, nor be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by the name of Fathers) <hi>Even unto them will I give, in my Houſe, and within my Walls,</hi> (that is, in the Church, <hi>the Houſe of the living God.</hi> 1 Tim. 3. 15. and within the wals of the ſpiritual Jeruſalem, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87. 4, 5.—) <hi>a name better then of ſons and daughters,</hi> that is, better then that which ariſeth from the begetting of ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For what is the name of <hi>Fathers of ſons,</hi> unto the name of <hi>ſons of God, of the Lord God Almighty</hi>

Rev. 2. 17. &amp; 3. 5, 12.</note>? yet Strangers and Eunuchs ſhall have this Name given them, which is an everlaſting name (for a ſon of God once, and a ſon of God ever, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 1.) and which gives in with it an everlaſting fame and honour, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112. 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 5. How honourable is the name of the <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian Eunuch</hi> unto this day, after that by believing he was made the ſon of God? <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. yea, ſuch ſhall be glorified at the laſt day, by Jeſus Chriſt, before his Father and the Angels, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10, 12. I ſay again, (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Explication of this Propheſie) that there is no juſt reaſon to lay it aſide in this argument of the Sabbath: For as the Covenant (mentioned there) and the condition of that Covenant, to wit, laying hold of it by faith, do ſtill continue; ſo (albeit the Jews Sabbath be gone, yet) a Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath ſtill remains, wherein as the Spiritual duties of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:151789:81"/>
old Sabbath are to be performed, ſo the honours and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges attending on, and promiſed to, that performance may be expected; I mean, being interpreted according to the ſpiritual ſtate of the Goſpel.</p>
                           <p>However, it is a clear truth, that honour and eſtimation ſtill followeth the fear of God, I ſay, that fear of God, which is learned, and ſtill better learned, by Sabbath-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Exerciſes <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 34. 11. Deut. 31. 13. with Act. 13. 14, 15, 27.</note>; and it ſo far followeth it, that every one that will be accounted a Citizen of Zion, and heir of Heaven, is bound to honour thoſe in whom this fear of God is found <note n="k" place="margin">Pſal. 15. 4.</note>; As on the contrary, a <hi>vile perſon,</hi> (which is a name that falls heavily, on Sabbath-profaners, and profane livers, which two uſe to go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="l" place="margin">Prov. 23. 20, 21.</note>,) is, and ought to be, of all ſuch, contemned: not <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

                           <p>And if we look on the ſtate of things amongſt our ſelves, it's eaſie to obſerve that they have not taken a good courſe, either for their comfort or honour: Unto one and another of whom, the Sabbath may ſay, <hi>Thou haſt thruſt ſore at me that I might fall, but the Lord helped me</hi> 
                              <note n="m" place="margin">Pſal. 118. 13.</note>, yea, they themſelves from whom the Chriſtian Sabbath hath received but hard meaſure, yet, confeſs it <hi>meet, that Chriſtians on the Lords day ſhould abandon all worldly affairs, and dedicate it wholly to the honour of God</hi>

And again, That <hi>they that are ſo piouſly affected on the Lords-day, as to retire from ſecular buſineſs, and ordinary pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, that they may more freely attend the ſervice of Chriſt, are to be commended and incouraged</hi>

Whatever diſputes therefore there be, yet the Concluſion is, that the holy obſervation of the Lords-day, (now, the weekly Sabbath-day) is a commendable thing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dounds to the honour of thoſe that ſo obſerve it.

                           <p>This refers plainly to the Jews, (whoſe Father <hi>Jacob</hi> was <note n="p" place="margin">Joh. 4. 12.</note>) who while they obſerved Gods holy Sabbath, and other of his Commandements well, were well fed and fill'd <note n="q" place="margin">Neh. 9. 14, 15, 25.</note>, and ſo, if they had kept the Sabbath from pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it, and kept their hand from doing any evil, might ſtill have been <note n="r" place="margin">Iſai. 1. 19.

                              <note n="x" place="margin">Mal. 3. 16.</note>, ſufficiently appeareth, in that they bleſs the Lord with all their hearts and ſouls for appointing ſuch a day, (for when ſhould we have ſet a part a whole day (in any due diſtance) for God, and for the enjoying of God, if God had not done it himſelf?)

                              <note n="y" place="margin">Mat. 17. 1.</note>, where they ſee his face ſhine as the Sun, and are ſo extraordinarily taken and delighted with what they ſee and feel, that they ſay feelingly, <hi>It is good for us to be here.</hi> In brief, The Sabbath with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Ordinances and Exerciſes of that day) is (towards their latter end eſpecially) like <hi>Mount Abarim</hi>

Albeit therefore I ſhall eaſily grant, that we have great cauſe to deſire God to be merciful to us in this thing, that our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in Sabbath-duties is ſo dim, yet it doth not follow from thence, that there is none. If God ſhould take away Sabbaths from us, I doubt not, but that in all good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, the grief would prove the delight; for no man is grieved to loſe what he never lov'd nor took any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in; I ſay, it is thus in all good and truly godly, and eſpecially, <hi>greatly-</hi>godly perſons; for, as the man is, ſo is his delight; No marvel if the men of the world ſay, When <hi>will the Sabbath be gone</hi>

                  <q>Texts of Scripture to prove Catechiſing in Families a duty.</q>
                  <p>It is not my purpoſe here to mention every Text of Scripture that gives ſtrength to this neceſſary duty, but ſhall content my ſelf with the naming (and with the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) of two Texts in the Old-Teſtament, and one in the New.</p>
                  <p>The firſt in the Old Teſtament is, Deut. 6. 6, 7. <hi>Theſe words which I command thee this day ſhall be in thy heart, And thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and ſhalt

talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lieſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the opening of this Scripture, and the awakening of Conſcience to a due conſideration of it, there comes to be conſidered in the firſt place, Who it is that ſpeaks in it, even the Eternal God by his Servant <hi>Moſes,</hi> that was faithful in all his houſe. Remember that it is <hi>He</hi> that ſaith, <hi>Keep theſe words that I command thee this day</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note>. But, How muſt Parents keep them? (For, to Parents, and every Parent, God here ſpeaks, and, in anſwer to that queſtion, ſaith) <hi>Theſe words ſhall be in thine heart:</hi> yet are they not only to be in the hearts of thoſe that have Families, but in their houſes, therefore it is added, <hi>Thou ſhalt teach them thy chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Nor was this a Ceremonial Precept, or a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement given peculiarly to the Jews for their aſſiſtance in the remembrance of the Law of God, as their Phylacteries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>fringes and faſtning the Law to their door-poſts <note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 13. 9, 16. Deut. 6. 8, 9.</note>; but it was, and is, a moral, and perpetual Precept, binding us in Goſpel-times as well as them, and therefore the very ſame things that we read in this Text, we find alſo in the New-Teſtament: That is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Word of Chriſt muſt dwell <hi>in us</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Col. 3 16.</note>, which is all one with this here, <hi>Let it be in thine heart.</hi> And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it muſt be in our houſes alſo, for Parents are required to bring up their <hi>children in the nurture and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Lord</hi>

                  <p>Yea, of old, they did uſe to dedicate their own houſes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, with a <hi>more common,</hi> but yet, religious and pious, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication <note n="p" place="margin">

                  <p>I anſwer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That if we will conſider of this rightly, we muſt ſet one thing againſt another; and then it will be found <note place="margin">

                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>But to the main Objection propounded, I ſhall give a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Anſwer, which is this; Catechiſing is conſidered two <note place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. In regard of the preſent action.</p>

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:151789:89"/>
the Name and Things of God; yet it followeth not, that they take Gods Name in vain, becauſe they repeat good things in order to, and for, the gaining of ſuch a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and of thoſe holy things, as whereby after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward they come to uſe them more reverently; And therein, the firſt uſe of them, (though not ſo reverent) hath a part, as being preparatory to it, and having an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence into it, and working, as a good means for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting of it. As when Parents teach very little children their <hi>letters</hi> by ſigns, and certain pretty deviſed ſayings and reſemblances, which put their little ones in mind of them, this is not a vanity but a way ſuited to their littleneſs, to make them learn them the ſooner: ſo it is in this and the like caſes; For, The firſt Rudiments are ſtill to be taken and judged of, not in a way of ſeparation from what follows after, but as a preparation to it, and being ſo taken, they are not vain, but material things, becauſe they ſerve to very conſiderable ends.</p>
                  <p>This ſhall ſuffice for the Old-Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>The Precept, preſcribing Catechiſing in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is laid down <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 4. in theſe words; <hi>And ye Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, provoke not your children to wrath, but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.—</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the Precept contained in theſe words there are two Branches;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Parents are warned, not to abuſe their office, power, and authority by provoking their children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor to neglect to make uſe of it in inſtructing their children; and both theſe are not without great reaſon mentioned: For in Parents there is not only Nature, and natural affection, but natural corruption, by reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if they watch not well, it will be very incident unto them to be curious; yea, and furious with their children, that their own will may be fulfilled: There is need there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to fay, <hi>Provoke not.</hi> And, on the other ſide, there is a danger of being too indulgent, and careleſs, to bring up children to ſuch courſes as are neceſſary for the knowing and doing of the will of God: Hence it is that there is
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:151789:90"/>
as much, or much more need of the latter branch of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, which is, <hi>But bring them up in the nurture and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt word <hi>[But]</hi> ſerves well to joyn together the two branches of the Precept, or parts of the verſe: for it holds forth a cure of the Provocation ſpoken of in the former part; and a care of the Inſtruction preſcribed in the latter part; Do not provoke, but inſtruct; yea, inſtruct, and you will not, or, at leaſt, you ſhall not have cauſe, to provoke; for a well-inſtructed child is in Gods way to be an obedient child, and very tractable to the inſtructing Parents, ſo that there ſhall not be any occaſion of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking from him, or being provoked againſt him. A care of the duty in the latter part of the verſe, will be a good prevention of the fault in the former part; for thy child knowing from thee Gods mind (O Chriſtian Parent) will not (God bleſſing the inſtruction, of which the Precept to give it, giveth the hope); I ſay, he will not do contrary to thy mind, if thy mind agree with Gods mind.</p>
                  <p>After this connecting and conjoyning Particle, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Precept concerning childrens <hi>nurture,</hi> which Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, howſoever, in it ſelf, it comprehends good and wholſom Inſtruction of every kind; yet the laſt words <hi>[of the Lord]</hi> faſten it on that religious nurture, and admonition, which is, of all other the principal, and of which it belongs to this place to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Now whileſt I come to the further opening of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, it may be noted that there are (in the <hi>Original)</hi> three words offered to our Obſervation, the explaining whereof will ſerve for a more full diſcerning of what is here preſcribed.</p>
                  <p>The firſt word is, <hi>nouriſh or feed them</hi>

ſpeaking to <hi>Timothy</hi>

The life and manners cannot be good, unleſs the mind be good <note n="m" place="margin">Act. 8. 21. Tit. 1. 15, 16.</note>; The mind cannot be good without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note n="n" place="margin">Prov. 19. 2.</note>; Nor will Knowledge be had without Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admoniſhing <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 8. 31.</note>. In that therefore, as in a Golden Mine, the riches of religious Education lyeth, and is laid up.</p>
                  <p>O that ſo plain and full a Precept might ſo convince the underſtandings, poſſeſs and preſs the hearts, of Chriſtian Parents, as to prevail with them for the bringing up of their Children, not only in Arts and Sciences, to make them wiſe; nor only in myſteries of trading and worldly imployment, to make them rich; nor only in matters of morality and civil honeſty, to make them vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: but in myſteries of Religion, in the nurture and information of the Lord, to make them truly godly and happy.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only add this, (which I touched a little before) which is, that though children only be named in the Text, yet this ſhould not cauſe Houſholders to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſcharged, if they Catechiſe their Children and never inſtruct other young ones that are a part of their Houſhold: for, He that is the Maſter of the Houſe, is the Father of the whole Family, and may ſpeak to all the Youth in it, as <hi>Eli</hi> to <hi>Samuel</hi> 
                     <note n="p" place="margin">1 Sam. 3. 6.</note>, whom he called his <hi>ſon,</hi> and accordingly ſhould diſperſe knowledge among them that they may not live under his roof, care, and charge without ſome acquaintance with God, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:151789:91"/>
being bredd up to do ſome homage and ſervice to Him. It would be a poor buſineſs for <hi>Mothers</hi> to ſay, We need not bring up our children in any good nurture, for the Scripture in the New-Teſtament, (that eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it) names only <hi>Fathers:</hi> No more will Fathers be excuſed, becauſe none are named here to be inſtructed by them, but only their children. It's true, that under the notion of Fathers of children (of whoſe duty the Apoſtle here properly ſpeaketh) they are called to Catechiſe their own children; but as they are Maſters and Fathers of Families, a further care and charge lies upon them in regard of other young ones, and namely, of Servants under them, and with them.</p>
                  <p>Yet I do not ſay, That Houſholders are bound to walk in the ſame way with thoſe that are elder in the Family, as they do with their children; or to beſtow the ſame time in inſtructing ſervants and children. It's true, that to appoint ſome day or dayes in a week, to examine and go on with ſervants, in ſome ſound and plain Catechiſm, (as namely, the <hi>Aſſemblies ſhort Catechiſm)</hi> is a godly Exerciſe, and a provident way to preſerve the duty of Family-Inſtruction, and to make it the more minded: But, yet, if Houſholders did but upon the Sabbath-day call thoſe that be grown up to give account of the Sermons they hear; Chapters read in the Family on the week-days; And further, If having (as they ought) an eye upon their carriage, and ſeeing any neglect or fault in them, they did take them to task, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion with them about it, reprove and admoniſh them, that for time to come they might amend it; and, then obſerve whether they do ſo or no; even this I ſay, (with ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the very firſt Principles of Religion in way of conference) might paſs for that which we call <hi>(Catechiſing)</hi> that word in Scripture <note n="q" place="margin">Luk. 1. 4. 1 Cor. 14. 19. Gal. 6. 6.</note>, being divers times applyed to a more general kind of Teaching; But, if ſuch a conceſſion as this, and yielding to any thing, be abuſed; if nothing be done in this duty, or nothing to purpoſe; then may one Servant and another (if it be poſſible for an uncatechiſed Servant to have ſo much grace), come and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:151789:92"/>
ſay ſeriouſly and ſadly, (I ſay ſadly, both in regard of themſelves and the Houholder), <hi>Maſter, Careſt thou not that we periſh?</hi> And let the Maſter conſider, how he will anſwer it.</p>
                  <p>Mean-while that I may return to the Text, as it ſtands clear for Parents Catechiſing, let it be (in the laſt place) obſerved, that Parents Inſtruction of their Children is of ſo great importance, that if they therein did their duty, then the work concerning Servants were already (in a good part) done; for they ſhould deliver (in this way) to every Maſter a catechiſed Servant, and ſo the Maſter ſhould have nothing to do, but to preſerve and carry on that which is already brought to his hand. But, if for want of this godly care (O Chriſtian Maſter), a catechized Servant be not brought to thee; let there be ſo much goodneſs in thee, and ſo much love to his ſoul, as that he may go a catechi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed-Servant from thee.</p>

                           <hi>Anſw.</hi> Reaſon teacheth to do it betimes; For, As all that deſire to have knowing children in any kind of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> begin with them in the beginning of their time <hi>(i. e.),</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as they come to be capable of the firſt Principles thereof: So the morning of life, the firſt of childrens time (after they are come to any competent capacity) is the beſt ſeaſon for the exerciſing and improving of their underſtanding in the knowledge of Religion. No marvel therefore, if we find that <hi>Timothy from a child had known the holy Scripture</hi> 
                           <note n="t" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 15.</note>. And that our Saviour honoured this courſe of timely Inſtruction, by converſing himſelf (when but twelve year old) among the Doctors in a kind of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techetical way, <hi>both hearing them, and asking them queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 
                           <note n="u" place="margin">Luk. 2. 42, 46.</note>. If any ſay, Let children grow up, and then be brought to the Miniſtry, and hear Sermons, and that may ſuffice. I anſwer, If it be ſuppoſed, that they are left to the Miniſtry; yet, (being not catechized before) they are left to it unprepared for it; And I add further, What if they die before that time? then, they muſt die un-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and that (I think) muſt needs be a ſad death to the negligent Parents, and a dangerous death to the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected child; whereas it is found by comfortable experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that divers, very young, have dyed with very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, and ſome, with very rare, expreſſions of knowledge and godlineſs, attained by timely teaching. If it be further ſaid, That children may be delivered over to Catechiſing-School-Maſters and Miniſters; I anſwer, that's a good help to, but no good diſcharge from, Parents Inſtruction, on whom it lies as a duty, (for it is not ſaid, <hi>you Fathers</hi> ſend them to others, but, <hi>bring them up your</hi> ſelves); and who ſhould, more naturally, care for their childrens ſouls; who may begin ſooner to exerciſe that care; who have a ſhorter work, (having to do only with
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:151789:93"/>
their own not others children;) and have a larger and better opportunity to carry it on, by thoſe frequent times they may allot to it, and thoſe <hi>Parental</hi> wayes that are in their hands to promote it. Parents do ſomething for their children when they put them forth to nurſe, but they ſhall do better to nurſe them up themſelves with their own more kindly milk, and more natural attendance.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond Argument to move Parents to the duty of Catechiſing is the ſingular profit thereof, and that <note place="margin">2.</note> both in regard of their children; and the Church of God.</p>
                        <p>As to their children; there is a profitable, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing power in it, in regard of the time, manner, and good effects of the careful performing of it.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In regard of the <hi>time]</hi> For when children are young <note place="margin">1.</note> and tender, they are then moſt capable, (though not by the ripeneſs of their underſtanding, yet by the flexible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their age) as of any evil that they ſee or hear, ſo of any good that ſhall be diſcreetly infuſed and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; like young twigs eaſily bowed; or like ſoft Wax <note n="x" place="margin">Udum &amp; molle lutum es: nunc nunc pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perandus, &amp; acri Fingendus fine fine rota.</note>, that eaſily receives any impreſſion, when (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grown harder, eſpecially if better things be fore-ſtall'd by worſe, as they will ſurely be) it will be much more hard to imprint the Image of God, and godlineſs upon them.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In regard of the <hi>manner]</hi> Catechiſing propounds the queſtion, and puts the Child to anſwer it, as the Eccho doth <note place="margin">2.</note> the Voyce <note n="y" place="margin">
                              <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>.</note>. Now, the readieſt way to make any Inſtruction to take, is to require returns from thoſe that are inſtructed: whence it is, that in all Schools of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that courſe is taken, whereas, if you ſpeak never ſo well, or ſo long (yea, the longer the worſe) in a ſet and continuate ſpeech, it uſeth to vaniſh in the air, without any obſervable notice, or after-fruit.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In regard of the <hi>effect]</hi> For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. This makes them fit to hear Sermons fruitfully; and that both becauſe the words that Miniſters uſe in Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note place="margin">1.</note> are, before-hand made familiar to them; and, becauſe the grounds of Religion, whereon they build their Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:151789:93"/>
are laid open to childrens underſtandings, and in ſome meaſure, laid in their hearts by their religious breeding: whereas, if a Miniſter be the firſt Teachet, the language of <hi>Canaan</hi> is ſo ſtrange to a young Hearer, that (unleſs God work upon the heart, and bring in a light from Heaven into it) he hardly knows what to make of heavenly words or matter. Now, though godly Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will not be ſavingly effectual without regenerating grace, yet this we may ſay of it, that children religiouſly bred up, are <hi>not far from the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> to wit, in compariſon of others not ſo educated; for they can anſwer, <hi>more diſcteetly,</hi> Mark. 12. 34</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This is the way to make them greatly good; as <hi>Obadiah</hi> is ſaid to <hi>fear the Lord greatly</hi> 
                           <note n="z" place="margin">1 King. 18. 3. &amp; v. 12.</note>, which (with <note place="margin">2.</note> good reaſon) may be aſcribed (in a way of means) to his fearing the Lord <hi>timely,</hi> and (as is expreſſed) <hi>from his youth.</hi> O How much ſin is, in this way, prevented? which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring in quickly, becauſe it is not kept out by good nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will (afterward) either grieve the ſoul by an heart-renting repentance (and that's the beſt of it) or ruine the ſoul for want of repentance. And (on the other ſide), How much good is done by this firſt goodneſs? even to others; for, How eminent a Reformer was that glorious <hi>Joſiah,</hi> who <hi>being yet young, began to ſeek after the God of his Father David</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="margin">2 Chr. 34. 3.</note>? which ſeeking is (ordinarily) ſet on in <hi>David</hi>'s way, that is, by Parents Inſtruction and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <note n="b" place="margin">1 Chr. 28. 9.</note>; yea, we find a <hi>little</hi> captive Maid, bred up (as appears) to a reverence of the Lords Prophet, to be the Inſtrument of an happy cure of her great Maſters both body and ſoul <note n="c" place="margin">2 King. 5. 2, 3, 14, 15.</note>. But, beſides the good of others, How great is the comfort which ariſeth to themſelves, who are taught to know and ſerve God early? and that by the ſweet remembrance (when they are old) of their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring their Creator when they were young, and in thoſe days wherein they had <hi>moſt pleaſure,</hi> whereby they may confidently conclude, that their God and faithful Creator will remember them in their old age, and thoſe decaying days wherein <hi>there is no pleaſure,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 1.</p>
                        <p n="3">
                           <pb n="148" facs="tcp:151789:94"/>
3. This is the way to make them conſtantly good, and that by an aſſurance from the mouth of God himſelf, who <note place="margin">3.</note> ſaith, that, <hi>When he is old he will not depart from it</hi> 
                           <note n="d" place="margin">Prov. 22. 6.</note>; Not that it is ever ſo, but it is truly ſo, for the God of Truth hath ſaid it; And ſomething is gained by it, even in thoſe that go quite from God at laſt, <hi>viz.</hi> that they do (for a time) very good offices for the people of God, and keep in an orderly way, as <hi>Joaſh</hi> did whileſt <hi>Jehoiada</hi> inſtructed him, and trained him up in the wayes of God, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 2. Indeed, the Proverb of the prophane and godleſs world is, <hi>A young Saint and an old Devil;</hi> when they ſhould ſay, (if they had any grace to ſay it), <hi>A young Saint, and an old Angel:</hi> for they that, by good education are planted in the Courts of the Lords Houſe, <hi>bring forth fruit in old age,</hi> and even then <hi>they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing,</hi> Pſal. 92. 14.</p>
                        <p>By theſe things it may ſomewhat appear, that it is ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to religious reaſon as well as to Scripture, to urge thoſe that have children and charges, to inſtruct them in the things of God in their tender and youthful time; But if there were no other argument, yet conſcience might be hereunto moved and perſwaded by the great unwillingneſs which we find in our evil natures to ſpend half an hour in Catechiſing; and the many devices that the Devil hath to divert it, when many half hours are waſted either in vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or impertinencies; and yet we cannot but know (if Religion be of any value with us) that no time can be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpent then that which is beſtowed with young ones in bringing them up in <hi>the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But to drive this further home, I ſhall add the ſecond branch of this Argument, and that is the benefit that ariſeth from this Exerciſe, <hi>to the Church of God,</hi> for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Religion is preſerved and increaſed by this labour of Love in reſpective Families; Hence it was that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Fathers of old, to make known the Law of God to their children, <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal. 78. 5, 6, 7.</note>, <hi>That the Generation to come might know the Law and Teſtimonies of the Lord, even the

And this God obſerved in <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would <hi>command his Children, and his Houſhold after him,</hi> that is, ſo as that there might be a Religion after him, and ſurviving him; for it is added, <hi>and they ſhall walk in the way of the Lord to do juſtice and judgement</hi>

                  <p>FOraſmuch as in this (and things of the like nature) Carnal-reaſon ſtands upon its guard, and will yield to no more then needs it muſt; and men, devoted to the World, and the Fleſh, are very witty to keep out of their Houſes this kind of Devotion, in as much as it ſeems to be a diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and impediment to their better beloved wayes: I ſhall (therefore) lay before the Religious Reader, ſuch Conſiderations, as I conceive moſt material for the urging and eſtabliſhing of this holy Exerciſe.</p>
                  <p>Wherein, all I have to ſay, may be ſummed up into Grounds of Scripture; and Reaſon agreeing with Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>Scripture-grounds I ſhall put into the four following Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</p>

                     <p>In this way our Saviour proves the Reſurrection of the body <note n="a" place="margin">Mat. 22. 31, 32.</note>, to wit, from this general ground of Scripture, that <hi>God is the God of Abraham, Iſſac, and Jacob</hi>

                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:151789:98"/>
In the ſame manner alſo <hi>Paul</hi> reſolveth the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in the matter of Mariage, putting a difference <note n="d" place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid. Beza d. Repud p.</hi> 109.</note> between what God ſpake from himſelf by expreſs Command, and what he ſpake by him (as a faithful Miniſter, according to the mind of Chriſt) <note n="e" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 40.</note> in a caſe where there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſpecial Precept. Concerning the firſt, he ſaith, <hi>Not I command, but the Lord</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 10.</note>, that is, it is the plain will of Chriſt (as appears by his words <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 31, 32. &amp; 19. 6, 9.) that they that are marryed ſhould not part (unleſs for that Adultery which God declares, diſſolves the marriage-bond) one from another. But now coming to another queſtion, to wit, <hi>Whether the unmarried ſhould marry? and, whether they that had virgins were bound to beſtow them in marriage?</hi> he expreſſeth himſelf thus, <hi>I ſay,</hi> v. 8. (not the Lord, and not I, as <hi>v.</hi> 10.) and more plainly <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>I have NO commandement of the Lord;</hi> that is, there is no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and certain Precept in the Word of God, to bind any particular man (ſimply) to Marry, or not to Marry, (a ſingle life being no where either commanded or forbidden); yet (ſaith he) <hi>I give my judgement;</hi> that is, in a thing which (in it ſelf) is indifferent, I give my advice and counſel; but withal ſignifyeth, that, what he ſaith, is not to be looked upon as the judgement of an ordinary man (that may be taken or left as men liſt) but as the determination of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter and Apoſtle of Chriſt, <hi>who obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful;</hi> that is, faithful to teach and declare (as the Doctor of the Church) the mind of God, (and that by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> v. 40.) to thoſe that ſought to him for his advice; And therefore whileſt he adviſed them unto that which (in regard of the circumſtances) was moſt expedient, they were bound to reverence and obſerve it, from which counſel (notwithſtanding) out of that caſe, and if not clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with ſuch circumſtances as he mentioneth, they might recede without ſin: which cannot be ſaid of an expreſs Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God <note n="g" place="margin">
                           <hi>Vid. Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron. myrothec. in</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 25.</note>.</p>
                     <p>But that which I would more eſpecially obſerve, is, that <hi>Paul</hi> (being ſought by the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to inform them about Mariage) doth not reſolve them abſolutely, and enjoyn them
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:151789:98"/>
either to Marry, or not to Marry, becauſe he had no ſpecial word of God for it; but <hi>he gives his judgement</hi> for taking the one courſe or the other according as he ſtated it; And (to come to my purpoſe) he ſtated it according to thoſe general grounds of Scripture; by which as he was guided to give them a ſound Anſwer, ſo they were bound to a ready and reverend receiving of it. For, what doth he ſay? or, what grounds doth he lay, but that Chriſtians are not to enter into the Marryed eſtate,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Wantonly,</hi> fancying an high felicity in it, and ſo long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vainly after it; Nay (ſaith the Apoſtle) you muſt make account to have <hi>trouble in the fleſh</hi>

                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Irreligiouſly;</hi> that is, without a ſerious and godly thinking of this own main thing, that it is our duty to deſign and diſpoſe our ſelves into, that eſtate wherein we may <hi>attend upon the Lord without</hi> (or with leaſt) <hi>diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>

                     <p>Now, All theſe things are ſo ſutable to the ſenſe of Scripture, and to Reaſon alſo (enlightened by Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation) that if men will not be thus ruled, it ſhews, they are not willing God ſhould rule them. It's true (indeed) that Miniſters (now) are not infallible nor to be compared with <hi>Paul</hi> (as an Apoſtle); but yet this may be inferred from <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of anſwering the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Queſtions, That any thing is binding truly, that is deduced from the <hi>generals</hi> of Scripture rightly; elſe could no uſe be made at
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:151789:99"/>
all (now) of general Scripture-truths (as to the deciding of particular caſes); becauſe no man (now) is infallible, and ſo men muſt be left to do what they liſt, in thoſe things that are not particularly and punctually defined and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Word of God. And, How many ſuch things are there? wherein, if we ſet aſide the general ſayings and declarations of the Word, it will be hard for Miniſters to know what to ſay? To mention ſome familiar Inſtances. We cannot tell Chriſtian Women (particularly), what clothes they ſhould wear, or how they ſhould dreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but we can tell them from God <note n="n" place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 9, 10.</note>, that they muſt <hi>adorn themſelves in medeſt apparel, with ſhamefaſtneſs and ſobriety,</hi> which ſhuts out (as abſolutely unlawful) <hi>platted hair, or gold, or pearls, or coſtly aray:</hi> I ſay, as abſolutely unlawful, ſo far (and ſo uſed) as they croſſe that general rule of Modeſty, Shamefaſtneſs, and Sobriety; and ariſe from Pride, Lightneſs, Luxury and Intemperance. Again, we cannot ſay, juſt how much men ſhould eat and drink at a Meal, or a Meeting; but, we may and muſt tell them (and our ſelves) that <hi>Whether we eat or drink, it muſt be to the glory of God</hi> 
                        <note n="o" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 31.</note>; which ſtrikes ſtrongly at, and argues unanſwerably againſt, the ungodly, unſober, and worſe then Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <note n="p" place="margin">Eſth. 1. 8.</note> drinking of <hi>Healths,</hi> and clean cuts off diſſolute and drunken Meetings, and all ſuch uſe of the c<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="3 letters">

                        </gap>tures as is either diſhonorable to the Creator, or bringeth no glory at all to him. Laſtly, (that I may ſpeak of one thing more, becauſe it is in every ones eye) we cannot tell men, juſt how long they oughr to wear their hair, but it doth not therefore follow, that, if inſtead of wearing their hair on their heads or necks, they wear it (as far as they can get it to go) on their backs, ſhoulders, and breaſts, that they may do this without any Divine controul: For we can tell them, that things Indifferent, are to be governed and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by thoſe things that are not Indifferent; if therefore mens long hair ariſe from pride, vanity of minde, and an affectation of being fine (as they think) that way, then its ſure unlawful; for though there be an indifferency in the cutting and ordering of the hair, yet Pride is no indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:151789:99"/>
thing. Or, If men do it in compliance with others, that in theſe dayes uſe ſo much to exceed; that general rule, <hi>Be not conformed to this World</hi> 
                        <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 12. 2</note> will, in the juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thereof, give a check to it. Or, If it be of ill report, and an offence to the wiſe and godly, it doth (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard) thwart with thoſe Rules, which require us to do <hi>things of good Report</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">Phil. 4. 8.</note>, and, in things indifferent, to <hi>give no offence</hi> to any <note n="ſ" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 32.</note>. And moreover, we can tell them what the Apoſtle ſaith, and what Queſtion he propounds for better order amongſt the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth,</hi> which is this, <hi>Doth not even nature it ſelf teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a ſhame to him</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 14.</note>? Let men conſider how they will anſwer the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> whoſe words (whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhuffle men make) are, at leaſt, thus far convincing, <note place="margin">

                     <p>If it be ſaid, <hi>For Men to wear hair as long as Women is (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) a fault, but not otherwiſe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To that I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That Men cannot wear, becauſe they cannot have (ordinarily) hair ſo long as Women. Nature will not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford it them, having given Women a moiſter temperature to nouriſh that hair, which is their diſtinguiſhing ornament and glory.</p>

                     <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it doth not follow, that it is not againſt nature (ſtrictly taken) to wear very long hair, becauſe
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:151789:100"/>

Its true, there cannot be ſo ſolemn an Aſſembly in a Private houſe, as when the trumpet is blown in <hi>Zion;</hi> but yet a Chriſtian-Houſholder, kneeling before the Lord, with his Wife, and Children, and whole Family, is (in ſome part, and with a Religious reſemblance) like <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Judah, ſtanding before the Lord with their little ones, their Wives, and their Children</hi>

                        <note n="o" place="margin">Act. 12. 5, 11, 12.</note>. Nor is the joyning of the Family in Prayer, beneficial only for the better hearing of the petitions preſented to God in the generality; but in ſpecial, for the better ſpeeding of all houſhold-affairs; for, as our nouriſhment, ſo our imployment, is <hi>ſanctified by the Word and Prayer</hi> 
                        <note n="p" place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 5.</note>; which is the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in a Family, becauſe the Scripture lets us know, how much the proſperity thereof depends on the bleſſing of God <note n="q" place="margin">Pſal. 127. 1, 2.</note>; which is, (as was ſaid before) like to be more obtained, when it is ſought by more, and when God is wreſtled with, by an united ſtrength of Faith and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency.</p>

what ſtrength can they give to the Duty of Prayer?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That the ſame objection might have been made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <note place="margin">1.</note> all <hi>Judah that ſtood before God with their little ones, their Wives, and their Children</hi> 
                        <note n="r" place="margin">2 Chron. 20. 13.</note>: for (ſure) <hi>they were not all Iſrael</hi> (that is, truly gracious and <hi>clean in heart</hi> 
                        <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 73. 1.</note>) <hi>that were of Iſrael</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Rom. 9. 6.</note>. And yet we find that of that general appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, there was a great acceptation; yea, God will have <hi>gathered together children, and thoſe that ſuck the breaſts</hi> 
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Joel 2. 16.</note>. Beſides that, it is required, that in the Church (which will always be a <note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 22. 14.</note> mixt company) <hi>[Amen]</hi> ſhould be ſaid by the whole Aſſembly, which notes ſuch a conjunction, as makes the Prayer common to all; yea, and commodious alſo: for God requires no unprofitable thing. Now the reaſon why God requires and accepts this joyning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is, becauſe He is honoured; yea, his honour is heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by the ſubmiſſion and ſeeking of his People when they are gathered together, though divers or many of the company are not perſons truly gracious. And howſoever Infants and Sucklings cannot pray, (and ſo, ſorry Men and Women are like to pray very poorly themſelves); yet others, by looking on them, and taking to heart their haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous condition, may thereby be ſtirred up to pray much more earneſtly and effectually. Yea, the Beaſts of <hi>Niniveh</hi> may lowden their cry, <hi>Jonab</hi> 3. 8.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. I anſwer, That it is too high and hard for us, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <note place="margin">2.</note> who (in a Family) have true Grace, and who have not; and we are not to reaſon away conjunction in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Exerciſes by uncertain conjectures. Nay, though they do by their outward and ill carriage, give great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to judge them bad and unregenerate men, and they be (indeed) ſuch; yet, the having and holding of them to a courſe of Religion in the Family, may (through the bleſſing of God) prevail for their Reformation; yea, we do not know, but that the Prayers of the company and houſhold (wherein there be ſome that have Grace) may be a means (through Grace) of the working of Grace in thoſe that joyn with them, though as yet, they have no

                     <p n="3">3.

                     <p n="1">1. Then, we find, that <hi>Abraham</hi> (journying with all his Family) did build an Altar unto the Lord, who <note place="margin">1.</note> appeared unto him, and <hi>called on the Name of the Lord</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny not that; but here let it be obſerv'd, that the thing which the Prophet mentions, is not the worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> of falſe gods, but the not-worſhipping, or the not-calling upon, the true God, which is a thing that nor only Heathens are guilty of, but bad men in the Church al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 14. 4.

If then, other Families agree with them in their deſcription, that is, that they do not know and own God in calling upon his Name; let them conſider, whether they be not under the danger of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation. I know, there is a further reaſon of the Curſe added in the concluſion, that is, becauſe they <hi>eat, devour, and conſume Jacob</hi> 
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Jer. 10. 25.</note>; but, yet the ſubjects of the curſe are ſuch as know not God, and call not on his Name; And this, and oppoſing and oppreſſing the Servants of God go together, not only out of the Church, but in it: I am loth to ſpeak over-ſeverely of Families, wherein, for want of Inſtruction and acquaintance with the neceſſity of ſuch a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Prayer is wanting; but let all men mark, (when there is a perſecution), Whether <hi>Prayerleſs-</hi>Families, be not the <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting-</hi>Families (though all of them be not ſuch.) In this, the Scripture is clear, which ſpeaks of corrupt men in the Church, juſt as <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks of Heathens here, deſcribing them to be ſuch as know not God; for they ſay, <hi>There is no God</hi> 
                        <note n="u" place="margin">Pſal. 14. 1.</note>, and that <hi>eat up Gods people as bread, and call not upon the Lord</hi>

To conclude this, What are the Houſholds of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? Are they not, or ſhould they not be, Families fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God? And the fear of God <hi>with all a mans houſe,</hi> and <hi>praying to God always</hi> are joyned together <note n="y" place="margin">Act. 10. 2.</note>, as <hi>the caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off fear, and reſtraining Prayer before God,</hi> (though ill applyed to <hi>Job)</hi> elſewhere are <note n="z" place="margin">Job 15. 4.</note>: Again, Should not the particular Houſhold of Chriſtians be (like the whole Houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold) Houſholds of faith <note n="a" place="margin">Gal. 5. 10.</note>? And if they be ſo, then (ſurely) they will be Praying-Families; for <hi>truſting in God,</hi> and <hi>pouring forth the heart before him,</hi> go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 62. 8.</note>.</p>
                     <p>From all this, it followeth, that calling on the Name of the Lord, is not only that which putteth a difference between the Church and Heathens <note n="c" place="margin">Jer. 10. 25.</note>, and between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons converted and unconverted <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 9. 11. Pſal. 14. 4, 6.</note>; but, (which we may obſerve at this day) that which makes a remarkable diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between Houſholders fearing God, and acquainted with Religion, and thoſe that are not ſuch. I do not ſay, that all that have Prayer in their Family, are truly good; but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, their goodneſs is very young, and very immature, that have it not, and they have very much cauſe to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire Whether they have any at all, that <hi>care not to have it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In ſuch ways as theſe, God calls upon us to call upon Him, together with our Family. Though it be not ſaid in ſo many words, that every Chriſtian Houſholder is to pray with his Houſhold, yet this is <hi>really</hi> ſaid in Scripture, that they are to glorifie God in their Families; And, that they are to ſerve God in their Families, by performing that duty of Prayer wherein the whole ſervice of God is held forth; And that they ſhould bleſs their Houſholds, and take the beſt courſe (which is the courſe of Prayer) with them, to procure Gods bleſſing upon them <note n="e" place="margin">

                        </note>. If ſuch things as theſe will not ſerve to make Houſholders godly, they will (ſure) ſerve to make them inexcuſable for their ungodlineſs. As it will never ſerve to excuſe the exceſs of intemperate and immodeſt men and women, that God hath not told them how much they ſhall eat, or what clothes they ſhall put on; ſo neither
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:151789:106"/>
will it ſerve to excuſe their defects in Prayer, or any other Chriſtian duty, that God hath not ſpoken particullarly and punctually of it; for they ought to reverence the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules, and, as neer as may be, to mould their carriage according to the mind of God, and herein be like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who do not only obey the preciſe Precepts of their glorious Lord and God, but delight to fulfill <hi>all his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> 
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Pſal. 103. 21.</note>, and what they conceive, by any hint they have from Him, to be acceptable to Him. <hi>Beneplaciti nomine laetum &amp; hilare obſequium exprimit, ac ſi dixiſſet; Angelos non ſolum Dei Praeceptis obſequentes eſſe, ſed libentèr, &amp; cum ſumma oblectatione accipere ejus nutus, ut ejus bene placitis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperent.</hi> Calv. in Pſal. 103. 21.</p>

                     <p>This may (in part) ſhew that to omit Family-Prayer is not only an ungodly thing, but an unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and a great diſadvantage as well as a defect.</p>

                           <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 3.</note> from the reaſon of that neglect.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The perſons neglecting this Duty are uſually men leſs fearing God <note n="ſ" place="margin">Act. 10. 2.</note>, leſs acquainted with Religinn, and cold <note place="margin">1.</note> in the profeſſion and practice of it; For as for gracious and grown Chriſtians there is (we may ſay) a <hi>common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct of piety</hi>

                     <p n="2">2. As to the cauſes of the neglect, they are the more conſiderable, becauſe the truth is, that this queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the cauſes of the neglect, will (as I conceive) be found ſuch as theſe;</p>
                     <p n="1">1. In lower and poorer people, ignorance and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs <note place="margin">1.</note> with Religion. They are loth to be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do, what they find it will be hard to do, and which they ſee, in themſelves little ability to perform; And, yet this will not excuſe them, becauſe there are ſo many helps for Prayer, as will prove their fault to be, want of hearts to that duty: That (therefore) which ſuch are to do, is to <hi>follow on to know the Lord;</hi> and then, they <hi>ſhall</hi> know <note n="u" place="margin">Hoſ. 6. 3.</note> and get ſuch ability from that which God ſpeaks to them, as to be able themſelves competently and comfortably to ſpeak (in Prayer) unto God; for, <hi>Revelation is the Riſe of Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> 2 Sam. 7. 27.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. In worſe perſons, Profaneneſs is an Enemy to <note place="margin">2.</note> Prayer, and an averſneſs from the ſervice of God; yea, not only a loathneſs, but a loathing to look after religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

                        <note n="y" place="margin">Mal. 1. 13.</note>; yea, perhaps, they are loth to ſtoop ſo low as to be ſo much Diſciples <note n="z" place="margin">Joh. 9. 29.</note>, and to bow down and kneel before the Lord their Maker in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of thoſe belonging to their charge, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95. 6. being therein of <hi>Michals</hi> haughty mind, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6. 20.</p>
                     <p n="3">3.

Unto this backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in many, Baſhfulnefs is added in divers others, and a natural fear and diffidence, making them very unapt to appear and act in any ſolemn religious duty when they are in company.

                     <p n="4">4. In many men, Worldlineſs is a great impediment, for ſo eager are men on their Earthly occaſions and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, <note place="margin">4.</note> that they cannot afford time for ſpiritual du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 14. 18, 19, 20.

                        <note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 19.</note>. He was ſo haſty, and looked upon his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as ſo urgent, that he thought it no wiſdom to abide with God to wait his anſwer. And (again), like <hi>Saul</hi> that was ſo eager of purſuit and revenge, that he adjured the people that not a man of them ſhould eat any food till the evening, and ſo they were faint, and could not make that flaughter they might have done among the <hi>Philiſtins</hi>

                        </note> they that are ſo greedy after the world, that God can have none of their attendance, either have not what they look for, or have it not in mercy. God is <hi>very gracious unto us,</hi> but it is, <hi>at the voyce of our cry,</hi> Iſa. 30. 19.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In ſome men, Atheiſm is the hinderance, whereby men uſe to make light <note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 22. 5.</note> of ſuch heavenly things as Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">5.</note> and Praying are. A Farm, a Wife, or a yoke of Oxen may be the next reaſon, but Atheiſm lies at the bottom; for let all men examine (namely when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not afford God a Prayer Morning and Evening,) whether this thought do not lodge in the heart of one and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them; <hi>To go about my buſineſs will do me ſome good, but Praying in my Family will do me none, but only hinder me of ſo much time.</hi> Now this wicked thought, to wit, that all time is loſt that is beſtowed in the Service of God; and that they that pray not, do as well as they that do, I ſay,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:151789:108"/>
this is down-right Atheiſm. The bottom-cauſe of not calling upon God, is, that, <hi>The Fool ſaith in his heart, There is no God.</hi> See for this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1, 4, 6. <hi>Job</hi> 21. 15. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 14.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, let every man enter into his own heart, and conſider, what comfort there can be in refraining Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold-worſhip, and reſtraining Prayer on ſuch reaſons as theſe; which yet (upon ſincere and ſerious conſideration) will (no doubt) be found the ordinary Pul-backs from ſo good a duty.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth now to enquire (after the former proofs for Family-Prayer) what time is to be allotted to this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, wherein I ſhall endeavour to ſhew two things,</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>Of Repetition of Sermons in Families.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Repeating of Sermons, I ſhall endeavour to move Chriſtians unto, (as I have done in other things before-mentioned) both by Scripture and Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Grounds of Scripture for Sermon-Repetition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt Scripture I ſhall mention, is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. 2, 6. where the Lord firſt commands <hi>Jeremy</hi> to write all the words which he had ſpoken from the days of <hi>Joſiah</hi> unto that day; and thereupon, <hi>Jeremy</hi> calls <hi>Baruch</hi> to write them from his mouth, and then commands him to read what he had written in the ears of the people, that ſo they might be brought to ſerious repentance for the preventing of their ruine; which ſheweth, that things preached by Miniſters (as <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s Sermons were in the Temple), or Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons delivered from Miniſters mouths (as theſe words were now from <hi>Jeremie</hi>'s mouth), being written and repeated, are of ſpecial uſe; and ſo may ſerve to recommend unto us both the <hi>writing</hi> and <hi>repeating</hi> of Sermons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>writing;</hi> that being here preſcribed, and being <note place="margin">1.</note> ſo needful, that what is preached, may be rightly and fully repeated. And therefore, though the repeating be that which I intend to perſwade here, yet I ſhall ſpeak ſomething of and for the writing of Sermons, becauſe that is of ſuch uſe for the Repetition; and anſwer what is moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly objected againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Writing hindereth hearing, that is, hearing with ſuch attention and affection, and giving up the whole man to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>it, as there may be, if Noting be laid aſide, and hearing be the only work.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereunto I anſwer, That as it is not in my thoughts to bind every one to Noting, ſo neither is it my mind and <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:151789:111"/>
ſenſe, that any ſhould be taken off from hearing with the beſt advantage, (I ſay, with the beſt advantage, <hi>all things conſidered);</hi> for I look upon Hearing as a neceſſary duty, and a ſpecial part of our obedience, but upon Repeating as an Auxiliary Exerciſe, and a part of our beneficial aſſiſtance. Beſides, that divers cannot write, and all that can write, are not ſo able and apr for writing of Sermons.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth this prejudice and take off the preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is <hi>Repetition:</hi> for a diligent hearer may (if he pleaſe, and be ſo provident) write what he hears immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after he hath heard it, and ſo repeat it; or, if he write not at all, yet, being able to retain it in his memory, he may communicate it in Repetition, by that ability; as the words which the man of God had ſpoken to <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> againſt his Altar were told, and (we may ſay) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, by the ſons of the old Prophet unto their Father, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. 11. <note n="a" place="margin">And it is ſaid <hi>Jer.</hi> 36. 13. that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caiah declared unto the</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <hi>all the words that he had heard.</hi>
                     </note>.</p>
                  <p>But here I ſhall offer (to prevent the neglect of ſo great an Help as Writing is) theſe Conſiderations, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let every man deal truly; for <hi>the heart is deceitful</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>above all things</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Jer. 17. 9.</note>, and whileſt one pretends (or perhaps, intends) a better hearing; yet he may, through the ſecret workings of corruption, forbear noting, becauſe he is loth to take the pains which noting requires; yea, (it's poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) becauſe he is not willing to be noted to be a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-noter, that being a thing which ſome will look upon, as too low for higher and more conſiderable Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Repetition is here ſpoken of (in ſpecial) as it is a <note place="margin">2.</note> Family-edifying exerciſe, which if it be left to memory, uſeth to be as defective as the memory is ſlippery; or, (where there is leſs Zeal, and Piety is leſs pleaſing) to be altogether omitted, and that by the omiſſion of writing; which would both furniſh the hearer for Repetition, and make it minded, and make it eaſie, and ſo make it more willingly undertaken.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Writing ſhews an eſtimation of what we hear, and <note place="margin">3.</note> a reſolution to preſerve the remembrance of it; As when
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:151789:112"/>
                     <hi>Hezekiah</hi> would ſhew how he prized his cure, and that it was in his heart to preſerve the memory of it, there was <hi>the writing of Hezekiah</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38. 9. Men will not truſt their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory with matters of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, but put them down.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As hearing without noting, may more ſtir up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; ſo noting with hearing more prevents diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which Satan, by the variety of objects, more eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſeth and multiplyeth when the mind is not kept to the matter by the intention of the writer.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Though by hearing without writing, the heart may be more moved, yet writing ſo imprints there that which <note place="margin">5.</note> is heard as that it is not ſo ſoon removed; for writing hath with it a multiplyed thinking of, and running over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again (in the inward thoughts) that which is preached and heart, till it be written down, and ſo it ſinks more deeply, and leaves in the heart a more laſting impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. We are to <hi>hear for the time to come</hi> 
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Iſa. 42. 23.</note>. Now, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">6.</note> alone, is for preſent uſe; but, accompanyed with wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, for after-uſe. The Sermon written may be read and reveiwed a month, or twelve months after; yea, it may remain for the uſe of others many years after we are dead. Hence the Scripture when it would expreſs the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of things, and the way of that continuance, ſaith, <hi>This ſhall be written for the Generation to come,</hi> Pſal. 102. 18. <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Calv.</hi> in Jer. 36. 2. <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam labuntur Sermones ex ore hominis, ergò major eſt ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendi utilitas.—Quod hodié quiſpiam lege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, poterit ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cras legere &amp; poſt annum &amp; plures an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos.</hi>
                     </note>. I do not ſay, it will be thus, if Book after Book be fill'd with Notes, which few or none can read but the writer himſelf; but, thus it will be, if, what is written (for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) haſtily, be after written out legibly, which, becauſe leiſure will not permit many to do (if we ſpeak of copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out whole Sermons,) therefore I would adviſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to an eaſier and ſhorter courſe, and that is, when they have noted largely, to obſerve the whole, and then cull out, and write out fair the choiſeſt paſſages <note n="f" place="margin">It was obſerved in the late (and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently hopeful) Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> though ſo young, yet that ſhe was ſo provident, as not only to write down every Sermon as it was preſently delivered; but, at ſpecial times, to pick out the choyſeſt Sentences, and tranſcribe them in a Book on purpoſe with her own Royal hand. <hi>John Bachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> Epiſtle Dedicatory to the <hi>Royal Bud</hi> of our Engliſh hopes, Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> prefixed to his <hi>[Golden Sands].</hi>
                     </note>, which may be
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:151789:112"/>
done more fully or more briefly, as time will give leave, and as the Sermons and Chriſtians condition give cauſe and occaſion. By this means, Poſterity (when they are in Heaven) may reap the benefit of that which they heard delivered, and were ſo careful to lay up; yea, by writing out briefly profitable and acceptable words of all ſorts, the ſurviving godly Reader will be a great gainer by things ſo uſeful, and be much refreſh'd alſo with the variety of them.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, <hi>That the caſe here was a ſpecial caſe, becauſe</hi> Jeremy <hi>was ſhut up, and could not go to the Houſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Lord; and therefore is not to be drawn to common uſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer two things,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the caſe may quickly be ſuch at any time, as that <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> which is deſcribed here; For <note place="margin">1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. No man knows how ſoon Miniſters may be ſhut up, (as <hi>Jeremy</hi> here was), that they cannot ſpeak to their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary hearers. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hearers know not how ſoon they may be ſhut up, either by ſickneſs or reſtraint, that they cannot come to Miniſters, and therefore, it's wiſdom to make uſe of the preſent liberty, in writing down, and laying up, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Inſtructions; that ſo, though intercourſe with Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be interrupted or removed, yet their Sermons being (as they ſay) in black and white, their former intercourſe with them, and hearing of them, may in this way, make ſome comfortable amends, and ſerve for a profitable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply: whereas, if old Sermons be forgotten, and new Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons cannot be gotten; Chriſtians are like to be at a ſad loſs, yea, though there be printed Sermons to be had; for, howſoever they may be very profitable, yet they may not be ſo ſutable to the times and their ſtate as thoſe which they have heard, and which (perhaps) were prepared at firſt with reſpect to their condition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I anſwer, That in the courſe taken here, to write from the mouth of <hi>Jeremy</hi> what was to be read by <hi>Baruch,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> we are not only to conſider the occaſion, but the end
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:151789:113"/>
and uſe, which was, that by reading the words written in the Ears of all <hi>Judah,</hi> they might thereby be moved to ſuch Humiliation and Reformation, as that the evil they heard pronounced might not come upon them <note n="g" place="margin">Jer. 36. 6.</note>: Now, Albeit, that occaſion was a more ſpecial occaſion, yet this end is a common end: which, whileſt it lets us ſee that the writing and reading of Sermons preached, is a good means (yea, Gods means) to work the heart to goodneſs, it doth thereby perſwade us to imitation, and, for attaining the ſame end, to take the ſame courſe; which if it be done more ſolemnly in a day of Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation (as then it was), it is probable it will prevail the more.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have ſpoken (by occaſion of this Scripture) with ſpecial reſpect to the Writing of Sermons: and now I ſhall briefly add that here is recommended,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Repeating</hi> of them] Becauſe, for that reaſon it was that the words ſpoken by the mouth of <hi>Jeremy</hi> muſt <note place="margin">2.</note> be written by <hi>Baruch,</hi> to wit, that they might be read and repeated to thoſe to whom they were firſt delivered, by the mouth of <hi>Baruch;</hi> And the remainder of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſheweth alſo that they were again read and repeated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Nobles and the King.</p>
                  <p>And this declareth the uſe of Noting Sermons, which is not to lay them up in Books, and there leave them; but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat and communicate them to others: Indeed, it's true, that what was done here, was done by the Lords direction; and, what was read here, was read in the Lords Houſe; But, there being no juſt cauſe to appropriate this courſe (for the ſubſtance of it) to any time or people, we have reaſon to ſay, that this Divine direction, at this time, caſts an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and an approbation upon the ſame courſe (in the generallity) at all times; and Gods end in this Reading and Repeating in His Houſe, juſtly mindes us of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit that may be had from it in our own houſes; I mean, according as the matter is which is preached, written, and repeated; for, it is not always of that kind that theſe
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:151789:113"/>
words here were, but, whatever ſort of matter it be, this Writing and Repeating is a way to make it more familiar to us, and fruitful in us. Thus of this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>ſecond Scripture</hi> that I ſhall mention, is <hi>(Col.</hi> 4. 16.) where the Apoſtle ordereth firſt, that the Epiſtle written to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> ſhould be <hi>read among them;</hi> And then that they ſhould <hi>cauſe it to be read alſo in the Church of the Laodiceans;</hi> for, it was not written (as one ſaith) <note n="h" place="margin">
                        <hi>Muſc.</hi> in loc.</note> to <hi>Coloſſians</hi> as <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> (for the ſubſtance of it) but to the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> as Chriſtians, and ſo, it was for the uſe of Chriſtians generally, albeit, there was (it's like) a ſpecial reſpect in it to other Churches in the ſame Countrey, and namely, that of <hi>Laodicea:</hi> which, it is conceived, laboured under the ſame ſpiritual diſeaſes that the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> did, and ſure were in danger of being taken with thoſe Errours that are mentioned in the ſecond Chapter of that E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</p>
                  <p>Now, as this Scripture makes much for the reading of Scripture; and for the communicating of holy Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by one Church to another: ſo (by the like reaſon, and for the ſame ends) it recommendeth alſo the impart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the things of God, once delivered by Miniſters (as this Epiſtle was by <hi>Paul)</hi> by one Chriſtian to another; and that eſpecially, where their Intereſt, Opportunity, and Charge lies moſt, which we know to be in their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Families.</p>
                  <p>Unto the two former Scriptures, I ſhall add one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sentence more, which though I intend not to inſiſt upon, yet Ingenuity and Piety will make it helpful to this holy Exerciſe; The words are theſe, <hi>God hath ſpoken once, twice I have heard this</hi> 
                     <note n="i" place="margin">Pſal. 62. 11.</note>, which howſoever it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of our hearing twice. becauſe God ſpeaks to us twice <note n="k" place="margin">Job 33. 14.</note>, yet it is alſo a good Interpretation, and very ſuitable to the words (as they are rendred in our Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) which <hi>Calvin</hi> (writing upon thoſe words) reciteth; to wit, that, though God ſpeak but once, yet, we ſhould hear it twice; that is, revolve it, ponder it <note n="l" place="margin">Luk. 2. 19.</note>, and make
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:151789:114"/>
our ſelves to hear it again and again; which will be aptly applyed to the matter in hand, if we ſay, that when God ſpeaks once, that is, by his Miniſter in Preaching, then we are to hear twice; that is, (as by Meditation in our hearts, ſo alſo, by Repetition) wherein there is apparently a ſecond hearing) in our houſes.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of Scripture-Grounds for Family-Repetition.</p>
                  <p>I proceed now to the <hi>Reaſons</hi> that may be given of this labour of Love, and whereby the minds of godly perſons may be confirmed in this practiſe of Piety.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, I ſhall lay down a General reaſon drawn from the manifold profit that ariſeth from Sermon-Repetition; For thereby</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Sermon is <hi>better underſtood</hi> by a ſecond skan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note n="m" place="margin">
                        <hi>Si quod ſtatim noa fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit intellectum repetitur, plus habet lucis.</hi> Calv. <hi>ia</hi> Jer. 36. 1, 2.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Better remembered,</hi> by a new recalling <note n="n" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 13, 15.</note>.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Better laid up in the heart,</hi> by harrowing after the firſt ſowing, unto which Meditation and Repetition may be compared, whereby any thing harder is broken, and the ſeed ſown is covered and kept ſafe. Writing without reciting, lays the Sermon up in the Book, and there leaves it; but Repetition houſeth it in the heart, which is the proper place where it ought to dwell <note n="p" place="margin">Col. 3. 16. Pſal. 119. 11.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Better expreſſed in the life,</hi> by thoſe freſher and ſtronger impreſſions in the heart, which the calling of that we have heard to mind and to a new conſideration, leaves behind it. Now the better impreſſions there be within, and the more the Word is wrought into the heart, the better expreſſions and the more holy fruit there will be without; for, <hi>Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> Matth. 12. 34. And ſo the hand work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:151789:114"/>
the foot walketh, and the whole man acteth. Thus in general.</p>
                  <p>In the next place I ſhall make uſe of ſome more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Reaſons of Repetition, and that, both in regard of our ſelves, and others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In regard of our ſelves,</hi> There are three things conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable. <note place="margin">1.</note>.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this Reviewing of Sermons, and ſpending more of our time and thoughts upon them is an effectual <note place="margin">1.</note> means of growing up in a right knowledge of Religion; for, the abilities and ſtudies of Miniſters (eſpecially their Scripture-ſtudies) are much ſum'd up in their Sermons, which (therefore) being firſt attentively heard, (which writing ties the hearer unto), and afterward more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately conſidered of, in the Repetition, do thereby poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the hearer in a good degree with the Miniſters ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency; beſides that, he freeth himſelf alſo from that ſad imputation of being <hi>ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth</hi> 
                     <note n="q" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 7.</note>. Hence it is, that the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roeans</hi> were ſo careful of, and are ſo much commended for, not only an hearing <hi>with all readineſs of mind,</hi> but alſo a taking up of what they had heard into their thoughts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, <hi>Searching the Scriptures whether thoſe things were ſo</hi> 
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Act. 17. 11.</note>; yea, Hence alſo Miniſters themſelves, do write and preach the ſame things again and again, becauſe (what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever tediouſneſs there be in it in it ſelf, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet) they are ſure it is <hi>ſafe</hi> for their people <note n="ſ" place="margin">Phil. 3. 1.</note>, and a great Preſervative againſt the Infection of Errour, which is ſo much againſt Chriſtians ſafety and ſalvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is to be carefully conſidered and weighed, that faithful Miniſters and provident Paſtors ſpeak to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <note n="t" place="margin">Ezek. 34. 4.</note> of their people, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to the diſeaſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was a backwardneſs in receiving the Faith; and ſo the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> to the diſeaſe of thoſe to whom he wrote, which was, though they received and profeſſed the Faith, yet to be careleſs of a godly life, and thoſe good works wherein Faith (if it be not a dead Faith) is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:151789:115"/>
fruitful; upon this ground, I infer, that albeit there be many printed Sermons which Chriſtians may very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly read (and ought ſo to do) yet, the matter of them is not like to be ſo proper to, and fitted for, their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual condition as the Sermons of their own Paſtor, who (being ſuch a one as he ought to be) is (like <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <note n="u" place="margin">Eph. 6. 22. Phil. 2. 19. Coloſſ. 2. 1, 2. 1 Theſſ. 3. 5.</note>,) diligent to know their particular <hi>ſtate,</hi> and conſtitution, and ſollicitous to diſpenſe and adminiſter that Inſtruction which is moſt ſuitable thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And every hearer ſhould very ſeriouſly take this to <note place="margin">3.</note> heart, that he is to give a ſpecial account of the Sermons which himſelf heareth, as being therein more concerned and more charged, then in thoſe that are preached to other hearers. As the great works of God ſhould, in that very reſpect, move us the more, becauſe our own eyes have ſeen them <note n="x" place="margin">Deut. 11. 2, 7, 8. Judg. 2. 7.</note>. So the Words of God alſo, becauſe our own ears have heard them. A Kings charge in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects own hearing, works much for obedience <note n="y" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 12. <hi>For in our hearing the King charged.</hi>
                     </note>, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all tentations to the contrary. The Sermons preached to us, are our Talents which we are to trade withall, as thoſe of whom it ſhall ſhortly be demanded what we have gained. Now every mans reaſon will tell him, that of that whereof he is to give a ſpecial account, it behoveth him to take and make a ſpecial ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, which eaſily falleth into <hi>Noting, and Repetition.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In regard of others</hi> alſo, this courſe is very conſiderable, it being much fo the ſpiritual good and growth of thoſe <note place="margin">2.</note> who have not heard, to hear and have (though at ſecond hand) the things heard by others. Hence godly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Chriſtians have ever been careful of this Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <note n="z" place="margin">For Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours to ſpeak to their Families out of Gods Word, is good; but to repeat what Miniſters ſpeak, is ſafe, and likelier to be free from miſtake.</note>. As Bees bring what they have gotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, home to their Hive, ſo do good Hearers, to their Houſe and Family; and, as they that go to the Market, bring with them bodily Proviſion for the reſt of the Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that have not been there, ſo doth a provident Hearer ſpiritual Proviſion; By which means, the ſame good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may ariſe which we find wrought upon the <hi>Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> by what the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> teſtified unto them
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:151789:115"/>
concerning the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> which was that <hi>many of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritans believed on him for the ſaying of that woman</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 4. 39.</note>; that is, that was a good preparation and excitation to their after full and firm believing; of which they give this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the woman, <hi>Now we believe, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Ver. 42.</note>. Accordingly, Chriſtians communicating and repeating in the ears of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the good Inſtructions they have heard and noted themſelves, may ſtir up in others holy affections, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare their hearts unto the Lord; but then, all comes to perfection and to a ſolid ſetting of the ſoul in frame by hearing in their own perſons from the Miniſters of Chriſt, that which hath been before repeated and teſtified to them by the hearing of others.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I doubt not, but divers have found by their experience, (I am ſure, I have found it by my own) that Sermons have divers times come nearer the heart, and under more Obſervation in the Repetition then in the firſt Hearing. Not but that the Word preached by the Meſſenger of the Lord of Hoſts, is the principal and higheſt means of Ediſication and Salvation; but yet, (beſides, that every man ſees more by a review then at firſt ſight), God is pleaſed ſo far to ſhew his liking of the conſcientious uſe of every Chriſtian exerciſe and aſſiſtance, as to follow it with a ſenſible addition of ſpiritual profit; ſo that, the <hi>ſearching Hearer</hi> is the noble and the <hi>thriving Hearer</hi> 
                     <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 17. 11, 12.</note>. And to this experience I ſhall leave the religious Reader thereby to make up what might be further ſpoken, for the Confirmation, and Commendation of this godly Family Exerciſe <note n="d" place="margin">

                  <p>THe laſt duty that I ſhall ſpeak of (in ſome generality, but with reſpect alſo to the reſpective Families of Chriſtians) is, <hi>Singing of Pſalms;</hi> For the better eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whereof, I ſhall in the firſt place endeavour to take out of the way what is objected againſt it; I ſay, objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, not ſo much in our days formerly, as in theſe latter days wherein many have ſo caſt off all Forms of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and (under that name) Gods own Inſtitutions, and amongſt them, this holy Exerciſe, that, though they be afflicted, yet it is a queſtion, whether they will Pray, or, though they be merry, whether they will Sing Pſalms <note n="a" place="margin">Perhaps this (as other things) may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Popiſh ſuggeſtion in it, with whom it is accounted hainous for common people to ſing Pſalms, <hi>Vid.</hi> Muſc. <hi>in</hi> Epheſ. 5. 19. <hi>In hac ſenecta meacogor audire de quibuſdam Papiſticis Magiſtratibus quod ſubditos ſuos uſum Pſalmorum abjurare coguat: cò inſan<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I ſhall not meddle with many Objections but only with two more uſual, and that ſeem to be more material.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>Many that joyn in ſinging of Pſalms, cannot ſay truly what they ſing, as Pſal.</hi> 86. 2. Preſerve my ſoul, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> my ways, and doings holy be, <hi>&amp;c. And ſuch like.</hi>

                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> it, yet carries this weakneſs with it, that it is againſt the <hi>reading</hi> of the Pſalms as well as the <hi>ſinging,</hi> for they that read utter the ſame words when they read (at leaſt for ſubſtance) which they do when they ſing; yea, this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is againſt the reading of the Hiſtories of Scripture generally, becauſe, therein other men ſpeak otherwiſe then we can.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="193" facs="tcp:151789:116"/>
2. To ſpeak more directly to the thing it ſelf, I anſwer, that the words of Scripture, which men recite when they <note place="margin">2.</note> read or ſing, are not to be taken as their own words, but as the words of them whoſe words the Scripture declareth them to be: It is <hi>David,</hi> or ſome other holy man of God, who ſpeaks thoſe words that are written in the Pſalms, which whoſoever repeateth (whether in Reading or Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) he doth only declare what another ſometime ſaid, which, if he cannot ſay of himſelf truly, yet he truly ſaith that ſuch or ſuch a perſon (ſpeaking in the Pſalm), ſaid ſo of <hi>himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I add, That we ſhould ſo put on the perſons of thoſe that ſpeak, or are ſpoken of in Scripture, as to think that <note place="margin">3.</note> every thing ſpoken (though of others), yet ſome way or other belongs to us; for, <hi>Whatſoever things were written a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-time were written for our learning</hi> 
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 15. 4.</note>, and profit in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind <note n="c" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 16.</note>; yea, our duty is to labour to be ſo far like the holy Servants of God, whoſe gracious ſpeeches are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in Scripture, as to be able to ſay truly (in our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and in regard of the ſaving ſubſtance of Religion), the ſame things that they ſpake; which they that cannot yet do, or can leſs do, by obſerving ſuch ſayings in their ſinging of Pſalms, have an help to do, and by often repeating of them in their minds and mouths, may come at length (through the bleſſing of God) truly and ſincerely to profeſs in their own perſons, the like Piety.</p>
                  <p>Object. <hi>There are in divers Pſalms, heavy Imprecati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>and Curſes pronounced againſt ſundry perſons, Muſt we? How can we ſing ſuch things, and curſe Enemies?</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Although it ſhould be acknowledged, (as in part it is to be granted) that ſuch Imprecations, or Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1.</note> fearfully againſt evil men, be not for our <hi>imitation,</hi> yet they are for our <hi>inſtruction.</hi> For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſhew us the woful eſtate of the Enemies of God, and of his People, which ſuch Prayers (proceeding from the Spirit of God) are a propheſie of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſerve to nouriſh patience, and preſerve com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and conſtancy in the hearts of Gods people, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:151789:117"/>
that ſuch men as have been found deſperate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God and to them, are mentioned in the Book of God as a curſed generation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some imitation there may be (in theſe times) of the Imprecations that we find in Scripture in former times, <note place="margin">2.</note> (though with much caution, charity, and jealouſie over our own ſpirits) and that with reſpect not only to the Churches ſafety <note n="d" place="margin">Pſal. 94 1 5, 6</note>, but Gods glory <note n="e" place="margin">Pſal 83 17, 18.

                  <p>Yet we ſhould ſtill remember that we are not to pray <hi>perſonally;</hi> that is, to fix ſuch fearful Prayers on ſuch and ſuch particular men (albeit they in Scripture that had an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſpirit of diſcerning, did ſo <note n="f" place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 14. 2 Chron. 24. 22.</note>, as the <hi>Church</hi> alſo did againſt <hi>Julian,</hi> ſeeing ſo much in him of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt); I ſay, we are not to ſingle out particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, and pray againſt them; And, eſpecially, we are not to turn <hi>Religion</hi> into <hi>Revenge,</hi> and to direct our Prayers againſt our private Enemies, though they have done us never ſo much wrong <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 12. 14.</note>; Nor muſt we be haſty in judging, and then hard hearted in praying; But, yet all this hinders not, but that, in a generality, we may pray, that God would exerciſe his juſtice (as He ſeeth good) in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the implacable and irreconcileable Enemies of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and of his Church <note n="h" place="margin">Judg. 5. 31. Pſal. 129. 5.</note>. Albeit, the thing in queſtion here is, Whether we may not in Reading or Singing, take into our mouths, the Imprecations recorded in Scripture, making thereof that holy uſe which God would have us to make of that part of his Word? which none that underſtand will doubt of.</p>
                  <p>In all ſuch caſes, the duty of Reading and Singing is not to be left; but they that perform it, are to be inſtructed, and if they are out of the way, be rectified.</p>
                  <p>Having endeavoured to remove theſe rubs, I ſhall now proceed to enquire what may be gathered from Scripture; and, what Arguments agreeable to Scripture may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to eſtabliſh this heavenly Exerciſe.</p>

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Scripture will inform us, that ſinging of Pſalms is a <hi>neceſſary</hi> and <hi>profitable duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. A <hi>neceſſary duty,</hi> becauſe God requires it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. <note place="margin">1.</note> 17, 18, 19.

Now it's true, that <hi>teaching and admoniſhing</hi> may be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either to the <hi>Word of God</hi> going before; or to <hi>Pſalms and Hymns</hi> following after; but, it comes all to one, if the <hi>Pſalms, Hymns</hi> and <hi>Songs</hi> ſpoken of there, be ſuch as are recorded in Scripture, for then they are a part of the Word of God: and ſo the intent of the Apoſtle may be to ſhew that of every part of the Word of God, and in particular of the Pſalms and Songs thereof (the rejoycing part) uſe is to be made for our Edification; thereby ſomething may be added to our <hi>light</hi> in a teaching way, and to our <hi>life and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor</hi> in Piety in an admoniſhing way.</p>

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Scripture ſets it forth as a Congregational duty, or a duty to be performed in the Publike Meetings of Chriſtians, becauſe we find the People of God ſtill called to it by the commands of the Old-Teſtament, (pointing to the New), Pſal. 100. 1, 2, 3. 4. &amp; 66. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 149. 1. <hi>Sing his praiſe in the Congregation of Saints.</hi> And alſo we find it uſed in the New-Teſtament, and in the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 15, 26.) which appears alſo to be practiſed by Chriſtians when they met together in after-times, the end of their meeting being (however many grievous accuſations were rais'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them) to ſing to Chriſt and to God, and by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation among themſelves to eſtabliſh all good Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, and ſuppreſs thoſe wickedneſſes which were moſt falſely laid to their charge. <hi>Tertul.

                  <p>Now, As to the performance of this duty in Families; It is not my meaning (nor ought to be) to impoſe any thing further then the grounds of Scripture will conclude it; And it's poſſible, there may be ſome Families, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or at ſome times, not in a capacity for it; yet, that none may ſlight ſuch a ſervice, and ſhut their doors againſt it, I ſhall offer (out of Scripture) not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite, but to induce Chriſtians to ſet and keep it up in their Families; theſe conſiderations,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The duty it ſelf (as hath been ſhewed before) is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently commanded as a duty much tending to Chriſtian <note place="margin">1.</note> Edification <note n="l" place="margin">

And ſomething it is for the honour and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of this Exerciſe that when godly men refreſh themſelves with it, profane men are ſo grieved at it; they cannot well and with patience (at leaſt, without ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy) paſs by the houſes where they hear Singing of Pſalms, much leſs go into them; for, the Mirth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations of Godlineſs are heavy to them as well as the Rules, eſpecially to Perſecutors; Singing of Pſalms hath been ſtill the pleaſure of Martyrs (as it was to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> 
                     <note n="n" place="margin">Act. 16. 25.</note> in Priſon;) but their Tormenters were torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and uſed them the worſe for it; yet, ſuch
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:151789:121"/>
was the comfort of that Exerciſe, that they would not leave it; And when forcible reſtraints were put upon them, yet their hearts were full of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is obſervable, that this duty is commended to Chriſtians in way of exchange, or in oppoſition to the vain delights of Unregenerate men, or of themſelves in their unregenerate eſtate <note n="o" place="margin">Eph. 5. 18, 19. 1 Pet. 4. 3.</note> whence ariſeth this argument for it, that it is a diſtinguiſhing Exerciſe, putting a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between Heathens and Chriſtians, between ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual and ſpiritual men. Profane-ſpirited men ſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their exceſſive Cups, abuſive Songs, carnal and vain Catches, wanton and unclean Mirth, and ſo make me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody to the Devil in their houſes; when (on the contrary) it becomes (and is the manner of) Chriſtians and godly Perſons to converſe one with another in holy Hymns, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with recreating themſelves in their houſes and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therein making melody to the Lord, in their hearts. I ſay <hi>[in their hearts];</hi> for an Hypocrite may ſing, and that with a very good will, (eſpecially if he have a very good voyce), but his pleaſure is in the action of ſinging rather then in the holy frame of his heart, and he makes melody to himſelf and thoſe that like him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to the Lord that looks at the inner man. So that this Exerciſe (taken with its qualifications) puts a difference between men pions and profane, ſincere and hypocrites, and ſo is like the <hi>Rain-bow,</hi> a pleaſant ſight and a better ſign; I ſay, ſuch is ſinging Pſalms, a ſweet Exerciſe in it ſelf, and as it is an act of godlineſs; and a better ſign, if well acted, that is, of a godly perſon, and one filled with the Spirit of God <note n="p" place="margin">Eph. 5. 18.</note>, and (by the ſame reaſon) it will mark out a ſpiritual, and diſtinguiſh it from a carnal Family; Not, but that a Family wherein there is the fear of God, may be, by reaſon of ſome impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments, at a time, or for a time, without it; but, that's a carnal Family that doth not like to have it, and that cannot dwell pleaſantly with it.</p>
                  <p>Now that theſe reaſons may be of more weight, and this Exerciſe of more uſe, I would adviſe Chriſtians to two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:151789:122"/>
1. Before they ſing, to view and weigh, and (by one or other of the company) mention and declare the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">1.</note> of the Pſalm they intend to ſing, for which Mr. <hi>Beza</hi> his argument on every Pſalm, together with his Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe, opening the meaning thereof (both which are ſet forth in <hi>Engliſh)</hi> would be a ſingular help. And as for ſuch as cannot procure it, let them at leaſt conſider the contents of the Pſalm, which Contents (though they may in ſome places, need a reveiw,) yet for the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) are ſo adviſedly compoſed, throughout the Bible in our laſt Tranſlation, that they give a great light to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Pſalm which they are let before; to all thoſe that diſcreetly obſerve them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When they have ſung, a little to diſcourſe together (as their ability will ſerve, and time give leave) of what <note place="margin">2.</note> they have ſung: by which means, they will better both know and ſhew the meaning of that paſſage of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>[Teaching and admoniſhing one another in Pſalms and Hymns</hi> 
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Col. 3. 16.</note>,] becauſe, matter both of teaching and admo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>niſhing will be ſupplyed, by obſerving what the Pſalm offers to their conſiderations for the one, or the other; So ſhall this be ſound an edifying Exerciſe, when as (other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe) a bare ſinging paſſeth without profit and ſpiritual commodity, becauſe without pondering, and Chriſtian-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
                  <p>And here I cannot (before I leave) but lament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The great neglect of this duty by many, whereby it comes to paſs that it is ſo little regarded; for the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of duty is the Enemy of the duty, and the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of it preſerves the Eſtimation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The negligent performance of it by many others that do not neglect it, but ſeem to affect it rather. O how rare a thing is it in thoſe that ſing Pſalms, not to delight (yea not to terminate their delight) in themſelves, if there be a greater ſweetneſs in their voyce, or if they excel in skill in that vocal Muſick, when all the melody ſhould be, to the Lord? But, (to ſpeak of that which is moſt uſual), How many content themſelves with keeping tune, and
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:151789:122"/>
carrying on the Exerciſe with others in a formal way, without underſtanding the matter of the Pſalm, when they ſhould ſing with underſtanding, or with ſeeking to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand; And, yet there is another fault (which the beſt (I think) are not free from, or, if they be, they may be well reckoned amongſt the beſt) and that is, the not minding in their ſinging that which they do underſtand, or (at leaſt) not keeping their hearts to it [ſtill]; but contenting themſelves to mark what they ſing now and then, and to do that at times, and by ſtarts, which they ought to do at all times whileſt ſuch holy ſervices are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and the thing they have in hand, is, the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſily obſerved, that the Devil makes great gaps in duties by diſtractions, and in this more then in other Exerciſes, by the advantage he hath from the nature of the ſervice: wherein they that are imployed do ſo at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the tune, and mark the Singers, ſo pleaſe themſelves with the outward and natural part of it, (if it be well performed,) and have ſuch various and turbulent thoughts, (if there be any thing not decent in it,) that they are eaſily drawn from the ſubſtance of what they ſing, their hearts are alienated from what their mouths utter; and ſo there is a failing in that main rule, which is, to make melody to the Lord <hi>in their hearts</hi> 
                     <note n="r" place="margin">Eph. 5. 19.</note>: when better it is, to be out of tune with the voyce, then out of frame, in the heart. It's neceſſary that the Eye and the Ear ſhould be ſo far watched and diſciplined, as that they may not draw away the mind from meditation on the matter of the Pſalm; This meditation and heart-holding to the thing in hand, is of ſuch uſe in praying and praiſing God, that both of them are expreſſed by the word <hi>meditation;</hi> Hence <hi>Iſaac</hi> is ſaid to go out to <hi>meditate in the field at Even-tide,</hi> or <hi>to pray</hi>

                     <note n="t" place="margin">Pſal. 104, 34.</note>. Nor is this Meditation requiſite only
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:151789:123"/>
in thoſe Prayers and Praiſes which we conceive and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our ſelves, that we may frame them the better; but we are alſo to be thoughtful in, and to attend unto, thoſe that are already framed to our hand, eſpecially out of Scripture, for which we have this rule given us, to <hi>ſet our hearts to all the words</hi> thereof <note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 32. 46.</note>; whether we hear them, or read them, or ſing them, ſtill, that's the rule; and the rather to be obſerved in Singing, becauſe the words ſpoken of in the fore-cited Scripture, are the words of <hi>Moſes Song</hi>

                  <p>But I muſt haſten; Were theſe things ſearched, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, what is amiſs reformed, and this Exerciſe conformed to Scripture-rules, What ſweetneſs would there be in it? How much would Knowledge, Holineſs, and Comfort be improved by it? In a word, What ſtrong arguments might Chriſtians make for Singing, by making conſcience how they ſing? I confeſs, exactneſs in this duty is an hard work to the beſt, but would be an happy work to all, and is (in ſome meaſure) attainable by all.</p>
                  <p>To conclude the whole; Let me beſeech all ſerious Chriſtians, to look upon Singing of Pſalms, as the Soul-ſupport of <hi>David,</hi> (the ſweet Pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> 
                     <note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 1.</note>,) in all his afflictions: As the Cordial of wounded Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note n="b" place="margin">Pſal. 51. 8. &amp; 77. 6. &amp; 88. <hi>Title,</hi> &amp; 143. 7, 8.</note>; As the holy Fire to enkindle heavenly Affections; As the Perfume of Priſons <note n="c" place="margin">Act. 16. 25.</note>; the Muſick of Martyrs; yea, the work and pleaſure of Saints and Angels in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe

of God <note n="d" place="margin">Rev. 19. 1.</note>. And then, how will they, how can they neglect it?</p>
                  <p>After all, I ſhall put down thoſe ſhort Prayers, which I mentioned before, when I ſpake of the duty of Family-Prayer; but have thought it fitteſt to place them here, that the Treatiſe might not be interrupted; and that ſuch as need them, might more eaſily find them: I ſay, ſuch as need them, for they are framed only for the help of weak and well-minded Chriſtians that would pray in their Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies if they knew how; And theſe Forms are put down, not to <hi>tie them,</hi> (as if they ſhould uſe no other, or needed no more) but to <hi>teach them,</hi> that by this aſſiſtance they may ſet upon this duty, and do ſomething in it, and by doing a little at firſt, may be able to do more after; and moſt, and beſt, at laſt.</p>
