            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THou hast here recommended once more unto thy view, what as from time to time, and from age to age, hath been not only the grand Cause of invocating counsels, but also hitherto even the ground of great dispute and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie, if thou this Treatise do with a single eye peruse, and ballance the same in just and equal scales, thou wilt find it of so much validity, as will poise thy judgement to give sensure, that this is a clear and true demonstration of the matter in hand; if thou be serious in thy view, sincere in thy heart, and single in thy mind, as willing to know the radix, rise, and ground of the matter herein handled, then wilt thou find this the very key which will aright, and may without scruple open unto thee, and demonstrate the very certain infallible and sure testimony, as well of their original rise, growing, begetting, constituting, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling, confirming, upholding, and maintaining of them, <hi>viz.</hi> Tythes; all which that thou mayst be clearly informed, may thou finde as by step and step herein traced, thou wilt finde their original as first how tenths were given before the Commandment was given forth to the Jews, thou wilt also find their growing, and their Institutions thou may clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, and wherefore they were so instituted, thou wilt

finde them when confirmed, and thou wilt finde them when corrupted, thou wilt finde them when lawful, and thou wilt finde them when not lawful; thou wilt find them when they were to be payed, and thou wilt find a time when they ought not to be payed, And because the Ministers of our age, as we have daily from them, do vaunt and boast themselves of the Orthodox Fathers of their Church, therefore wilt thou find by a narrow search, and a single eye in the reading hereof, unto which I do advise thee, and that in patience and sobriety, thou wilt, as one unbiassed ballance the same, here may thou have their opinions, and judgments also, and their ancient Fathers quoted thou wilt have at large their own words; All which as by this Treatise is intended to inform thy mind, and be as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident how they are now in this our age apostatized from what they were, and now at length becom'd as usurpation, or abused; And for thy more full and perfect understanding how they were continued and imposed, thou may also read the Orders and Decrees of many great Councils, their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, Judgements, and Impositions, from time to time in many ages past; Thou wilt see the testimony of the holy Martyrs and their verdict, and last of all the Scriptures discussed, the arguments confuted, the questions answered, and the objections razed, which the Ministers of our daies do produce, or in times past have been produced, as the basis or ground from which they inferre and lay their seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fair foundation, these thou wilt all see sufficiently, clearly and evidently confuted, their structure defaced, their painted building demolished, their foundation unbottom'd, and they themselves, if their old root of Covetousness were not so strongly centered in them, might be convinced, there is not one stone left, but all is overturn'd, and the bottom

            <p>From the year 400, till the year 800 no Canon or other Law was generally received, to compel ony payment of Tythes, although a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Offerings of devout Christians, gifts of that quantity was received as due by the doctrine then in use in some places only, which <hi>Ambrose, Augustine, Jerome,</hi> and <hi>Chrysostome</hi> taught by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the coldness and want of charity among the Christians in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers parts; and for their ground and foundation, the first two taught that the tenth was due by Gods Law, which they took only from the <hi>Mosaical</hi> law, and the other two perswaded only that a less part then a tenth might not be offered, but ought to be paid for holy uses, as the phrase was; and by the reason of the doctrine of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> they were offered under the name of Tenths in part of <hi>Italy,</hi> he being the Bishop of <hi>Millan</hi> there in the year 390.</p>
            <p>Likewise <hi>Augustine</hi> Bishop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> hath a vehement sermon for the payment of them, whose doctrine brought in the word Tenth in use among Christians; and as is said before his ground only was taken from <hi>Moses</hi> law in point of offering, these two threatned them with great penaltyes, and heavy Judgements, that did not pay their tenths; but yet take notice to what end they required them, <hi>viz.</hi> that the poor might not want, and saith, that God had reserv'd them for that use and end; so in process of time, when this doctrine came to be received, divers followed the opinion of the ancient fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, yet hitherto it was not laid down as a positive do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to pay them as the <hi>Jewes</hi> did, but only brought the <hi>Jewes</hi> in for an example that Christians should not pay less.</p>

kept hospitality, and helped their poor friends; and if the Parsons were improperd, the Monks were bound to deal Alms to the poor, and to keep hospitality, as the writings of the gifts of such Parsonages and lands do plainly declare. And as touching the Alms that they dealt, and the hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that they kept, every man knoweth that many thousands were well received of them,</q> and might have been better if they had not had so many great mens horses to feed, and had not been overcharg'd with such idle Gentlemen, as was never out of the Abbeys, and if they had any Vicorage in their hands, <q>they set in sometimes some sufficient Vicar, though but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to preach, and to teach. But now that all the Abbeys with the Lnds and Goods and inpropered parsonages be in temporal mens hands; I doe not hear that one halfe penny worth of Almes or any other profit comes unto the people of those Parishes, your pretence of putting downe of Abbeys was to amend that which was amiss in them, it was far amiss that a great part of the Lands of the Abbeys, (which were given to bring up learned men and to keep hospitality, and to give Almes to the poor should be spent upon a few superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Monks, which gave not forty pounds in Almes, when they should have given two hundred pound: it was amiss that the Monks shoulld have parsonages in their hands, and deale but the twentieth part thereof to the poor, and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but once a year to them that payed the Tythes of parso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages: It was amiss that they scarcely among twenty set one sufficient Vicar to preach for the maintenance which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: but see now, that which was amiss is amended as it is in the old Proverbe, It is amended even as the devil amended his dams leggs, when he should have set it right he brok it quite a pieces; the Monks gave too little Almes and set unable parsons many times in their Benefices, but new where twenty pound was given yearly to the poor in more then one hundred places in <hi>England,</hi> is scarce one meales meat given: this is a faire amendment, where they had alwayes one or other Vicar that either preached or hired some, now there is none at all, but the Farmer is Vicar and Parson and all; and onely an old cast away Monk or Frier which can scarcely say his Mattens, is hired for 20. or 30.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:59144:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was also changed: Fourthly, That neither Christ nor his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles in their age never received any, nor demanded any: Fiftly, That in the beginning of the Church for the first 300. years, whilest the Simplicity of the Gospel was retained, no Tythes was either claimed or payed amongst Christians: Sixtly, But as the power of Godliness came to be lost, and the mistery of iniquity began to work, mens imaginations taught in stead of the doctrin of Christ, began to preach up Tythes, fetching the ground from <hi>Moses</hi> writings, that in the first practise of the payment of Tythes, after the apostacy was entred in, they were not payed as Tythes, but as free offerings and as the bounty of the giver, and were not given for the Ministers maintenance onely, but chiefly for the poor. It was no received doctrin generally that Tythes ought to be payed, till near 1000. years after Christ, that the <hi>Pope</hi> had set up his authority and dominion over the greatest parts of <hi>Europe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> Seventhly, That after they were confirm'd by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and commanded to be payed, there was no compulsary law made but onely excommunication: Eighthly, After that they were accounted an Ecclesiastical duty, and never called a civil right, but were tryed in Ecclesiastical Courts: Ninthly, Untill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1200, the common practice was for every one to bestow his tenths where he pleased: Tenthly, They were first brought in as a duty owing to God and to the Church, and so was required &amp; enforced, and therefore there is no civil property or right in him that claimes them: that first fruits and tenths are but a late invented thing, &amp; claim'd by the <hi>Pope</hi> as successour to the Jewish High priest as he sayes. Eleventh, That Tythes were the same in the ground and foundation, whether claim'd by a <hi>Priest, Impropriator,</hi> or by an <hi>Abbey,</hi> and differed nothing but in the person of him that possessed them: Lastly, All may see the declining estate, the corruption and error that crept in among men, after the power of truth was lost, so was the fruit also, which caused such earnest pressing to needfull contributions, and then afterward was it necessary for Laws and Decrees to enforce them, but in the beginning is was not so; while that Purity and Simplicity of the Gospel remain'd, for then their Charity abounded, even oftentimes

beyond their ability, to whatsoever need the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>But now to proceed to answer some other pleas which are come up in these latter dayes, for now the Priests of this age begins to be ashamed to make claime for Tythes <hi>Jure Divine,</hi> they have been so beat out of that their hole, and their plea <hi>Jure Ecclesiastico</hi> was but determined in the midnight of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and they are ashamed to derive their Authority from the Pope or his Decrees, but now humane right is pleading, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time by gift of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes,</hi> others plead the temporal Laws of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments,</hi> others plead prescriptions by a legall right of their possessions, others plead a legall right by purchase, and lastly the Priests they pleade the equity of the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> still to be in force, and alleadges all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the New Testamens for their proofe, unto which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after some what is said, these are the most pretences that of late hath been made by the Priests of our daye, or the maine rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that hath been alleadged for Tythes; and first whereas they pleade the gift of <hi>Kings,</hi> as one by King <hi>Ethelwolfe</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this book: To that is answered, that if it could be proved, that if the whole land had been in the particular possession of any such <hi>King</hi> they had said something, but by what right could he give the tenth part of all the encrease, and fruits of the labours of all the people of his Dominions, who had no legall property therein? but if King <hi>Ethelwolfes</hi> grant must be the foundation of Tythes, then how many in<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

Another argument which seemes more strong is urged, that the temporal Lawes of <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Parliaments</hi> say, <hi>By the Law, that they have as good a propriety to the tenth part as any hath to the ninth of their Lends.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To such may be said, that the Law doth not give any man a propriety either in Land or Tythes, or any o<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59144:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deceived with a new formed pretence, lately taken up to blinde the simple mindes with a name of legall propriety &amp; civil right, for that's but a meer shift, for I may give my Land which I have by gift, purchase or inheritance, or I may sell it, and so cannot they that seemes to lay claime to Tythes, but it matters not much what any say, when they see their other claimes will not serve, they would evade and shift from one thing to another to blinde people.</p>
            <p>But lets hear what the makers of the Law saith of them, though in the height of Popery, passing by the <hi>Saxon</hi> times and <hi>King Stephen,</hi> who in their blinde superstition, being perswaded thereunto by the Doctrin then taught of the Popish Clergy, that remission of sins was obtain'd by good works, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> aforesaid, they gave divers gifts and tenths for the health of their souls, and their Fathers souls as is aforesaid; but lets come to <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, upon whose Law all others that are since made are builded, who in his time cast off the <hi>Popes Yoke;</hi> in that Act concerning Tythes it is declared, <hi>that Tythes were due to God and holy Church,</hi> and they blame men for being so wicked as not to pay them and therefore that Law is made; and here is the ground of their Law, <hi>viz.</hi> not any property or civil right in Priests or others, for the Law requires them as due by Divine right, and therefore cannot be by any civil or temporal right, (for a man to claime that by humane right from humane law, which commands them as due to God and holy Church as that <hi>Stat.</hi> of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth doth) is but a meer juggle and decelt, and that Law of <hi>Hen.</hi> the eighth, and the rest since, takes them as granted due to God and holy Church, but if they be not, but onely supposed as a duty, then the Law cannot be binding, as they are in all the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes.</p>
            <p>That Tythes were never till of late pretended a civil right, is plain, for as they were imposed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> so they are try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his Courts, and those very Statutes which do pleade made by late <hi>Parliaments,</hi> appoint them to be tryed in <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Courts:</hi> And the Act of 32. of <hi>Hen</hi> the eighth, Tythes are their called <hi>Spiritual gifts,</hi> and therefore no temporal or civil right, for before the dissolution of the <hi>Monastries</hi> in <hi>Hen.</hi>

            <p>COncerning these parish Churches about which there is such heavy stir at this day, and for parish pay, and an injuction for all to worship there, is a very novelty, and compared with the Apostles time, though its granted that there were places wherein the Saints did assemble themselves for the worship of God, yet no limitting to any such place, nor no limitting, nor no tying to pay, these were but set up at best in the time of Popery, and not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the beginning of it neither, for as is mentioned before, the Teachers was sent out of the Monasteries and religious houses so called, and the people did go to worship at any place, and at their own free will gave their offerings where they pleased, till the year 1200. as before is mentioned, as learned <hi>Selden</hi> hath well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd in his exact Treatise of tythes.</p>

            <p>Likewise in other Kingdomes and Nations, where the <hi>Pope</hi> had Authority, the like Rules as aforesaid were observ'd, as might be evidenced by sundry Authors; but not to trouble my selfe or the reader any more, with such unprofitable stuffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
