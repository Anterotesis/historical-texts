            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient custom among the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill nations, so oft as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102692:8"/>
they were blessed with a just and a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King (lest their felicity should bee mutely smother'd, and moulder in their brests) to pour sorth their affections and joyes in elogies, in hearty wishes, and in applauses; especially, when any occasion did excite their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations. By emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102692:8"/>
of which sacred custom, being rapt, and my very bowells in this my frozen age being warmed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, I have taken a flagrant confidence, to celebrate this day which hath restored your Majesty to us, and us unto our selves: being so little daunted with the weaknesse of mine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102692:9"/>
own elocution, that almost I am ready to esteem my self there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the fitter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it. For, what need is there here of any rhetoricall stuff? or why should I too curiously ballance words by weight? it will be enough this day simply to rejoice. Sincerity is a plain and impolite thing, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102692:9"/>
how much the lesse tricked, so much the more joying in her owne naturall ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity; and fine speech while it adorneth, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth our gladness. Neither do I fear that this duty shall appear a flattering blandish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to proceed from one ambitiously projected at the <hi>feet</hi> of <hi>fortune,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102692:10"/>
were unworthy of that ingenuity that I have received from my <hi>parents,</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of that blessed contentment, which liberall <hi>studies</hi> have taught me. Yet, one thing I confesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d oh involve my thoughts at the very entrance, in a kind of <hi>Solicitude</hi>; namely, lest I should with true <hi>praises</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102692:10"/>
that verecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous modesty, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Your Majesty doth so sweetly sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son all your other vertues: for although your fortitude bee great against any thing that requires either <hi>Constancie</hi> of <hi>spirit,</hi> or <hi>validity</hi> of <hi>body</hi>; yet, I cast some doubt, lest you should bear these applauses
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102692:11"/>
the more tenderly, by how much they are the more justly due.</p>
            <p n="2">II. We read that <hi>Germanicus</hi> (and yet what a man?) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what before the <hi>battel</hi> against the <hi>Catti</hi>; went disguised with a beasts skin about his shoulders, to listen behind the souldiers tents what <hi>opinion</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:102692:11"/>
they had of him. So as they seem the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest receivers of their own commendations, that are the worthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to receive them.</p>
            <p>Whence I easily foresee that I must prepare a way for your <hi>Sacred Eares,</hi> by more severe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then I can bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row from the shop of light Rhetoritians. I
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102692:12"/>
will therefore round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirm, that neither the fair, nor the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed lives of <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> should be suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed under ignoble si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but that both the good and bad, should bee delivered to posterity with the same liberty in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves used in living: and with no less reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:102692:12"/>
of truth then of majesty: the good, lest by subducting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of vertue from our knowledge, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue it self by little and little should decay: the bad, that being exempt while they live, from all danger of laws, they might at least be attempered with some awe of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture records. This I
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102692:13"/>
dare speak to your self (most excellent Soveraign) and, even that I dare say so much as this, I owe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your self, who have now so lived 33 and reigned almost nine yeers, that you are not afraid of truth.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Most famous it was of old, and wil eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102692:13"/>
live, that answer of <hi>Virginius Rufus,</hi> to <hi>Cluvius:</hi> You know <hi>Virginius</hi> (saith hee) what credit is due to history: wherefore if you read any thing in my books, otherwaies then you would have it, I pray pardon me. To whom replies <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginius; Cluvius</hi> knows this, that I have done those that I have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102692:14"/>
done, that it might be free for you writers to write what you list. Which was the security (I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess) of a brave gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman indeed, but of a private personage.</p>
            <p>How much more may this day rejoice, at the reception of a King, of whose life and whole deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wee may speak
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102692:14"/>
both openly and safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Yea, let me add this boldly, that if nature her self (the first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitectres) had (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Vitruvius</hi> his conceit) windowed your brest: if Your Majesty should admit all mens eyes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within the walls of your priviest cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward'st closet of your
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102692:15"/>
heart, nothing would there appear, but the splendor of goodness and an untroubled serenity of vertues. What said I? if you would admit? why, can they whom the supreme power hath set in a high and <hi>lucent throne</hi> bee secluded from the eyes of men? or the course of your life and government
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102692:15"/>
be hidden in a mist? certainly in this point, obscurity of degree and solitude it self, is more vailed then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. Doth that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror of <hi>Abyssine</hi> (who they say is seen but once a yeer abroad) think that it is lesse known what he doth with in? Doe wee not know even at this day that <hi>Domitian</hi> even in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102692:16"/>
his secret retied room, whither hee dayly in private resorted, did nothing but stick flies with a bodkin? Lay <hi>Tiberius</hi> hid in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to the Islands of <hi>Capreae,</hi> when among so many wounds and tortures of his consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (with which he was vexed like so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>furies</hi>) many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of a distracted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102692:16"/>
mind did daily break forth? Surely no.</p>
            <p>Your Majesty hath taught the Princes both of your own, &amp; future times, the only and most wholsome way of concealing your self, in this, that you indeavour no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is to bee concealed. There are certain creatures of ingratefull aspect; as
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102692:17"/>
               <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Owls,</hi> (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd by nature to hate the light,) and I know that some Prin-have held it among the secrets of Empire, and for a great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of craft, to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red afar off, as if reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence did only dwell in holes, and caves; and not in full light. Whence flow those Sophistries of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102692:17"/>
I will speak in a word, and freely; they wandred in crooked paths, because they knew not (the shortest way) to bee good. But, Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie doth not flie the eyes and accesse of your subjects; you do not joy to be hid, you do not withdraw your self from those that are yours; you doe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102692:18"/>
not catch at false ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration with a rigid and clouded counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance: yea, sometime you vouchsafe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend to a certain affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility without offence of your dignitie: for thus you reason with your self in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of your owne bosome; if it were not above our power to lie concealed, yet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102692:18"/>
were it below our goodness to will it; then which nothing (in conclusion) is more popular; for good Princes are by all good men openly revered, and even si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently by bad: so much do the beams of vertue dazle even unwilling eies.

of <hi>Pompey</hi>; in your gestures free from af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation; in your whole aspect no swelling, no rigidity, but an alluring and pleasing suavity: your alacrity and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit appears in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your motions, otherwaies stayed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed demeanour; in your purposes and
