            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Now this is so exactly <hi>Our Case,</hi> and the design of our present Meeting; that I think there is no more incumbent on me, than to endeavour to beget in you a due sense of it, and to stir you up to an hearty Acknowledgment of Gods present Mercies to us: And I promise my self some Success in this Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and that the Consideration of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Particulars will make the same Impression on every body concerned, as they have done on me.</p>
            <p>First, Therefore let us consider our <hi>Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Secondly, The <hi>Returns</hi> we are obliged to make for it.</p>
            <p>In our <hi>Deliverance</hi> we ought to <hi>Reflect.</hi>

            <p n="1">I. On the <hi>Depth of the Contrivance, and Design against us, from which God has graciously been pleased at this Time to Deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. On the <hi>great Extent of it.</hi> All Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> especially such as profess the <hi>Reformed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> being struck at by it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. On the <hi>Miraculous Concurrence of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for our Deliverance, in breaking this Design so deeply laid, and vigorously Prosecuted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:43618:5"/>You all have suffered so much by this Design; and the Memory of your Dangers and Deliverance from it, is so fresh before you; that I need not trouble you with the Particulars of it: 'Twas, in short, to destroy <hi>you</hi> and <hi>your Religion,</hi> and enslave all <hi>Europe</hi> under the Tyranny of the <hi>French King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The <hi>Depth</hi> of this Design appears: 1<hi>st. From the length of Time, wherein it has been forming and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on.</hi> Some, and not without Reason, date it from the very beginning of the <hi>Reformation</hi>; some from the Restauration of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> and some from the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Peace; but as it immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns these Kingdoms, we can trace it by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Footsteps from the year 1670<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> since which Time, not only <hi>we,</hi> but <hi>all Europe</hi> have groaned under the Fatal Effects of it. As to this Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> we find a Scheme of it laid down at large, in a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per formerly found in the Earl of <hi>Tyrconnel</hi>'s House, (then Collonel <hi>Talbot</hi>) dated <hi>July</hi> 1671. Supposed to be drawn up by his Brother <hi>Peter Talbot,</hi> then Titular Arch-bishop of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and accidentally dropt about that Time. Several Copies of which, have for many years been in Protestants hands. In this Paper are proposed the <hi>Modelling the Army</hi>; the admitting Papists into <hi>Corporations</hi>; the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to serve in <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military Employments</hi>; and the raising a <hi>vast Army</hi> of them, to be transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into <hi>England</hi> on occasion.</p>
            <p>One Particular in this Paper is Remarkable; 'tis in these Words:
<q>The Toleration of the Roman Catholick Religion in <hi>England</hi> being granted; and the Insolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> taken down; a Confederacy with <hi>France,</hi> which can influence <hi>England,</hi> as <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> can also, will together, with God's Blessing, make His Majesty's Monarchy absolute and real.</q>
Where we see that the <hi>Design</hi> was to make the King <hi>absolute</hi>:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43618:6"/>
And the Means proposed, <hi>Toleration of Popery,</hi> a War with <hi>Holland,</hi> and a League with <hi>France</hi>; all which were at that time put in practice, and have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted vigorously to this day.</p>
            <p>But 2<hi>dly.</hi> We shall better understand the <hi>Depth</hi> of this Design against us, if we reflect on the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, Policy,</hi> and <hi>Number</hi> of the Persons engaged. The <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> of <hi>France</hi>; the <hi>Cunning</hi> and <hi>Craft</hi> of the <hi>Jesuits</hi>; the numerous and bigotted <hi>Roman Clergy</hi>; the <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> were all to be employed to our Ruin. The indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and desperate <hi>Papists</hi> of <hi>Ireland</hi> were to be Armed, and let loose upon us; The common Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Christians, the <hi>Turk,</hi> and <hi>Ravaging Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> were called into Christendom, to promote this Design, and their destructive Methods of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging Wars by <hi>universal Slaughters, Havock,</hi> and <hi>Burnings,</hi> brought into Practice by the <hi>more Vnchri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian French:</hi> And to Crown their Design for the general Slavery and Desolation of <hi>Europe,</hi> Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants were <hi>cajolled, bribed</hi> or <hi>compelled</hi> to fight against, persecute and devour <hi>one another.</hi> All which might be proved by undeniable Instances, if this Sermon were designed for a History.</p>
            <p>But 3<hi>dly,</hi> We may have a further <hi>Idea</hi> of the <hi>Depth</hi> of this Contrivance, from which God has hitherto delivered us, if we consider the Methods used for effecting it: Had it been hatched in Hell, it could not have been more a Mystery of Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than it was; more Black and Villainons Means could not have been applied to bring it to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>For 1<hi>st.</hi> We find <hi>Wicked,</hi> and <hi>Treacherous Leagues</hi> and Conspiracies entred into, in order to carry it on: One of which is more especially Notorious and Remarkable for its <hi>Folly</hi> and <hi>Falshood.</hi> A <hi>League</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:43618:6"/>
so contrary to all <hi>Sence,</hi> as well as <hi>Faith,</hi> that the great Princes concerned in it, are yet ashamed to own it; a <hi>League</hi> so mischievous to <hi>Europe</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and so destructive to <hi>England</hi> in particular, that it has brought them to the very Brink of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction: And it is only God's Miraculous Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that could, or yet can preserve them; a <hi>League</hi> that broke the <hi>Ballance</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> so care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preserved by our wise Fore-Fathers, and by that means has <hi>advanced</hi> one, by <hi>depressing</hi> and <hi>sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> all the rest. This is that Fatal <hi>Confederacy with France,</hi> proposed in the Fore-mentioned Paper: These are the <hi>Engagements of Friendship and Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> which Monsieur <hi>D' Avaux</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador, tells the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> in his Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of <hi>September</hi> the 9<hi>th,</hi> 1688. <hi>The King his Master had with the King of</hi> Great Britain; This is the secret Treaty Abbot <hi>Primi</hi> tells us, <hi>His Britannick Majesty signed in the Year</hi> 1670, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he should have secured to him an absolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over his Parliament, and the Re-establishment of the Roman Catholick Religion in his Three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi>; This is the <hi>Alliance with</hi> France, which <hi>Moloony</hi> the Popish Bishop of <hi>Killaloo,</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his to Bishop <hi>Tyrell</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 8<hi>th.</hi> 1689. (the Original whereof was found amongst the Bishops Papers, and is ready to be produced) is so very angry that some <hi>Trimmers</hi> (as he calleth them) <hi>obliged</hi> King <hi>James</hi> to <hi>disown</hi>; and this is the very <hi>Source</hi> and <hi>Fountain</hi> of all the present Calamities of <hi>Europe,</hi> but more particularly of ours.</p>
            <p>A second Method of carrying on of this Conspiracy to Ruin us, was, by <hi>corrupting</hi> Ministers, by grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>large</hi> Pensions, and <hi>multiplying</hi> Bribes. I wish this means of promoting this wicked Design had
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43618:7"/>
stopped at Ministers, and that the Honour of Princes had set them above the Suspition of taking Bribes; for we are willing to think that it should be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Majesty of a <hi>Crowned</hi> Head to turn <hi>Pensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner,</hi> or to sell his <hi>Crown</hi> or <hi>People</hi> for <hi>Lewis d' Ors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Third Means for carrying on this Contrivance against us, was <hi>Murthering</hi> and <hi>Poysoning</hi>: An Art too much practised of late in some Courts. And 'tis observable, that wherever the Life of a <hi>Protestant,</hi> stands between a <hi>Papist</hi> and an Inheritance, it is of no long continuance; nor doth any Prince begin to appear vigorous or terrible to <hi>France,</hi> but he is in danger to be taken off in the Prime of his Age, and that not without Suspicion of Foul Play; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> There is much Gold in <hi>France,</hi> and there are every where wicked Men ready to be bribed to do any thing; and 'tis not supposed of some that they scruple much to make the Experiment what it is able to do.</p>
            <p>But 4<hi>thly.</hi> Where they could not <hi>Murther Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> Princes, (it is hard to say where they have not attempted it) they endeavour to defeat them of their <hi>Succession.</hi> We all are satisfied that <hi>this</hi> was the only <hi>Womb,</hi> that conceived a <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Wales</hi> for us, and gave him a Birth. There was an Attempt of the same kind, in the days of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which did not succeed to their mind, but <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> make Men wiser: Hence it is, that the Contrivance that proved <hi>abortive then,</hi> did with <hi>us</hi> come to <hi>Perfection</hi>; but in such a manner, that at the same rate (if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed) we might be sure never to fail of an Heir, to defeat a <hi>Protestant Successor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A 5<hi>th.</hi> Means of promoting this Design, was, by calling the <hi>Turk</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> and by supporting that common Enemy of <hi>Christianity,</hi> to the Ruine of those
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43618:7"/>
that profess the Holy Name of <hi>Christ.</hi> And the <hi>French</hi> King, that he might embroyl Christendom by <hi>Sea,</hi> as well as by <hi>Land,</hi> has made his Pride stoop to his Interest, and condescended to buy a Peace with the <hi>Algerines:</hi> Covenanting with them, to assist them in their Pyracies, and their Enslaving Christians. A <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Designs</hi> are known by his <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Confederates:</hi> Now the <hi>French</hi> King's Allies are, the <hi>Banditi</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Pyrates</hi> of <hi>Algiers,</hi> the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> and the <hi>Tories</hi> of <hi>Ireland:</hi> What a Mercy of God is it, to give us a Deliverance from the Conspiracy and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs of such Monsters.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Depth</hi> of this Design appears from a sixth Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod used to Effect it, and that was, to stir up and Animate one Party of <hi>Protestants</hi> to <hi>Bite</hi> and <hi>Devour</hi> another, 'Tis not bare difference of Opinion that makes Men of different Sects, so strange and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociable to one another, as we commonly observe them to be; but their Strangeness and Enmity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds either from Interest, or from some peculiar Principle that obliges them to Persecute and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all that differ from them, tho' in a Trifle: Where neither of these happen, or where Men of different Opinions are not Encouraged, or suffered to hurt one another, we see they live very easily, and lovingly together: Of which <hi>Holland</hi> is an undeniable Instance: And likewise <hi>this</hi> City under our Late Common Sufferings; in which the Generality of <hi>Protestants,</hi> notwithstanding their Difference in Judgment, lived with much Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Confidence and Friendship. But it is a Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, that every Prince with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his own Dominions, is obliged to Extirpate, and Destroy all <hi>Hereticks:</hi> And that under no less a Penalty than <hi>Deposition.</hi> This is required of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43618:8"/>
Princes by the Councils of <hi>Lateran</hi> and <hi>Constance,</hi> and all <hi>Popish</hi> States, and Princes have been so True to it in their Practice, that I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that there has been, nor believe that there is at this present, any Prince or State of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, who doth Tolerate any Religion besides their own, in their Country, where they are able to suppress it with safety to themselves: And they have generally been so eager upon it, that many have attempted it to their own destruction. No wonder therefore if their Persons, and Religion be very Odious to Men of different perswasions; since Every body Naturally hates one that is always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to do him a Mischief. But I wish that they had kept this Principle to themselves, and not industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously sowed it amongst <hi>Protestants,</hi> among whom they first, by their Emissaries sow False Doctrines, and raise Schisms; and then set up others to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute, and Destroy those whom they themselves have seduced. And when they have prevailed with one party to <hi>Bate, Worry,</hi> and <hi>Exasperate</hi> another to the Height, they then take them off for a time, put the <hi>Rods</hi> and <hi>Axes</hi> into the Hands of the <hi>Oppressed,</hi> and whilst they yet smart under their sufferings, they stir them up, and Encourage them to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge themselves on their Persecutors. By which arts they make the breach irreconcilable, and the difference, tho inconsiderable in it self, to become the ground of an Eternal Schism and Feud, between the Parties whom they have thus Dashed against one another.</p>
            <p>We all know that these were the Methods used to set us together by the Ears, ever since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and in the <hi>Two last Reigns</hi> 'twas particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly observable, that <hi>Toleration</hi> and <hi>Persecution,</hi> succeeded one another by turns; and were timed
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43618:8"/>
just as they served most effectually to set People a madding against one another. One day the <hi>Laws</hi> must all be put in execution, and none must be a Favourite, that would not be forward to <hi>execute</hi> them; the next day the Persecution must not only be stopped, but the instruments of it exposed to the revenge of those they had exasperated, and forced to take their turn in suffering, by the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Law-Suits</hi> of such as they had wronged. Thus the common Conspirators against our <hi>Peace, Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> blew the Coals, and kindled a flame amongst us, that was like to devour us all: And 'tis God's great Mercy that we have escaped it. These are a few of those considerations which might be offered to shew the depth of this Design, from which our good God has graciously redeemed us.</p>
            <p n="2">II. But I haste to the second Head of my Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, whence we may have occasion to magnifie God's goodness in our <hi>Deliverance:</hi> and that is from the <hi>extent</hi> of the design against us, which was equal to its <hi>Depth,</hi> it being of a vast and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive Nature.</p>
            <p>The true and great Design was, to satisfie the <hi>Ambition</hi> of the King of <hi>France,</hi> by advancing him to the <hi>Vniversal Monarchy</hi> of the <hi>West: England</hi> might be cullied and wheedled with the imaginary pleasure of <hi>Mastering</hi> his <hi>Parliament,</hi> of getting his <hi>will of his People,</hi> and settling <hi>Popery; Holland</hi> with the hopes of Gain and free Trade; the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Emperor,</hi> with the specious pretence of re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Catholick Religion; but the true and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom design was, to enslave <hi>Europe,</hi> and to make the French King as great and as pernicious to the <hi>Western</hi> Princes and States, as the <hi>Turk</hi> has been to the <hi>Eastern.</hi> And <hi>they</hi> did not miss the matter, <hi>who</hi> in the Emblem represented these two as sawing the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43618:9"/>
Globe a sunder, whilst the King of <hi>Englands</hi> part was to pour in Oyl, to make the Work more easie for them: A thing so destructive to the true Interest of his Crown, that it is a Miracle, how he could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to accept of the Employment; much more how he should be able to prevail with his Subjects to assist him in it. Whatever he pretended of the <hi>Stubbornness</hi> or <hi>Vngovernableness</hi> of the People of these Nations, it certainly argued a very <hi>Passive</hi> and <hi>Submissive</hi> Temper in them, to give Money so <hi>libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally,</hi> and to Fight so <hi>fiercely</hi> as they did, to destroy themselves and their Fellow-<hi>Protestants</hi>; to make sport for their common Adversaries, and serve the Interests of their most <hi>inveterate</hi> and most <hi>dangerous</hi> Enemy, the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Design was <hi>Vniversal,</hi> and aimed at the destruction and enslaving all the Kingdoms and States of <hi>Europe</hi>; no Distinction of <hi>Protestant</hi> or <hi>Papist, Enemy</hi> or <hi>Ally, All</hi> were equally devoted to Destruction in it.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was actually turned out of his Dukedom; the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> (His Present Majesty) was deprived of his Principality of <hi>Orange</hi>; the Empire was partly to be given up to the <hi>Turk,</hi> and the remaining Princes were to apply themselves to <hi>France</hi> for Protection, and to chuse his Son King of the <hi>Romans</hi>; the Dukedom of <hi>Savoy</hi> was to be brought in, under the Notion of <hi>Pupillage</hi>; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Italy</hi> were <hi>frightned, bought,</hi> or <hi>wheedled</hi> out of their strong Holds, and the Keys of their Country (such were <hi>Cassal</hi> and <hi>Guastale</hi>) put into <hi>French</hi> hands: <hi>Scicily</hi> was perswaded to Rebel, and solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to serve the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> as they had done the <hi>French</hi> before in the famous Vespers; <hi>Genoa</hi> was to be bombed, <hi>England</hi> bought, and <hi>Holland</hi> drowned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Spain</hi> had a barren Queen (designedly made so (as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43618:9"/>
many believe) put upon him, that his Crown might fall to <hi>France</hi> by Succession; the Northern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, whose Cold and Distance secured them from immediate Attempts, were yet taken off from assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Neighbours, and <hi>brought</hi> into something <hi>worse</hi> than a <hi>Neutrality.</hi> The great Contrivers and Managers of these, were the <hi>French</hi> King, the Great <hi>Turk,</hi> and I need not name the <hi>Third, in Triumvirate.</hi> 'Tis too much, that we groan yet under the Mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous effects of their Conspiracy, which has been no less pernicious to all <hi>Europe,</hi> than that of <hi>Anthony, Lepidus</hi> and <hi>Augustus,</hi> was to the <hi>Roman</hi> Common-Wealth. There is no doubt but all these have been <hi>designed, attempted,</hi> and <hi>almost brought</hi> to <hi>Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> within these Twenty Years, by strength of this Confederacy· And there is not one Prince or State in all <hi>Europe,</hi> that has not been concerned in the fatal effects thereof.</p>
            <p>But 3<hi>dly,</hi> This Design was levelled more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately at the Destruction of the Protestants of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>; the <hi>Extirpation of the Pestilent Northern Heresy</hi> has been long known to be the principal Article in it, and was probably the Pretence and Bait, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced His <hi>late Majesty</hi> to espouse it. He was not fonder of being <hi>obeyed without Reserve,</hi> than of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating his Religion</hi>; and perhaps he chiefly desired an <hi>Absolute Authority</hi> over his Subjects, that he might compel them to come into the <hi>Bosom of his Church.</hi> What business had he with a standing Army, or nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Troops of Dragoons, but to employ them as Missionaries, to Convert his Heretical Subjects? The Example of <hi>France</hi> had taught him their use; and that <hi>Dragooning</hi> was a much more effectual way to <hi>Reconcile</hi> Men, than <hi>Sermons</hi> or <hi>Arguments.</hi> In short, by this Conspiracy, the Protestants of <hi>France</hi> are already destroyed; those of <hi>Savoy</hi> turned out
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43618:10"/>
of their Country; those of <hi>Holland</hi> have been inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and forced to cover themselves with their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and as for us in <hi>Ireland,</hi> I need not tell you how we have been used, the least hint is sufficient to refresh your Memories, and the Danger we have escaped, is yet so near, that it supersedes all Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of a Description. It has been said of some, that when they have been shewed the <hi>next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the Danger they escaped <hi>in the night,</hi> they have dyed with Apprehension. I am sure no Precipice can have a more dreadful prospect to those that have escaped it, than our Danger ought to have, and will have to all that duly consider, and look back on it. But God has <hi>Redeemed</hi> and <hi>Saved</hi> us out of our Enemy's hands; He has brought us back into our own Land, and we are now before him this day, to magnifie him for our Deliverance. Let us therefore join in that which is the Chorus of this Psalm, <hi>O that Men would praise the Lord for his Goodness, and declare the Wonders he doth for the Children of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 4<hi>thly.</hi> This Conspiracy had a peculiar respect to the Free States of <hi>Europe</hi>: 'Twas about the time of the entring into this League that famous Saying was applied to <hi>Holland, Delenda est Carthago</hi>; it was pretended to be of ill consequence to Princes and Crowned Heads, to let a Common-Wealth be their Neighbour, lest the sight and example of Liberty might influence their People, they combined there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to destroy them, that the Slaves of <hi>France</hi> might not understand, that there was a milder Government in the World, than the Tyranny of their Master. If His present Majesty could have been prevailed on, to come into the Confederacy, he needed not have ventured his Life to rescue <hi>England,</hi> and merited a Crown by such hazardous
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43618:10"/>
Undertakings. He might have been a KING out of hand in his own Country, and secured of his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession to the English Throne; but he scorned Crowns of <hi>Lewis</hi>'s giving, much more one that he could not take without injuring his Country, the Liberty of which is due to his <hi>Ancestors,</hi> and the Preservation of it to <hi>Himself.</hi> But when they could not corrupt, they resolved to destroy him, and that more particularly, because they look'd on him as the <hi>Patron</hi> and <hi>Defender</hi> of the Liberty of <hi>Europe</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to which they on all occasions declared their Enmity. 'Tis not imaginable, with what Passion and Zeal their whole Party <hi>here,</hi> used to enlarge on the Praises of an <hi>Absolute</hi> Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how impatient they were to hear any one name to them, the <hi>Laws,</hi> the <hi>Liberty</hi> of the <hi>Subjects,</hi> or a <hi>Common-wealth.</hi> No, the <hi>King's Will</hi> was the <hi>only Law</hi> they could endure to hear of; and they mightily admired and praised the <hi>submissive</hi> Temper of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themselves happy to be under a Power which, when it pleased, might present them with a <hi>Bow-String.</hi> They did not mince the Matter, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professed, That they designed to free the King from the <hi>Chains</hi> of the <hi>Laws,</hi> and the <hi>Pupillage</hi> of <hi>Parliaments:</hi> Or, as the Irish Proposals I mentioned before, word it, <hi>Make his Monarchy absolute and real.</hi> The very Terms of the League, according to Abbot <hi>Primi,</hi> were to <hi>secure</hi> to the King <hi>an absolute Authority over his Parliament, and the Re-establishment of the Roman-Catholick Religion in the Three Kingdoms of</hi> England, Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>But, 5<hi>thly.</hi> This Confederacy, or rather Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, had a peculiar relation to <hi>Ireland.</hi> The great Body and Magazine of Men, whose Hands were to perform this Work in these Kingdoms, were to be raised out of <hi>Ireland</hi>; the <hi>Irish Proposals</hi> I have so
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43618:11"/>
often mentioned, promise 150000, part of them were to be the King's <hi>immediate Guards,</hi> part of them the <hi>standing Army</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and all of them the <hi>Instruments</hi> of our <hi>Slavery.</hi> In order to make them considerable, and to hire them to do their Work cheerfully, <hi>Ireland</hi> was to be separated from the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and made independent on it; The <hi>English</hi> Interest in it was to be destroyed, and the Protestants, under the Notion of <hi>Whigs, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, Cromwelians,</hi> roo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed out of it. How near these things were to taking effect, you can all wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. They were not only designed and attempted, but actually, for the most part, executed upon us; our <hi>Estates</hi> were taken away, and this Kingdom cut off from <hi>England,</hi> by Acts past in their late pretended <hi>PARLIAMENT</hi>; our Houses were filled with Souldiers and Dragoons, our Churches possessed by <hi>Romish</hi> Priests, our Persons shut up in Prisons, and our Religious Assemblies interdicted. Our <hi>Friends</hi> and <hi>Relations,</hi> our <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Clergy,</hi> driven for the most part out of the Kingdom, attainted for Life and Estates, and an Army ready to be transported into <hi>England,</hi> if God had not put a stop to their <hi>Designs,</hi> and <hi>confounded their Devices.</hi> 'Tis by His mercy <hi>we are redeemed from the Lands, from the North and from the South,</hi> and therefore let us give Thanks unto Him, and Praise Him.</p>
            <p>You see then the <hi>Extent</hi> of this Design, that it took in all the Princes and States of <hi>Europe,</hi> that it struck at our <hi>Estates,</hi> our <hi>Liberty,</hi> our <hi>Lives,</hi> and above all, at our <hi>Religion</hi>; that it was carryed on by many and powerful hands, and by the most se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and efficacious Methods; And who else could defeat such a Contrivance, or put a stop to it, but the same God that <hi>bounds the Sea with a Heap of Dust,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43618:11"/>
and says to the Waves thereof, hither shall you come, and no farther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Which is a proper Introduction to my third Head, <hi>The Miraculous Concurrence of Providences for our Deliverance, in breaking this Design so deeply laid, and vigorously prosecuted.</hi> These were so many, and so remarkable, that I doubt whether ever any Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was accompanied with a Chain of such strange and unaccountable Accidents, I shall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only a few, that every body must have observed, and leave you to judge, whether the Finger of God must not be acknowledg'd in them.</p>
            <p>First therefore, it was strangely unaccountable, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> who seemed to have a great Stake and Interest in this Design, and as one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, was most deeply concerned in the Success of it, should upon a trifle, break with the <hi>French</hi> King, and not only desert his Party, but most cordially espouse the opposite side: And that the King of <hi>France,</hi> who never before struck at any thing when <hi>Interest</hi> was in the case, upon the <hi>Worlds</hi> counting it base or wicked, should refuse his Ghostly Father common Justice in Matters of so little moment, as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale</hi> and <hi>Franchises.</hi> It is plain, that the <hi>Pope</hi> has Right on his side on both these, and that the <hi>French</hi> King was not much concerned, either in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or Honour to defend them: The <hi>Regale</hi> being a new Usurpation, and the <hi>Franchises</hi> an ancient Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance: Yet so obstinate have both sides proved in the Contest, that we hope 'tis become irreconcilable. Now if this had not happened, the Counter-League of the Princes of <hi>Europe</hi> to the <hi>French</hi> Conspiracy, could hardly have been entred into or continued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Tis this takes off the Odium from the <hi>Emperor</hi>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43618:12"/>
the Advantages he proposed to himself, by decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this a <hi>War</hi> of <hi>Religion:</hi> It being ridiculous to pretend a <hi>Holy War</hi> against the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Head</hi> of <hi>his</hi> Church. This aversion of the Pope to the <hi>French</hi> designs is, an Obstacle in the way, that neither <hi>Lewis</hi> nor <hi>James,</hi> can yet get over, tho' the one begs hard, and the other offers fair to remove it: Having proffered the Pope all that he desired at first, and to oblige the French Clergy to own his <hi>Infallibility</hi> into the bargain.</p>
            <p>Thus God shews, that <hi>the Hearts of Kings are in his Hands</hi>; that he can make them <hi>stoop,</hi> and do <hi>mean</hi> things, when it will do them no good; and <hi>obstinate,</hi> when yielding would be serviceable to them. It cannot but be esteemed a further Providence, that two <hi>Popes</hi> should succeed one another of the same humour, (which is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) and should persevere in the same Enmity to <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 2<hi>dly.</hi> It must be owned as a <hi>signal</hi> piece of <hi>Providence</hi> in God, to have raised up a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the <hi>Courage, Closeness,</hi> and <hi>Activity</hi> of his <hi>present Majesty</hi>; who durst attempt so strange and (in human probability) such an impractical thing as our <hi>Deliverance.</hi> 'Tis a rare thing in the World, that one man should have the <hi>Dexterity</hi> to <hi>Engage,</hi> and the <hi>Wisdom</hi> to <hi>Manage</hi> so many <hi>Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> Interests into a <hi>Confederacy,</hi> and argues a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It was another piece of <hi>Divine Ordering,</hi> that His Majesty should be so particularly interessed and engaged to undertake this Work, before it was too late, and our Destruction unavoidable. If we had gone on a few years in the course, in which we were, in all probability our Condition would have become altogether desperate. But the eagerness
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43618:12"/>
of the Conspirators to cut off Their present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties from all hopes of Succession to the Crown, made them introduce a Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> two or three years sooner than they were ready for him. They knew very well when <hi>he</hi> appeared, the Persons <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned</hi> would be provoked to the height, and that then, if ever, Their present Majesties must appear for <hi>their Right,</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom,</hi> for their <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> against which They were not as yet prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: For they had not yet sufficiently <hi>trained</hi> the <hi>Irish,</hi> nor filled the Army in <hi>England</hi> with <hi>Papists,</hi> for want of which they were not able to make any Resistance against the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> having awakened him, before they were prepared for him, and necessitated him to make his Descent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> whilst the Arms were still for the most part in the Protestants Hands, and the Papists in no capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to awe them.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> The very pretended <hi>Birth</hi> of the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> was so ill managed, that it was not so much as a <hi>well-contrived</hi> Cheat. The very <hi>Papists</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of it, and that publickly in print. There was published here, (amongst many others under the late Government) a virulent Paper against His present Majesty, entituled, <hi>England's Crysis, or the World well amended.</hi> To give it the greater Credit the Author pretends to be a <hi>Protestant,</hi> and the Evidence of Truth forced from him this following passage. <hi>One Reason of his</hi> (the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi>'s) <hi>Expedition had at least a shew of Justice in the Quarrel, I mean the business of the Prince of</hi> Wales, <hi>which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but confess, some People managed, as if they designed either that we should not believe at all, or if we did, our Belief should be as implicit as to Successions, and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances here, as that of the Romanist is in his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Inheriting the Kingdom of Heaven hereafter.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:43618:13"/>
This it is true, they imputed to the Treachery of Councellors and Managers: But when their Zealots writ, and King <hi>James</hi> permitted such Accounts of that matter to be published, 'tis a sign the business needed an Apology; and that by God's just Judgment on them, their usual Dexterity failed them in it.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> It was a <hi>Peculiar Providence</hi> in this Affair, that King <hi>James</hi> did not adhere <hi>determinately</hi> to any <hi>Counsels</hi> or <hi>Counsellors,</hi> but did things irresolutely, and by halves. I find <hi>Papists</hi> in their Letters to him complaining of this, and cautioning him against it. One entreats him, <hi>for Gods sake not to listen to Trimming Counsellors, whose Aversion to his Religion, and cunning design of spinning out his Life with their</hi> Pian Piano, <hi>put them upon urging to him, that great Alterations are dangerous, when carried otherwise than by slow and imperceptible degrees.</hi> The same tells him, That <hi>nothing causes Irresolution more than a Medley of Councellors of a Different Religion from their Prince.</hi> Yet King <hi>James</hi> could never free himself from this <hi>Medley</hi>: And that is the Reason that his Actions were never of a Piece, and that he commonly spoyled his Business by doing <hi>too much,</hi> and yet <hi>too little.</hi> Thus he ought either not to have brought any <hi>Irish</hi> or <hi>French</hi> into his Army. or made the whole entirely <hi>Papists</hi>; he ought either to have accepted the <hi>French</hi> King's Assistance and Fleet without Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, or else broken with him altogether, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red against him: But by hanging between both, he lost the Affections of his own Subjects, which might have supported him, and the Benefit of Forreign As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. His <hi>doing</hi> and <hi>undoing</hi> things had the same effect; In wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ch, and many other particulars, his not sticking entirely to one sort of Counsellors, was to us a great <hi>Providence.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:43618:13"/>I must reckon it as a Sixth, that the States of <hi>Holland</hi> should, without scruple, trust their <hi>All</hi> into His Majesty's Hand, and be content to run his Fortune: Which they plainly did in his Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We all know, that the United <hi>Netherlands</hi> are a <hi>Free</hi> People, most Jealous of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and who have done and suffered more to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, than perhaps any Nation in the World. And as they are jealous of their Liberty, so they are <hi>close</hi> and <hi>wary,</hi> and not apt to venture too much at one stake. Now, that such a People should commit the Absolute Disposal of their <hi>Navy, their Armies, and their Money, the very Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of their State,</hi> to one man, and venture all in the same Bottom with him, was an unbounded <hi>Trust and Kindness,</hi> as His Majesty himself is said to have expressed it to them. They trusted not only <hi>Him,</hi> but the <hi>Winds</hi> and <hi>Seas</hi> for his sake: And tho' they had such entire Confidence in his Conduct and Faith, as not to ask him what he designed; yet the Hazard of a Winter Voyage, where the whole of their State was at once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the mercy of a Tempest, was sufficient to have s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7<hi>thly.</hi> It must be owned as an Effect of the same <hi>Providence,</hi> that King <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Court</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters</hi> was so <hi>blinded,</hi> that they could not see into His present Majesty's Designs, and so secure, that they would not give credit to the many Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices given them of <hi>these</hi> Preparations; of which we can give no other account than that of <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 5.13. <hi>He taketh the Wise in their own craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness,

and the Councel of the Froward is carryed head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; They meet with Darkness in the Day, and grope in the Noon-day, as in the Night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8<hi>thly.</hi> I shall only mention King <hi>James</hi>'s <hi>Deserting</hi> his Army in <hi>England,</hi> on which if he had absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast Himself, and depended on their Fidelity, it is certain, by what has happened since, that a great part of them would have stood by him. There were enow to make a Vigorous Opposition, who were willing to run his Fortune, if God had not En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled their Courage, and put fear in their Hearts. It was this opened the way to one of the greatest Revolutions that ever happened in that Kingdom, almost without a Drop of Blood. Which must be owned as a singular <hi>Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9<hi>thly.</hi> It was an over-reaching Act of <hi>Providence</hi> to make that the <hi>Key</hi> to open a Way for our Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, which was projected by our Enemies, as the certain means to Embroil us for ever. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose no body doubts, but those who advised King <hi>James</hi> to <hi>Desert</hi> the Kingdom, believe that we could never come to a Settlement without him; and yet the Event proved directly contrary to their Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation: For his Presence in all probability had been such a Rub to our Settlement, that it had not been easie to get over it. It was indeed strange we should come to a Resolution so soon, especially where the Weight of the Matter was so great, and the Opinions of Men so divided, that in the near equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Voices, the Wisest could not foresee how it would end, till Heaven it self determined it. For what else could have brought such different Interests and Judgments, to acquiesce in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion.</p>
            <p>Neither in the 10<hi>th.</hi> Place must we imagine, that <hi>that</hi> strange and absurd Division of <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:43618:14"/>
into <hi>Jacobites</hi> and <hi>Williamites,</hi> happened with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Providence.</hi> Whatever Sense some may have of it in other respects, we of this Kingdom, must own it as a great and signal Mercy. King <hi>James</hi> and his Adherents here, reckoned upon a strong and numerous Party in <hi>England</hi>; and were afraid, if they had utterly destroyed <hi>us,</hi> that they should have lost <hi>them</hi>; and therefore in many cases were oblig'd to bear an easier hand towards us, than otherwise they would have done. And whatever Favour or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance we received from them, it was intirely due to this Consideration. This was the Use God made of this Faction, and now it has served his Purpose, I hope he will extinguish it.</p>
            <p n="11">11<hi>thly.</hi> God in his <hi>Providence</hi> so order'd it, that King <hi>James</hi> found an unexpected Diversion in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that employed all his Forces till things were settled in <hi>England</hi>; and till his Present Majesty had leisure to break the Enemies Power in <hi>Scotland</hi>; and prepare for the Conquest of <hi>Ireland.</hi> Had King <hi>James</hi> on his Landing in <hi>Ireland,</hi> found no Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in it, but been intirely at Liberty to join his Forces with that Party that appeared for him in our Neighbouring Kingdom, every one is sensible, how fatal the Event might have proved: Not only to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> but also to the Liberty of all <hi>Europe.</hi> But it pleased God to find him Work here by an unexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Opposition, which not only <hi>imployed,</hi> but <hi>ruined</hi> his best Men; and lost him such an Opportunity, as never could again be expected. If we consider the <hi>Places</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> that made this Opposition, it is a Miracle that they should undertake, much more that they should succeed in it. And it looks as if God Almighty in his <hi>Providence</hi> had raised them up for that Juncture, and inspired them with Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in an extraordinary Manner, to shew <hi>his
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:43618:15"/>
Power</hi> in <hi>their weakness,</hi> and his Care of us, in the Seasonableness of their Undertaking. Our Enemies were very sensible of the Unluckiness of this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, as they called it, and curst <hi>Derry</hi> and <hi>Enis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>killin</hi> as the Occasion of the Ruin of their Affairs.</p>
            <p n="12">12<hi>thly.</hi> It was certainly a <hi>great Providence</hi> to us, that his Majesty in Person should undertake the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of <hi>Ireland,</hi> at a time, and in such Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, that King <hi>James,</hi> and his Party judged it <hi>impossible:</hi> And promised themselves that they had made him such Work at home, that he should rather fear an <hi>Invasion</hi> from <hi>Ireland,</hi> than think of an <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition</hi> into it. But the <hi>Providence</hi> of God, by his single Courage and Resolution, broke all their Measures, and put them out of those Methods, which they imagined so well concerted, that it must be impossible to defeat them.</p>
            <p n="13">13<hi>thly.</hi> Can it be ascribed to any thing else than a <hi>singular Providence,</hi> that they should mistake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and disregard the Advices, or rather (as they themselves used to call them) <hi>their Orders from</hi> France, so, as to put themselves to the hazard of a <hi>Battle,</hi> when <hi>delay</hi> was so much their Interest whatever it cost them, and so easie to them, had they not been infatuated?</p>
            <p n="14">14<hi>thly.</hi> It was no less an <hi>Over-ruling Providence,</hi> that an Army so well Trained, Disciplined, and Armed; and so advantageously posted, should make so little Opposition. The Advantage of their Post by all Intelligent men, was reckoned above <hi>three</hi> to <hi>one</hi>; and it had been impossible to beat them from it, had not the God of Battles enfeebled <hi>their</hi> hearts, and animated his <hi>Majesty</hi> to an Attempt, that seems next in strangeness to that of <hi>Jonathans</hi> on the <hi>Philistines:</hi> And which perhaps, <hi>only</hi> his Majesty of all Men living, would have attempted.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:43618:15"/>15<hi>thly.</hi> Add to this, the strange <hi>Panick</hi> Fear that seized the Vanquished. Tho' their Troops were for the most part untouched, and a very few fallen; yet such Dread and Terror possessed them, as did formerly the <hi>Syrians</hi> at <hi>Samaria,</hi> and <hi>they fled where no man pursued them.</hi> King <hi>James</hi> did not stop till he got out of the Kingdom, and his Army fled as far as the Sea would let them; had they had ships, they would have gone all together.</p>
            <p n="16">16<hi>thly.</hi> I must remark it further as a peculiar <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> that his Majesties Victory happened at such a Critical Time, that the Peace of <hi>England,</hi> nay per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Fate of <hi>Europe,</hi> depended on it, Had it but been delayed one Week, no body knows what would have been the Consequence.</p>
            <p n="17">17<hi>thly,</hi> The saving of this City of <hi>Dublin</hi> from so often threatned, and (as both we, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of our Enemies believed,) resolved Destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is another piece of Divine Goodness: And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al so strange, that we can yet give no Account of it, or so much as guess at what altered their Resolution. I need only mention this to most of my Hearers, to fill their hearts with Admiration, and open their Mouths with Thansgiving to God, for the Miracles of his Mercies.</p>
            <p n="18">18<hi>thly.</hi> And yet there is still behind a greater Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle and Mercy than this, and which we can hardly think on without Terror, and that was, <hi>the Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Preservation of his Majesties Person in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle:</hi> To whom we may apply what <hi>David</hi> affirms of himself, <hi>there is but a step between me and Death</hi>; our danger came nearer, even within a hairs breadth. If there were no dangers &amp; difficulties in Life, we should not be sensible of particular Providences: But one such escape as this, awakens the Sense of Religion,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:43618:16"/>
and of Gods Power, more in our Hearts, than many years of even and un-interrupted Happiness. We must acknowledge that all our Lives in him, were at the Mercy of that one Bullet: And 'twas surely the God of Battles in his unspeakable Mercy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence preserved us. If Thousands of us had dyed, the Enemy would not have cared for us: And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they lost the Battle, yet they would have counted it a Victory, and their loss sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ballanced by the single Life of his present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty. 'Tis certain they would willingly have given their Army for it. And this alone is sufficient to teach us how to value it, and what thanks we owe to God for preserving it.</p>
            <p>In short, we had not, neither have we yet in our utmost view, another chance to save <hi>us,</hi> our <hi>Liberties, Estates</hi> or <hi>Religion,</hi> but this one, of His Majesties coming to the rescue of these Kingdoms: And his undertaking it has been carried on by such a miraculous Chain of <hi>Providences,</hi> that we must ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, it is by the <hi>Grace of God,</hi> that <hi>William</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> are now our King and Queen. Perhaps they have more visible reasons to put <hi>that</hi> in their Titles, than any Princes in Christendom.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore own the whole of our <hi>Deliverance</hi> to be a work of God, and ascribe it intirely to him, without assuming any part of it to our selves. God in his <hi>Providence</hi> has so ordered the matter, that <hi>we,</hi> in <hi>this</hi> place, have had no hand in it, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to it. And as for others, it plainly appears not to be so much a work of man, or carried on by humane means, as by the <hi>over-ruling Providence</hi> of God. 'Twas manifestly God, rather than the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, set our King and Queen on the Throne. The People Obstructed it as much as they could, by their Divisions; the Nobles Opposed it; the Mighty
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43618:16"/>
stood up to hinder it; the Nations Combined against it; but God had them in Derision, and not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their Majesties from the Striving of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but also made them their Head. 'Tis He, <hi>the most High, that Ruleth in the Kingdom of Men, and giveth it to whomsoever he will.</hi> 'Tis He raised up King <hi>William</hi> to be a Deliverer to us. And to sum up all. 'Tis He that <hi>delivered us from so great a death, and doth deliver: In whom we Trust that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will yet deliver us.</hi> And therefore to him be the <hi>sole</hi> glory of it.</p>
            <p>And now, that God has so signally appeared for us, let us (which was the <hi>Second</hi> General Head I proposed) Consider what Returns we are Obliged to make him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Let us Remember that it was not for nothing that he Delivered us. He had Certainly a Peculiar design in saving us from the Hands of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, by so many and so Remarkable Providences, <hi>even that we might serve him without fear.</hi> Let us therefore Employ those <hi>Lives, Liberties, Estates</hi> and <hi>Churches</hi> to his service, that he has preserved for us, and restored to us. Let us avoid those provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that induced him to bring such Heavy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon us; and let us Remember, how Easy it is for him to bring us to a condition much worse, than that from whence he delivered us; and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure our selves, that if instead of serving him, we serve <hi>his</hi> Enemies the <hi>Devil,</hi> and our <hi>Lusts,</hi> he will make his Providence as signal in our future pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, as it has been in our present Deliverance. It were Easy to point out the sins that provoked God, and Occasioned our late Sufferings, and the same causes will always have the same Effects.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Let us own God's goodness to us in our late Sufferings, how in the midst of his anger, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:43618:17"/>
Mercy; how he made our Sufferings ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier to us than we expected, and relieved us sooner than we could have reasonably imagined; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued us amongst the living, when we expected Death; He gave us Hearts to bear up under our Pressures, and made us Unanimous and kind to one another; He pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>served us from <hi>Famine</hi> and <hi>Pesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,</hi> which we feared, and granted us, for the most part, Opportunity of Meeting together, to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him; and in many things rather afforded our Enemies an occasion of shewing their Malice, and wicked Intentions against us, than of Executing them. So that we must acknowledge with the <hi>Psalmist</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the <hi>Lord has Chastned, and Corrected us, but hath not given us over unto Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> Let us be thankful to <hi>God</hi> for our <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verers,</hi> and thankful to them for the great Pains they have taken, and the great Dangers they have run to effect it. This is in a manner all we can return them at present, for all the Pains and Costs they have been at for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for all the Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity they have shewed towards us: Our Enemies having disabled us in a great Measure, either to help our selves, or make any Retribution to them. However, what we can do, let us do cheerfully. And let us return at least our hearty acknowledgments and Prayers to God for them: Especially for their Majesties, whose Parts have been <hi>so</hi> signal in it, that they revive in our Minds the Memories of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Heroes, the Kings of <hi>England</hi>; the <hi>Edwards, Henries,</hi> and (of Queens) the fam'd <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that made us safe at home, and dreadful to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. If we consider <hi>what</hi> we have seen the King do in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and <hi>what part</hi> her Majesty in the mean time acted in <hi>England</hi>; it must be our own faults if we are not a happy People under such Princes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:43618:17"/>
and we must be very ungrateful both to God and Them, if we are not sensible of his Goodness in blessing us with such Governors; either of which seems capable of Governing much larger Territories, than they yet possess. And I hope as they are <hi>Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled</hi> to them, so in time they will <hi>acquire</hi> them.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> Let us spare no pains nor costs to perfect this happy Work of our <hi>Deliverance:</hi> And let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that if this had not happened, we must have lost our <hi>Estates</hi> and <hi>Liberty,</hi> and perhaps together with them, <hi>our Lives.</hi> Who would not within these last Three Years have given one half of his Estate to save the other? And then what great matter if we give half of our In-comes for some Years, to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Their Majesties to secure the whole to us, since whatever it cost us, 'tis but restoring part of what we have saved, or had Restored by their Means.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> Let us not grudge or murmur at the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, or Difficulties, with which we may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to struggle for a few Years. No great Cure was ever perfected without putting the Patient to some pain; and then why should we expect it? Those that saw not what we suffered under the Late Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, may think some things hard at present. But I observe that the People of this Kingdom, that seem to have the greatest Cause to complain, are best satisfied: Which gives us reason to suspect, that if any complain, 'tis rather from their dissatisfaction with the present Government, than their Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Uneasiness.
