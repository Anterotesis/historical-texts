            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE LIFE OF FRANCIS OF <hi>Lorrain, DUKE</hi> of <hi>GUISE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Houſe of <hi>Lorrain</hi> is one of the moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Families of <hi>Europe,</hi> whether we examine its Alliances, or conſider the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:36062:6"/>
number of great Men that are ſprung from thence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claude</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> was the firſt of this Name, who came and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>France,</hi> where he married <hi>Antoinette de Bourbon,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Aunt.</p>
            <p>He was one of the greateſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of his Age; and it was in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him, that King <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt Erected the County of <hi>Guiſe</hi> into a Dutchy, an honour which, till then, had been reſerved only for Princes of the Blood.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Claude</hi> had ſeveral Children, the Eldeſt of whom was <hi>Francis,</hi> whoſe Life we write. He made his firſt Apprentiſhip under his Father, and was in the Army that was ſent to <hi>Therouenne,</hi> under the Conduct of <hi>Anthony</hi> Duke of <hi>Vendoſme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was eaſie to judge then, what he afterwards proved to be. He diſtinguiſhed himſelf from the young Perſons of his Age, by his
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36062:6"/>
Valour, and the vivacity of his Wit; inſomuch, that they already conſidered him as their Chief, and took it for an honour to follow him in all occaſions.</p>
            <p>As that Army was only drawn together to put relief into <hi>Therou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enne, Guiſe</hi> went into the Town by reaſon it was nearer the Enemies than the Camp, and was followed by <hi>Laval, Saint Andre, Dampierre, la Chataigneraye,</hi> and all the young Perſons of Quality in thoſe Troops.</p>
            <p>He was daily out upon Parties, and never returned without ſome conſiderable advantage. In ſhort, he acquired in a little time ſo great a Reputation, that he raiſed a jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, even in the Duke of <hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſme</hi> his General.</p>
            <p>He received two great wounds in his Youth: the firſt at the Siege of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> where he had his Ancle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone ſhot through with a Musquet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullet: and the Second at <hi>Boulogne,</hi> which happened in this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36062:7"/>
               <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt had an Army before <hi>Boulogne,</hi> which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had taken a little before, and though the Siege was not yet formed, there were daily great Skirmiſhes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and them. <hi>Guiſe</hi> being one day gone forth to ſee one that was very warmly diſputed, he obſerved that the <hi>French</hi> were hardly able to reſiſt any longer, and that they were going to be cut in pieces by a Troop of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were coming to charge them in the Flanck. Then without conſidering that he had ſcarce any body with him, he galloped directly towards this laſt Troop, routed thoſe he firſt met with, and put a ſtop to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, leſs by the force of his blows, than the amazement they were in at ſo bold an action.</p>
            <p>But as he valiantly oppoſed their Efforts to give the <hi>French</hi> time to rally. He was ſtruck with a Lance which run into his Head, between his Noſe and right Eye, and which
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36062:7"/>
being broken with the violence of the blow, leſt all the Iron with a piece of the Wood in the wound.</p>
            <p>He was no more ſtunned with this wound, than if he had not felt it: He did not ſo much as loſe his Seat, and returned to the Camp as if he came back from a match of Hunting.</p>
            <p>His Life was long deſpaired of; but at length he was cured, and with that ſucceſs, that his Face was not in the leaſt disfigured by this accident. Which is, perhaps, what made the Hiſtorians of that time, believe that there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing miraculous in that Cure, which ſome attributed to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, others to the misfortune of <hi>France,</hi> according to the different Sentiments they had of <hi>Guiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the Second being come to the Crown; <hi>Guiſe,</hi> in the flower of his Age, ſaw himſelf raiſed at one clap to the higheſt degree of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and ſhared all the Authority
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36062:8"/>
of the Government with the <hi>Conſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> of <hi>Montmorency.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe two Lords had very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently applyed themſelves to the King, even when he was no more than <hi>Dauphin;</hi> but though they ſeemed to be equally in favour of their Maſter, they made their Court to him however, after a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſtable</hi> was very old. He had governed the Kingdom, during ſeveral years under <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt, and had been in four Battels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he had acquired much honour. Thus ſeeing no one above him, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Affairs, or for War, he only thought of maintaining the Peace, that he might enjoy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his Reputation and his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur. He applyed himſelf wholly to his Maſter, but had no regard for any body elſe; and thinking that his fidelity ought to ſerve him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all things, he often diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelf from thoſe little Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſances
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36062:8"/>
that are requiſite to be had for Soveraigns, even when we render them great Services. His Counſels had ever ſomething of that ſeverity, which is ordinary to old Men, and which was natural to him; and they were often contrary to the humour of the Prince, who being young and liberal, loved plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and magnificence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> on the contrary, of the ſame age as his Maſter, and having the ſame inclinations, rendered himſelf uſeful in Affairs of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and agreeable in Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. He performed, to a wonder, all exerciſes of the Body, which the Prince was a paſſionate lover of; and as with a wit ſupple and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all things, he had a ſecret am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition which made him carefully ſeek for all occaſions to pleaſe; he always entertained the King accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his humour. He ſpoke to him at the ſame time of the Siege of a place and the deſign of a Turna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:36062:9"/>
inſomuch that <hi>Henry</hi> finding in one and the ſame Man, what might both contribute to his Glory, and his Pleaſure, was ſo taken with him, as not to be able to be without him.</p>
            <p>Thus we may ſay of <hi>Henry,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> what was ſaid of <hi>Alexander</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of <hi>Craterus</hi> and <hi>Hoepheſtion,</hi> that he honoured the former, but that he loved the other.</p>
            <p>He ſent each of them with an Army of between four and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, to appeaſe a furious Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that was kindled upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Taxes, in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> and the neighbouring Provinces.</p>
            <p>Their Conduct was as different as their humour. The <hi>Conſtable</hi> came to <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> where he left terrible marks of the diſpleaſure of a Prince juſtly irritated. <hi>Guiſe</hi> overrun <hi>Sain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonge, Poitou</hi> and <hi>Aunis.</hi> He paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied all things without uſing vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, preferring the pleaſure of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36062:9"/>
the people return to their Duty, to the glory of having reduced them by the ſeverity of puniſhments; and when he was come back to the King, he moved him to moderate ſeveral too ſevere puniſhments that the <hi>Conſtable</hi> had impoſed upon the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Bourdeaux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Conduct begun from that time to acquire him the affection of the People, which ſo augmented af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that we may ſay it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to exceſs.</p>
            <p>It was then he married <hi>Ann,</hi> Daughter of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> and of <hi>Rence</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> they ſay, that having always affected to paſs for one of the Royal Family, he took the name of <hi>Anjou</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of marriage, which was Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a <hi>Ferrara.</hi> This is moſt certain, that ſeveral Writers of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey making mention of the Duke of <hi>Guiſo,</hi> and of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> his <hi>Brother,</hi> give them the name of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> which they never durſt have
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36062:10"/>
taken in <hi>France,</hi> and which thoſe forreign Authors would never have bethought themſelves of giving them, if they had not made appear that it was pleaſing to them.</p>
            <p>The War being broke out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Emperour;</hi> it ſeemed that Fortune was grown weary of having ſo long favoured <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and that ſhe was willing to repair in the Perſon of <hi>Henry</hi> the injuſtices ſhe had done to <hi>Francis</hi> the Firſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſtable</hi> took in the Cities of <hi>Metz, Toul,</hi> and <hi>Verdun.</hi> This was as the Signal of ſo great a change; and the <hi>Emperour</hi> was ſo lively concerned at this loſs, that from that time he thought of reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the World: but to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear great even in his retreat, he reſolved to ſignalize it by ſome conſiderable exploit that might be as the End and Coronation of all thoſe he had performed during his Reign.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:36062:10"/>
And to that intent he reſolved to recover <hi>Metz,</hi> and neglected no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of all that might aſſure the ſucceſs of ſo important an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>
            <p>He drew together all the Forces he had in <hi>Spain,</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries:</hi> He raiſed all <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> and proteſted to the Princes in his Army, that he would ſooner cauſe himſelf to be interred at the foot of the Walls of the Town, than raiſe the Siege.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> was alarm'd at all theſe preparations; and his oldeſt Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains did not believe that place was able to hold out a Week againſt all the Forces of the <hi>Empire,</hi> with which it was menaced. He choſe <hi>Guiſe</hi> for ſo glorious and ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult an Employ, and gave him by this choice, the greateſt mark he was able to give him of the eſteem he had of his Valour and his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:36062:11"/>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> thereupon departed, after having received his Orders, and paſſing through <hi>Toul,</hi> notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Plague was then in that Town; he cauſed the Fortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be repaired, and gave ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral neceſſary Orders for the ſecurity of the place: in ſhort, he arrived at <hi>Metz</hi> about the end of the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> in the Year, 1552.</p>
            <p>He was received by <hi>Gonnor,</hi> the Governour of the Town, who came to meet him at the head of his Troops, accompanied by the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> the <hi>Vidame de Chartres,</hi> and <hi>Luxembourgh Martigues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Town of <hi>Metz</hi> is watered on the North and Weſt, by the <hi>Moſelle,</hi> which divides it ſelf into two Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the one whereof comes into the Town by the means of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal which brings it thither; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſes by the Walls: the <hi>Seille</hi> does the ſame on the Eaſt and South. Thus it is almoſt wholly included be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Rivers, if you except
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36062:11"/>
that part which is between the South and Weſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> having viſited the place, found it unprovided of all that was neceſſary for the ſupporting a great Siege. This Town having been long lulled aſleep in a profound Peace, there was hardly any thing that reliſhed of War. Its compaſs being between eight and nine thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Paces, was only guarded by a ſingle Wall, without a rampart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, and by conſequence incapable of reſiſting the leaſt efforts of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; the Moats were partly crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and partly taken up with the buildings of private Perſons. In ſhort, nothing was ſeen but Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, and Houſes of pleaſure, in places where nothing ought to have been ſeen beſides Baſtions and Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moons: The Granaries almoſt emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Gunpowder forty years old, and in a very ſmall quantity; very little Artillery, and for the moſt part ſo ill caſt, that it was hardly
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36062:12"/>
fit to be made uſe of. The Harveſt being then gathering in, and the Vintages going to begin, had cauſed all the labouring people to leave the Town, and there was hardly left for the carrying of Earth, any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Women and little Children.</p>
            <p>However, an extraordinary dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence was requiſite for the repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all theſe defects before the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> came. They begun with beating down the Houſes that were upon the Town Walls, and which took up the place of the Rampart: They ruined the Gardens and the Buildings in the Suburbs, that might have been ſerviceable to the Imperialiſts: Inſomuch, that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome days, <hi>Metz</hi> had rather the air of a City that was in the power of its Enemies, than of a Town that prepared to repulſe them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> knew ſo well how to gain in that occaſion the hearts of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, by his ſweetneſs of beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:36062:12"/>
an eloquence, that was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him, that thoſe perſons whoſe houſes were taken down were ſo far from complaining, that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves helped the Souldiers; and preferring the publick good to their private intereſts, they willingly bore with, for the defending their Town, the ſame dammages they might have been affraid of, in caſe it had been taken. <hi>Guiſe</hi> was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where himſelf, ordering all, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Works, haſtening the Labourers, and eating with them at the Carriages, to ſave the time that would have been ſpent in going to his own Houſe: He himſelf would needs carry the Doſſer for ſome hours every day; and thus having, as we may ſay, rendered this Trade noble by his example, there was not one but took a pride in it: Inſomuch, that in a ſhort time the Works were in a much greater forwardneſs than they durſt have hoped they could have been
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:36062:13"/>
with a greater number of hands. Not but that <hi>Guiſe</hi> knew well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that it was almoſt impoſſible to put the Town in a poſture of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence: He even told his particular Friends, that he obſerved ſeveral very dangerous places, which the ingenious did not take notice of; but that it was to no purpoſe to ſpeak of them, at a time when they could not be repaired, and that it would only help to make them known. He ſpared neither Cares, nor his Money, nor the Benefices of his Brother, which were not far diſtant, and ordered his ouſineſs ſo well, that in a ſhort time there was Ammunition enough in the City for the maintaining a Siege of a whole year.</p>
            <p>He likewiſe made proviſion of a great number of Gabions, Beams, Sheds of Boards, Sacks full of Wool and of Earth, that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſupply what ſhould be wanting to the Fortifications, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:36062:13"/>
in a poſture of defending the Breaches.</p>
            <p>There was in the Suburbs a great number of Churches, which might have ſerved the Beſiegers for a Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to plant their Cannon. <hi>Guiſe</hi> cauſed ſome of them to be taken down, and contented himſelf with propping the others, by having Beams put in place of the Pillars, which ſupported the Vaults, that it might be eaſie upon occaſion, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to re-eſtabliſh them by raiſing up the Pillars that had been taken down, or overturn them by ſetting fire to the ſupporters of Wood; as they were conſtrained to do fifteen days after.</p>
            <p>But there was neceſſity of ruining entirely the Abbey of St. <hi>Arnould,</hi> which commanded a whole Quarter of the City. It was conſiderable both for its Antiquity, and the Tombs of a great number of Princes of the Family of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> from whom <hi>Guiſe</hi> boaſted that he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:36062:14"/>
He cauſed their Bodies to be removed into the City, with the Relicks and the ſacred Veſſels, having ordered for that end a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral proceſſion, at which he aſſiſted bareheaded, and with a Flambeau in his hand, as making a kind of repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the diſorders which the War obliged him to againſt his will, and for appeaſing the people, who never ſuffer without regret the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of thoſe great Edifices, which they look upon as marks of Nobility and Grandeur. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards put out of the Town all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Perſons, permitting thoſe who went away, either to carry with them their moveables, or to leave them with an Inventory, which he charged himſelf with the render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an account of at the end of the Siege. He ſuffered the Souldiers to have neither Horſes nor Servants, but what they had abſolutely an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for; forbidding any one to lay hand to Sword for private quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:36062:14"/>
upon pain of having their hands cut off.</p>
            <p>After having ſpent the day in giving orders, and cauſing them to be put in execution, he employed what time he had left, in exerciſing the twelve Companies of Foot he had found in the City, and who had not yet bore Arms.</p>
            <p>But theſe were not the only cares he was poſſeſſed with. <hi>Albert Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſſe</hi> of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> was near <hi>Metz</hi> with an Army of twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, chaffering between the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>King,</hi> and ready to ſide with them who ſhould offer him moſt, or, to ſpeak more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, waiting for an occaſion of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf uſeful to one or other of the two Parties. Thus <hi>Guiſe</hi> was obliged to live in appearance with him, as with a Prince who gave Teſtimonies of his being for the Kings Intereſts, and who indeed might have been very uſeful to him; but at the bottom he diſtruſted him
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36062:15"/>
as a Traytor, who only waited for an opportunity to ſeize the Town, and ſell it very dear to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed he made ſeveral Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which only tended to that end; ſometimes making ridiculous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as when he made a propoſal to <hi>Guiſe</hi> of coming out of the Town to confer with him, ſometimes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch complaints as there was no ground for, and in which it was impoſſible to give him ſatisfaction. But <hi>Guiſe</hi> knowing the man he had to do with, and the reaſons there were to manage him; he governed himſelf ſo dexteroufly, ſometimes granting one thing, and ſometimes not ſeeming to ſee others, that he broke all his meaſures, without gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the leaſt reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
            <p>In the mean while the <hi>Emperours</hi> Army approached, which <hi>Guiſe</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had notice of, he recalled his Cavalry, which he had left till then
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36062:15"/>
in the gathering in of the Harveſt, and to ſpare the Proviſions of the Town: He ordered them to break down all the Mills that were in the Emperours way, and to burn all the Amunition that they were not able to bring along with them.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> came with fourteen thouſand men within half a League of the Town to view it. <hi>Guiſe</hi> knowing of what importance it is to a Commander, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings of a great Enterprize, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire his Souldiers with a contempt of the Enemies, and the Enemies with a dread of his Souldiers, cauſed <hi>Strozzy</hi> to ſally out with a ſmall number of choſen men. The Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh laſted longer than was expected. <hi>Strozzy</hi> withſtood the effort of the Enemies, who were relieved three ſeveral times; and after having killed two hundred of their men, he returned to the Town, having loſt but five of his.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:36062:16"/>
On the morrow <hi>Guiſe</hi> received a Letter from <hi>Lewis d' Avila</hi> General of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cavalry. He rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him a Slave who had made his eſcape into the Town, with a Horſe of great value that he had ſtoln from his Maſter. <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſent him back the Horſe, after having payed for him to the man whoſe Houſe he had found him at; but as for the Slave, he made anſwer, he ſhould never think of ſending back a man who was become free by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foot upon the Territories of <hi>France,</hi> nor violate the moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous priviledge of the Kingdom, which conſiſts in reſtoring all thoſe to their liberty who come to ſeek it there.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> having ſent thrice to <hi>Marqueſs Albert</hi> to treat of an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation with him, and receiving only general anſwers, and which ſignified nothing, he begun to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as an Enemy. This hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Troops and Artillery from
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36062:16"/>
paſſing to <hi>Metz,</hi> that were to be ſent thither, by reaſon he was poſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the way.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Holſtein</hi> was already before the Town with <hi>Aiguemont</hi> and <hi>Brabanſon,</hi> who had brought an Army from the Low Countries: His Quarters were at the <hi>Mount de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillon;</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alva</hi> with his poſſeſſed the <hi>Abby</hi> of St. <hi>Arnould: Albert,</hi> after having defeated the Forces of the <hi>Marqueſs a' Aumale,</hi> who had attacked him indiſcreetly, and having taken <hi>D' Aumale</hi> himſelf Priſoner, made without difficulty his Treaty with the Emperour, and quitting the white Scarf for the red, he came and encamped at the Mount St. <hi>Martin</hi> with all his Troops. Thus <hi>Guiſe,</hi> having only a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men in a great and ill fortified Town, ſaw himſelf beſieged by three Armies that mounted to above a hundred thouſand Foot, twenty three thouſand Horſe, a hundred and twenty pieces of Cannon, and ſeven thouſand Pioneers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:36062:17"/>
The truth is, that he reckoned much more upon thoſe he had with him, than he ſhould have done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a much greater number. The rumour of this Siege, and the glory that was there to be acquired, had drawn ſeveral Volunteers, and all the conſiderable Perſons of Quality in the Kingdom. There were three Princes of the Blood, <hi>Anguien</hi> and <hi>Conde,</hi> Brothers to the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> and <hi>Charles de la Roche-yon</hi> their Couſin; the <hi>Grand Priour of France,</hi> the <hi>Marqueſs d'Elborut; Guiſes</hi> his Brother, <hi>James of Savoy, Duke of Nemours, Francis of Vendoſme, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame of Chartes, Montmorency,</hi> and <hi>Danville,</hi> the <hi>Conſtable</hi>'s Sons <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race Farneze, Duke of Caſtre,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others whoſe names are found in particular Relations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> was not ignorant what he might expect from ſo many brave men; but he knew likewiſe very well how difficult it is to rule Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers, who uſually thinking how to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36062:17"/>
make appear their valour, pretend to ſerve after their own mode, will be in all places, and almoſt ever render themſelves uſeleſs by their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-eagerneſs for too great perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances. Wherefore he ſhared the Compaſs of the Walls amongſt all the Princes and Lords in the Town: He made them agree that every one ſhould keep the Poſt that ſhould be allotted him, without undertaking to be in other places; and ordered, that all the Volunteers ſhould chuſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, wherein they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duty of Souldiers, obeying their Captains, and doing nothing but by their orders, upon pain of being put out of the Town.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Emperour</hi> having made ſome ſtay at <hi>Thionville,</hi> at length arrived at his Camp, and had his quarters in the Caſtle of <hi>Lorgne,</hi> behind the Abby of <hi>Saint Arnoul:</hi> His preſence having redoubled the ardour of his men, and after all his Artillery ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been planted, they battered the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36062:18"/>
Town after the moſt furious manner that was ever heard of. They fired in one day alone, forty thouſand Shots of Cannon, againſt that part of the Wall that is between the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form of St. <hi>Mary,</hi> and the Gate of <hi>Champagn.</hi> This horrible Tempeſt continued for ſeveral days with the ſame fury, and with ſo great a noiſe, that Hiſtorians do aſſure, that it was heard forty Leagues from the Town.</p>
            <p>The Beſieged did oppoſe ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent efforts with an invincible cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and a continual labour; Men and Women, Souldiers and Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens being equally animated by the example of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing below him, but ſpent Days and Nights in carrying Earth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Ruines the Artillery had made, and to prevent thoſe it might make. At length the Tower of St. <hi>Michel,</hi> and that of <hi>Lignieres,</hi> not having been able to reſiſt the fury of the Cannon, were beaten to Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36062:18"/>
That of <hi>Vaſſieux</hi> was almoſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ruined; and in a few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the whole Pan of the Wall that was between thoſe two Towers, of about a hundred and twenty paces in length, was overturned into the Falſe-bray.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>French</hi> not being of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to ſpend their time in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves againſt Cannon Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, and repairing Breaches, cauſed Sallies to be daily made; and more Beſiegers than beſieged, they went to ſeek out their Enemies in their very Tents.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> himſelf choſe thoſe who were to ſally out every day; he ſtayed at the Gate with a body of reſerve to ſecond them, in caſe they were too much preſſed: and when they returned, he received them with that ſweetneſs, which is ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable in perſons who are raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, and gave them Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, which both recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and augmented their valour.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36062:19"/>
And indeed this Conduct made his Men do things that are hardly credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. A Serjeant was ſeen with his Halbert, and followed only by five or ſix Souldiers, to clear a Trench, and drive from thence above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Men: others went and nailed the Artillery, after having killed the Cannoneers upon their very Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons. An infinite number of ſuch like actions may be ſeen in the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that <hi>Salignac</hi> has given of that Siege.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> from thence concluded, that the <hi>Emperour</hi> would not eaſily become Maſter of the Town. He wrote to the King, whom this Siege put in pain, that his Majeſty might turn his Arms where he pleaſed, and that he undertook to defend <hi>Metz</hi> ten Months entire. The <hi>King</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received this News, cauſed his Army to march into <hi>Picardy,</hi> when he very luckily recovered <hi>Heſdin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:36062:19"/>
The <hi>Emperours</hi> Army had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready two Months before <hi>Metz</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing, and were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly able to reſiſt any longer againſt the rigour of the Winter, againſt Famine, and the diſeaſes the Camp was full of, and the continual Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the beſieged.</p>
            <p>This Prince ſeeing that the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of his Men did daily diminiſh with their ſtrength; that there was a vaſt number whom miſery and cold had rendered uncapable of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; and that of thoſe who were ſick, ſome quitted the Camp, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers threatned to leave it: He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to try at length a general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault; The breach was ſufficiently great, and the Souldiers cryed day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that they might be led to it, rather than ſuffer them to periſh thus miſerably by hunger and cold.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> being informed of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and ſeeing the Enemies were ranging in Battle, he on his ſide pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive them. He gave
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36062:20"/>
his Orders with that chearfulneſs which is ſo neceſſary for inſpiring courage into Souldiers, who being not for the moſt part capable to judg of things by themſelves, ſeek in the looks of their Commander for what they are to hope or fear from the ſucceſs of an enterprize. He was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaying ſomething that was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging to all thoſe he met with, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times commending the valour of ſome, and then again, promiſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence to others. In ſhort, all the brave Men in the Town being aſſembled upon the Rampart, <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſhewing them that long ſpace of Wall that was battered down, and through which the Enemies were preparing to mount; <hi>I am over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, Gentlemen,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to ſee that the Enemies have at length o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturned that</hi> Barrier <hi>which put a ſtop to your Courage, and which was more uſeful to them than to us. It is very juſt, that after you had been ſo often to ſeek them out in their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36062:20"/>
Camp, they ſhould at leaſt come once, and take a view of this City, which they boaſted they would ſo eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conquer. Here is now an occaſion of acquiring the Glory, which they will not often offer to you. Take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, Gentlemen, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint all</hi> Europe, <hi>that have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Eyes upon you, that it has not been impoſſible for a ſmall number of</hi> French-men, <hi>to put a ſtop to an Emperour who beſieged them with three Armies, who vaunted that the Pillars of</hi> Hercules <hi>were not capable to put a ſtop to his Career.</hi> In the mean time the <hi>Emperour</hi> caus'd his Souldiers to advance; but they had no ſooner perceived the <hi>French</hi> in the Breach, and <hi>Guiſe</hi> at the head of them, than that they gave back, as if the <hi>French</hi> were coming to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque them. It was to no purpoſe he joyn'd Prayers to threatnings; it was not in his Power to make Soldiers advance that were trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and full of all they had ſeen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36062:21"/>
during the Siege: they were fain to carry the <hi>Emperour</hi> back to his Tents, out-raged with grief, and crying that he was aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and had no longer any Men about him.</p>
            <p>This enterprize having had ſuch ill ſucceſs, he had nothing left, but the deſpair of being obliged to raiſe the Siege. Famine, Cold, Diſeaſes, and the continual Salies of the Beſieged, had cauſed above a third part of his Army to periſh. The reſt could not be ſaved other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by a Retreat, which he was forced to reſolve of, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Oaths he had made of taking the Town. It was then he was heard to ſay, That Fortune abandoned him to run to his Rival, who was younger than he.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, never was a more ſhameful Retreat ſeen. The <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,</hi> who, it may be ſaid, made his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36062:21"/>
eſcape to <hi>Thionville,</hi> had before his departure the vexation of ſeeing thoſe he beſieged come and kill his Soldiers in the very ſight of his Quarters. The Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged in the Night, without beat of Drum, leaving all the Ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Camp, and all the Tents ſtanding. <hi>Guiſe</hi> having cauſed four pieces of Canon to be brought into a little Iſland, he pointed them againſt the Tents of <hi>Albert,</hi> and quickly commanded him to follow the reſt.</p>
            <p>The Beſieged did not fail to ſally out after them; but their Fury was quickly changed into Compaſſion: They found in the Camp that was newly abandoned, all they could have found moſt dreadful in a Field of Battle, where a great Army had been cut to pieces, a horrible mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of diſeaſed and wounded; the Earth covered with the Dead, and dying, weltring upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the dirt; the Bodies of thoſe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36062:22"/>
they had buried, lying half out of the Earth, with which they were ill-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Thoſe who were retreated were not in a much better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moſt of them caſt away their Arms, as not having ſtrength to carry them any longer, and being hardly able to ſupport themſelves.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Roche-ſur-Yon</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving overtaken ſome Troops of <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Cavalry, and offering to fight them, their Commander turning towards him, How do you think, ſaid he to him, we ſhould have Force to fight? You ſee that we have not enough left to run away from you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> made appear as much Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in this occaſion, as he had ſhewn Valour and Conduct, during the Siege. He gave orders for the Burial of the Dead that were in the Camp. He cauſed the Sick to be brought into the Town, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving diſtributed them into Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, he appointed Money to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36062:22"/>
them for their return home, when they were recovered.</p>
            <p>He ſent back to the Duke of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> all ſuch of his Domeſticks as were Priſoners, and offered him as many covered Boats as he ſhould have occaſion of, for the carrying his Sick to <hi>Thionville.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſtayed the <hi>Emperour</hi> three Months before a Town, that did not ſeem to be in a poſture of reſiſting one moment, againſt all Forces, with which it was attacqued. He gave ſuch good Orders, during the whole Siege, that the Enemies durſt never mount to the Aſſault, though the Place was but imperfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified: While that with a ſmall number of Men, he daily made Sallies, which did more da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to <hi>Charles</hi> his Army, than the loſs of a Battle could have done.</p>
            <p>He appointed a general Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the rendring thanks to God; and to compleat that Ceremony by, as he would have it, an agreeable
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36062:23"/>
Sacrifice, he cauſed all ſuch of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> Books as were found in the Town, to be publickly burnt. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he recalled the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants who had abſented themſelves during the Siege, and re-eſtabliſhed the uſuall Policy: and having, as well as he could, made amends to thoſe who had ſuffered any damages, he returned to Court.</p>
            <p>The following Year the King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving over-run the Low Countries with an Army of Fifty thouſand men, uſed all poſſible means to come to a Battle, before the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> Army ſhould be ſtrengthened by the Succours that were coming to him from <hi>Germany.</hi> He beſieged the Caſtle at <hi>Renty,</hi> concluding that the <hi>Emperour</hi> not being far diſtant, would run immediately to raiſe the Siege. He was not miſtaken in that Conjecture. <hi>Guiſe</hi> went to view the Town, and had like to have been killed by a Muſquet Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, which pierced his Cloaths;
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36062:23"/>
and the <hi>Emperour</hi> being come to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp within a League of the Town, the <hi>French</hi> reſolved to take the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of an opportunity they had ſo long waited for.</p>
            <p>The two Armies were ſeparated only by a Hill, which concealed them from one another. Upon this Hill there was a Wood, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Party had yet poſſeſſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of; notwithſtanding that it was extreamly neceſſary to them both: but it was principally to the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> whoſe Artillery might have incommoded extreamly the <hi>French Kings</hi> Army in the Valley at the bottom of this Hill, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further trouble would have obliged him to have raiſed the Siege.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> making no doubt but that the <hi>Emperour</hi> would ſend men to take in that Poſt, cauſed three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Harquebuſiers, whom he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had choſen out, to be conceal'd there, and placed ſome Corſebiteers before the Wood on the Enemies
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36062:24"/>
ſide, that he might the more eaſily draw them into the Ambuſcade, by Retreating when they ſhould be Attacqued.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> fell into the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade, and were repulſed with a very great loſs; but the <hi>Emperour</hi> hearing the noiſe of the Artillery, with which the Caſtle was continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally battered, reſolved to make an Effort for the ſecuring it, and to hazzard all for the driving the <hi>French</hi> from their Poſt.</p>
            <p>He drew up his Army in <hi>Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> and ſent two thouſand Horſe, four ſmall Field-pieces, and four thouſand Harquebuſiers, to diſ-lodge thoſe who were in the Woods.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> advanced to ſecond them with ſome Troops of Horſe, while that the King, to whom he had cauſed notice to be given, did him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf diſpoſe and prepare his Army for the Fight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> cauſed his Harquebuſiers to retire, and Retreated himſelf by little
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36062:24"/>
and little, that he might oblige the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> to traverſe the Wood, and draw them into a little Plain, which was on the other ſide of the Hill, and near the <hi>French</hi> King's Quarters. They took this Retreat for a Flight, and no longer doubted of the Victory. <hi>Gonzagues</hi> ſent word to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> that he ſhould cauſe his Army to march in all haſte, and that the Vanguard of the <hi>French</hi> was put to rout. All the <hi>Imperial</hi> Army advanced imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, with four ſmall pieces of Cannon, which were called the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours Piſtols, becauſe they were mounted upon four Wheels, and were eaſily turned on all ſides.</p>
            <p>The firſt Battalions of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies already appeared out of the Woods, and fired upon thoſe of the <hi>French</hi> Army, when that <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſeeing-them at length where he wiſhed them, came to the Head of his Regiment, that was moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in the Plain, and gave the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36062:25"/>
Signal to the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> to begin the Charge. This firſt At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque was very furious, and the <hi>French</hi> were ſharpely repulſed with the loſs of ſeveral Officers. But <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>Nevers</hi> having rallied their Troops, and being ſeconded by all the Light Cavalry, commanded by <hi>d' Aumalle,</hi> they routed the firſt Battalion of the <hi>Germans:</hi> And the Duke of <hi>Nevers</hi> with his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment falling then upon, the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Harquebuſiers, who were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reſiſt him, all the Enemies Army was put to rout. The Count of <hi>Vulfenfourt</hi> was obliged to fly as well as the reſt; though he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to tread the <hi>French Gendarmes</hi> under Feet, with two thouſand Rheiſtres, or <hi>German</hi> Horſe he Commanded; and who to appear the more terrible, had horribly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured their Faces with black. The <hi>French</hi> gain'd in that Battle ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen <hi>Enſignes</hi> Colours, five <hi>Cornets,</hi> and the four Field-Pieces that were
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36062:25"/>
brought into the Wood, and the <hi>Emperours</hi> Piſtols. About two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men were ſlain on their ſide, and two thouſand on the Enemies.</p>
            <p>However, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> if we may believe the Count of <hi>Rocca,</hi> who has written the Hiſtory of <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, imagined ſome time after that it was they who had gained the Victory; inſomuch that <hi>Don Lewis d' Avila</hi> diſtruſting, perhaps, the Teſtimony that the Hiſtorians give thereof, cauſed that Battle to be painted in his Country-Houſe, where the <hi>French</hi> were ſeen flying from their Enemies: And that <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, through a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty which the Author of his Hiſtory does not ſail to commend him for, was of Opinion the Piece ſhould be reformed, and that they ſhould draw the <hi>French</hi> making a Retreat; becauſe, ſaid he, it was rather an honourable Retreat, than a ſhameful Flight.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:36062:26"/>
That day gave Birth to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred that broke out afterwards, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Guiſe</hi> and Admiral <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> and which has had ſuch fatal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. Theſe two Lords had been ſuch Friends, during their Youth, as that they were not able to live without one another, wearing the ſame Colours, and dreſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves after the ſame manner. This ardour begun to cool, and <hi>Guiſe</hi> complained, that the Admiral had given him inſincere Connſels, in an affair of importance. The <hi>Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> whether through Reſentment or Envy, reported after the Battle, that <hi>Guiſe</hi> was not to be found where he ought to have been, during the Fight. They thereupon quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled in the Kings Chamber, who commanded them to embrace, and be as good Friends as formerly: but theſe kind of Injuries are never forgotten, nor are they ever par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:36062:26"/>
In the mean time a Truce was made for five years, between the <hi>Emperour</hi> and the <hi>King.</hi> But <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Caraffa</hi> would not ſuffer it to laſt long. This turbulent and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Man, being ſhock'd with all that had an appearance of Peace, reported every where, that the <hi>King</hi> could not make an agreement, having an offenſive and defenſive League with his Unkle. He came <hi>Legate</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> and made ſo much noiſe againſt the Truce, that he made the King reſolve to break it.</p>
            <p>The Council were in no wiſe for this Rupture; neither was it on that ſide that the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had made his Cabal. He gained the fair Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſs of <hi>Valentinois,</hi> by his Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and the fine preſents he made her from the <hi>Pope</hi> and himſelf. She perſwaded the <hi>King</hi> to War, both out of acknowledgment to the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> and that <hi>Guiſe</hi> might have the Command of the Armies, with
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:36062:27"/>
whom ſhe had contracted a great Friendſhip. <hi>Caraffa</hi> aſſured him of the Conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples,</hi> which the <hi>Pope</hi> promiſed him the Inveſtiture of, and to which all thoſe of the Houſe of <hi>Lorrain</hi> have always had pretentions. <hi>Guiſe</hi> being naturally ambitious, ſuffered himſelf to be eaſily flattered with the hopes of a Crown; and he was likewiſe drawn in by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> his Brother, for whom he had ever too much deference. This was a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Man, and to whom nothing appeared difficult; hold to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take all things indifferently; and often abuſed the Authority of his Brother, that he might bring his own deſigns to paſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> not knowing how to deny the Dutcheſs, ſent only for form ſake to the <hi>Emperour,</hi> and to <hi>Philip</hi> his Son, who was then King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to exhort them to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw their Troops out of the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:36062:27"/>
of the Holy See. This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was received as a Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of War; and <hi>Guiſe</hi> full of great hopes, marched into <hi>Italy,</hi> at the Head of fifteen thouſand Men.</p>
            <p>He was looked upon as one of the greateſt Generals of his Age, and beloved as the moſt Civil, beſt Bred Perſon of Quality at Court. Thus almoſt all the Nobility of <hi>France</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him in this expedition; ſome to learn their Trade under ſo great a Maſter; others to acquire Glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Commander, who being ſure of his own, bore no envy to that of his Souldiers.</p>
            <p>It is in this occaſion that it muſt be confeſſed, that all the times of the Lives of great Men are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like; for it is certain that <hi>Guiſe</hi> did not perform, in that War, all that was expected from him, whether he had not the Succours he ought to have had, or that he was ſo happy, as not to be able to ſucceed in a War that appeared manifeſtly unjuſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:36062:28"/>
He immediately attacqued the City of <hi>Valenza,</hi> which he took without difficulty, and made but a kind of ſorry anſwer to the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> Lieutenant, in the Land of <hi>Milan,</hi> who complained of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of the Truce.</p>
            <p>After the taking of <hi>Valenza,</hi> the Council of War was of Opinion, that advantage ſhould be taken of the general Conſternation, and of the want of Men at that time in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi> It is certain, that <hi>Guiſe</hi> might eaſily have conquered it: But he would never be perſwaded to ſtay, notwithſtanding the remonſtrances that were made him; whether, as he ſaid, he had moſt expreſs Orders to march on, or that the Idea of the Conqueſt of the Kingdom of <hi>Naples</hi> did not permit him to think of any thing elſe. Perhaps, one of the Reaſons that made him paſs on ſo faſt, was the fear of being obliged to yield the Command to the Duke of <hi>Ferrara,</hi> his Father in Law, who
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:36062:28"/>
in the League that was made with the Pope, was nominated <hi>Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſſimo</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> Armies in <hi>Italy.</hi> For he knew very well, that this Prince, having Reaſons not to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf from his Dominions, would never think of following the Army as far as <hi>Naples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereupon he came to <hi>Bologne,</hi> where he neither found the Forces, nor the Ammunition they had given him hopes of. He made great Complaints thereof to <hi>Caraffa,</hi> who ſatisfied him with ill Reaſons, and Promiſes that had no effect; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had already made his Acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation under-hand with the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> as ſeveral perſons have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; or that he was a turbulent Man, who made it his buſineſs to breed Quarrels, and never troubled himſelf how to weather them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> having ſent his Army to <hi>Geſi,</hi> came to <hi>Rome</hi> to pay his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the <hi>Pope;</hi> he ſtayed there near a Month, to wait perhaps,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36062:29"/>
and ſollicite for the Succours that were promiſed him; but no Body did approve of this ſtay. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed though he could not have been reproached with leaving the Kings Forces uſeleſs, through his negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence; it was not very honourable to <hi>France</hi> to ſee a General that is ſent to be at the head of it's Armies, ſtay a whole Month amongſt Monks, and have the loweſt place at a Table of Cardinals. Upon which account there runs a Story of a Maſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of his Train, who went and placed himſelf below him, without being invited, that he might pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, ſaid he, a General of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the King of <hi>France</hi> from ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the loweſt place at Table.</p>
            <p>Some were of opinion that he ſtayed at <hi>Rome</hi> to ſecure the <hi>Pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> to his Brother, in caſe it ſhould come to be vacant. Whatſoever the reaſon was, being returned to his Army, he beſieged <hi>Civitella,</hi> and was obliged to raiſe the Siege after
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36062:29"/>
having ſtayed there three Weeks. He was likewiſe vigorouſly repulſed at an Aſſault he made, wherein he loſt above two hundred Men.</p>
            <p>The famous Battle of Saint <hi>Quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> having brought <hi>France</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an Ace of its Ruin, <hi>Guiſe</hi> was recalled in all haſte, and he joyful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly quitted a Country where he met with no ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Never was Man received with a more general Applauſe. The King did him the Honour to tell him, that he was returned for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Kingdom: The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who uſually are as eaſily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted as they are afflicted, forgot at the ſight of him the misfortune that had occaſioned his coming back; and thoſe who two days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did not think themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure in the midſt of <hi>Paris,</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing more than to be led forth againſt the Enemy.</p>
            <p>It was propoſed that <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſhould be made <hi>Vice-Roy:</hi> but this Title be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36062:30"/>
new, and almoſt unknown in <hi>France,</hi> he was nominated Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant General of the Kings Armies, within and without the Kingdom; and the Letters were verified in all the Parliaments.</p>
            <p>Though it was then the midſt of Winter, it was thought important, for the Glory and Security of the Kingdom, to make ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enterprize.</p>
            <p>It was not thought fit to go to Saint <hi>Quentin,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had fortified, and the ſight of which would only have ſerved to abate the Courage of the Souldiers, by renewing the remembrance of their defeat.</p>
            <p>The reſolution having thereupon been taken in the Council, the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Nevers,</hi> with one part of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, marched towards <hi>Campagne,</hi> giving out that he was going to take <hi>Luxembourg</hi> and <hi>Arlon. Guiſe</hi> came into <hi>Picardy,</hi> under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of guarding the Frontier: after
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36062:30"/>
which he advanced, as if he deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to go re-inforce the Garriſons of <hi>Ardres,</hi> and of <hi>Bologne;</hi> and at length, the Forces of the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> having joyned him after great days Journeys, he cauſed his Army to march with incredible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and came on the firſt of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> before <hi>Calice,</hi> where he was not expected.</p>
            <p>This Town did at that time belong to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but it was looked upon as the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Spain</hi> wore then the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> having married <hi>Mary</hi> the Queen at that time.</p>
            <p>The place is defended on one ſide by the Sea, and on the other by deep Marſhes, and by a River which almoſt wholly environs it.</p>
            <p>Thus on the Land ſide you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approach it, but by a Ditch which is guarded by the Fort of <hi>Nieulay;</hi> and on the Sea ſide it has the Fort of <hi>Risban,</hi> which abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36062:31"/>
Commands all the Port, and which can hinder all Ships, both great and ſmall, from coming in.</p>
            <p>The ſucceſs of this enterprize conſiſted in diligence. <hi>Guiſe</hi> cauſed the two Forts to be Attacqued, and took them both in one day: after which, having raiſed a Battery a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that part of the Town which is called the Water-gate, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to Fire upon the Fortifications, as if he would have made his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Attacque on that ſide: But the Enemies thinking they had only that part to defend, were much aſtoniſhed to ſee in an inſtant fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen pieces of Canon pointed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Caſtle, that was only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed by a ſimple Wall without Ramparts. The noiſe of the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery was ſo great, that it was heard as far as <hi>Antwerp;</hi> but it was not a noiſe to no purpoſe; for the ſame Evening the Breach was great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to amount to the Aſſault.</p>

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:36062:31"/>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> having cauſed <hi>Grammont</hi> to advance with three thouſand cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen Harquebuſiers, to hinder the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies from Re-trenching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the Breach; he cauſed fifteen hundred Souldiers to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Port, under the Conduct of <hi>Dandelot,</hi> with order to ſink a Trench, and afterwards a Traverſe, which anſwered to the Canal of the Ditch they broke: and the Waters being emptied to the height of the Traverſe, <hi>Guiſe</hi> paſſed through the Water to the middle at the head of his Souldiers; and notwithſtanding the obſtinate reſiſtance of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, he became Maſter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, whither the <hi>Engliſh</hi> brought him the Keys of the Town the next day, and received the Conditions he thought fit to impoſe upon them.</p>
            <p>Thus was that Town taken in leſs than ten days, which the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> had held for two hundred and ten years. They took it in the Reign of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36062:32"/>
               <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> in the year 1347. though it was not fortified at that time: the Siege laſted a whole year; and <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Vienna,</hi> who Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded there for the King, did not deliver it up till that he ſaw his Souldiers half dead of Hunger, and that they were no longer able to bear their Arms. But ſince that time, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had fortified it after ſuch a manner, as that it paſſed for impregnable, and for this reaſon the <hi>French</hi> had been ſo long without daring to undertake to drive them from thence.</p>
            <p>He afterwards took, with the ſame Rapidity, the Town of <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,</hi> and that of <hi>Hames:</hi> He made himſelf Maſter of all the County of <hi>Oye,</hi> and in leſs than a Month drove the <hi>Engliſh</hi> out of <hi>France,</hi> after their having been ſettled there for two Ages, without the <hi>French</hi> being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to force them thence.</p>
            <p>The year after he beſieged <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onville,</hi> with the Duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:36062:32"/>
This place was taken with a great deal of pain; and <hi>Guiſe</hi> had like to have been killed there, by a Cannon Shot, which took away Marſhal <hi>Strozzy,</hi> upon whoſe Shoulder he was leaning.</p>
            <p>But while that his Army, after the taking of <hi>Thionville,</hi> ſpent their time in ſeeing the little City of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> on Fire, which the Enemies had abandoned, and in making Skirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes near <hi>Luxemburg,</hi> they received news of the defeat of <hi>Thermes,</hi> whoſe Troops had been cut in pieces by the <hi>Count d' Aiguemont</hi> in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Gravelines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This loſs had like to have ruined <hi>France.</hi> Some have laid the fault upon <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it by joyning with <hi>Thermes</hi> as ſoon as the Siege was at an end. They likewiſe ſay, that it was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in the Kings Council. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there might be ſome neglect on his ſide. But I cannot believe what a famous Author ſays, that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36062:33"/>
this delay to give occaſion to this defeat, which he looked upon as the augmentation of his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>There was a great number of <hi>Rhei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtres,</hi> or <hi>German</hi> Troopers, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of whom the Baron of <hi>Lunebourg</hi> was one of the principal Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. As <hi>Guiſe</hi> was one day viſiting the Camp, that <hi>German,</hi> who was brave and violent, and in whom Wine had that day augmented his natural fierceneſs, fell into ſuch a paſſion againſt <hi>Guiſe,</hi> as to offer to fire at him. <hi>Guiſe</hi> having drawn his Sword without being concerned, ſtruck his Piſtol out of his hand; and ſeeing that <hi>Montpeſat</hi> was going to kill that inſolent Man, <hi>Hold, Montpeſat,</hi> cryed he to him, <hi>you know not how to kill a man better than I do. I could kill him, if I had a mind. I pardon thee,</hi> ſaid he to the <hi>Baron, the Injury thou haſt done me; I might have revenged my ſelf: but as for that which thou haſt done to
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36062:33"/>
the King, whoſe Perſon I here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is for him to do what Juſtice he ſhall think fit.</hi> And taking him immediatly by the Belt, he ſent him to Priſon, and proceeded to viſit the Camp, with a hundred Horſe, not one of the <hi>Rheiſtres</hi> daring to ſtir, though they are naturally mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous and ſeditious.</p>
            <p>The Marriage of the <hi>Dauphin</hi> with <hi>Mary Steward,</hi> which was celebrated towards the end of the War, had raiſed <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was Uncle to the <hi>Dauphineſs,</hi> above all others in the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>It was he, who at the Ceremony of the Nuptials, had performed the Office of <hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> in the <hi>Conſtables</hi> abſence, who was taken Priſoner at the Battle of Saint <hi>Quentin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Peace was made, and the <hi>Conſtable</hi> returned; and <hi>Guiſe</hi> being become leſs neceſſary, quickly ſaw the favour he was in diminiſhed. He had rendered great Services to
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36062:34"/>
his Maſter, but he affected too much to make him ſenſible of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of them: and <hi>Soveraigns</hi> make little difference between the Injuries and the Services that are valued to them at too high a rate. And indeed, <hi>Guiſe</hi> believing that nothing could be refuſed to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, had had the boldneſs to demand of the King the Charge of <hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> which the <hi>Conſtable</hi> was poſſeſſed of. The King refuſed it him, however, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Counſel that <hi>Francis the Firſt</hi> had given him, as he lay a dying; which was, <hi>to be diffident of the natural Ambition of the</hi> Guiſes, <hi>and to remove them from the Government, that otherwiſe their their riſe would be the fall of the Royal Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Dutcheſs of Valentinois,</hi> whom the <hi>Guiſes</hi> were indebted to for one part of their Grandeur, complained of their change of Conduct towards her.
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36062:34"/>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> did no longer pay her thoſe devoirs; and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain,</hi> inſolent in good Fortune, and as proud of the fine actions of his Brother, as if he had performed them himſelf, begun to treat her very ſcornfully.</p>
            <p>This haughty and imperious Woman, who ſaw all bend before her, was not of a humour to bear with the Contempts of the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, whom ſhe looked upon as her Creature, and hardly ever called him otherwiſe than <hi>Maſter Charles.</hi> She made her complaints to the King, whoſe mind was already perfectly diſpoſed to receive them, and it is certain, that he was reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move thoſe two Brothers, with both whom he was equally diſſatisfied, when he was prevented by his Death, which happenned in ſuch a manner as all the World knows.</p>
            <p>Never had the <hi>Guiſes</hi> ſeen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo near their ruin, and never did they ſee themſelves ſo raiſed.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36062:35"/>
It ſeemed as if all things would have conſpired to render them Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Kingdom. <hi>King Francis the Second,</hi> weak in Body, and yet more feeble in mind, ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be abſolutely governed by his Wife, who was their Niece. The Queen-Mother, who hated the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and ſtood in fear of the Princes of the Blood, cauſed the firſt to be diſcharged by the King, and removed the others upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers pretexts: The <hi>Guiſes</hi> remained alone at Court, and ſhe was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to contribute to the Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their Authority, for the ſupporting her own.</p>
            <p>The King declared to the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Parliament, who came to kiſs his Hand, that he had ſhared the Government of the State amongſt his Uncles; that <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſhould have care of the War, and that the Cardinal ſhould govern the Revenue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:36062:35"/>
The <hi>Dutcheſs</hi> of <hi>Valentinois</hi> was put away, and the <hi>Conſtable</hi> conſtrained to yield up at length his Charge of <hi>Lord High Steward</hi> to <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who had ſo long aimed at it.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Guiſe</hi> being Maſter of the Armies, by the diviſion that was newly made, and Maſter of the Kings Perſon by this laſt Office, had the ſame Authority in the Kingdom as the <hi>Maires</hi> of the <hi>Palace</hi> had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the King of the former Race; and we may ſay that it was he who reigned in the King and <hi>Regents</hi> Name.</p>
            <p>The laſt Wars had drained the Treaſury, and the Demeſn was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt wholly engaged; in the mean time nothing was ſeen at <hi>Fountain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleau,</hi> where the Court was at that time, but People who demanded ſome Payments, others Recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with an extraordinary Importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. The <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought himſelf of a way conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his humour, to free himſelf
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36062:36"/>
from theſe troubleſom Sollicitors. He cauſed Proclamation to be made by ſound of Trumpet, that all thoſe who were at Court upon account of Petitioning, ſhould be gone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in four and twenty hours, upon pain of being Hanged upon a Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet that was ſet up before the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle.</p>
            <p>It is incredible how much this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Order did incenſe People againſt its Author, and againſt <hi>Guiſe</hi> likewiſe; though he had no Hand in it. For notwithſtanding that he was naturally mild and moderate, we may ſay that he rendered himſelf an Accomplice of the violences and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagances of his Brother, by not hindring them, and often likewiſe by helping him to put in execution ſuch deſignes as he ought to have oppoſed.</p>
            <p>Thus the Publick, ſeeking uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its misfortunes only whom to complain of, almoſt equally accuſed them both.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:36062:36"/>
The Princes of the Blood, and the <hi>Collignies</hi> made uſe of that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to diſturb the Government, which they had but little reaſon to be ſatisfied with, being they had no ſhare in it. They formed the famous Conſpiracy of <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> which I ſhall not here give an account of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not a Hiſtory, but a Life that I write: And beſides it has been ſo exactly deſcribed by all our Hiſtorians, that it would be only a uſeleſs Repetition.</p>
            <p>Their deſign was to kill <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his Brother, and afterwards to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige the King to give to the Princes and the <hi>Collignies</hi> the ſhare they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended was due to them in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the Kingdom. The Liberty of Conſcience, which they demanded, did only help them to cover their intentions with a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title, and to increaſe their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by engaging therein the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> who hated the <hi>Guiſes</hi> mortally, as having always been perſecuted by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:36062:37"/>
The Court was at <hi>Blois</hi> when they had the firſt notice of this Conſpiracy. The <hi>Cardinal,</hi> more fearful than a Woman, already fancied that all was loſt, and would have had them cryed out to Arms. But <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was not eaſily ſtartled, did rightly gueſs that ſuch a Buſtle would only help to defer the miſchief, inſtead of curing it; that it was requiſite to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, that the Plotters might come and deliver themſelves up; and that their preſence being their Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, would at the ſame time ſpare the trouble of ſeeking and convicting them.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, as able Men know how to take advantage even of the misfortunes that happen to them; <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſo ordered the buſineſs, that this Plot, which was laid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his Authority, did only help the more to augment and ſettle it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:36062:37"/>
He made known to the King, that there was a horrible Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy againſt the Royal Family, and that the Princes had reſolved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of his Crown, and his Life. The King being in a fright, and not knowing what Reſolution to take, deſired <hi>Guiſe</hi> to ſuccour him in an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion wherein he did not find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf capable of doing any thing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and at the ſame time declared him <hi>Lieutenant General in all the Provinces of his Dominions,</hi> with full Power <hi>to do all he ſhould judge uſeful for the good of the Kingdom:</hi> Theſe are the terms of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion that was given him. The <hi>Chancellour</hi> oppoſed it with all his Power, but his reſiſtance was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to no purpoſe; and the <hi>Queen Mother,</hi> who was the beſt in the World at ſeeming to deſire things which ſhe could not hinder, was conſtrained to be aiding to it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rendevouze</hi> of the <hi>Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> was at <hi>Blois: Guiſe,</hi> to break
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36062:38"/>
their meaſures, carried the King to <hi>Amboiſe.</hi> They came thither, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ſtartled at this change: but the prudence of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the good Orders he gave every where, rendered their deſigns Abortive. A great number of them were killed in the Woods, where they had hid themſelves, and amongſt others <hi>la Renaudie</hi> their Leader. Others, were carried to <hi>Amboiſe,</hi> where du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſeveral days there was nothing ſeen but horrible Executions, which they obliged the King to look at from a Window. The blood flowed along the Streets, and the Walls of the Caſtle were covered with Bodies of the Conſpirators, whom they hanged at the Battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all Booted, and without any form of Proceſs, but only as they were brought into the Town.</p>
            <p>What care ſoever the <hi>Guiſes</hi> took to perſwade the King, that this Conſpiracy was only deſigned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Perſon, and againſt his
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36062:38"/>
Royal Brothers; they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his hearing ſometimes Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the averſion the People had for them. This poor Prince frighted with hearing them ſay eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment, that there was a deſign to kill him, and to ſee ſo many Wretches put to Death dayly, told them ſometimes weeping: <hi>What have I then done to my People, that ſhould oblige them to have ſuch an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for me? Is it not you, My Lords, they aim at? And would it not be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that you ſhould withdraw for ſome time, that we might ſee if your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would not put an end to theſe diſorders?</hi> But they did not think fit to take this courſe; and beſides, it would have been imprudent in them to have abandoned the Kings Perſon to Rebellious Subjects, who had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taken up Arms becauſe they were not ſatisfied with the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was without doubt the chief of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36062:39"/>
was come to <hi>Amboiſe</hi> to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour their enterprize. The King being perfectly informed of it, forbid him to go out of the Town without his Order, and appointed Guards to attend him.</p>
            <p>But the Conſpiracy being entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſipated, he beſeeched the King to call his Council, and to cauſe all the <hi>Ambaſſadours</hi> to be there. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving complained there with that confidence, which does ſo well im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate Innocence, of the ill Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſome Perſons would have inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into the King of his Conduct, and principally as to what had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happened; he ended his diſcourſe with ſaying, That if there was any one who durſt maintain that he had had a Hand in the Conſpiracy, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to give him the Lie at the point of his Sword, and for that purpoſe would renounce the Priviledges that his Quality gave him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> knowing well enough that this Diſcourſe was meant to him, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:36062:39"/>
with ſuch a diſſimulation as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled the Princes aſſurance; That the reports which the Princes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of, ought not to be ſuffered; that no body ought to doubt, but that he was very innocent: but that if he ſhould come to Fight, for to prove his innocence, he ſhould have no greater Joy than to offer him his Sword, and to ſerve him for a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
            <p>Theſe fine Proteſtations did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from adviſing the King to cauſe the Prince to be taken into Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody: but as they had reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> his Brother had a hand in the Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that it would have been to no purpoſe to have confined the one without the other, they thought convenient to refer the doing it till another opportunity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſtable,</hi> who was retired to <hi>Chantilly,</hi> had order to come and inform the <hi>Parliament</hi> of what had paſſed at <hi>Amboiſe.</hi> He acquitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:36062:40"/>
of this Commiſſion after ſuch a manner, as was diſagreeable to the <hi>Guiſes;</hi> for he made known that the Plot was only againſt them, and that there was no Conſpiracy againſt the Kings Perſon, as they would have had it believed. He added That however the Conſpirators had been juſtly treated after the manner they had been: For if particular Perſons of Quality cannot ſuffer without ſhame, that their Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, or thoſe they take under their Protection, ſhould be inſulted; it was not ſtrange that the King had taken an exemplary vengeance of the attempt they had had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to make upon the Principal Miniſters of State.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Parliament wrote a Letter to the King, upon what had newly happened; and another to <hi>Guiſe,</hi> wherein they gave him the glorious Name of Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of their Country; what ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſoever he might have rendred to
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36062:40"/>
the State in this Rencounter, the <hi>Parliaments</hi> acknowledgment ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extraordinary, and ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Dignity of ſo great a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
            <p>In the mean time an Aſſembly was Convened at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> to deliberate about the means of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing the Troubles which aroſe in the Kingdome: For thoſe who in good truth did demand Liberty of Conſcience, and thoſe who conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it only as a pretext to revolt, made more noiſe than ever.</p>
            <p>In this Aſſembly, <hi>Guiſe</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> gave publickly an account of their Adminiſtration. After which, ſeveral means were propoſed to accommodate affairs of Religion: but the minds of People were too much heated; and neither Party would come to an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, though they ſeemed ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt for it. The <hi>Guiſes</hi> were reſolved to ſpare nothing for the preſerving their Power; and the others were
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36062:41"/>
determined to attempt all things for the deſtroying it, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the place of their Enemies.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Navarre</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to come thither, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Inſtances that had been made them. Thus the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who after them was the moſt conſiderable of their Party, was the Man who ſpoke for the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> He preſented a Requeſt to the King in their Name, by which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Churches in all the Cities of the Kingdom, and a full liberty for the Exerciſe of their Religion. The <hi>King</hi> received the requeſt; and it being wondered at, that it was not Signed, the Admiral had the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to anſwer, That he would eaſily cauſe it to be Signed by fifty thouſand men. He added, That it was ſtrange that they ſhould bring up the <hi>King,</hi> as they did, in diſtruſt and fear, and that he was always environed with Soldiers, as if he had been in the midſt of his Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:36062:41"/>
The <hi>Guiſes</hi> replyed, with a great deal of ſharpneſs, to what the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi> had ſaid: That if the King was obliged to keep Souldiers about his Perſon, the fault was in them who had dared to Conſpire againſt his Life; and that if there were fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand Rebels ready to Sign the Requeſt that was preſented, there would be found millions of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that were faithful to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and their Prince, and would be able to ſuppreſs the enterpriſe that ſhould be made againſt either of them. The Aſſembly ſeparated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing any thing, they only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened the States at <hi>Meaux,</hi> for the Month of <hi>December</hi> following, and gave Orders, that they ſhould ceaſe putting to Death thoſe of the new Religion, who were at that time too numerous to hope they could be deſtroyed by Puniſhments.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> was retired to his Brother in <hi>Bearne,</hi> where he was contriving a new Conſpiracy
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36062:42"/>
againſt the <hi>Guiſes. La Sague,</hi> whom he had ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> was taken into Cuſtody at <hi>Eſtampes,</hi> as he was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his return encharged with Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Memoires. It was diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that the Princes were to come to Court, and that they had taken meaſures to ſeize on, in their paſſage, the beſt Cities that were in their way. Theſe things were confeſſed by <hi>La Sague,</hi> whom they had terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for the Letters did contain in appearance, only meer Civilities, that had nothing Criminal. But when, by the Information of that Man, they had made them have a hand in the Plot, they found the Papers were to be interpreted after another way, and ſeveral things were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. They found written by <hi>Dardoir</hi> the <hi>Conſtables</hi> Secretary's hand, that his Maſter ſtill perſiſted in the Deſign of ridding himſelf of the <hi>Guiſes;</hi> which might be effected, maugre the Queen and the States; and in order to that; the preſence of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36062:42"/>
the Princes was only expected. <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doir</hi> added of his own Head, that the execution of this Deſign appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed difficult to ſeveral, and that it would be more expedient, that the Princes, at their arrival at Court, ſhould cauſe the <hi>Guiſes</hi> to be killed by truſty people; that this would change in an inſtant the face of things; and that then they would not find it difficult to get all affairs into their own hands.</p>

               <hi>Guiſe</hi> kept theſe Memoires, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making any noiſe, being reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make uſe of them upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>And indeed the States, who were appointed to meet at <hi>Meaux,</hi> having been removed to <hi>Orleans, Guiſe</hi> ordered his buſineſs ſo well, that he engaged the two Princes to come thither, notwithſtanding the earneſt advice of all their Friends, who would have diverted them from that Journey; and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the juſt reaſons they had of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36062:43"/>
themſelves to diſtruſt the uſages they ſhould meet with there.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Cuſtody at his arrival, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few days having been brought to a Tryal before Commiſſioners, whom the King had nominated, he was condemned to loſe his Head.</p>
            <p>We cannot read without horrour what was reported at that time, and which has ſince been written, That the <hi>Guiſes</hi> fearing the reſentments of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding beſides, that their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would never be peaceable nor ſecure, as long as there ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a Prince of the Blood to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt it, they had undertaken to rid themſelves of them; but by ſuch means, as, if they had been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, would have cauſed the whole Royal Family to have periſhed by it ſelf; that the King, whom they had made to comprehend how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant it was, not to ſuffer a Prince to live who might revenge the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36062:43"/>
Death of the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> was to ſend for the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> to his Chamber, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him in very ſharp terms, with the Crimes of his Brother, and the juſt reaſons of complaint he had againſt himſelf; the Prince would either confidently deny, or at leaſt vindicate himſelf with too much heat, and thereupon he was to be ſtabbed to Death by People the King ſhould give a ſign to, and who were to be in Ambuſcade. Others add, that this Prince had notice of the danger which threatned him, and after having conſidered a long time of what he had to do, he reſolved to run the hazzard of what might happen; and that having told his mind to one of his faithfulleſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks, as he was upon the point of going into the Kings Chamber, <hi>If it happen,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>that I fall under the multitude and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of my Enemies, take my Shirt all bloody, carry it to my Wife and my
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36062:44"/>
Son; they will read in my Blood what they ought to do to revenge me.</hi> That then he went to the King, who durſt not, or who would not give the Signal they had agreed of; and that <hi>Guiſe</hi> being vexed to ſee his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe thus fail, cryed out to thoſe who were with him, <hi>What a poor Prince have we?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the recital alone of this Story makes it ſeem incredible, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in regard of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who was not capable of adviſing an Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; I thought my ſelf obliged to mention it here, as I have found it written by the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of that time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>King</hi> being ſeized by a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent ſickneſs, the ſtate of things was very much changed: The <hi>Guiſes</hi> ſeeing that it muſt needs have a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ill iſſue, preſſed the Queen to put the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to Death, and to take the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> into Cuſtody.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:36062:44"/>
But this Princeſs being ambitious to Govern, and no longer able to bear with the Authority of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> did not think fit to do a thing that would have contributed to the confirming it.</p>
            <p>She took meaſures wholly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: She came to an accommodati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Princes; and the <hi>King</hi> being dead, the Prince was ſet at liberty. As he was haughty and imperious, he did not conceal his reſentments againſt ſuch perſons as he believed to have been the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of his Impriſonment; and he cauſed thoſe to tremble in their turn, who two days before thought themſelves Maſters of his Life. And the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> conſenting that the Queen ſhould have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, was declared <hi>Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral</hi> of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>The agitation of a Court filled with ſo many ſeveral Intereſts, and the Devoirs which they crowded
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36062:45"/>
to pay the new King, cauſed thoſe to be forgotten which they owed the <hi>King</hi> who was newly expired. His Body was carried to <hi>Saint Denis,</hi> being only attended by <hi>Sanſac</hi> and <hi>la Broſſe,</hi> who had been his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and <hi>Lewis Guillard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Senlis,</hi> who was blind.</p>
            <p>People were not ſatisfied with the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> though they excuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they had ſtayed with their Niece to comfort her: It was thought ſtrange, that there being ſix Brothers of them at Court, not one had accompanied the Corps of a Prince who had been ſo kind to them during his Life. They were likewiſe reproached with their ingratitude, after a very ingenuous manner. There was faſtened upon the Pall of the Coffin a Ticket, wherein theſe words were written: <hi>Tanneguy du Chaſtel, Where art thou?</hi> This <hi>Tanneguy du Chaſtel</hi> had been <hi>Lord High Chamberlain</hi> under <hi>Charles the Seventh,</hi> who had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36062:45"/>
him, though he had rendered great Services to the King and the State. But this ill uſage not having been able to ſtifle the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the benefits he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, as ſoon as he knew of the Death of his Maſter, he came to bewail him upon his Coffin, and did at his own charges the Funeral Rites which no one would take care of.</p>
            <p>The Queens Ambition was the preſervation of the <hi>Guiſes,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their being obliged to her for it. She was affraid, that by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, the Princes would abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly become Maſters: Thus ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained both Parties, that ſhe might make uſe of the one to poiſe the Authority of the other.</p>
            <p>Things were, during ſome days, in a pretty great Tranquillity: But the moſt prudent eaſily perceived that this Calm could not laſt long. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> being grown haughty with his new Authority,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36062:46"/>
and thinking that he might at length oblige <hi>Guiſe</hi> to renounce the Government, ſought only to vex him upon all occaſions. He quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with him for keeping the Keys of the Caſtle, as <hi>Lord High Steward,</hi> and pretended that they were to be brought to him, as being <hi>Lieutenant General</hi> of the Kingdom. The <hi>Queen</hi> not daring to Condemn this Prince openly, propoſed the bringing the Keys to her: but this temperament did not pleaſe him, he threatned her to retire, if <hi>Guiſe</hi> was not removed, and to take with him all the <hi>Princes</hi> of the Blood, and the <hi>Conſtable</hi> likewiſe, whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was very great at that time. The <hi>Queen,</hi> in this perplexity, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Conſtable</hi> to be forbidden to leave the Court: he obeyed more willingly than was expected, and this ſtayed the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who was affraid they would accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom themſelves to be without him, as they had done in the <hi>former Reign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:36062:46"/>
In the mean time the <hi>Admiral</hi> had got ſuch an influence over the <hi>Queen,</hi> that ſhe did nothing but by his Counſel, both as to Religion and the Government of the State. The <hi>Conſtable,</hi> who was fixed to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religion, preferrably to all the Intereſts at Court, was ſhocked at the <hi>Queen</hi>'s Conduct. He could not bear ſhe ſhould permit the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots</hi> to exerciſe their Religion in the very <hi>Louvre,</hi> nor that ſhe obliged the <hi>King</hi> to aſſiſt at the Sermons of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Valence,</hi> whoſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were but too much ſuſpected. He repreſented to her that it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Kings honour and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to ſuffer the exceſſes that were daily committed in his very Family, contrary to the Religion he made profeſſion of. But ſeeing that his Remonſtrances were to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that this <hi>Princeſs</hi> only conſidered things as they might aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diminiſh her Authority, he begun to withdraw himſelf from her intereſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:36062:47"/>
The <hi>Marſhal de Saint Andre</hi> did dexterouſly make uſe of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture to unite the <hi>Conſtable</hi> with <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who deſired nothing more: He ſucceeded in his undertaking. Theſe two Lords had ever had a very pure and ſincere affection for the Catholick Religion; and we may ſay that it is to them <hi>France</hi> is indebted for the Conſervation of it in that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>Thus they paſſed over the ſeveral Intereſts which ſeparated them from one another, and forgot their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Enmities, to unite themſelves in the Deſign of oppoſing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> The <hi>Conſtable</hi> went to the Communion with <hi>Guiſe</hi> on <hi>Eaſter-day,</hi> and in the Evening they ſupped together at the <hi>Conſtable</hi>'s Houſe, with the Prince of <hi>Joinville, Guiſe</hi>'s Son, and the <hi>Marſhal de Saint Andre.</hi> The <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> going afterwards to <hi>Chantilly, Guiſe</hi> retired to his Houſe at <hi>Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuil,</hi> which is not far diſtant, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:36062:47"/>
from whence he wrote to him very often. He ſtayed there till Spring, and then followed the <hi>King</hi> who was going to be Crowned at <hi>Rheimes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the occaſion of this Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, there aroſe a diſpute for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence between <hi>Guiſe</hi> and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> the ſource of which was as followeth.</p>
            <p>There was formerly but twelve <hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> ſix Eccleſiaſticks, and ſix Laicks: But all the Titles of the Laicks having been ſuppreſſed, whether by the Re-union of their Lands to the Crown, or otherwiſe, the Kings have reſerved to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the power of honouring with that Quality thoſe they ſhall think fit, without confining themſelves to the number which is no longer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited. However, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the memory of the firſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the Cuſtom is, That at the Coronation of Kings, beſides the ſix Eccleſiaſtick Peers who aſſiſt at the Ceremony, ſix others are
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36062:48"/>
choſen from amongſt the Laicks, who repreſent the ſix ancient ones, and who aſſiſting there only in Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Peers, have no other Rank amongſt them than that of their Seniority, without having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Offices they are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe poſſeſſed of: Inſomuch, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that a meer Gentleman would take place there of the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable,</hi> if he had been made Peer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him.</p>
            <p>The diſpute was to know if this Cuſtome ought to reach to the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood.</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Montpenſier</hi> pretended to go before <hi>Guiſe,</hi> though <hi>Guiſe</hi> was a more an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Peer than he. He ſaid that the quality of a <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> eminently contained all the others; and that this was the reaſon that thoſe who had the honour to be ſo, did not take their Rank among them according to their Dignities, but according as they were more or leſs related to the <hi>Kings Perſon. Guiſe</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:36062:48"/>
made anſwer, That <hi>Montpenſier,</hi> not aſſiſting at that Ceremony as <hi>Prinoc</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> but only as <hi>Peer</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> his quality ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate the precedence in that occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But his beſt reaſon was, that Cuſtome was for him; his Father at the Coronation of <hi>Henry the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi> and he himſelf at that of <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis the Second,</hi> having preceeded the <hi>Princes</hi> of the <hi>Blood.</hi> Thus he walked immediately after the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and before the <hi>Prince of Montpenſier,</hi> though <hi>Prince A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> who was afterwards King, under the name of <hi>Henry the Third,</hi> went before the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As it was difficult, after what had paſſed, but that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> who was at Court, ſhould daily meet with <hi>Guiſe,</hi> without ſhowing him his diſpleaſure in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as might have very ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, there was an accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion propoſed between them, which
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:36062:49"/>
was effected after this manner. The King having ſent for them both to him, in the preſence of all the Court, and having ordered <hi>Guiſe</hi> to ſpeak firſt, he told the <hi>Prince: Sir, I neither have had, nor would have had a hand in any thing which ſhould he againſt your Honour or your Life, nor was I the Author, Motive, nor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigator of your Impriſonment:</hi> To which the Prince made anſwer: <hi>Sir, I look upon the Perſon or Perſons as baſe and wicked, who were the occaſion of it.</hi> Thereupon <hi>Guiſe</hi> replyed: <hi>I am of the ſame Opinion; but it does not at all touch me.</hi> After which the King deſired them to embrace one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to remain good Friends.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the <hi>Admirals</hi> Credit augmented every day, and <hi>Guiſe</hi> not being able to bear with the publick contempt there was had of Religion, nor perhaps of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of his Authority, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to his own Houſe, after having complained to the Queen of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36062:49"/>
ſhe gave to the <hi>Hugonots.</hi> The <hi>Conſtable,</hi> the <hi>Marſhal of Saint Andre,</hi> the <hi>Cardinal of Lorrain,</hi> and the <hi>Duke of Nemours</hi> were all of the ſame Cabal, and retired likewiſe at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> did not remain idle in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. He intereſſed the King of <hi>Spain</hi> in his diſcontent: and this Prince ſhared in it the more willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that he ſought nothing more, than an occaſion of ſhowing his Zeal for the Catholick Religion, by ſeizing on the reſt of the Territories of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly countenanced the <hi>Hugonots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> advantageouſly made uſe of that occaſion with <hi>Anthony,</hi> who was naturally fearful. He thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on promiſed him a match between him and <hi>Mary Steward,</hi> and to cauſe the Kingdom of <hi>Scotland</hi> to be given him, or to cauſe the King of <hi>Spain</hi> to deliver to him <hi>Sardaign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anthony,</hi> who knew himſelf well enough, to judge that of himſelf he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36062:50"/>
could never oblige the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> to reſtore <hi>Navarre</hi> to him, liſtened greedily to theſe propoſitions; and was at length ſo well perſwaded, that he entered into very ſtrict engagements with <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and withdrew himſelf wholly from the <hi>Hugonots</hi> Party, which his Brother the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> was the Head of.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Guiſe</hi> knowing that having the King of <hi>Navarre</hi> on his ſide, who was Lieutenant General of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he ſhould be ſtronger than his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, he reſolved to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he was impatiently expected.</p>
            <p>As he paſſed through <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> a ſmall City of <hi>Champagne,</hi> word was brought him, that the <hi>Hugonots</hi> held their meeting in a Barn hard by. A Company of inſolent and uſeleſs people, who are ever following great Perſons, run thither immediately, and who never ſhow any Zeal to their Religion, but by out-raging thoſe who were not of it: They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to exclaim againſt the <hi>Hugonots,</hi>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:36062:50"/>
calling them Dogs and Rebels to their King. Theſe injuries were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by others: in ſhort, they came to blows; and <hi>Guiſe</hi> running thither to put an end to this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, received by chance a blow with a Stone, which covered all his Face with Blood. Then his Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, believing their Violence au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by his wound, could not be withheld by his threatnings or his Prayers: they fell upon the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots,</hi> who had not Armes; there was about two hundred wounded in that unlucky Encounter, and near ſixty killed upon the place.</p>
            <p>This is what was called the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre of <hi>Vaſſy,</hi> and which has been ſo diverſly reported, according to the ſeveral intereſts of thoſe who have written thereof, inſomuch that one Writer has had the Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to affirm, that <hi>Guiſe</hi> led his Men to the attacque of that <hi>Barn,</hi> as to an Aſſault, the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets ſounding, and himſelf march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36062:51"/>
at the head of them with his Sword drawn.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> waiting only for an occaſion to be ſtirring, did not fail to make a great Buſtle for what happened at <hi>Vaſſy. Francour</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> came to the King at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaux,</hi> to complain thereof, in the name of all the <hi>Hugonot</hi> Party. But the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> being no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on their ſide, treated them as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious in the <hi>Kings</hi> preſence, and ſent them back with ſmall ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Queen,</hi> who countenanced the <hi>Hugonots</hi> more than ever, had entered into ſuch ſtrict engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> and the <hi>Admiral,</hi> that they governed in her name. In ſhort, the Catholick Religion was upon the point of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baniſhed <hi>France,</hi> if <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and the <hi>Marſhal de Saint Andre,</hi> who ſaw that on its ruin that of their Authority depended, had not reſolved to oppoſe vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36062:51"/>
all that the <hi>Queen</hi> ſhould do in order to its deſtruction. The <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonots</hi> hereupon called this Union <hi>the Triumvirate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The buſineſs of <hi>Vaſſy</hi> had made ſo much noiſe, as that it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but that it ſhould have very ill Cenſequences; and <hi>Guiſe</hi> meditated a Journey to <hi>Paris</hi> that was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> and the <hi>Queen.</hi> He was come from <hi>Joinville</hi> to his houſe of <hi>Nanteuil,</hi> where he received Letters, by which ſhe ordered him not to go to <hi>Paris,</hi> and to come to the King without being accompanied. But <hi>Guiſe,</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſupported by the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and being willing to make known to the <hi>Hugonots</hi> that he did not fear them, made anſwer, that he was taken up with receiving his Friends, and that after he ſhould have acquitted himſelf of that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voir, he would ſee what he had to do. The <hi>Marſhal de Saint Andre</hi> uſed the ſame language, and told
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36062:52"/>
the <hi>Queen,</hi> who ordered him to retire from his Government, that conſidering the poſture Affairs were in, it was the Duty of his place not to abandon the Kings Perſon.</p>
            <p>However, notwithſtanding the <hi>Queens</hi> Orders, <hi>Guiſe</hi> came to <hi>Paris</hi> with a numerous Train. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of the Merchants</hi> and the Sheriffs went to meet him, and the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him as a Man ſent from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for the preſervation of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: And indeed there was no longer any hopes but in him. The <hi>Queen</hi> ſeemed to approve of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes of the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> inſtead of ſuppreſſing them, and her protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had rendered them ſo inſolent, that they daily committed new Diſorders, inſomuch that the Prieſts could hardly carry the Hoſt through the Streets, without being expoſed to the inſults of the Rabble.</p>
            <p>The Queen, outraged at <hi>Guiſes</hi> contemning her Orders, and fearing the effects of the ſtrict Union that
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36062:52"/>
was formed between him and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> reſolved to unmask, and to put her own and the Kings Perſon into the hands of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde.</hi> The <hi>Prince</hi> was at <hi>Paris</hi> with a great Train when <hi>Guiſe</hi> arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved there. He went from thence ſome days after, upon Condition that <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſhould do the like; and retired to his Houſe <hi>de la Ferte,</hi> where he ſecretly raiſed Men, and took meaſures with the <hi>Queen</hi> for the putting their deſign in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who let nothing eſcape his knowledge, ſeeing of what moment it was to prevent them, put a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of fifteen hundred Men into <hi>Paris,</hi> and being followed by a great number of armed Men, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> whoſe timidity he reaſſured by his Reſolution, he went to the <hi>Queen</hi> at <hi>Fontainbleau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

He repreſented to her that the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> was arming under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand; that he was juſtly ſuſpected of having dangerous deſigns; and that it was not convenient the <hi>King</hi> ſhould remain any longer in a place where he was too much expoſed to the attempts that might be made upon his Perſon.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen,</hi> ſurprized to ſee her ſelf diſcovered, asked them with great concern, if they had forgot the reſpect that was due to her, and if they were come to uſe violence? To which <hi>Guiſe</hi> made anſwer for the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre</hi> and himſelf. <hi>We know, Madam, the reſpect that is due to you, and we will never be wanting in it, as long as we live; but we ought to anſwer to the State for the Kings Perſon. You are Miſtreſs, and may ſtay here as long as you pleaſe; but the fidelity we owe our Prince, obliges us to carry him this very day to a place where he may have nothing to fear from his Rebel Subjects.</hi> And im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately

they carried the <hi>King</hi> to <hi>Paris;</hi> and the <hi>Queen,</hi> not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to hinder it, was obliged to follow them, after having written a Letter to the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> to teſtifie to him how ſorry ſhe was that they had been ſo prevented by their Enemies.</p>
            <p>It is certain, that it is this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize that has preſerved the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion in the Kingdom; for conſidering the ſtate things were in, the two Parties being equal, it was eaſie to ſee that that which could have the Kings Perſon on its ſide, would be looked upon as the Loyal Party, and that the others would be conſidered as Rebels. The King was not of an age to make choice himſelf of a Religon, and the <hi>Regent,</hi> who, according to all appearances, affected no one in particular, ſeemed fully determined to inſpire him with that which ſhould ſuit beſt with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign ſhe had of being always at the Helm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:36062:54"/>
The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> was prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to go to <hi>Fontainebleau</hi> with the Men he had about him, when he learnt that he was prevented. Then ſeeing that there were no more hopes for him, but in open force, and believing he ſhould ſtill be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the Queen, he ſeized on <hi>Orleans;</hi> and having thereby given a Signal to the Rebellion, all the beſt Cities of the Kingdom found themſelves almoſt at the ſame time in the hands of the <hi>Hugonots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen,</hi> who till then had countenanced them, ſeeing her ſelf in the power of the Catholicks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to act as if ſhe had always been an the intereſt of theſe laſt; and while ſhe wrote ſecret Letters to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> wherein ſhe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to <hi>Guiſe</hi> all the misfortunes that had already happened to the Kingdom, and thoſe it was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with for the future: She treated the <hi>Hugonots</hi> in publick as Rebels; and took meaſures in Council to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36062:54"/>
them by force of Arms. Some days were ſpent in proclaiming <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſto's</hi> on both ſides, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Propoſitions for an accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which could not fail of being abortive, becauſe neither of the two Parties had a mind to Peace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> pretended to prove by Letters from the <hi>Queen,</hi> that he had taken Arms by her Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and that he only kept himſelf in that poſture to free the <hi>King</hi> and her out of the Captivity they were detained in by the <hi>Triumvirate.</hi> The King iſſued out Declarations whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrary, and wherein he aſſured that the Qeeen and himſelf were at full liberty.</p>
            <p>But conſidering the Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the Queen was then under, the enterprizes of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> were of no uſe to her, and the iſſue of them could not be otherwiſe than a Civil War, that would be very fatal to both Parties. Wherefore ſhe cauſed ſeveral Propoſitions of Peace to be

made him; and at length engaged him to declare by writing, That for the putting an end to the troubles which divided the Kingdom, he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to leave it immediatly, upon condition that <hi>Guiſe,</hi> the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and the <hi>Marſhal de St. Andre</hi> ſhould retire from Court.</p>
            <p>This propoſition was accepted <hi>Guiſe</hi> and his two Friends departed the ſame day, teſtifying a great deal of Joy, in that <hi>France</hi> was pacified at ſo cheap a rate.</p>
            <p>But the Prince could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to keep his word, having given it only becauſe he thought it would not have been accepted: All the Conferences were broken off, and their thoughts were wholly bent to War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe,</hi> after having retaken <hi>Blois</hi> and <hi>Tours</hi> from the <hi>Hugonots,</hi> laid Siege to <hi>Bourges</hi> with fifteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Foot and three thouſand Horſe. The King and Queen were perſonally in the Army. <hi>Yvoy</hi> the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36062:55"/>
Governour of the Town defended it courageouſly during five Weeks, and it would not have been eaſily taken, if he had not let himſelf be tempted by the promiſes of the Court.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Bourges Guiſe</hi> went to <hi>Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and having himſelf taken a view of the Place, he aſſured the King that he would take it by Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault in four and twenty hours time. But it was thought more covenient to ſpin out the Siege, that the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants might have time to recollect themſelves, and not expoſe to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage ſo rich and populous a City.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Mount Saint Katherine,</hi> and the Suburbs of <hi>Saint Hillary</hi> having been taken, and yet the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged not bating any thing of the inſolence, with which they made anſwer to the firſt Orders of the King; it was at length reſolved a general Aſſault ſhould be made.</p>
            <p>He choſe a very hopeful young Man, called <hi>Saint Colombe,</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36062:56"/>
the Attacque, and having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted him to pick out fifty Men, he promiſed him he would follow very cloſely. Then having aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled all the Officers and Souldiers who were to mount to the Aſſault, amongſt whom was <hi>Caſtlenau,</hi> who gives all his Speech in his Book, he repreſented to them, That true Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ought only to fight for Glory, and were not capable of ſaccaging a Town againſt their Sovereigns will, who was deſirous to preſerve it. <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>that thoſe you are going to fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt will be no longer your Enemies, than while they are up in Arms. But as ſoon as they ſhall be rendered uncapable of defending themſelves, they will be your Brethren, and againſt whom it is with regret his Majeſty ſends you.</hi> And thereupon having made all thoſe who ſurrounded him, promiſe that the Town ſhould not be pillaged, he gave the Signal. The Beſieged made very little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36062:56"/>
and <hi>Guiſe</hi> his Souldiers ill remembring what they had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their Leader, and no longer knowing the voice of their Officers, they plundered one of the richeſt Towns of the Kingdom, which it was impoſſible to hinder them from doing.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Guiſe</hi> was going the next day to meet the <hi>Queen,</hi> who was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to lodge in the City, he percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved afar off ſome Souldiers carrying a wounded Man upon a Chair; and being informed that it was <hi>Saint Colombe,</hi> who firſt mounted to the Aſſault: <hi>Ha! My dear</hi> Saint Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombe, ſaid he to him, <hi>how doſt thou do? I am going to dye, Sir,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wounded Perſon, <hi>but it will be without regret, provided you aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure me that the King and you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with my Services. And how ſhould we be otherwiſe,</hi> replyed <hi>Guiſe? it is certain, that had it not been for you, the King would not yet have been Maſter of the Town; but
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36062:57"/>
think of being Cured, and aſſure your ſelf, you ſhall be ſatisfied with the Recompence that the King prepares for you, and that I ſhall look upon you as long as I live, as my Brother and Companion in War.</hi> Having ſaid theſe words, he left him with Tears in his Eyes, and <hi>Saint Colombe</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead the next day, <hi>Guiſe</hi> himſelf did aſſiſt at his Funeral, teſtifying and extream regret for his loſs, and was always ſpeaking of him with extream applauſe. He likewiſe made inquiry after all the Soldiers who had accompanied him, and took care to recompence them every one according to his Merit.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> deſigning to re-animate the hopes of his Party by ſome conſiderable enterprize, they being very much dejected at the taking of <hi>Rouen,</hi> led his Army to <hi>Paris.</hi> He imagined that it would be eaſie for him to take in that great Town, being it was without Fortifications, and full of a people
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36062:57"/>
that were eaſie to be terrified. But <hi>Guiſe</hi> going thither in all haſte, diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their fears, as his Father had done twenty years before, when that <hi>Charles the Fifth</hi> had taken <hi>Chaſteau-Thierry;</hi> and during the eight days that the Army was at the Gates, the people did not for one moment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt their uſual employs: The Shops and Colledges were opened as was Cuſtomary, and the Courts of Juſtice as full of Advocates, as in a time of profound Peace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> having perceived the folly of his deſign, raiſed the Siege, and marched towards <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he hoped to receive the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Forces that were coming to him from <hi>England.</hi> He was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Kings</hi> Army, which was lead by <hi>Guiſe</hi> and the <hi>Conſtable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> did not deſign to fight; but his Army having loſt one days March through his <hi>Major General</hi>'s fault, the <hi>Conſtable</hi> overtook him near <hi>Dreux.</hi> He cauſed his
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36062:58"/>
Army and his Artillery to paſs over the little River of <hi>Eure</hi> by Moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and with ſo great a ſilence, that the Enemies did not in the leaſt perceive it: Inſomuch that when they were going to continue their March the next day, they were much amazed to ſee the Royal Army poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the way through which they were to paſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Conſtable</hi> had poſted himſelf between two Villages, having <hi>Blain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> on the right, and <hi>Spinal</hi> on the left; and as he was very weak in Cavalry, he had diſpoſed it by little Squadrons amongſt the great Battalions of Infantry, which the Army was compoſed of. Thus joining to the Village of <hi>Blainville</hi> was the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Infantry under co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Houſes, and the Trees of the Village: On the left ſide of it was <hi>Guiſe</hi> and <hi>la Broſſe</hi> his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at the Head of the Companies of Ordnance; then were the old Troops of <hi>Piemont,</hi> and after them
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36062:58"/>
the <hi>Marſhal de Saint Andre,</hi> with four Cornets of Horſe.</p>
            <p>Near the <hi>Marſhal de Saint Andre,</hi> ſtill drawing towards the left, you had the <hi>German</hi> Infantry, and at laſt the Squadron of <hi>Daumale</hi> and <hi>Damville,</hi> who compleated the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, before which was placed fourteen pieces of Cannon. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing farther in the Plain, however ſtill drawing towards <hi>Spinal,</hi> was the great Battalion of the <hi>Suiſſes,</hi> having on the left hand eight pieces of Cannon, and the Cavallery of the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and of <hi>Brichanteau,</hi> then the Regiments of <hi>Brittany</hi> and of <hi>Picardy. Sanſac</hi> made up the Body of the Army, having the light Horſe, who reached from this Battalion to the Village of <hi>Spinal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> would not take any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand that day, that he might not be obliged to obey the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> and ſaid that he took care only of his Company of Ordonnance, and ſome Volunteers that had joyned
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:36062:59"/>
themſelves to him. But his Name Commanded for him in all Places where he came, and we may ſay that it was he who led the Vanguard.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Princes</hi> Army was divided into two: There was in the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, led by the <hi>Admiral,</hi> five hundred <hi>French</hi> Horſe, ſix <hi>French</hi> Colours, and ſix <hi>German.</hi> The Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Army which was led by the <hi>Prince,</hi> was compoſed of ſix hundred <hi>French</hi> Lances, ſix Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of <hi>German</hi> Cavalry, ten En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of <hi>Germans,</hi> twelve of <hi>French,</hi> and ſix Troops of light Horſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dandelot,</hi> having been to diſcover the Royal Army, was not of Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Battle ſhould be hazarded, and the Prince already cauſed his Men to March towards <hi>Treon,</hi> where he hoped to Intrench himſelf: But as he could not make this motion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out laying his right Wing full o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to his Enemy; the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable</hi> having cauſed the fourteen pieces of Canon, we have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36062:59"/>
to be fired upon him, obliged him to come briskly to the Charge. The Body of the <hi>Conſtables</hi> Battalia was advanced into the Plain; for as there was not a ſufficient ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Villages to contain all the Army, it advanced in the Form of a demicircle; and the right Wing that lay behind, and was hidden by the Trees and the Houſes of the Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of <hi>Blainville,</hi> did hardly appear at all. Thus the Prince, who was below <hi>Blainville,</hi> marching towards the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> thought he ſaw all the Army, and advanced in all haſte without taking notice what he left on one ſide of him. And the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who was yet further, turning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout likewiſe at the ſame time, they both found themſelves directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the Body of the <hi>Conſtables Battalia.</hi> In the mean time the Prince, inſtead of falling upon the Cavalry, that was not ſo ſtrong as his, attacqued the Battalion of <hi>Suiſſes</hi> immediately. <hi>Mouy</hi> and <hi>Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:36062:60"/>
having Attacqued the Front, pierced it through intirely, and made their way through to the very Baggage, which was plundered. Then the <hi>Prince</hi> took them in the Rear, and <hi>Damville</hi> being advanced to them with three Companies of <hi>Genſdarmes,</hi> he was ſo ſharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed by the <hi>German</hi> Horſe, that he was obliged to retreat to the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, to rally his Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Admiral</hi> on his ſide having Attacqued the <hi>Conſtables</hi> Cavalry, put it to the rout without much dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. The Regiments of <hi>Britta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> and <hi>Picardy,</hi> were cut to pieces. <hi>Sanſac's</hi> Cavilry, being as it were ſeized with a panick fear, fell a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning without making any reſiſtance; and ſeveral of them having galloped full ſpeed, as far as <hi>Paris,</hi> brought news thither of the Kings Army be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defeated, and of the <hi>Hugonots</hi> having gained the Victory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:36062:60"/>
At length the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> being wounded with a Piſtol Bullet, and having had his Horſe killed under him, was taken Priſoner by the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Horſe. <hi>Daumale</hi> had his Arm broken in endeavouring to ſuccour him, and the Enemies made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the Artillery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſaw all this without quitting his Poſt, raiſing himſelf up from time to time in his Stirrups to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Enemies. <hi>Damville</hi> was near him, and deſperate with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeen his Brother <hi>Montberon</hi> killed; and ſeeing that the Enemies were carrying his Father away Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, would by all means have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged <hi>Guiſe</hi> to have run after him, in order to his ſuccour.</p>
            <p>But the violent Tranſports of this young Lord could not move him, and he only anſwered him with a great deal of ſweetneſs: <hi>My Son, we will be revenged, but it is not yet time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:36062:61"/>
At length, when he ſaw that the Enemies, by over purſuing a Victory they thought themſelves ſure of, had brought themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Condition of being infallibly conquered, and that they had loſt all their Ranks; he detachued a hundred and fifty Horſe under the Conduct of <hi>la Broſſe,</hi> to begin the Charge, and turning towards thoſe who followed him, <hi>Come, my Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>the Battle is won.</hi> Then he cauſed the <hi>Vanguard</hi> to advance, marching himſelf at the head of them, with a boldneſs as ſeemed to anſwer for the Victory. <hi>La Broſſe</hi> having made the <hi>German</hi> Horſe ſomething give way, he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf put them perfectly to the Rout. He cut in pieces the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Infantry: it is in vain that the Admiral and the Prince do all they can to rally ſome Cavalry; they were hindred by eight hundred Harque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſiers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom <hi>Saint Andre</hi> had placed on purpoſe, and who fired
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36062:61"/>
continually. The <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf is taken Priſoner by <hi>Damville,</hi> as he was changing his Horſe; and the <hi>Admiral,</hi> after having returned fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to the Charge, and put <hi>Guiſe</hi> ſeveral times in danger of his Life, was at length obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to <hi>Neuville,</hi> and to leave his Enemy Maſter of the Field of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>Though all the World agree that the ſucceſs of this Battle, which was of a very great Conſequence for the Kingdom, was due to <hi>Guiſe</hi> alone, they have however talked diverſly of his Conduct in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. He is reproached with not having Attacqued the Enemies ſoon enough, though he might have charged them in the Rear, and with having ſuffered the whole Army to be put to the rour, without ſtirring in the leaſt to its relief.</p>
            <p>But beſides, that it was to be feared, that the Runaways coming to fall upon his Battalions, might
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36062:62"/>
have put them in diſorder, which would have happened, if he had moved ſooner than he did; I believe that in thoſe extraordinary occaſions, we muſt ſometimes judge of the Conduct of great Men by the Event.</p>
            <p>Beſides, that ſtratagem of War is not without example, and it was practiſed a long time before, by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lopoemen,</hi> with as happy a ſucceſs. This great Captain, in a Battle he fought againſt <hi>Machanidas</hi> the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the <hi>Lacedemonians,</hi> ſeeing all his Vanguard put to the rout, and the Enemies paſs hard by him, in purſuit of the Runaways, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained firm in his Poſt, and did not ſtir till he ſaw that his Enemy, after having entirely defeated the Vangu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rd, returned in diſorder, and were no longer in a Condition to oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> treated the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> with all the humanity that can be expected from a generous Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Theſe two Generals, whoſe
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36062:62"/>
thoughts had for ſo long a time been taken up wholly with contriving how to ruine one another, ſupped together, and ſuſpended in that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion reſentments that were too lively to be ſo quickly forgotten.</p>
            <p>As all the Baggage had been plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>Guiſe,</hi> who had but one Bed left, offered it to the Prince, who accepted the half of it, fearing it would be either too great an Incivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to receive entirely the offer that was made him, or too much haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs to refuſe it.</p>
            <p>In which I find that the modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the vanquiſhed merits no leſs praiſe than the Civility of the Conquerour: for as much as great Courages have mildneſs in proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo much have they uſually Haughtineſs in their Misfortunes, ſome being deſirous to make appear that the favours of Fortune cannot elevate them, and others, that Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces cannot deject them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:36062:63"/>
               <hi>Guiſe</hi> has himſelf written, that eight thouſand were killed upon the place. He diſpatched <hi>Loſſes,</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards, to the <hi>Queen,</hi> who immediatly confirmed to him the Charge of General, of which the Victory had already put him in poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>It was in that Quality that <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> had preſented the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to him, after having taken him: But <hi>Guiſe</hi> who was the moſt civil perſon of Quality of that Age, returned him again into his Hands on the morrow, telling him very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably, <hi>I reſtore you your Priſoner, take care to keep him; he may help you to pay my Lord the Conſtables ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some days after he went to the <hi>Queen</hi> at <hi>Rambouillet,</hi> to whom he rendered a publick account of all that had paſſed in the Battle of <hi>Dreux.</hi> He enlarged extreamly in Commendations of the <hi>Conſtable,</hi> of the <hi>Marſhal de Saint Andre</hi> who
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36062:63"/>
was killed, and of all thoſe who had ſhown any valour in that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He even ſpoke very well of ſeveral Officers who had abandoned their Poſts, and who baſely run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and he told his Friends, who ſeemed amazed at ſo much Genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that it was not juſt to ruine peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for a misfortune that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to them, and which, perhaps, would never happen again; and that his carriage towards them would perhaps oblige them to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect themſelves, and ſhow more courage in the future.</p>
            <p>Certainly we cannot ſufficiently admire this wiſe anſwer, when we conſider, that there is in War, as elſe-where, certain unluckly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wherein the greateſt Coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are not Maſters of themſelves; and are ſometimes hurried by unvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary motions, to actions they would willingly afterwards waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the memory of at the price of all their Blood: Witneſs what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to <hi>Auſſin.</hi> This brave Captain, who had given in <hi>Italy</hi> ſo many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of his Valour, that it was become a Proverb; being at the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Dreux,</hi> was taken, as well as others, with the panick fear that ſpread through the <hi>Conſtables</hi> Forces. But coming the next day to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on what had happened to him, it put him into ſo great a deſpair, that he ſtarved himſelf to Death, notwithſtanding all the inſtances of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the principal Officers of the Army, who uſed all their efforts to oblige him to pardon himſelf.</p>
            <p>After the Battle <hi>Guiſe</hi> went to lay Siege to <hi>Orleans.</hi> This Town was as the Fortreſs of the <hi>Hugonots;</hi> and he ſaid, that after having taken it, he would in a Months time bring them perfectly to reaſon, and render the Kingdom as peaceable as it had ever been.</p>
            <p>However, whether that for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Reaſons this Deſign was not pleaſing to the <hi>Queen,</hi> or that haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36062:64"/>
alone oppoſed his putting it in Execution, he was traverſed in at all manner of ways. The Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder in the <hi>Arſenal</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken Fire, without being known how, conſumed in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant all the Ammunitions of War deſigned for that Siege. <hi>Guiſe</hi> was forced to wait a long time for the Cannons he wanted to begin the Siege with, and when he was upon the point of making the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, <hi>Caſtlenau</hi> arrived from <hi>Blois,</hi> to order him in the <hi>Queens</hi> Name, who was then there, to raiſe the Siege, and to go purſue the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral</hi> into <hi>Normandy,</hi> and give ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to the <hi>Marſhal de Briſſac,</hi> who complained he had not Forces ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keep the Field.</p>
            <p>All theſe diſappointments did not alter his Reſolution of taking the Town. He told <hi>Caſtlenau,</hi> that thé buſineſs in hand was of ſo great importance, as to deſerve ſome time to conſider of it: In the mean time
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36062:65"/>
that he would ſhow him his Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which was the fineſt that had been yet ſeen in <hi>France;</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving commanded him to follow him, he came to it within two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Paces of the Suburbs of <hi>Porte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau,</hi> where they expected him without noiſe, according to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders they had received.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Caſtlenau,</hi> thinking he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Review, was much ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee <hi>Guiſe</hi> light off his Horſe, and cauſe four Culverins to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, drawn by Pioneers, falling Pell-mell upon the Suburbs. The Culverins having over-turned the Gabions and Barrels the Enemies had covered themſelves with; he cauſed his Souldiers to march with Sword in Hand, who took the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs after a very obſtinate Fight, and taking advantage of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies diſorder, they had like to have entered the Town with them. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the heat of the Attacque, <hi>Guiſe</hi> told <hi>Caſtlenau, I am grieved
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36062:65"/>
the Marſhal</hi> de Briſſac <hi>is not here; I believe he would take delight to ſee the Performances of our Foot, and that he would find them much better employed in taking this Town, and in freeing the</hi> Conſtable, <hi>than in croſſing the Kingdom to run after the</hi> Admiral's <hi>Cavalry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The River of <hi>Loire,</hi> which runs along the Walls of <hi>Orleans,</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the City from the Suburbs of <hi>Portereau,</hi> and the Bridge which makes the Communication of the one with the other, is guarded by the Fort of <hi>Tourelles. Guiſe</hi> became Maſter of it in a few days, and the Town was ſo preſt, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for it to hold out four and twenty hours longer, when there happened a Misfortune which chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the ſtate of things.</p>
            <p>There was in the Camp a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man called <hi>Poltrot,</hi> of a gloomy and cloſe humour, and having all the manners of <hi>Spain,</hi> where he had been brought up, but was reſolute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36062:66"/>
and capable of the greateſt Crimes. He had let himſelf be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by <hi>Guiſes</hi> Enemies, that he could not render a greater piece of Service to the State, than by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching <hi>Guiſe</hi> out of the World. This Man, by much thinking of this Deſign, which at firſt raiſed a horrour in him, and overcome with the continual Inſtances of thoſe who moved him to it, imagined that it would be really an Heroical action, and of the greateſt advantage to his Country. He came thereupon and offered himſelf to <hi>Guiſe,</hi> as having abandoned the Reformed Religion; and <hi>Guiſe</hi> having received him with a great deal of humanity, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him Quarters amongſt the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingers, and cauſed him to eat of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten at his Table.</p>
            <p>This Traytor having waited a pretty while for a convenient op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to put his deſign in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and knowing that <hi>Guiſe</hi> who had ſpent the day at <hi>Portereau,</hi> in
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36062:66"/>
giving Orders for the general Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, was returning, being attended only by a Page and <hi>Triſtan Roſtain,</hi> who was mounted upon a Mule, he hid himſelf behind a Nut-Tree, near which <hi>Guiſe</hi> was to paſs, and having fired his Piſtols at him at five or ſixpaces diſtance, he ſhot three Bullets into his Shoulder, and gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped away full ſpeed on a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Horſe that he had bought for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This accident put all the Army in a Conſternation; and the Queen came in all haſte to the Camp, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more grieved than, perhaps, ſhe really was.</p>
            <p>The Murderer ſpent the Night in Gallopping up and down the Wood, whither he had made his eſcape: But whether the horrour of what he had done had diſturbed his mind, or that Heaven would not that ſo great a Crime ſhould remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, it was impoſſible for this wretch to get from the place where
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36062:67"/>
he had committed it, and he was taken the next day, being ſo weary that he was not able to ſtir any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> cauſed him to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in her preſence; he declared that it was the Admiral who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to kill the Duke of <hi>Guiſe;</hi> that at firſt he had found a repugnance to this action, and that having been once already in the Camp upon the ſame deſign, he had been touched with Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and returned to <hi>Orleans,</hi> but that the Admiral and two Miniſters, of whom <hi>Beza</hi> was one, had ſo preſſed him, that he was not able to reſiſt their perſuaſions. But they cleared themſelves of this buſineſs by publick Writings, and perfect Demonſtrations, of their being no ways concerned in this Aſſaſſinate, and deſired likewiſe, that <hi>Poltrot</hi> might be kept ſo long till the Truth was found out. And though the Admiral confeſſed in his Letter to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36062:67"/>
the Queen, that he could not be ſorry for an accident that freed the Reformed Religion from its greateſt Enemy, he proteſted, that he had never ſpoken to <hi>Poltrot,</hi> and that he did not ſo much as know his Face.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, <hi>Guiſe</hi> finding his death approaching, prepared himſelf for it by all the actions of Piety that can be done by a Man under thoſe Circumſtances. I ſhall mention here ſome of his laſt Words, not ſuch as I have imagined them, as moſt Hiſtorians do, but as they have been written by the Biſhop of <hi>Ries,</hi> who aſſiſted him to his laſt gaſp, and who has Collected them in a Letter he Addreſſes to <hi>Charles the Ninth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After having told the <hi>Queen,</hi> that he had no other regret in leaving the World, than to leave it in a time when the King and She might have ſome occaſion for his Service; He adviſed her to employ all things to make Peace; and that it was the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36062:68"/>
only means of appeaſing the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that ſet <hi>France</hi> in a Cumbuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; that ſhe knew very well, that he had never given her any other Counſel; and that at the very time when he thought himſelf ſure of taking <hi>Orleans,</hi> it was his Advice, That new Propoſitions of accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation ſhould be made to the <hi>Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots;</hi> and that in ſhort, all thoſe who Counſelled a War, were neither good <hi>French-men,</hi> nor good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to the King.</p>
            <p>Then turning towards his Wife, who was all in Tears near his Bed, and having put her in mind of the Affection he had always had for her, he recommended to her the Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their mutual Children, giving her an abſolute Power over them, and permitting her to retrench a third part of their ſhares who ſhould be diſobedient to her, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence thoſe ſhe ſhould be moſt ſatisfied with; praying God to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh her likewiſe, as ſhe would mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:36062:68"/>
it, in caſe ſhe had not for them the Sentiments that a good Mother ought to have. <hi>Farewell,</hi> ſaid he to her, graſping her Hand, <hi>I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I have but a ſhort time to ſee you: remember me without deſiring to revenge my Death, ſince that God Commands us to pardon our Enemies, and that I do pardon him who has ſo grievouſly aſſaſſinated me.</hi> Then cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the young Prince of <hi>Joinville,</hi> his Eldeſt Son, to come to him, <hi>My Son,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>you have heard what I have ſaid to your Mother: The Condition thou ſeeſt me in, will be to thee, as long as thou liveſt, a fine Inſtruction of the Vanity of the things of this World, as often as thou ſhalt remember, that a Great General, in the midſt of his Army, was not able to defend himſelf from the treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a ſimple Souldier. I do not ſay this out of Vanity, but to make thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the better, that what ſ<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ems greateſt in the Eyes of men, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before God, and perhaps de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:36062:69"/>
in a moment. I have had great Offices, which I have always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to acquit my ſelf of, as I ought to do: Do you the ſame in thoſe it ſhall pleaſe the King and Queen to honour thee with; but above all, think rather of meriting them by thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, than of obtaining them by thy Cares, and by Intrigues, which are very often Criminal. My dear Child, have always the Fear of God, and Love of Vertue, before thy Eyes: but remember, that theſe Sentiments are only learnt and kept in the Commerce of good People; wherefore contract Friendſhip with ſuch Perſons as are Vertuous, and carefully avoid irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Companies, which the Court is but too full of, and where the greateſt Crimes are excuſed under the Notion of Follies of Youth. God judges other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of them than men do, and there are no ſmall Crimes before him. I heartily beſeech him, that he would beſtow on thee the Grace to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe Counſels: it is all that I
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36062:69"/>
wiſh thee, in giving thee my Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and is what I am going to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of him in Heaven, where I hope his Goodneſs will not diſdain to receive me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then looking upon all his Friends and his Brothers, who were weeping, he thanked them for their Cares, and deſired them not to grieve for his Death: and as they exclaimed againſt the blackneſs of that horrible Aſſaſſinate, <hi>I avow to you,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>that I am troubled at it for the Honour of</hi> France. <hi>I ſhould never have believed that it could have born Men capable of committing an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that would raiſe a horrour in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. But God, from whom I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Pardon for my Faults, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to pardon our Enemies: I heartily pardon them, and I take him to Witneſs the ſincerity of the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have had all my Life time, for the good and repoſe of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="130" facs="tcp:36062:70"/>
After that, he would hear no more talk of things of this World, and dyed at length, on the ſixth day after he had received his Wound, being hardly fifty years old.</p>
            <p>He was ſenſibly regretted by all thoſe whom his Death was of no advantage to. The Souldiers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored him as their Father; and they run through all the Camp, asking one another, where they ſhould find ſuch another General as they had newly loſt; who is it that would expoſe himſelf to dangers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them? And who would hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward make inquiry for the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and diſtribute to them Money with his own Hands? And, in ſhort, who would ſhelter them from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gours and hardneſs of the <hi>Conſtable?</hi> The <hi>Catholicks</hi> ſaid, that they had loſt their Protectour, and looked upon his Death, as a Martyr, who had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the defence of the Faith.</p>
            <p>He left his Family incommoded and charged with Debts, which is
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36062:70"/>
perhaps as glorious to a Man who has had the chiefeſt Places and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdom, as it is ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a private Perſon.</p>
            <p>He had all the Qualities, which have ever made the greateſt Heroes; and if his Enemies have reproached him with any thing, he was not ſo much to be accuſed, as the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Age, and the diſorders which happened during his time.</p>
            <p>He was a true Friend, a Quality pretty rare at Court: and having made the Fortune of a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons, even thoſe who moſt decryed his Conduct, have been obliged to allow, that he never advanced any other than Perſons of a known and extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. He was exact, even to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all himſelf, when he was in War, going always in Perſon to view the Places he deſigned to Attacque, which he underſtood better than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Man of that Age. He wrote all his Diſpatches with hs own Hand, and
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:36062:71"/>
he ſpent whole Nights ſometimes in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>When he was wounded at <hi>Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne,</hi> his Life was deſpaired of, the Chyrurgions were obliged to ſet their Feet againſt his Head to draw out the piece of the Lance that ſtuck in it; and they feared that the violence of the pain would make him expire in their Hands. But he was the firſt to encourage them; and <hi>du Bellay</hi> ſays, that he ſuffered all that cruel Operation with the ſame Tranquillity, as if they had only pulled away a Hair.</p>
            <p>His Civility and the ſweetneſs of his Carriage procured him the love of all People: He never ſaid any thing that any body could be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at: and if ſome haſty Word e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped from him, he repaired it with an extraordinary care. He was told that a Gentleman, called <hi>Saint Val,</hi> complained that he had ſtruck him with his Sword on that day that the Battle of <hi>Renty</hi> was fought, becauſe
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36062:71"/>
he was too eager to engage the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, and out-went his Ranks. He promiſed to give him ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein. And indeed, having met with him in the Kings Tent, he told him before all the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Mounſieur</hi> de Saint Val, <hi>you ought not to be diſpleaſed at my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to ſtrike you with my Sword, ſince far from being diſadvantageous to you, it makes appear how much ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour you had to ſight the Enemies. I take all theſe Gentlemen here to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and deſire of you that we may live Friends as before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was ſo brave, as never to be amazed at any thing; and from thence comes the preſence of mind which he preſerves in the greateſt dangers.</p>
            <p>They once ſhewed him a Man who had ſeveral times boaſted that he would kill him. He looked ſquintingly upon him, and told thoſe who had ſhown him to him, <hi>That Man will never kill me; he is not
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36062:72"/>
worth the trouble of taking into Cuſtody.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Death of the King of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre,</hi> who was kill'd at the Siege of <hi>Rouen,</hi> it was the general apprehenſion, that the Kings Army would disband of it ſelf, being no longer commanded by a Prince of the Blood: And the <hi>Queen</hi> was told, that all the Officers talked of going to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde. No, no, Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Guiſe</hi> to her, <hi>be not affraid, the number of thoſe who ſhall quit your Army will be very ſmall; and beſides, they will be ſuch as that we ſhall gain by loſing them. Traytors do but hurt where they are; but if there be any here, I ſhall ſtick to them ſo cloſe, and have them ſo well watched, that they ſhall not dare ſo much as to make a Leaf tremble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot forbear adding one word more, which will help extreamly to make known the Character of his mind and his humour. Some Company talking one day of the Troubles that begun to be a brood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>France,</hi> after the Death of <hi>Henry the Second, Montluc,</hi> quick and boiling, like a <hi>Gaſcon</hi> as he was, ſaid, That there was no other cauſes of theſe ills, than the Ambition of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy'd the great Actions of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd every where that he had uſurped
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36062:72"/>
over him the Government of the State. <hi>He had diſcourſed thereof to me,</hi> continued <hi>Montluc, Whereupon I made him anſwer, That if he had ſuch great pretenſions, you ought each of you, ſome fair Morning, to examin them with a good Sword, and that I was ſure you would make good my Words. Guiſe,</hi> who eaſily foreſaw the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that ſuch a Diſcourſe might have, anſwered him very coldly, <hi>Montluc, have you an Order ſigned from the King of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varre, <hi>to talk to me after this manner?</hi> And <hi>Montluc</hi> replying, that he had not, and that he had framed all this himſelf; <hi>You think,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>that you are ſtill in</hi> Piemont, <hi>diverting your ſelf, in ſeeing your Souldiers fight againſt one another; learn a little, that the King of</hi> Navarre <hi>and I am not born to exerciſe your Imaginations. I do not believe that I have any thing to diſpute with him, or that he does complain of me. When he lets me hear from him, he ſhall hear from me. We have long known one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All the learned Men of his time ſtrove to make Epitaphs on him, which are ſtill in being. But if it is a great honour to be commended by a Man who himſelf merits the higheſt Applauſes, we may ſay that nothing is more glorious to the memory of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> than the Verſes which
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36062:73"/>
have been made of him by the Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Chancellour</hi> of the <hi>Hoſpital.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Virtue was as much admired by Strangers, as by <hi>French-men:</hi> The <hi>Itali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, who cannot be reproached with Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding others to exceſs, call'd him <hi>The Great Duke of Guiſe;</hi> and at the interview of <hi>Bayonne,</hi> which was two years after his Death, they ſeemed extream earneſt to ſee his <hi>Widow,</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi> his Son, never calling them otherwiſe than <hi>la muger y el hijo d'aquel gran Ducque di Guiſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Body was carried to the <hi>Chartreux,</hi> and from then to <hi>Noſtre Dame,</hi> where the Funeral Rites were very Magnificent, before they carried him to <hi>Joinville,</hi> where he was buried. The wretched <hi>Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trot</hi> had the ſame puniſhment inflicted on him, as thoſe have who have made at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temps upon the ſacred Perſons of our Kings. But this was not the leaſt venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that was taken of this Crime, and we may ſay, that never any one Mans Death has ſet ſo much blood a flowing, nor drawn after it ſo great a number of Illuſtrious Victimes.</p>
