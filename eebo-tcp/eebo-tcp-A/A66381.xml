         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Question.</head>
            <head type="sub">Q. Whether things not prescribed in the Word
of God, may be Lawfully used in Divine
Worship?</head>
            <p>BEfore I proceed to the Case it self, it will be fit
to consider what the things are which the
Question more immediately respects. For the
better understanding of which, we may observe,</p>
            <p>1. That there are Essential parts of Divine Worship,
and which are, either by Nature or Revelation, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined,
that they are in all Ages necessary: In Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Religion, such are the Objects of it, which must
be Divine; such are the acknowledgments of Honour,
and Reverence, due and peculiar to those Objects, as
Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the Christian Religion, such are the
Sacraments of Baptism, and the Lord's Supper. These
are always to be the same in the Church.</p>
            <p>2. There are other things relating to Divine Worship,
which are arbitrary and variable, and determined ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to circumstances, as Gesture, Place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:62494:3"/>
As to the former it's granted by the contending Parties,
that they are all already prescribed, and that nothing
in that kind can be added to what is already prescribed,
nor can any thing so prescribed be altered, or abolished.
Nothing now can be made necessary and binding to
all Persons, Places, and Ages, that was not so from the
beginning of Christianity; and nothing that was once
made so by Divine Authority can be rendred void or
unnecessary by any other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore the Question is to be applied to the latter,
and then it's no other than,</hi> Whether things in their own
nature Indifferent, though not prescribed in the Word of
God, may be lawfully used in Divine Worship? Or, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any thing Indifferent in the Worship of
God?</p>
            <p>Toward the resolution of which, I shall
<list>
                  <item>1. Enquire into the Nature, and state the Notion of
things Indifferent.</item>
                  <item>2. Shew that things Indifferent may be Lawfully
used in Divine Worship.</item>
                  <item>3. Consider how we may know what things are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
in the Worship of God.</item>
                  <item>4. How we are to Determine our selves in the use of
Indifferent things so applied.</item>
                  <item>5. Shew that there is nothing required in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God in our Church, but what is either Necessary
in it self, and so binding to all Christians; or what is
Indifferent, and so may be Lawfully used by them.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>I shall enquire into the Nature, and state the Notion
of things Indifferent.</hi> In doing of which we are to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
that all things with reference to Practice are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
to these three Heads:
<list>
                  <item>First, Duty.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, Sin.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62494:3"/>
Thirdly, Neither Duty nor Sin.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Duty is either so Morally, and in its own Nature, or
made so by Divine and Positive Command. Sin is so
in its own Nature, or made and declared to be such by
Divine and Positive Prohibition. Neither Duty nor Sin,
is that which no Law, either of Nature or Revelation,
hath determined; and is usually known by the Name
of <hi>Indifferent,</hi> that is, it's of a middle Nature, partaking
in it self of neither extremes, and may be indifferently
used or forborn, as in Reason and Prudence shall be
thought meet. Things of this kind the Apostle calls
<hi>Lawful, 1 Cor. 10. 23. &amp;c.</hi> because they are the subject
of no Law, and what are therefore Lawful to us, and
which without Sin we may either chuse or refuse. Thus
the Apostle doth determine, <hi>Rom. 4. 15. Where no
Law is there is no Transgression,</hi> that is, it can be no
transgression to omit that which the Law doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn,
nor to do that which it doth not forbid; for
else that would be a Duty which the Law doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn,
and that would be a Sin which it doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid;
which is in effect to say there is a Law where there
is none, or that Duty and Sin are so without respect to
any Law. But now if Duty be Duty because it's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd,
and Sin be Sin because it's forbidden, then In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
is Indifferent because it's neither injoyn'd nor
forbidden. For as to make it a Duty there needs a
Command, and to make it a Sin there needs a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
so where there is neither Command nor Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it's neither Duty nor Sin, and must be therefore
Indifferent, Lawful, and Free. So that we may as well
know by the Silence of the Law what is Indifferent, as
we may know by its Authority what is a Duty or a
Sin. And I have no more Reason to think that a Duty
or a Sin which it takes no notice of (since all Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
ariseth from a Law) than that not to be a Duty or a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62494:4"/>
Sin which it doth: The Nature of Lawful things being
as much determined so to be, by the want of such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
as that of Necessary is determined by it: And
he that shall say that's a Duty or a Sin which is not so
made and declared by any Law, may as well say that's
no Duty or Sin which there is a Law about. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
there must be a Law to make it a Transgression,
and the want of a Law doth necessarily suppose it to be
none, and what there is no Law for or against, remains
Indifferent in it self, and Lawful to us. As for instance,
suppose there should be a Dispute concerning Days set
apart for the Service and Worship of God, how must
this be determined but by the Law of Nature or Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
and how shall we be resolved in the case, but
by considering what the Law injoyns or forbids in it?
If we find it not injoyn'd, it can be of it self no Duty;
if we find it not forbidden, it can be of it self no Sin;
and consequently it's Lawful and Indifferent, and in
what we neither Sin by omitting nor observing. So
the Apostle concludes, <hi>Rom. 14. 6. He that regardeth a
day, regardeth it unto the Lord, and he that regardeth not
the day, unto the Lord he doth not regard it;</hi> that is, there
was no Law requiring it, and so making the observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it Necessary; and no Law forbidding it, and so
making the observation of it Sinful; and therefore
Christians were at Liberty to observe, or not to observe
it as they pleas'd; and in both they did well, if so be
they had <hi>a regard to the Lord</hi> in it.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>I shall shew that there are things Indifferent in the
Worship of God, and that such things, though not prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
may be lawfully used in it.</hi> 'Tis allowed by all that
there is no Command to be expected about the Natural
Circumstances of action, and which the Service can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be celebrated without, such as Time and Place,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62494:4"/>
and that these are left to humane Prudence to fix and
determine. But what those Natural Circumstances
are is not so universally agreed to. And if they be such
as aforesaid, that is, <hi>such as the action cannot be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without,</hi> then it will very much serve to justify most
of the things in dispute, and defend our Church in the
use and practice of them. For what is there almost
in that kind amongst us, which is not Naturally or
Morally necessary to the action, and if Time and Place
fall under humane determination, because they are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
necessary, then why not also Gesture and Habit,
which Worship can no more Naturally be celebrated
without, than the former; and consequently a Surplice,
or Kneeling and Standing, may be alike lawfully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
and used, as Time for assembling together, and
a Church to assemble and officiate in. And what Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Circumstances are to a Natural action, that are
Moral Circumstances to a Moral action; and there are
Moral as necessary to a Moral action, as there are Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
necessary to a Natural action. As for example,
what Time and Place are to Natural, that are Method
and Order to Moral and Religious acts, and can no more
be separated from these than the other can be separated
from the former, and therefore the Method and Order
of Administration in Divine Worship (where not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
determined and appointed by God) may as well
be determined by Men, as Time and Place, with respect
to the nature, end, and use of the Service. So that
the exception made against humane Appointments in
Divine Worship, <hi>viz. (that all but natural circumstances
must have a Divine Command to legitimate their use;</hi> and
that <hi>whatever is not prescribed, is therefore prohibited)</hi>
is of no service to them that plead it; and it remains
good so far notwithstanding, that there are things Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
in the Worship of God, and that the outward
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62494:5"/>
Order and Administration of it is left to Christian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
And this I shall more particularly prove.</p>
            <p>1. From the consideration of the Rules laid down in
the Gospel, relating to the administration of Divine
Worship which (except what refer to the Elements,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the Sacraments) are taken from the Nature of
the thing; and so always were obliging to all Ages under
the several variations and forms of Divine Worship,
and will be always so to all Christians in the World, <hi>viz.</hi>
such as respect <hi>Order, Decency</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi> insisted
upon, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 26, 40. So that we are no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
bound, than as bound by these measures, and
where not bound by them we are free. For as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Ages from the beginning of the World, where
revelation did not interpose (as it did under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saical
Dispensation) all persons were left at liberty, and
if so be they had a respect to those natural rules, might
choose what ways they pleased for the regulation of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Worship: So when under the Gospel we have no
other than those Natural rules (except as above excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
the particular circumstances are as much now the
matter of our free choice, as they were then, and this
or that may be used and observed, as the Case requireth
and Occasion serves. So that if ever there were things
Indifferent in Gods Worship, and the administration of
it was left to the Consideration and Prudence of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,
it is so still, since the Gospel keeps to those eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Rules which even the Nature of the Thing hath
invariably established, and which, if it ever was sufficient
for the guiding of the Church of God in those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
is certainly so when the Nature of Man is improved
by new helps, and so he is more capable of judging what
may be sutable to that essential Worship which God
hath prescribed under the Gospel, and to Him whom
that Worship is directed to. But then that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62494:5"/>
this, is that those Rules are also general; and
such as will in their use and end respect all People in
the World. The Apostles in all their Discourses upon
this subject rarely do descend to particulars, and in
what they do, shew how far Custom and Charity, and
the Reason of the thing ought to govern us; as in the
case of mens being Uncovered in the Worship of God,
for which the Apostle doth argue not from Institution,
but the Nature and Decency of it, being in token of
their preheminence, and the headship they have over
the Woman, <hi>&amp;c. 1. Cor. 11. 47.</hi> But otherwise they
without doubt thought it unpracticable to tye all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
up to the same Modes and Circumstances, or if
practicable that it was not worth the while, when the
Worship might as well be Administred, and God as
much Honoured by one as the other. Now if they
did think it sufficient to prescribe only in this General
way, it must needs be that the particulars of those Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals
must be Indifferent, and that the chusing of one
particular before the other was left to Christian Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
And if it should be said (as it is) that <hi>when
the things are determined in general, the particulars are
therein also vertually determined,</hi> and so are not Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
I shall content my self to reply, that by this
way of arguing there would be nothing Indifferent in
the World: There being nothing how Lawful and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different
soever in it self, but what we are limited by
General Rules in the use of. As for example, all Meats
are now Lawful to Christians, but yet there are Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rules by which we are determined in the use of
them, such as our own Constitution, and our Quality,
or Scandal given to others: But the being thus boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by such Rules, doth not change the Nature of
those Meats, and make them to be other than Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
So it is in the Worship of God, for the better
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62494:6"/>
Administration of which there are general Rules laid
down, and according to which we are to be determined in
our choice of particulars, but yet the particulars not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
are Indifferent, and matter of Christian
Liberty, and what humane prudence is to regulate
us in.</p>
            <p>All which will yet be further confirmed by consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Nature of the things which are the Subject of
those general Rules, <hi>viz, Order, Decency</hi> and <hi>Edification,</hi>
which do mostly, if not altogether, depend upon vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
circumstances, and may be different according to
those circumstances; sometimes this, and at other times
that being subservient thereunto. As for instance, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
doth generally depend upon Custom, and the
Custom of Ages and Countries being different, Decency
in one Age or Country may be and often is quite diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
from what it is in another. It was once comely
amongst some Nations to be covered in Divine Worship,
and practised both amongst the <hi>Jews</hi> in their Synagogues,
as the Apostle doth insinuate, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 14. and their
own Authors do acknowledge<note n="a" place="margin">Lightf. Hor. Hebr. in 1 Cor. 11. 4.</note>; and also amongst the
<note n="b" place="margin">Plut. Probl. Rom.</note> 
               <hi>Romans.</hi> But it was <hi>Comely</hi> amongst others to be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered,
as amongst the <hi>Grecians,</hi>
               <note n="c" place="margin">Macrob. Saturn. l. 3. c. 6.</note> who in those Times
giving Laws of Civility, and in many things of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
too to other Nations, it became a prevailing
Custom, and was, as a thing decent, introduced into
the Christian Church. Thus it is also as to <hi>Edification,</hi>
which doth in like manner often depend upon circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
and according to those circumstances the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification
of the Church in its Peace, Union, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
may be promoted or hindered, and that may be
for Edification in one Age or Church, which is not so
in another.</p>
            <p>Thus the being covered in Divine Worship was for
Edification in the <hi>Jewish</hi> Church, being used in token
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62494:6"/>
of Fear and Reverence, Distance and Subjection; in
allusion to which the <hi>Seraphims</hi> are represented appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ng
before God, after that manner, <hi>Isai. 6. 2.</hi> and in
mitation of whom the Apostle pleads that Women
should be vailed in Religious Assemblies, in token of
Subjection and Shamefacedness, 1 <hi>Cor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 11. 10. But on
the contrary He doth Judge and Determin that, for
the Reasons above given, it was better and more for
Edification, that Men should be therein Uncovered.
So the <hi>Love-feasts,</hi> and <hi>Holy-kiss</hi> of Charity were at the
first thought good for Edification, and were according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
used in Apostolical times,<note place="margin">Chrysost. and Theophyl. in 1 Cor. 11. 17.</note> (being an Excellent and Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
Admirable and Friendly, Custom) as thereby was signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
the Universal Love and Charity that Christians
ought to maintain,<note place="margin">Tertul. Apol. c. 39. de orat. l. 6.</note> and which they should at all times
but especially in Divine Worship be forward to express
and renew: But when Disorder and Licentiousness a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose
from them,<note place="margin">Concil. Laod. c. 28. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> they were generally laid aside, and
Abolished by Authority.</p>
            <p>So it was thought to be for Edification in the Primitive
Church to Administer Baptism by immersion or dipping,
and the Apostle doth make use of it as an excellent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to newness of life, <hi>Rom. 6. 3, 4.</hi> and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
the signification of it, and the practice of the
Church for a long time, a Charitable reason hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled
it, and brought in Sprinkling instead of it. Thus
sitting at the Lords Supper is accounted decent by some,
and for Edification, as it's a table posture, and is a sign
of our being feasted by God; and yet in a general Synod
of the Reformed Churches in <hi>Poland,</hi> &amp;c. it was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
that <hi>forasmuch as sitting was introduced first by the</hi>
Arrians <hi>(beside the Custom used in all the Evangelical
Churches throughout</hi> Europe,<note place="margin">Synod. Petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cov. conclus. 4.</note>) <hi>we reject it as peculiar to
them (that as they do irreverently treat Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">An. 1578.</note> 
               <hi>so also his
Sacred appointments) and as a Ceremony less Comely and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62494:7"/>
Devout, and to many very offensive.</hi> So that Order,
Decency, and Edification being generally mutable
things, and varying as circumstances vary, there could
in the nature of the thing be only general rules prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and so the particulars must be left to discretion, and
to be determined by those that are best able and have
Authority to judge of the circumstances, and to pick
out of them those which are Indifferent, what may best
serve the ends of Religion, and the honour of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions.</p>
            <p>2. I shall prove that <hi>things Indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
though not prescribed, may be Lawfully used in Divine
Worship,</hi> from the practice of our Saviour and his Apostles.
Under the Law the Constitution was very exact, the
Rites and Orders of it very particular, and the Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them punctually required. But as it was not
so precise but that many things respecting the outward
order were added, so some things were altered upon
prudential considerations; and by the addition or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of which the Authority of that Law was not
conceived to be infringed, nor violated; as it's evident
from the respect which our Saviour shewed to them, and
his compliance with them. An instance of this is the
Synagogual Worship; It's a controversy whether there
was any provision made under the Law for the places
themselves, the intimations of that are (if any) very
obscure, but there are not so much as any intimations
of the manner and order or parts of the Worship there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
to be observed; and yet we find such there was,
<hi>Acts 15. 21.</hi> Moses <hi>being read and preached there every
Sabbath day;</hi> and that our Saviour frequently resorted
to it and bore a part in it, <hi>John, 18. 20,</hi> &amp;c. The like
temper we find him of, when he used the Cup of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
after the manner of the <hi>Jews,</hi> in the Passover, though
there was no institution for it; and that it was as many
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:62494:7"/>
other things, taken up and used amongst them by way
of signification, and as a Testimony of entire Friendship,
and Charity, <hi>Luke, 22. 17.</hi> But I conceive alteration
of circumstances in the institution is much more excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable
than the addition of such to it, and yet this
was both done by them and observed by our Saviour,
when there was nothing else to oblige him, but only
a condescension to them in such usages and rites as were
inoffensive in themselves, and what were then generally
used in the Church. That the posture first required
and used in the Passover was standing, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances,
being to be eat with Staves in their Hands and
Shoes on their Feet,<note place="margin">Philo. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crif. Able, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do prove, and is affirmed by
the <hi>Jews;</hi> and it is as manifest that the <hi>Jews</hi> in the
time of our Saviour, and for a long time before, did
recede from it, and did eat it in the posture of discumben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
whether it was as they looked upon themselves as
settled in the possession of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which they were at
the first institution Travelling towards; or, as it's said
by the later <hi>Jews,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lightf. Hor. Matth. c. 26. 20.</note> because it was <hi>a sign of Liberty, and
after the manner of Kings and Great men,</hi> is not so materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
as it is that our Saviour did follow this Custom, and
complied with this practice of theirs without hesitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And thus did the Apostles when they observ'd the
hours of Prayer, <hi>Acts, 3. 1.</hi> which were of humane
institution as well as the Pray<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs themselves, (for
without doubt they were publick Prayers, which were
used in the Temple,) but though the place was, yet that
service was of no more Authority than what was used
in the Synagogues. Now if the <hi>Jews</hi> did thus institute
and alter things relating to external Order and Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration,
according as the case might require, and it
was lawful for them so to do (as it's plain from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
of our Saviour and the Apostles with them in
it) then much more may it be supposed lawful for the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62494:8"/>
Christian Church to exercise that liberty when they
have no other than such general rules for their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as they had then, without such particulars as they
had.</p>
            <p>And that this is no other than a certain Truth will
appear from the same liberty taken in Apostolical times
in Religious Assemblies, when the Christian Church
not only complied with the <hi>Jews</hi> in such Rites as they
were under no Obligation, but that of Charity, to use, and
which they did use because they were not forbidden,
and so lawful; (as when St. <hi>Paul</hi> took upon him a
Vow, <hi>Acts. 21. 26.)</hi> but also had some Observances
of its own, that were of a ritual nature, and as they
were taken up so might be laid down upon prudential
consideration. Such I account was <hi>the Washing the
Disciples Feet,</hi> which was done by our Saviour in token
of the Humility he was to be a president of, and would
have them follow him in; and which it seems was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved
amongst them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10. and for a long time after
continued in a sort in some Churches<note n="a" place="margin">Ambros. Tom. 4. l. 3. de Sacrament. c. 1.</note>. Such also
were the <hi>Love-feasts</hi> at the Administration of the Lords
Supper; and the <hi>Holy-kiss</hi> used then amongst Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
if not as a constant attendant upon all publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
yet to be sure at Prayer<note n="b" place="margin">Tertul. de orat. c. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4.</note>. Which and the
like usages, however taken up, yet were in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Church no other than Indifferent, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
were upon the abuse of them (as I observed
before) discarded. From all which it appears, that
there was no such thing as Prescription expected before
any Rite should be introduced into the Church, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it would be lawful for Christians to use it, but that
where it was not forbidden, the Practice of the Church
was to determine them; and if Prescription had been
thought necessary for every thing used in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,
which was not Natural, then certainly our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:62494:8"/>
and his Apostles would never have used or encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
others to use any thing that wanted such Authority,
and that was not of Divine Institution.</p>
            <p>Now if it should be objected that these usages of the
Christian Church were <hi>Civil observances,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ames. Fresh Suit, l. 2. Sect. 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 334.</note> 
               <hi>and used as
well out of God's Worship as in it;</hi> and therefore what
there needed no institution for, and might be lawfully
used without. I answer 1. That this doth justify most of
the usages contended for, and there would be nothing
unlawful in using a White Garment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in Divine
Service,<note place="margin">Casaub. Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. 16. c. 73.</note> since that <hi>as a sign of Royalty and Dignity</hi> was
used in Civil as well as Religious cases, and according
to this Argument may therefore lawfully be used in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious,
because it was in Civil.</p>
            <p>Secondly, They must say that either a Civil obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
when used in Religious Worship, remains Civil,
notwithstanding its being so applied, or that it's Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
whilst so applied; if the former then Kneeling or
Standing in the Worship of God would be no acts of
Adoration and not be Religious, because those postures
are used in Civil matters; if the latter, then it must be
granted that there may be Rites used in the Worship of
God and to a Religious end, which there is no Divine
Prescription for.</p>
            <p>Nay Thirdly, It's evident that these and the like were
not used by the Christians as meer Civil Rites; this I
think is made evident, as to Washing the Feet, by a
Learned Person<note n="a" place="margin">Buxtorf. Exercit. Hist. Sacr. Coenae</note>; and not only was the kiss of Charity
called the <hi>Holy-kiss</hi> in Scripture, but by the Fathers,
(notwithstanding what is<note n="b" place="margin">Ames. ibid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> p. 342. n. XXX.</note> objected) <hi>the Seal of Prayer,</hi>
and <hi>the Seal of Reconciliation,</hi> and both consistent, the
one as it was an attendant upon that office, the other
as it was a testimony of their Charity and Reconciliation
to each other in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:62494:9"/>
Fourthly, If the being Civil usages did make them
which were originally so, to be lawful in or at Divine
Worship, then there is nothing that is used out of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
in Civil cases and affairs, but may be introduced
into the Church; since if it be for that reason that any
usages of that kind are defended, the reason will as well
defend all as one. And then the Histrionical Practices
of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> might warantably be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
as the <hi>rocking of a Babe in a Cradle at night, at
the Nativity time; the Harrowing of Hell at Easter,</hi> &amp;c.
Then <hi>a Maypole may be brought into the Church for Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
to Dance-about and Climb up on, in sign of their desire
to seek the things above; and a stiff Straw put into the
Childs Hand, for a sign of Fighting against Spiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
as with a Spear;</hi> And all the absurdities of that
Nature charged injuriously upon our Proceedings<note n="a" place="margin">Ames. ibid. l. 1. c. 3. p. 17.</note>
would return with success upon themselves: Since all
these are fetched from Customs and Practices in Secular
matters.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If this be a reason to Defend the Use of Rites
in the Christian Church, <hi>because they are used out of it,
and in Civil cases;</hi> then what will become of that position,
before spoken of, and generally asserted by those who
oppose us, that <hi>nothing is to be used in the Worship of
God without Prescription, except the Natural Circumstances
of Action;</hi> for though Civil and Natural are sometimes
coincident, yet they may be and often are Separated;
for Feasting and Salutation are Civil usages, but are no
Natural Circumstances in Divine Worship, and which
that cannot be performed without. And if these and
the like were used in the Church, and applied and annexed
to Divine Worship; then the reason upon which they
were introduced and used doth, wherever that reason
is, justify the like Practice, and we are left still to choose
and act according to the Permission and Allowance that
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62494:9"/>
is given us; that is, all such things that are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
are just matter of our Christian Liberty, and there
is no Sin in a Prudent exercise of it.</p>
            <p>3. I shall further prove and strengthen the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that <hi>things Indifferent, though not prescribed, may
be lawfully used in Divine Worship,</hi> from the ill conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
attending the contrary; one of which is, that
if we hold all things not commanded to be prohibited,
we shall find no Church or Religious Society in the
World but are Guilty; and if the doing so makes Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with a Church unlawful, there is no Church
we can hold Communion with. There are some
Churches that do maintain and use such things as the
Scripture expresly condemns, and do lay aside such as
the Scripture requires; as the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in its
Worshipping Saints and Angels, and denying the Cup
to the Laity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And these things make it necessary
for those to quit its Communion that are of it, and for
those to avoid it that are not in it. But other Churches
there are that are Guilty of no such Fundamental
Errors and fatal miscarriages, and may so far lawfully
be Communicated with. But even none of these are
there, but what, either wittingly or unwittingly, do take
the liberty of using what the Scripture hath no where
required. It was notoriously so in the Ancient Church
when some Customs did universally obtain amongst
them; as the Anniversary Solemnities of the Passion,
Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ, and Descent of
the Holy-Ghost, the receiving of the Lords Supper Fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<note n="a" place="margin">Aug. Epis. 118. Januar.</note> the Praying toward the East<note n="b" place="margin">Basil. de Spir. S. c. 27.</note>; the Standing in
their Devotions on the Lords Days,<note n="c" place="margin">Aug. Epis. 119. Januar.</note> especially from
<hi>Easter</hi> to <hi>Whitsuntide;</hi> the Dipping the Baptized thrice
in Water<note n="d" place="margin">Ambros. lib. 2. de Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. c. 7.</note>, <hi>&amp;c..</hi> Now whatever some of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
might plead for any of these from Scriptures mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood,
yet it's plain that none of these are required
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:62494:10"/>
in Scripture, and if so, a Person that holds it unlawful
to use any thing uncommanded, and to hold Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
with a Church so using, must have separated from
the Catholick Church, since (if there be Credit to be
given to the Fathers so reporting) they all agreed in
the use and practice of the things above recited. And
he that held all fixed Holy-Days of Ecclesiastical
Institution unlawful, and all Ceremonies not instituted
by God to be prohibited, must not have Worshipped
with them, who did not only thus do, but thought
it unlawful, when universally Practised to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>But again as there were some Rites universally held
in estimation, so there were others that were peculiar to
some Churches, and that were not thought to be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out of that Particular Communion, as when in
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it was the Custom to Fast on the
Saturday; and of most others to make no such distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
betwixt that and other days.<note n="a" place="margin">Aug. Epist. 118.</note> In the Church
of <hi>Milain</hi> they Washed the Feet of those that were to
be Baptized, but in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they used it
not<note n="b" place="margin">Ambros. l. 3. de Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. c. 1.</note>. Now if persons did believe such things unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
they could have no Communion with any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church, because no Church was without such Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commanded
Rites; or if they could be so fond as to
think the Rites of their own Church to be of Divine
Institution, yet how could they have Communion with
a Church, where the contrary Custom did prevail, as
in the cases abovesaid. And as it was then, so it is now
with all stated and settled Churches in the World, who
do Practise against this Principle, and either expect not
or are not able to find a Command for every thing establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
amongst them; and that Practise with as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety
to each other as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Milain</hi>
once did. So in some Churches they receive the Lord's
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62494:10"/>
Supper Kneeling, in some Standing, in others Sitting. In
some they Sprinkle the Child in Baptism but once, and
in others thrice. Now there would be no reconciling
of these one to another, and no possibility of holding
Communion with them under these circumstances, or
of being a Member of any Church, if we must have
an institution for every thing done in the Worship of
God, and that we must joyn in nothing, which has it
not. As for Instance what Church is there in the World,
which has not some form or forms of Prayer, and whose
Service for the most part (generally speaking) is not
made up of them; especially that doth not use them
in the Administration of the Sacraments. But now if
a Person holds that whatever is not prescribed is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,
and that forms of Prayer are no where prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then he cannot joyn with the Church so using, but
while in the body of the Church by residence, he must
be no Member of that Body in Communion.</p>
            <p>Nay further, if this be true, then none must hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with them who are of this Opinion; since those
that pretend most to it, and urge it as a reason against
Communion with us, live in contradiction to it,
and do Practise and Use things which they have no
more Authority, nor can give more reason for, than we
do for the things they condemn, and that is, that they
are lawful, expedient, and convenient. As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
let us consider the Sacraments, in which, if any
thing, we might expect particular Prescription, because
they are meer Institutions; where do they find that the
Baptized Person is necessarily to be Sprinkled? What
Command or Example have they for it, or what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
more than the reason of the thing taken from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedience
and the general Practice of the Church of God
in colder Climates? And yet this is as much used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them that pretend to keep exactly to the Rule
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:62494:11"/>
of Scripture, as it is amongst us that take a liberty in
things Uncommanded; but with this difference, that
they do it upon the supposition of a Command, and
so make it necessary, and our Church leaves it, as it is,
Indifferent. Again, where do they find a Command for
Sitting at the Lord's Supper, or so much as an Example?
(For the Posture of our Saviour is left very uncertain.)
Where again do they find a Command for the necessary
use of conceived Prayer, and that that, and no other,
should be used in the publick Worship of God? And that
they must prove that maintain publick Forms unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
Where again do they find it required that an Oath
is to be taken by laying the Hand on the Gospel and
Kissing the Book? which is both a Natural and Instituted
part of Worship, being a Solemn Invocation of God
and an Appeal to him, with an acknowledgment of
his Omniscience, and Omnipresence; his Providence
and Government of the World; his Truth and Justice
to Right the Innocent and Punish the Guilty; all which
is owned and testified by Kissing that Book that God
has declared this more especially in. And if we more
particularly descend to those that differ from us in this
point: Where do those of the Congregational way
find that ever Christians were otherwise divided from
Christians than by place, or that they did combine into
particular Churches, so as not to be all the while re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
Members of another, and might be admitted,
upon removal of place, upon the same terms that they
were of that they removed from; or indeed that they
were so Members of a particular as not to be Members
of any or the whole Church of Christ, upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Baptized? Where do they find that Christians were
gathered out of Christians, and did combine into a
Society Excluding those from it that would not make
a Profession of their Faith and Conversion distinct from
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:62494:11"/>
that at Baptism? Where do we ever read that he that
was a Minister of one Church was not a Minister all the
World over, as well as he that was Baptized in one was
reputed a Christian and Church-Member wherever he
came? Again, where do we read that its necessary that Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
should be alike in Authority, Power, and Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
and that there is to be no difference in point of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
and Superiority amongst them: Or that there are to
be Elders for Governing the Church, who are not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to it, and are in no other State after than they
were before that Service, both of which are held by the
Presbyterians, strictly so called? And if it be said these
respect Government but not Worship; I answer the case
is the same, for if we are to do nothing but what is
prescribed in the Worship of God, because, (as they
say) it derogates from the Priestly Office of Christ, and
doth detract from the Sufficiency of Scripture; then
I say upon the like reason, there must be nothing used
in Church Government but what is prescribed, since
the Kingly Office is as much concerned in this as the
Priestly in the other, and the Sufficiency of Scripture
in both. Lastly, Where do any of them find that
position in Scripture, that <hi>there is nothing lawful in Divine
Worship but what is prescribed,</hi> and that <hi>what is not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
is Forbidden?</hi> And if there be no such position
in Scripture, then that can no more be true than the
want of such a position can render things not Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to be unlawful.</p>
            <p>And now I am come to that which must put an Issue
one way or other to the dispute; for if there be no such
position in Scripture, either expressed in it, or to be
gathered by good consequence from it, we have gain'd
the point; but if there be, then we must give it up.
And this is indeed contended for. For its Objected,<note place="margin">Object. I.</note>
            </p>
            <p>That its accounted in Scripture an hainous Crime
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62494:12"/>
to do things <hi>not Commanded;</hi> as when <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu
offered strange Fire before the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10. 1, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>which he Commanded
them not,</hi> &amp;c. From which form of expression it may
be collected, that what is not Commanded is Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
and that in every thing used in Divine Worship
there must be a Command to make it lawful and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>To this I answer that the Proposition infer'd,<note place="margin">Answ. I.</note> 
               <hi>that all
things not Commanded are Forbidden,</hi> is not true, and so
it cannot be the Sence and Meaning of the Phrase; for
1. then all things must be either Commanded or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden;
and there would be nothing but what must be
Commanded or Forbidden; but I have before shewed,
and it must be granted, that there are things neither
Commanded nor Forbidden, which are called Indifferent.
2. if things not Commanded are Forbidden, then a thing
not Commanded is alike Hainous as a thing For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden.
And then <hi>David</hi>'s Temple which he designed
to Build would have been Criminal as well as <hi>Jerobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi>'s
<hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel;</hi> and the Feast of<note n="a" place="margin">Esth. 9. 27.</note> 
               <hi>Purim,</hi> like
<hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Eighth Month<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 12. 32, 33.</note>; and the Synogogal
Worship like the Sacrificing in Gardens<note n="c" place="margin">Isai. 65. 3.</note>; and the
hours of Prayer<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 3. 1.</note> like <hi>Nadab</hi>'s Strange Fire. The
former of which were things Uncommanded, and the
latter Forbidden; and yet They were approved and These
condemned.</p>
            <p>2. The things, to which this Phrase <hi>not Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi>
is applied, do give no encouragement to such an
Inference from it; for its constantly applied to such as
are absolutely Forbidden. This was the case of <hi>Nadab</hi>
and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who offered Fire not meerly Uncommanded,
but what was prohibited; which will appear, if we consider
that the Word <hi>Strange</hi> when applied to matters of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
doth signify as much as Forbidden. Thus we read
of <hi>Strange Incense,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 30. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note> that is, other than what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62494:12"/>
according to the directions given for it; which
as it was to be put to no common uses,<note place="margin">Ver. 34.</note> so no common
perfume was to be put to the like uses with it.<note place="margin">Ch. 37. 29.</note> So we
also read of <hi>Strange Vanities,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 8. 19.</note> which is but another
Word for <hi>Graven Images;</hi> and of <hi>Strange Gods.</hi> And
after the same sort is it to be understood in the case
before us, <hi>viz.</hi> for what is Forbidden. For that such
was the Fire made use of by those Young Men will be
further confirm'd, if we consider that there is scarcely
any thing belonging to the Altar (Setting aside the
Structure of it) of which more is said than of the
Fire burning upon it. For 1. It was lighted from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<note n="a" place="margin">Lev. 9. 24.</note>. 2. It was always to be burning upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.
<note n="b" place="margin">Ch. 6. 12.</note> 3. If it was not made use of in all Sacred
matters (where Fire was to be used) yet it was most
Holy, and when Atonement was to be made by Incense,
the Coals were to be taken from thence<note n="c" place="margin">Lev. 16. 12. 46.</note>, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
surely was as peculiar to those Offices as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense,
and to be as constantly used in them, as never
to be used in any other. And it will yet make it
more evident if it be considered 4. That just before
there is an account given of the Extraordinary way
by which this Fire was lighted, for the Text saith,
there <hi>came out a Fire from before the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lev. 9. 24.</note> 
               <hi>and consumed
upon the Altar the Burnt-Offering,</hi> &amp;c. and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follows the Relation of <hi>Nadab</hi>'s miscarriage. Now
for what reason are these things so closely connected,
but to shew wherein they Offended. For before it was
the Office of <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Sons to put Fire upon the Altar,<note place="margin">Lev. 1. 7.</note>
and now through Inadvertency or Presumption Attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to do as formerly, when there had been this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from Heaven to the contrary, they Suffered for
it. 5. It appears further from the conformity betwixt
the Punishment and the Sin; as <hi>there came Fire from
before the Lord and consumed the Burnt-Offering;</hi> to teach
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62494:13"/>
them what Fire for the future to make use of: So upon
their Transgression <hi>there came</hi> out Fire from the Lord
and devoured them; to teach others how Dangerous
it was to do otherwise than he had Commanded. So
that it seems to me to be like the case of <hi>Vzzah,</hi> when
they carried the Ark in a Cart,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 13. 7. 10.</note> which the <hi>Levites</hi> were
to have born upon their Shoulders; and it was not an
Offering without a Command,<note place="margin">Ch. 15. 2.</note> but otherwise than Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
that was their Fault; and without doubt they
might with no more Offence have taken what Fire they
would for their Incense, than what Wood they pleased
for their Fire, if there had been no more direction about
the one than the other. But to proceed in the other
places of Scripture where this Phrase of <hi>not Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
is to be met with, its also so applied to things For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden;
as to what is called <hi>Abomination,</hi> which is the
Worshipping of <hi>Strange Gods,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 17. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>the Sun, Moon and Stars, and
the Host of Heaven:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 7. 31.</note> 
               <hi>To the building the High Places of</hi>
Topheth,<note place="margin">Ch. 19. 5.</note> 
               <hi>and the burning their Sons and Daughters in
the Fire to</hi> Baal,<note place="margin">Ch. 32. 35.</note> 
               <hi>and causing them to pass through the Fire
unto</hi> Molech. Of such and the like its said, <hi>which I
Commanded them not, neither came it into my mind.</hi> And
lastly it's applied to the false Prophets,<note place="margin">Jer. 29. 22, 23.</note> who <hi>spake Lies
in the name of the Lord;</hi> in which case the meer being
not Commanded nor sent by him, is in the nature of
the thing no less than a Prohibition, it being a Belying
God; though there had been no such place as, <hi>Deut.
18. 20.</hi> to forbid it. Now if so much stress was to be
laid upon the Phrase, as the Objection doth suppose, and
that we must take a Non-Commanding for a Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we might reasonably expect to find the Phrase
otherwhere applied to things that were no otherwise
Unlawful than because not Commanded; but when its
always spoken of things plainly Prohibited, its a sign
that its rather God's Forbidding that made them Unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62494:13"/>
than his not Commanding. But it may still be said,
why should then the Phrase be used at all in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and why should the case be thus Represented, if not
Commanded is not the same with Prohibited?</p>
            <p>To this I answer, 1. That all things Prohibited are
by consequence not Commanded; but it follows not
that all things not Commanded are Prohibited. If it was
Forbidden to Offer Strange Fire, then it was a thing
not Commanded (for otherwise the same thing would
be Forbidden and Commanded) but if it had been a thing
not Commanded only, it would not by being so have
been any more Prohibited than the Wood that was to
be burnt upon the Altar. Now its with respect to the
former that things Prohibited are call'd things not Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
and not with respect to the latter. 2. Indeed
the Phrase <hi>not Commanded</hi> is only a Meiosis or Softer way
of speaking, when more is understood than express'd.
A Figure usual in all Authors and Languages, that I
know of, and what is frequently to be met with in
Scripture. Thus its given as a Character of an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
People,<note place="margin">Isai. 66. 3. 4.</note> 
               <hi>they chose that in which I Delighted not,</hi>
which is but another Word for what was said in the
verse before,<note place="margin">Ch. 65. 3, 12.</note> 
               <hi>their Soul Delighted in their Abominations,</hi>
or Idolatries. And when the Apostle would Describe
the evil state of the Gentile World, by the most Hainous
and Flagitious Crimes,<note place="margin">Rom. 1. 28, 29.</note> 
               <hi>such as Fornication, Covetousness,
Maliciousness, Envy, Murder,</hi> and what not, he saith
of these, that they were <hi>things not convenient.</hi> And it
is as evident that the Phrase <hi>not Commanded</hi> is of the
like kind, when the things its applied to are alike Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
and Abominable.</p>
            <p>But its further Objected,<note place="margin">Object. II.</note> that its said in Scripture,
<hi>ye shall not add unto the Word which I Command you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
shall ye diminish ought from it:</hi> And that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
condemning the Practices of the Scribes in this kind,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62494:14"/>
concludes,<note place="margin">Matth. 15. 9.</note> 
               <hi>In Vain do they Worship me, Teaching for
Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</hi> From whence it
may be collected 1. That all things not Commanded
by God in his Word are additions to it. 2. That such
additions are altogether unlawful.</p>
            <p>To this I reply,<note place="margin">Answer.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. If they mean by <hi>adding to the Word,</hi> the doing
what that Forbids, and by <hi>diminishing,</hi> the neglecting
of what that requires (as the next Words do intimate,<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 4, 6.</note>
and is plainly the sense otherwhere<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 12. 32.</note>, when its no
sooner said, <hi>What thing soever I Command you, Observe to
do it;</hi> but it immediately follows, <hi>thou shalt not add
thereto, nor diminish from it)</hi> its what we willingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn;
<note place="margin">Matth. 5. 19.</note> according to that of our Saviour, <hi>Whosoever shall
break one of these least Commandments, and shall teach
Men so, he shall be called least in the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. If they mean by <hi>adding</hi> the appointing somewhat
else instead of what God hath appointed, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi>
did the Feast of the Eighth Month; and by <hi>diminishing,</hi>
the taking away what God hath Commanded, as <hi>Ahaz</hi>
did the Altar,<note place="margin">2 King. 16. 14, 17.</note> and Laver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is what we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
also, and do blame in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilst
they feed the People with Legends instead of Scripture,
and take away both that and the Cup from the Laity.</p>
            <p>3. If they mean by <hi>adding,</hi> the adding insolent expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
to the Command, by which the end of it is
frustrated. This our Saviour condemn'd in the <hi>Pharisees,
Why do ye Transgress the Command of God by your tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 15. 3.</note> 
               <hi>For God Commanded saying, Honour thy Father,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>but ye say, whosoever shall say to his Father, it is a
gift,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thus ye have made the Commandment of God of
none effect by your tradition.</hi> And this we condemn in
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who do defeat the Commands
of God by their Doctrines of Attrition and Purgatory,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:62494:14"/>
4. If they mean by <hi>adding,</hi> the making of that which
is not the Word of God to be of equal Authority with
it; This our Saviour condemn'd in the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> when
they <hi>Taught for Doctrines the Commandments of Men,</hi> and
esteem'd them as necessary to be obeyed, and to be of
equal force with what was Authorized by him; nay it
seems, they had more regard to the Tradition of the
Elders than the Commandment of God, as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
Insinuates, verse, 2, 3. and has been observed from
their own Authors. This we also condemn in the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which decrees that the Apocrypha
and Traditions should be received <hi>with the like Pious
regard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Con. Trid. Sess. 4. Decr. 1.</note> 
               <hi>as the Sacred Writ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. If by <hi>adding</hi> they mean the giving the same Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to humane Institutions, as God doth to his, by mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to confer Grace upon the rightly disposed; and by
<hi>diminishing,</hi> that the Service is not complete without it.
This our Saviour condemn'd in the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> when they
maintained that to <hi>eat with unwashen Hands defiled a
Man,</hi> verse 20. And this we condemn in the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> in their use of Holy-Water, and Reliques and
Ceremonies.</p>
            <p>Thus far we agree; but if they proceed, and will
conclude that the doing any thing not Commanded, in
the Worship of God is a Sin though it have none of the
ingredients in it before spoken of, we therein differ from
them and upon very good reason. For therein they differ
from our Saviour and his Apostles, and all Churches,
as I have shewed. Therein also they depart from the
notion and reason of the thing: For <hi>adding</hi> is adding
to the substance, and making the thing added of the
Nature of the thing its added to; and <hi>diminishing</hi> is
diminishing from the substance, and taking away from
the Nature of it; but when the substance remains in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire,
as much after this humane appointment as it was
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62494:15"/>
before it, without Loss and Prejudice, without Debase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or Corruption, it cannot be called an addition
to it, in the sence that the Scripture takes that Word
in.</p>
            <p>Nay so far are we from admitting this charge, that
we return it upon them, and do bring them in Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals
upon it. For those that do Forbid what the Gospel
Forbids not, do as much add to it, as those that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
what the Gospel doth not Command: And if
it be a Crime to Command what that Commands
not, it must be so to Forbid what it Forbids not. And
this is what they are Guilty of that do hold that <hi>nothing
is to be used in the Worship of God but what is prescribed,</hi>
for if that be not a Scripture Proposition and Truth (as
certain it is not) then what an addition is this? A
greater surely than what they charge upon us; for all
that is Commanded amongst us, is look'd upon not as
necessary but expedient; but what is Forbid by them
is Forbid as absolutely unlawful; the latter of which
alters the Nature, whereas the other only affects the
circumstances of things.</p>
            <p>The second Commandment,<note place="margin">Object. III.</note> 
               <hi>Thou shalt not make unto
thee any Graven Image,</hi> &amp;c. is frequently made use of
to prove that we must apply nothing to a Religious Use
but what is Commanded; and we are told that the
sence of it is, that <hi>We must Worship God in no other way,
and by no other means or Religious Rites, than what he hath
prescribed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The best way to answer this is.<note place="margin">Answer.</note> 1. To consider
what is Forbidden in this Commandment, and 2. To
shew that we are not concern'd in the Prohibition. As
to the former,</p>
            <p>1. In this Command it is provided, that there be no
act of Adoration given to any besides God. By this the
Heathens are condemned in their Plurality of Gods, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62494:15"/>
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Veneration they give to
Saints and Angels.</p>
            <p>2. That the Honour we give to God be sutable to
his Nature, and agreeable to his Will. Sutable to his
Nature; and so we are not to Worship him by Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as the Sun, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for that is to consider him as Finite;
nor by Images and External Representations, for that
is to consider him as Corporeal: Agreeable to his Will;
and so we are Forbidden all other Worship of him than
what he hath appointed. Its in the last of these we
are concerned, for I believe there will be no attempt to
prove that there is any thing in our Worship that doth
derogate from the perfections of God, and is unsutable
to his Nature, further than the defects that must arise
from all Worship given by Creatures to a Creator. And
if we come to consider it as to what he hath revealed,
there can be nothing deduced thence to prove Rites
instituted by Men for the Solemnity of God's service
to be Forbidden; and which for ought I see is not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
to be proved from this Commandment, or
from Scripture else where, but by crowding such Rites
into and representing them as a part of Divine Worship.
This way goes one of the most industrious in this cause.
<hi>Ceremonies,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ames. Fresh Suit, part. 2. sect. 2. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. p. 228.</note> saith he, <hi>are External Rites of Religious
Worship, as used to further Devotion, and therefore being
invented by Man are of the same Nature with Images, by
which and at which God is Worshipped.</hi> In which are no less
than three mistakes. As 1. he makes whatever is used
to further Devotion to be Religious Worship. 2. he
makes it a fault in External Rites in Religious Worship
that they are used to further Devotion 3. he makes
External Rites taken up by Men, and used for that
end to be of the same Nature with Images. If I shew
that these are really mistakes I think that in doing so
the whole argument taken from the 2. Commandment
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62494:16"/>
falls with it. 1. He mistakes, in that he makes <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is used to further Devotion to be Religious Worship:</hi>
The error of which will appear from this confideration;
that all things relating to Divine Worship are either
Parts or Adjuncts of it; Parts, as Prayer, and the Lord's
Supper; Adjuncts, as Form and Posture. Now Adjuncts
are not Parts, because the Worship is intire and invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in all the Parts of it, and remains the same though
the Adjuncts vary. Prayer is Worship, whether with a
Form or without; and the Lord's Supper is Worship,
whether Persons Kneel, Sit, or Stand in the receiving of it.
And yet though the Adjuncts are no part of Worship, they
further Devotion in it. This those that are for conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Prayer plead for Their Practice, and this also is
pleaded by those that are for a Form. This do they
urge that are for Sitting at the Lord's Supper, and this
they say that are for Kneeling; so that these and the like
Adjuncts do further Devotion, and are for Edification, is
an argument used by both. Now if Adjuncts are not part of
Worship and may be yet used to further Devotion, then the
furthering Devotion by any Rite doth not in it self make
that Rite so used to be Worship. I acknowledge there is
False Worship as well as True; True Worship is of Divine
Institution, and False Worship is of Humane Appointment;
and becomes Worship when either Divine Institution is
pretended for it, or its used for the same special ends that
God's Worship is instituted for, that is, as necessary to
acceptance, or as a means of Grace. And so I confess
Adjuncts may be made parts of False Worship, as many
Ceremonies are in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but this is not
the case with any things used in the Administration of
Worship in our Church; we plead nothing of Divine
Authority to enforce them, use them not as necessary,
nor as means of Grace; after the manner we do the Word
of God, and the Sacraments. 2. Its another mistake, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62494:16"/>
its charged as a fault upon Rites in Worship, that <hi>They
are used to further Devotion.</hi> Without this end surely
they are not to be used, or at least not to be encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for Divine Worship being the acknowledgment of
God and a giving Honour to Him, should have all things
about it Grave and Solemn, that may best sute it, and
promote the ends for which its used, But if Rites are
used in it that have no respect to such ends, they become
Vain and Trifling, neither worthy of that nor our
Defence. And therefore we justly blame the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> for the Multitude of Ceremonies used in their
Worship, and for such that either have no signification,
or whose signification is so obscure as is not easie to be
observed or traced, and that rather hinder than further
Devotion. Surely it would not so well answer the end
if the Hand in Swearing was laid upon another Book, as
when on the Gospel; nor if the Love-feasts at the Lord's
Supper had been only as a Common Meal, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to Charity signified by it. 3. Its another mistake
that <hi>External Rites taken up by Men, and used for the
furthering Devotion are made to be of the same Nature
with Images.</hi> This there is no foundation for, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
use of Images is expresly contrary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, and Forbidden, because it tends to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>base
God in the thoughts of those that Worship him by
such mediums. But there is nothing in the use of such
External Rites (as are before spoken of) that fall under
the censure of either of these; but that we may lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
use them, and the use of which is not therefore at
all Forbidden in the 2. Commandment.</p>
            <p>If there be not a Rule for all things belonging to the
Worship of God,<note place="margin">Object. IV.</note> the Gospel would be less perfect than
the Law; and Christ would not be so Faithful as <hi>Moses,</hi>
in the care of his Church, <hi>Heb. 3. 2.</hi> which is not to
be supposed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:62494:17"/>
The sufficiency of Scripture and Faithfulness of Christ
are not to be judged of by what we fancy they should
have determined,<note place="margin">Answer.</note> but by what they have. Its a plausi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Plea made by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for an Infallible
Judge in matters of Faith, that by an Appeal to him
all controversies would be decided, and the Peace of the
Church secured. But notwithstanding all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which they so hugely amplify, there is not one
Word in Scripture (which in a matter of that impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
is absolutely necessary) that doth shew that it is
necessary; or (were it so) who the Person or Persons
are that should have this Power or Commission. And in
this case we must be content to leave things as the
Wisdom of God hath thought fit to leave them,
and to go on in the old way of sober and ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
debate and fair reasoning to bring debates to a
conclusion. Thus it is in the matter before us, the
pretence is very Popular and Plausible, that, Who can
better determine things Relating to the Worship of
God, than God whose Worship it is? And where
may we expect to find them better determined than in
his Word, which is sufficient to all the ends it was
writ for? But when we come to enquire into the case,
we find no such thing done, no such care taken, no
such particular directions as they had under the Law;
and therefore its certain that neither the sufficiency of
Scripture, nor Faithfulness of Christ stand upon that
foundation. And if we do not find the like particular
prescriptions in Baptism as Circumcision; nor in the
Lord's Supper as in the Passover; nor in Prayers as in
Sacrifices; its plain that the sufficiency of Scripture and
Faithfulness of Christ do respect somewhat else, and
that they are not the less for the want of them. Christ
was Faithful, as <hi>Moses, To him that appointed him,</hi> in
performing what belonged to him as a Mediator (in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62494:17"/>
which respect <hi>Moses</hi> was a Type of him) and discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Mankind in Scripture the method and means
by which they might be Sav'd; and the sufficiency of
Scripture is in being a sufficient means to that end, and
putting Men into such State as will render them ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of attaining to it. And as for modes and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of things they are left to the prudence of those who by
the Grace and the Word of God have been converted
to the Truth, and have received it in the Love of it.
I have been the larger in the consideration of this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
<hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Nothing but what is prescribed may be
lawfully used in Divine Worship,</hi> that I might relieve the
consciences of those that are Insnared by it, and that
cannot be so, without subjecting themselves to great
inconveniences. For if nothing but what is of that
Nature may be used or joyned with, and that the second
Commandment doth with as much Authority Forbid
the use of any thing not Commanded, as the Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
of Images: If <hi>Nadab</hi>'s and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s Strange Fire,
and <hi>Vzza</hi>'s touching of the Ark be examples Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for caution to us, and that every thing Uncomman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
is of the like Nature, attended with the like
Aggravations, and alike do expose to God's Displeasure:
If the use of any thing not prescribed be such an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to the Word of God, as leaves us under the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
of that Text;<note place="margin">Rev. 22. 18.</note> 
               <hi>If any Man shall add unto these things,
God shall add unto him the Plagues that are Written in
this Book;</hi> we cannot be too cautious in the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what is, or what is not prescribed. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
if this be our case, it would be more intolerable
than that of the <hi>Jews.</hi> For amongst them every thing
for the most part was plainly laid down, and though the
particular Rites and Circumstances prescribed in their
Service were many, yet they were sufficiently describ'd
in their Law, and it was but consulting that, or Those
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62494:18"/>
whose Office and Employment it was to be well versed
in it, and they might be presently inform'd, and as
soon see it as the Book was laid open. This they all
agreed in. But it is not so under the Gospel, and there is
no greater proof of it than the several schemes drawn
up for Discipline, and Order, by those that have been of
that Opinion and made some attempts to describe them.
And then when things are thus dark and obscure, so
hard to trace and discover, that it has thus perplexed
and baffled those that have made it their business to
bring these things within Scripture Rules, how perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
must they be that are not skilled in it: And (as I
have above shewed) must all their Days live in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
its likely, of no Church; since though a
Church should have nothing in it but what is prescrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet it would take up a great deal of time to examine,
and more to be satisfied that all in it is prescribed.</p>
            <p>3. I shall consider, <hi>How we may know what things are
Indifferent in the Worship of God?</hi> I may answer, to
this that we may know what is Indifferent in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
of God by the same Rule that we may know what
is Indifferent out of Worship, that is, if the thing to be
enquired after be neither required nor Forbidden: For
the Nature of Indifferency is always the same, and
what it is in one kind or instance, it is in all; and if the
want of a Law to Require or Forbid doth make a thing
Indifferent in Natural or Civil matters, it doth also
the same in Religious: And in things Forbidden by Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Authority, the not being required in Scripture;
and in things required by Humane Authority the not
being Forbidden in Scripture is a Rule we may safely
determine the case, and judge of the Lawfulness and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency
of things in <hi>Divine Worship by.</hi> But I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
the Question requires a more particular Answer,
because things in their Nature Lawful and Indifferent,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:62494:18"/>
may yet, in their use and application, become unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.
As it is in Civil cases and Secular matters, to be
Covered or Uncovered is a thing in it self Indifferent;
but to be Covered in the presence of such of our Betters,
as Custom and Law have made it our Duty to stand
bare before, would be unlawful, and it would be no
excuse for such an Omission and Contempt, that the
thing is in it self Indifferent. And then much more
will this hold where the case is of an higher Nature;
as it is in the Worship of God, where things in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
Indifferent may become Ridiculous, Absurd and
Profane, and argue rather contempt of God than reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
for him in the Persons using them. Again, the
things may, though Grave and Pertinent, yet be so
numerous that they may obscure and oppress the Service,
and confound and distract the Mind that should attend
to the Observation of them; and so for one reason or
another are not to be allowed in the Solemnities of
Religion. Therefore in Answer to the Question, I shall
add,</p>
            <p>1. That things Indifferent are so called from their
general Nature, and not as if in practice and use, and
all manner of cases, they always were so, and never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful;
for that they may be by Accident and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance;
being lawful unlawful, expedient or inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient,
as they are used and applied.</p>
            <p>2. I observe that there are several Laws which things
Indifferent do respect; and that may be Required or
Forbidden by one Law, which is not Forbidden or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
by another; and that may be Indifferent in one
State which is Unlawful in another, and by passing out
of one into the other may cease to be Indifferent, and
therefore when we say things are Indifferent, we must
understand of what Rank they are, and what Law they
do respect; As for example, Humane Conversation,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62494:19"/>
and Religious Worship are different Ranks to which
things are referred; and therefore what may be Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in Conversation may be unlawful in Worship.
Thus to Enterchange Discourse about Common Affairs
is a thing lawful in it self, and useful in its place; but
when practised in the Church and in the midst of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Solemnities is Criminal. This distinction of
Ranks and States of things is useful and necessary to be
observed, and which if observed would have prevented
the objection made by some, that if a Church or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
may Command Indifferent things, then they
may require us to Pray Standing upon the head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for
that though Indifferent in another case is not in that, as
being unsutable to it.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore we must come to some Rules in Divine
Worship, by which we may know what things in their
Nature Indifferent, are therein also Indifferent, and
may be lawfully used: It being not enough to plead they
are Indifferent in themselves (as some unwarily do) and
therefore presently they may be used; For by the same
reason a Person may Spit in anothers Face, may keep
on his Hat before the King, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Spitting and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Covered being in their Nature Indifferent. But
now as there are certain Rules which we are to respect
in Common and Civil Conversation, and which even
in that case do tye us up in the use of things otherwise
Indifferent: So it is as reasonable, and must be much
more allowed that there are some Rules of the like
Nature which we must have a regard to in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Divine Worship. And as in Common mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
the Nature of the thing; in actions the end; in
Conversation the circumstances are to be heeded, <hi>viz.</hi>
Time, Place, Persons; as when, where, before whom
we are Covered or Uncovered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in Sacred mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;
the Nature of the thing, in the Decency and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62494:19"/>
of the Worship; the end for which it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
in the Edification of the Church; and the
Peace, Glory, and Security of that, in its Order are to
be respected. And according to these Rules and the
circumstances of things, are we to Judge of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,
Lawfulness, or Expediency of things used
in the Service of God; and as they do make for or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst,
and do approach to or recede from these Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,
so they are to be rejected or observed, and the
more or less esteemed. But yet we are not come to a
conclusion, for 1. These are general Rules, and so the
particulars are not so easily pointed to. 2. Decency,
and Edification, and Order are (as was observed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
Variable and Uncertain, and depend upon Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
and so in their Nature not easily determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And, 3. Persons have very different Opinions
about what is Decent, Edifying, and Orderly; as in
the Apostles time in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> some were for,
and others against the Observation of Days; and in
the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> some doubtless were for being
Covered, others for being Uncovered in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
And therefore there is somewhat further requisite
to give Satisfaction in the point; and by which we may
be able to Judge what is Decent, Edifying, and Order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
as well as we are by what is Decent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
what is fit to be used in Religious Worship.
And this we may be help'd in by considering,</p>
            <p>1. That some things make so Eminently for, or are
so Notoriously opposite to these Rules, that Common
Reason will be able forthwith to Judge of them, and
to declare for or against them. So when the Love-feasts,
and the Lord's Supper were appointed for the testify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and increase of mutual Charity; if one took his
Supper before another,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11. 20, 21.</note> it was to make it rather a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
Meal than a Religious Feast, and so was a Notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62494:20"/>
Breach of Order and Christian Fellowship. So a
Tumultuous speaking of many together is less for Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and hath more of Confusion than the Orderly
speaking of one by one. And Service in an Unknown
Tongue doth less conduce to Edification than when it
is in a Language Vulgarly known and Understood;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 16, 17. 26, 27.</note>
this is a case that Reason as well as the Apostle doth
Determine to our Hands, and which Mankind would
with one consent soon agree to, were it not for a certain
Church in the World that carries those of its Communion,
against Sense, Reason, and Nature, for its own advantage.</p>
            <p>2. But there are other things which are not so Clear
and Evident, and so the case needs further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration.
For the clearing of which we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
            <p>1. That we are not so much to Judge of Decency,
Order, and Edification asunder, as together; these
having a mutual Relation to and dependance upon each
other.<note place="margin">Chrys. in 1 Cor.</note> So its well observed by St. <hi>Chrysostom, That
nothing doth so much Edify,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ch. 14. 40.</note> 
               <hi>as Order, Peace and Love:</hi>
And the Apostle when he had reproved the Disorders
of their Service in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> concludes it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 26.</note>
               <hi>Let all things be done to Edifying.</hi> The not observing
of this is the occasion of very great Mistakes in this
matter; For Persons when they would Judge of Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
consider presently what they conceive doth most
improve them in Knowledge or any particular Grace;
and having no further consideration, for the sake of
this throw down the Bounds of publick Order and
bring all into Confusion; and for Edifying (as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend)
themselves do Disturb if not Destroy the
Church of God, and render the means used in it inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to themselves and others. Thus again they
Judge of what is Decent, and Indecent; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that there is no Indecency in Sitting, suppose at
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62494:20"/>
the Sacrament, or the Prayers; but they mistake in
such a conception, whilest what is against publick Order
and Practice, is for that reason Indecent, were there no
other reason to make it so. So that if we would Judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
of either of these we must Judge of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and as Order alone is not enough to make a
thing Decent which is in it self Indecent; so Decency
or particular Edification is not enough to recommend
that which is not to be Introduced or Obtained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Disturbance and Overthrow of publick Order
and Peace.</p>
            <p>2. When the case is not apparent, we should rather
Judge by what is contrary than by what is agreeable
to those Rules. We know better what things are not
than what they are: And if Christians should never
agree to any thing in the External Administration of
Divine Worship till they agree in the notion of Decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
Order, and Edification; or till they can prove
that the things used, or required to be used in a Church,
do exactly agree to the Notion and Definition of it;
Worship must never be Administred, or the greater part
of Christians must Exclude themselves from it. And
yet this must be done before it can be positively said
(unless in things very manifest) that this is Decent, or that
is Orderly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> These things as I have said are variable,
and depend upon Circumstances; and so Persons must
needs be Wonderfully Confounded if they come to Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and insist upon them. And therefore as we better
know what is Indecent than Decent, Disorderly than
Orderly, against than for Edification, so its better to
take the course abovesaid in Judging about it. As for
instance, if we would enquire into the Decency of the
Posture to be used in the Lord's Supper, or the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that may arise from it; some will say its best to
receive it in the Posture frequently used in the Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62494:21"/>
of the ancient Church of Standing or Incurvation;
others would choose Sitting, as the dissenting Parties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, and some Forreign Churches; others be for the
Posture of Kneeling used in ours and many more, and
all with some shew of reason. In these different cases
it may not perhaps be so easy for a Person (Educated in
a different way from what is Practised and Prescribed)
to Judge of the Decency or Edification; but if he find it
not Indecent, or Destructive of Piety, and of the ends
for which the Ordinance was Instituted, he is therewith
to satisfy himself.<note place="margin">Epist. 118.</note> St. <hi>Austin</hi> puts a like case and gives
the like answer. <hi>Some Churches Fast on the Saturday,
because Christ's Body was then in the Grave, and he in a
State of Humiliation. Others do Eat on the Saturday,
both because that Day God Rested from his Work, and
Christ Rested in the Grave.</hi> And how in such a case to
Determine our selves, both in Opinion and Practice, that
Father thus directs, <hi>If</hi> saith he, <hi>what is injoyned be not
against Faith, or good Manners, it is to be accounted Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent.</hi>
And I may add, if it be not Indecent, Disorderly and
Destructive of Piety, its lawful.</p>
            <p>3. If the case be not apparent, and we cannot easily
find out how the things used and injoyned in a Church
are Decent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we are to consider that we are in, or
Obliged to be of a Church, and that these things do
respect such a Society; and therefore are to be Cautious
how we Condemn this or that for Indecent, Confused,
and Inexpedient, when we see Christians agreeing in
the Practice of them, and such whom for other things
we cannot Condemn. When we find if we argue against
it, they argue for it, and produce Experience against
Experience, and Reason against Reason, and that we
have a whole Church against our particular conceptions
of things of this Nature; we should be apt to think
the Fault may be in our selves, and that its for want of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62494:21"/>
Understanding and Insight, for want of Use and Tryal,
and by Reason of some Prejudices or Prepossessions that
we thus differ in our Judgment from them. We see
what little things do Determin Men ordinarily in these
matters; how addicted some are to their own Ways
and Customs, and forward to Like or Condemn accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Education, which doth form their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
and fix their inclinations; how Prone again
others are to Novelty and Innovation.<note place="margin">Epist. 118.</note> So St. <hi>Austin</hi>
observes, some warmly contend for an usage, <hi>because its
the Custom of their own Church; as if they come, suppose
into another Place where Lent is observed without any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation,
they however refuse to Fast, because its not so
done in their Country.</hi> There are others again do like,
and are bent upon a particular Rite or Usage, <hi>Because,</hi>
saith he, <hi>they observ'd this in their Travels abroad, and so
a Person is for it, as perhaps he would be thought so
much the more Learned and Considerable, as he is distant
or doth disagree from what is observed at home.</hi> Now
when Persons are Prone thus to Judge upon such little
Reasons, and may mistake in their Judgment, and do
Judge against a Church (which they have no other
Reason against) it would become them to think again;
and to think that the case perhaps requires only time
or use to wear off their Prejudices, and that by these
ways they may as effectually be reconciled to the things
Practised in a Church, as they are to the Civil Usages and
the Habits of a Nation, which at the first they looked
upon in their kind as Indecent and Inexpedient, as they
can do of the Usages of a Church in theirs. As sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
the Dispute should be about Forms of Prayer, or
the use of responsals in it, we see that Decency, Order,
and Edification are pleaded by the Parties contending
for and against, but when a Person considers that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
Opinion he therein hath, yet if he be against
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62494:22"/>
them, he is at the same time against all formed Churches
in the World, he may conclude safely that there is a
Decency, Order, and Expediency in the Publick use of
them;<note place="margin">Epist. 86.</note> and as St. <hi>Austin</hi> saith of a Christian living in
<hi>Rome</hi> where they fasted upon the Saturday that <hi>such a
one should not so praise a Christian City for it,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Casulano.</note> 
               <hi>as to
Condemn the Christian World that was against it;</hi> so we
should not be so Zealous against a Practice, as to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
those that are for it, and be so addicted to our
own Opinion as to set that against a Community and
a Church, nay against all Churches whatsoever. This
will give us reason to suspect its a <hi>Zeal without Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
when we presume to set our Judgment, Reason,
and Experience, against the Judgment, Reason and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
of the Christian World. Which brings to
the Fourth General.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>How are we to determine our selves in the use of
Indifferent things with respect to the Worship of God?</hi>
For resolution of which, we are to consider our selves
in a threefold Capacity. 1. As particular Persons, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
and alone. 2. As we are in Ordinary and Civil
Conversation. 3. As we are Members of a Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
or Church.</p>
            <p>In the first capacity, every Christian may chuse and
act as he pleaseth; and all Lawful things remain to
him, as they are in their own Nature, Free. He
may eat this or that; chuse this day or another, and
set it apart for the Service of God and his own soul. In
this state, where there is no Law of man to require,
he may forbear to use what is Indifferent; where there
is no Law to forbid, he may freely use it.</p>
            <p>In the second capacity, as in Conversation with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
he is to have a regard to them, and to use his
Liberty so as shall be less to the prejudice, and more to
the benefit of those he converses with. So saith the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62494:22"/>
Apostle,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 2</note> 
               <hi>all things are lawful for me, but all things are
not expedient; all things are lawful for me, but all things
Edify not.</hi> In this capacity Men are still in their own
Power; and whilst its no Sin they may safely act,
and where its no Sin they may forbear in complyance
with those that are not yet advanced to the same Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
of Judgement with themselves; as the Apostle
did,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 19. &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Though</hi> saith he, <hi>I be free from all Men, yet have I
made my self Servant unto all, that I might gain the more.
And unto the</hi> Jews <hi>I became a</hi> Jew, &amp;c. In such a case
the strong should not despise, affront, or discourage
the weak; nor the weak censure and condemn the
strong.</p>
            <p>In the third Capacity, as we are Members of a Church
and Religious Society, so the use of Indifferent things
comes under further consideration, since then the
Practice of a Church and the Commands of Authority
are to be respected. And as what we may lawfully do
when alone, we are not to do in Conversation, because
of Offence: So what we may allowably do when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
or in Conversation, we must not do in Society,
if Forbidden by the Laws and Customs of it. For the
same reason (if there was no more) that Restrains or
Determines us in Conversation, is as much more forcible
in Society, as the Peace and Welfare of the whole is to
be preferred before that of a part; And if the not griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Brother, or endangering his Soul makes it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable,
just, and necessary to forego our Liberty, and to
Restrain our selves in the exercise of it, then much
more is the Peace of a Church (upon which the present
Welfare of the whole, and the Future Welfare of many
depend) a sufficient reason for so doing, and to Oblige
us to act or not to act accordingly. The Apostle saith,
<hi>Let every one of us please his Neighbour for his good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to
Edification,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 15. 2.</note> that is, to his Improvement in Knowledge
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:62494:23"/>
or Grace, or Christian Piety, and the promoting of
Christian Concord and Charity: Now Edification is
eminently so with respect to the whole, as the Church
is <hi>the House of God,</hi> and every Christian one of the
<hi>living Stones</hi> of which that Spiritual building is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted;
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> and so he is to consider himself, as well as he
is to be considered, as a part of it, and to study what
may be for the Edification of the whole, as well as the
good of any particular Member of it. And how is that
but by promoting Love, Peace, and Order, and taking
Care to Preserve it?<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10. 8.</note> So we find Edification Opposed
to Destruction,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14 26.</note> to Confusion, to Disputacity and Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness:
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1. 4.</note> And on the contrary,<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 19.</note> we find Peace and
Edifying,<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 11.</note> Comfort and Edification, Union and Edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
joyned together,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 12. 16.</note> as the one doth promote the
other. And therefore as the Good and Edification of the
whole is to be always in our Eye, so its the Rule by which
we ought to act in all things lawful; and to that end should
comply with its Customs, observe its Directions, and
Obey its Orders, without Reluctancy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Opposition.
Thus the Apostle resolves the case, Writing about pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Order and the Custom newly taken up of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
Uncovered, <hi>if any Man seem,</hi> or have a mind
<hi>to be,</hi>

               <hi>contentious, we have no such Custom, neither the
Churches of God;</hi> looking upon that as sufficient to put
an end to all Contentions and Debates; that whatever
might be Plausibly urged against it, from the <hi>Jewish</hi>
Practice, and the Representation even of Angels ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
after that manner; and from the reason of the thing
as a signification of Shame and Reverence; or from the
Practice of Idolators that did many of them Worship
Uncovered; yet he peremptorily concludes, <hi>We have
no such Custom,</hi> &amp;c. The Peace of the Church is to a
Peaceable Mind sufficient to put an end to all Disputes
about it; and the Peace of the Church depending upon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62494:23"/>
the Observation of its Customs, that is infinitely to be
preferred before Scrupulosity and Niceness, or a meer
inclination to a contrary Practice. For in publick cases
a Man is not to go his own way, or to have his own
mind, for that would bring in Confusion (one Man having
as much a right as another.) There must be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
Established, some Common Order and Bond of
Union; and if Confusion is before such Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
then to break that Establishment, would bring
in Confusion; and where that is likely to ensue it is
not worth the while for the trial of a new experiment
to decry and throw down what is already Established
or Used in a Church, because we think better of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
for saith a Grave Author, and well Skill'd in
these matters,<note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 118.</note> 
               <hi>The very change of a Custom though it may
happen to profit, yet doth disturb by its Novelty.</hi> Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Peace is worth all new Offers (if the Church is
Disquieted and its Peace Endangered by them)
though in themselves better; and it is better to labour
under the infirmity of publick Order than the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
of being without it, or, what is next to that, the
trial of some Form, seemingly of a better Cast and
Mould that hath not yet been experimented. I say it
again, Infirmity in a Church is better than Confusion,
or Destruction which is the Consequent of it: And I
had rather choose that as I would a House, to have one
with some Faults, rather than to have none at all; And
if I cannot have them mended (when tolerable) I
think my self bound not only to bear with them, but
to do all I can for its preservation though with them,
and to observe all things that are lawful for its suppore
and encouragement. In doing thus I serve God, and
his Church, my own Soul and the Souls of others,
promote Religion and Charity in the World;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 33.</note> 
               <hi>For God
is not the Author of Confusion but of Peace in all the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:62494:24"/>
Churches of the Saints.</hi> In things which neither we
nor the Worship are the worse for, but the Church the
better for observing, Peace and Order is far to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
before Niceties: And certainly neither we nor the
Service of God can be the worse for what God hath
concluded nothing in. What the Gospel looks at is the
Main and Essential parts of Religion in Doctrine, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
and Practice. And if these be Secured, we are
under no Obligation to contend for or against the modes
and circumstances of things further than the Churches
Order and Peace is concerned in them. So the Apostle,
<hi>Let not your Good be Evil spoken of:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 14. 16.</note> 
               <hi>For the Kingdom of
God is not Meat and Drink, but Righteousness, Peace,
and Joy in the Holy-Ghost;</hi> the promoting Love and
Charity, and substantiul Righteousnes. <hi>He that in these
things Serveth Christ is acceptable to God, and approved
of Men.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Aug. Epist. 86.</note> 
               <q>The Beauty of the Kings Daughter is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
saith St. <hi>Austin,</hi> and all its observations are
but its vesture, which though various in different
Churches, are no prejudice to the Common Faith,
nor to him that useth them.</q> And therefore what he
and his Mother received from St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
as a Divine Oracle,<note place="margin">Epist. 118. &amp; 86.</note> is worthy to be recommended to
all, <hi>That in all things not contrary to Truth and good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
it becometh a Good and Prudent Christian to Practise
according to the Custom of the Church where he comes, if he will
not be a Scandal to them, nor have them to be a Scandal to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if the Custom and Practice of a Church should
be thus taken into consideration by a Good Man, then
certainly much more ought it so to be, when that is
Established, and is made a Law, and is backed by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:
For then to stand in Opposition is not only an
Offence but an Affront; and to insist upon the Gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our own Inclination against publick Order, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
whether we or our Superiours shall Govern, whether
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62494:24"/>
our Will or the publick Good and Order must take place
And what can be the Issue of such a temper but the distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
if not Dissolution of Government; which as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be without Governed as well as Governours, so can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be preserved without the submission of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in all lawful things to the Governours; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
them to choose and determine in things of that
kind as they shall see meet. Its pleaded <hi>That there should
be a Liberty left to Christians in things Vndetermined in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
and such things indeed there are that Christians
may have a Liberty in and yet hold Communion, as in
Posture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (though Decency would plead for Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
in those things also) but there are other things,
which they must agree in, or else there can be no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Worship or Christian Communion, which yet they
differ in as much as the other. As now whether Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is to be celebrated with or without a Form; whether
the Lord's Supper is to be received in the Morning or
Evening; whether Prayers should be long or short,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now unless one of these disagreeing Parties doth
Yield to the other or there be a Power in Superiours
and Guides to determine for them, and they are to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to them in it, there will be nothing but confusion.
And why Superiours may not then Command and
why Inferiours are not to obey in all things of the like
kind; In Posture or Habit, as well as the time (above
specified) and Forms, I understand not.</p>
            <p>To conclude this, if we find any thing required or
generally practised in a Church, that is not Forbidden
in Scripture; or any thing Omitted or Forbidden in a
Church, that is not required in Scripture; we may and
ought to act or to forbear as they that are of its Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
do generally act or forbear, or the Laws of that
Communion require; and in such things are to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62494:25"/>
by the publick Voice of the Communion, that
is, Authority, Custom, or the Majority.</p>
            <p>But to this it will be said,<note place="margin">Object.</note> If we are thus to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
in our Practice, then where is our Christian
Liberty, which being only in different things, if we
are restrained in the use of them, we are also restrained
in our Liberty, which yet the Apostle exhorts Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to <hi>stand fast in.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gal 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>
            </p>
            <p>1. This is no argument to those that say there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
Indifferent in the Worship of God;<note place="margin">Answer.</note> for then there
is nothing in it matter of Christian Liberty;</p>
            <p>2. A restraint of our Liberty, or receding from it
is, of it self, no violation of it. All persons grant this
in the latter, and the most scrupulous are apt to plead
that the Strong ought to bear with the Weak, and to
give no Offence to them by indulging themselves in
that Liberty which others are afraid to take. But now
if a Person may recede from his Liberty, and is bound
so to do in the case of Scandal, and yet his Liberty
be not thereby infringed, why may it not be also little
infringed, when restrained by others? How can it be
supposed, that there should be so vast a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
restraint and restraint, and that he that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained
by Authority should have his Liberty prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 29.</note> and yet he that is restrained <hi>By anothers Conscience</hi>
(as the Apostle saith) should keep it intire? And if it
should be said this is Occasional, but the other is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuated
by the Order, perhaps, of a Church. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
that all Orders about Indifferent things are but
temporary, and are only intended to bind so long as
they are for the good of the Community. And if they
are for continuance that alters not the case; For though
the Apostle knew his own Liberty and where there was
Just Reason could insist upon it, yet he did not suppose
that could be damnified, though for his whole life it was
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62494:25"/>
restrain'd.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8. 13.</note> For thus he resolves, <hi>If meat make my Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to offend, I will eat no flesh while the World stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi>
which certainly he would not have condescended
to, if such a practice was not reconcileable to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation
of <hi>standing fast in that Liberty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>3. Therefore to find out the tendency of his Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
its fit to understand what Christian Liberty is,
and that is truly no other than the Liberty which
Mankind naturally had, before it was restrain'd by
particular Institution; and which is call'd Christian Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
in opposition to the <hi>Jews</hi> which had it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their Law, but were restrain'd from the practice
and use of things, otherwise and in themselves Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
by severe Prohibitions. Now as all the World was
then divided into <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> so the Liberty
which the <hi>Jews</hi> were before denied, was call'd Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
because by the coming of Christ, all these former
restraints were taken off, and all the World, both <hi>Jews</hi>
and <hi>Gentiles</hi> did enjoy it. And therefore when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
doth exhort them to <hi>stand fast in it,</hi> it was, as
the Scope of the Epistle doth shew, to warn them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
returning to that <hi>Jewish</hi> state, and against those
who held it necessary for both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> still to
observe all the Rites and Orders of it. Now if the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages
of a Church were of the same kind, or had the
same tendency, or were alike necessarily impos'd as
those of the <hi>Mosaical</hi> Law, then Christians would be
concerned in the Apostles Exhortation; but where
these reasons are not, our Liberty is not at all prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by compliance with them. As long I say, as they
are neither peccant in their Nature, nor End, nor Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
they are not unlawful to us, nor is our Liberty
injured in the use of them. And so I am brought to
the last General, which is,</p>
            <p>V. That there is nothing required in our Church,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62494:26"/>
which is not either a duty in it self, and so necessary
to all Christians, or else what is indifferent, and so
may be lawfully used by them. By things required, I
mean, such as are used in the Communion and Service
of our Church, and imposed upon the Lay-members of
it (for these are the things my Subject doth more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
respect.) This is a Subject too Copious for me
to follow through all the particulars of it; and indeed
it will be needless for me to enlarge upon it, if the
foundation I have laid be good, and the Rules before
given are fit measures for us to Judge of the lawfulness,
or unlawfulness of things by; for by these we shall soon
bring the Cause to an Issue. I think there is nothing
to be charged upon our Church for being defective in
any Essential part of Divine Worship<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> (as the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> is in its Half-Communion) nor of any pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
that is apparently inconsistent with, or that doth
defeat the ends of any Institution (as the same Church
doth offend by having its Service in an unknown
Tongue, and in the multitude of its Ceremonies). I
think it will be acknowledged, that the Word of God
is sincerely and freely Preached, the Sacraments intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and truly Administred, the Prayers for matter inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensive
and good. And therefore the matter in dispute
is about the Ministration of our Worship, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of its performance; and I think the things of that
kind Objected against, refer either to Time, or Forms,
or Gesture. To Times, such are Festivals, or Days set
apart for Divine Service; to Forms such are our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
and the Administration of our Sacraments; to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
as Standing up at the Creed or Gospels, and
Kneeling at the Lords Supper. But now all these are
either Natural or Moral Circumstances of Action, and
which, as I have shew'd, are inseparable from it. Of
the former kind are Days and Gestures; of the latter
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62494:26"/>
are Forms of Administration, and so upon the reasons
before given may be lawfully determined and used. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
these are not forbidden by any Law, either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
or consequentially, and have nothing that is
indecent, disorderly, or unedifying in them; and which
if any should engage his own opinion and experience
in, he would be answered in the like kind, and have
the opinions and experience of Thousands that live in
the practise of these, to contradict him. And if there
be nothing of this kind apparent, or what can be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prov'd, (as I am apt to believe there cannot) then
the Proposition I have laid down needs no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
proof. But if at last it must issue in things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient
to Christians, or an unlawfulness in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure;
are either of these fit to be insisted upon, when
the peace of one of the best Churches in the World is
broken by it, a lamentable Schism kept up, and our
Religion brought into imminent hazard by both? Alas
how near have we been to ruin, and I wish I had no
reason to say, how near are we to it, considering the
indefatigable industry, the united endeavours, the
matchless policy of those that contrive and desire it!
Can we think that we are safe, as long as there is such
an abiding reason to make us suspect it, and that our
divisions are both fomented, and made use of by them
to destroy us? And if this be our danger, and Union
as necessary as desirable, shall we yet make the breach
wider, or irreparable by an obstinate contention? God
forbid! <hi>O pray for the peace of</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper
that love thee: Let peace be within thy Walls, and
prosperity within thy Palaces.</hi> Amen.</p>
