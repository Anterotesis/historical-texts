            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I shall first examine the weakness of <hi>H. D</hi>'s, and <hi>I. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>I shall begin first with <hi>H. Den's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>little,</hi> (since his Sheet came came out first) a man that was wont to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and much more, (being a man of more than ordinary ability) when he disputed against the <hi>Priestly Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> behind him, yet here left justly of the Lord to bewray great weakness, for his pushing at a people that are in the Light before him: So let all the <hi>Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> of such, as know not thy hidden ones in that, in which alone thou and thine can be manifest, perish from them (O God) and be converted into <hi>foolishness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next I shall shew the <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rrowness</hi> and <hi>shallowness</hi> of those two sheets under which (lest <hi>H. D</hi>'s single one should not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) <hi>Ier, Ives</hi> having sham'd himself among the Saints by

               <hi>Swearing,</hi> (seeks more subtilly and shufflingly then su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>cessfully) to <hi>shroud</hi> himself out of sight, that the <hi>shame</hi> of his <hi>nakedness</hi> may not appear to all men.</p>
            <p>Yet where their <hi>words</hi> and <hi>arguments</hi> are coincident, I shall take notice of them so, as to return answer to them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>In proof of the Lawfulness of some Swearing now, <hi>Henry Den</hi> propounds two things: First the <hi>Antiquity,</hi> Secondly, the <hi>Universality</hi> of that practice.</p>
            <p>In proof of its <hi>Antiquity</hi> he propounds two <hi>Periods:</hi> The first is about <hi>three hundred years</hi> after the <hi>Moon,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Seth.</hi> The second about <hi>four hundred years</hi> after the <hi>Flood,</hi> in the daies of <hi>Ahraham.</hi> From the <hi>first</hi> of which he <hi>conjectures</hi> onely that <hi>probably</hi> it <hi>might be.</hi> From the <hi>second</hi> he <hi>concludes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly</hi> that it <hi>was</hi> then <hi>in being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the <hi>first</hi> of these two <hi>Periods,</hi> I have two things to say to it, whereby to discover its <hi>invalidity</hi> to evince the <hi>now law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> of that once <hi>(confessedly) lawful,</hi> or at least <hi>allowed</hi> Course, or <hi>Custom</hi> of <hi>Solemn Swearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> that 'tis but upon a meer <hi>fallible, uncertain, unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conjecture</hi> at best (by <hi>H. D's</hi> own confession) on which he derives the <hi>now-warrantableness</hi> of <hi>solemn Swearing</hi> from so high as those daies of <hi>Seth;</hi> witness his own words here under-cited, out of <hi>p.</hi> 3. of his Paper, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the</hi> Antiquity <hi>of it, although I cannot say that the practice is as old as the</hi> Moon; <hi>yet I have cause to conjecture, that it is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> 300 <hi>years younger: Indeed what the old world did in this case the</hi> Scriptures <hi>do not speak plainly, and therefore I will pass it by.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By which we plainly see as concerning the <hi>first P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>riod</hi> pitch'd upon by <hi>H. D.</hi> as his proof of the <hi>Antiquity</hi> of <hi>Swearing,</hi> that, were it an <hi>Antiquity</hi> high enough from whence to argue the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of that <hi>Ceremonious Custom;</hi> yet it is but <hi>doubtfully conjectured,</hi> and but <hi>probably concluded</hi> by him, That it is so <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient,</hi> as to be in use at all in the <hi>Old World</hi> before the <hi>Flood;</hi> for he confesseth, That what <hi>the Old World did in this Case, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures do not speak plainly:</hi> And can <hi>H. D's cloudy conjecture,</hi> that <hi>probably</hi> 'tis not above 300 <hi>years younger than the Moon,</hi> be a <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent consequence</hi> to 20000 <hi>tender Consciences</hi> in a Case of such
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63753:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Concernment as this; wherein they prizing their <hi>peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science,</hi> with <hi>prison</hi> and <hi>confiscation,</hi> before <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>All they have,</hi> with the <hi>violation</hi> of them, do lack no less evidence to their <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> then <hi>infallible</hi> and <hi>Scientifical Demonstration?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That if it were as certain, as 'tis but conceived by <hi>H.

               <hi>several Oaths</hi> with the <hi>highest asseverations</hi> that can be, are by him taken; and so if he answer <hi>Yea,</hi> or <hi>Nay,</hi> an hundred times, being so many times askt in the case in hand (as one Witness may be at one Court) he takes no less then an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <hi>solemn Oaths,</hi> and so his first <hi>Oath</hi> (he once assenting to swear) like sin, which is ever of a multiplying nature, when man once begins to fall under it, spawns it self quickly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an hundred; and <hi>consideratis considerandis,</hi> our <hi>Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature,</hi> which <hi>H.

            <p>So we see that if <hi>Christ</hi> had answered, <hi>I am</hi> (as <hi>Ior.

            <p>But <hi>secondly,</hi> in very deed when all is done, there's no such matter as <hi>I.

            <p>But the Answer I give shal be as follows:</p>
            <p>1. Some things (though <hi>swearing</hi> is none of them) <hi>Paul</hi> did by <hi>permission then,</hi> which we are not <hi>now</hi> to do because he did them, witness his <hi>circumcising Timothy, shaving his head and</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63753:15"/>
               <hi>taking a Vow upon him according to the Law, Act.</hi> 16. 3. 21, 23, 24, 25. which things were parts of the Law, then <hi>(by right)</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolished, in favour of the <hi>Jewes</hi> weakness, who yet could not bear the <hi>actual abolition</hi> of them: For <hi>as for the Gentiles that believe we command</hi> (say the Apostles) <hi>that they observe no such thing:</hi> So that if <hi>Oaths</hi> had then been (<hi>de facto</hi>) used by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that <hi>of it self</hi> would not prove they <hi>now</hi> are (<hi>de jure</hi>) to be used by us.</p>
            <p>But 2. That <hi>Paul</hi> either <hi>sware,</hi> or <hi>exacted Oaths</hi> upon others I deny.</p>
            <p>1. As to his not <hi>enjoining</hi> or <hi>exacting swearing</hi> on others, which <hi>I. I.</hi> draws by the head and shoulders from the place where <hi>Paul</hi> saies to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> and <hi>Timothy, I charge you by the Lord, I charge thee before the Lord</hi> (in <hi>which places</hi> (quoth he) he <hi>charges them to swear by the Lord</hi>) I have said so much before, that here I shall add onely this consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Paul</hi> did not <hi>charge them to swear</hi> there, but to <hi>read his Epistle,</hi> and to <hi>preach the Word.</hi> 2. If he had commanded them to <hi>Swear,</hi> or <hi>exacted an Oath</hi> of them, his command was not answered by them; For shal we think the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> did <hi>swear</hi> to him, that they would <hi>read his Epistle,</hi> before they did read it, or that <hi>Timothy sware</hi> to him that he would <hi>preach the Word,</hi> before he preached it? Or if they <hi>sware</hi> not to him, did they <hi>swear</hi> before any other that were his <hi>Proxies</hi> at that distance which they were in from him, who was at <hi>Athens</hi> when he wrote to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and at <hi>Rome</hi> when he wrote to <hi>Timothy,</hi> then Bishop among the <hi>Ephesians?</hi> And if there were no <hi>Representatives</hi> of his person then with them, to tender the <hi>Oath</hi> to them, then it appears, That <hi>I. I</hi>'s eies are out, who cannot see that the <hi>commands of Paul</hi> to them, which they (<hi>respectively</hi>) obeyed, were to <hi>read his Epistle,</hi> and <hi>preach the Word,</hi> and not to <hi>swear</hi> that they would do so.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>2dly,</hi> As to <hi>Pauls</hi> own <hi>swearing,</hi> though I will not say (as <hi>I. I.</hi> sayes some say) he <hi>did evil in swearing;</hi> (for he <hi>sware</hi> not) yet in <hi>swearing</hi> he had done evil, had he sworn in those many expressions wherein <hi>H. D.</hi> and <hi>I. I.</hi> assert he <hi>did swear;</hi> and no less then this, <hi>H. D.</hi> and <hi>I. I.</hi> must be forced to confesse with me (if each of them will <hi>own</hi> his <hi>own Book</hi> in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63753:15"/>
for <hi>H. D.</hi> and <hi>I. I.</hi> (as busie as they be in banding against our interpretation of Christs Prohibition <hi>universally</hi> against <hi>swearing at all,</hi> allowing swearing only before Magistrates to end strife) yet they both confess, that at least it extends to the forbidding of <hi>ordinary, frequent,</hi> or <hi>common swearing,</hi> or <hi>swearing</hi> in our <hi>common communication,</hi> when we are not called <hi>before Magistrates:</hi> But if <hi>Paul</hi> did swear so often as J. <hi>I</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents him to us <hi>as swearing,</hi> in the many <hi>Epistles</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> above cited by him; and if it were so <hi>frequent with</hi> Paul <hi>to use expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions equal to an</hi> Oath (that is to say, to use <hi>Oaths</hi>) as <hi>H. D.</hi> says <hi>some have noted,</hi> it was from <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 9. <hi>with many more of like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;</hi> then he had come under the guilt of that, <hi>swearing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, ordinarily, frequently,</hi> or in his <hi>common communication</hi> with the Saints, and in his Letters to them, uncall'd to it by any <hi>Magistrate;</hi> which kind of <hi>swearing,</hi> these two <hi>strict sticklers</hi> for <hi>Oaths</hi> in some cases, do both confess, are by Christ <hi>Matt.</hi> 5. 33. 34. condemned and forbidden.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But quoth J. <hi>I.</hi> p. 10. If <hi>calling God to witness what we say, be not</hi> swearing, <hi>I confess I am ignorant what</hi> swearing <hi>is; but if it be, then it was not onely used under the old, but under the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Testament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep. If it be not,</hi> then J. I. stands condemned here under his own hand, as ignorant of what <hi>Swearing is,</hi> and so is unfit to meddle so much as he hath done in that matter, who (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness his Title-page) takes on him to open that <hi>great Case of Conscience</hi> about the <hi>lawfulness</hi> or <hi>unlawfulness</hi> of <hi>swearing: But if it be,</hi> then (methinks) <hi>H. D.</hi> and J. I. should sit still, and save themselves the labour of writing so much as they do against the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in vindication of the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of <hi>some swearing;</hi> for <hi>such swearing</hi> (if they will needs have it to be swearing) as <hi>Paul</hi> used when he said, <hi>God is my witness; God is my record; I call God to record;</hi> I <hi>speak the truth in Christ,</hi> I <hi>lye not; my Conscience beareth me witness in the holy Spirit;</hi> and such like, the <hi>Quakers</hi> gainsay in solemn cases no more then them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; yet they have put themselves to so much pains, as to prove the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of that, the <hi>lawfulness</hi> of which, we know none that do deny. <hi>2dly. If it be,</hi> then, methinks the <hi>wise, prudent</hi> and <hi>potent imposers</hi> of the <hi>Oath</hi> upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63753:16"/>
others, who have been ever willing to express their <hi>Renuntia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Pope,</hi> and <hi>all forreign Powers,</hi> and their <hi>Fidelity to the King,</hi> by any of those <hi>strong Asseverations,</hi> or <hi>fervent Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> used, and J. I. calleth <hi>Oaths,</hi> should accept of the like from them; but that they neither do, nor will, as they would not have accepted the like from <hi>Jer. Ives</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so as to have excused him from falling under the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the like <hi>Premunire</hi> with such as cannot conform to that <hi>ceremonious</hi> kind of <hi>swearing,</hi> which he hath sworn in, without <hi>kissing,</hi> and <hi>laying</hi> one of their fingers at least upon a <hi>Bible,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But, quoth J. I. <hi>if any one should confirm the truth of what he speaks, after this rate</hi> (meaning the <hi>rate</hi> at which <hi>Paul</hi> spake in the places fore-cited) <hi>what did <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>e less then</hi> Swearing? <hi>However it were more then</hi> Yea <hi>and</hi> Nay.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply;</hi> If it was more then <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Nay,</hi> as it was in sound of words, but not in substance, (<hi>yea</hi> and <hi>nay</hi> being spoken solemnly as in Gods sight, amounting in substance to no less then all that) yet it was less then <hi>swearing,</hi> however less then such <hi>formal, customary, ceremonious, superstitious swearing,</hi> as that J. I. is found in, which was no less <hi>foolish, needless, vain</hi> and <hi>superfluous,</hi> then it was <hi>superstitious,</hi> if less then that of <hi>touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>kissing</hi> the <hi>Book</hi> (as aforesaid) might in the Court (where he was <hi>sworn</hi>) have passed for <hi>swearing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then all <hi>H. D.</hi>'s and <hi>I. I.</hi>'s instances in proof of <hi>Oaths,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing practis'd and used in <hi>old time, before Christ,</hi> and <hi>since,</hi> prove altogether useless to that purpose.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> But (quoth <hi>H. D.</hi> p. 4.) <hi>it is warranted not onely by</hi> Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, <hi>but by</hi> Precept <hi>also,</hi> Deut. 6. 13. <hi>Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt swear by his Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> Under the Law it was (as other <hi>types, shadows</hi> and <hi>ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies</hi> also were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> warranted not by <hi>practice</hi> onely, but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> also; but still we demand, where is there either <hi>practice</hi> of it, or <hi>precept</hi> for it among <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Disciples</hi> under the <hi>Gospel?</hi> If there had been any <hi>precept</hi> for it (for <hi>practice</hi> of it, I have proved there was none) among any but <hi>men</hi> (yet <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate</hi>) in the <hi>New-Testament</hi> since the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> we should surely have had it cited by <hi>H.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63753:16"/>
stood concern'd to have cited it above all other <hi>places</hi> of his <hi>Paper-work;</hi> but since he <hi>mentions none</hi> here, we may safely take it for granted he had <hi>none to mention;</hi> and since <hi>H. D.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all his <hi>Old-Testament-talk for swearing</hi> (which had been better <hi>spar'd</hi> then <hi>spilt</hi> in proof of what none denies) nor <hi>does,</hi> nor <hi>can possibly</hi> produce one <hi>pittance</hi> of a <hi>precept</hi> for it in the <hi>New;</hi> we shall rather adhere to <hi>Christs</hi> and his <hi>Apostles plain precept against it,</hi> or <hi>positive prohibition</hi> of it, in the two Texts, which these two men, <hi>H. D.</hi> and J. I. (as will be seen anon) <hi>traduce, Mat.</hi> 5. 33, 34. &amp;c. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5. 12. then either to <hi>H.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj. It is also confirmed by</hi> Prophesies (quoth <hi>H.

               <hi>Reply;</hi> That this is spoken with reference to the time of the <hi>new Heavens and Earth,</hi> I deny not; but I deny that this clause, <hi>He that sweareth, shall swear by the God of Truth,</hi> is understood of <hi>swearing</hi> at all (<hi>formally</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> so taken) much less (as <hi>I.

            <p>And that <hi>those Oaths</hi> these men plead as necessary to end strife, are in no wise meant here, is evident by that very <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance</hi> on which they insist most strictly in proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, if considered but a little more exactly.

            <p>J <hi>Ives</hi> argues p. 11. in his fifth Reason (as is above said) from the <hi>being</hi> of <hi>strife,</hi> to the <hi>necessity</hi> of a <hi>being</hi> of <hi>Oaths</hi> to <hi>end</hi> them; but to run down and <hi>rout</hi> that <hi>reason,</hi> I shall <hi>render</hi> another <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> out of J. <hi>I</hi>'s paper p. 9. <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>latter days,</hi> when the <hi>new heavens and earth are created, wherein dwelleth righteousness,</hi> and <hi>former troubles are forgotten,</hi> there shall be no more of that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness,</hi> those <hi>fleshly works,</hi> which <hi>strife</hi> is none of the least part of; therefore no more need of <hi>Oaths then</hi> to end all stri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63753:19"/>Thus as of those that argue against our <hi>Tenet</hi> of <hi>perfecting holiness</hi> (as to <hi>purging from sin</hi>) here, from the necessity of <hi>sins continuance</hi> in them to <hi>this end,</hi> that they may be kept <hi>humble,</hi> I would fain know what need of <hi>sin to humble,</hi> when <hi>perfect holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> which can't be without <hi>true humility,</hi> which is a <hi>prime part</hi> of it, is brought in? and what shall become of <hi>Pride,</hi> when <hi>all sin,</hi> which it's <hi>not the least of,</hi> is done away?

            </p>
            <p>We see then how these <hi>two men</hi> make <hi>one head</hi> agaist <hi>one man, viz. H.

               <hi>H. D.</hi> does no more (as to this point of <hi>Prophesie</hi>) in proof of <hi>Swearing;</hi> but J. I. doubles his Files, and fights on as follows, pag. 9.</p>

            <p>And because <hi>H.

               <hi>William Swinderby</hi> said, The <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Prelacy,</hi> neither any <hi>Ordinary,</hi> can compel any man to <hi>swear</hi> by any <hi>Creature of God,</hi> or by the <hi>Bible Book.</hi>

               <hi>William Thorp</hi> was accused, that the second Sunday after <hi>Easter</hi> he said openly in St. <hi>Chaddes</hi> Church in his Sermon, That Priests have no title to Tythes, and that it is not <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to swear in any wise.</hi>

            <p>Again, <hi>Will.

            <p>
               <hi>Walter Bruce</hi> in his Answer concerning <hi>Swearing,</hi> saith, I believe and obey the Doctrine of Almighty God, and my <hi>Master Iesus Christ,</hi> which teacheth, that <hi>Christian men</hi> in affirmation of a Truth, should pass the <hi>righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees</hi> of the old Testament, or else he exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them from the Kingdom of Heaven; for he saith, <hi>Unless your Righteousness exceed the Righteousness of the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as concerning Oaths, he saith, <hi>It hath been said to them of old time. Thou shalt not for swear thy self, but shalt perform unto the Lord what thou vowest; But I say, Thou shalt not swear at all; but let your communication be,</hi> yea, yea, nay, nay; <hi>for whatsoever shall be more then this, proceedeth of evil.</hi> Therefore saith he, as the <hi>perfection</hi> of the <hi>antient men</hi> of the Old Testament was not to <hi>for swear</hi> themselves; so the <hi>perfection of Christian men</hi> is, <hi>not to swear at all;</hi> because they are commanded of Christ, whose commands in no case must be broken. Although that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> is contrary to the Doctrine of Christ.</p>
            <p>Likewise in Queen <hi>Maryes</hi> dayes, in the fourth Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of one <hi>Elizabeth Young,</hi> before the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter <hi>Martin,</hi> and others. See <hi>Fox 2d. Vol.</hi> pag. 1874.</p>

sincere hearted <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Christians</hi> of this Age, called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> who consent not with the world, and actions of it, in that or any other <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>evil customs,</hi> being chosen and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by Christ's blood from among them.</p>
            <p>So Christ uttered many <hi>Truths</hi> in <hi>general terms,</hi> which must <hi>admit of exception,</hi> but then those <hi>exceptions</hi> also are <hi>expressed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Christ said <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. to <hi>all the sinners</hi> that stood about him in these <hi>general terms,</hi> ye shall <hi>all perish,</hi> this was not without an <hi>exception</hi> of such as should <hi>repent;</hi> but then that <hi>exception</hi> was not without an <hi>expression; viz. Except ye repent:</hi> he said oft to all his hearers, <hi>Ye cannot enter into the kingdom of God,</hi> that was not without <hi>exceptions,</hi> nor those <hi>exceptions</hi> without <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, viz. Except ye be converted,</hi> and become as <hi>little children,</hi> and Matth. 5. <hi>Except your righteousness exceed that of the Scribes and Pharises,</hi> many of whom yet were blameless, as to that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Letter of the Law.</p>
            <p>Yea in the Verses immediately before this <hi>universal prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Swear not at all,</hi> Matth. 5. 30, 31. Christ saies, '<hi>Twas said of old, if any will put away his Wife, let him give her a Bill of Divorce: but I say whosoever shall put away his Wife, causeth her to commit Adultery:</hi> this general term admits of an <hi>exception,</hi> but then that <hi>exception</hi> is thus <hi>exprest, viz. Saving for the cause of Fornication;</hi> i. e. <hi>Except</hi> she play the Harlot.</p>
            <p>But now as to this <hi>general term</hi> and <hi>universal prohibition, Swear not at all,</hi> it cannot be taken with <hi>restriction,</hi> or as <hi>admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> of <hi>any exception;</hi> because there is not onely <hi>no expression</hi> made any where (after it) of any such <hi>exception,</hi> but a <hi>fuller amplification</hi> of it by such particulars, as are more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>exclusive of all kinds of Oaths,</hi> and of <hi>all Oaths</hi> of any kind, thus, <hi>viz.</hi> Nor by <hi>Heaven,</hi> nor <hi>Earth,</hi> &amp;c. nor any <hi>other Oath:</hi> And also by the Apostle <hi>Iames</hi> 5. 12. a <hi>reinforcement</hi> and <hi>reduplication</hi> of the said <hi>universal prohibition:</hi> Whereas if Christ had intended <hi>any exception</hi> here, he might as easily have exprest it, and would as <hi>assuredly,</hi> as he did <hi>immediately</hi> above, in the case of <hi>Divorce</hi> by, <hi>Except in the case of Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and so have said, <hi>Swear not at all, except it be solemne and sacred Oaths,</hi> in <hi>Courts,</hi> when yee are called to <hi>swear before a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate upon a Book:</hi> But as I said, in stead of <hi>expressing</hi> any <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:63753:33"/>
he adds that which more strengthens and clears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all <hi>exception,</hi> the <hi>universality</hi> of his <hi>prohibition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we see in how <hi>mean</hi> a <hi>manner</hi> J.

            <p>And howbeit he hopes he hath the <hi>price he runs for,</hi> and so (<hi>in words</hi>) wishes <hi>that God may have the glory;</hi> yet <hi>in deed</hi> and <hi>truth God's Name</hi> hath <hi>dishonor,</hi> and his <hi>Truth shame</hi> by his <hi>dawby do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi> And if he have the <hi>price he runs for</hi> (as he hath not, if it be no more then the proving of <hi>Oaths now lawful,</hi> for he fails in that, but yet hath (for a time at least) if it be the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Estate, as some not ungroundly suspect it is) yet what will that profit him, had he not onely <hi>sav'd his own,</hi> but <hi>gain'd the whole world</hi> to boot by it, seeing thereby he hath <hi>lost himself</hi> (unless he yet <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>recant</hi> his rashness in so running) in the sight of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>good men.</hi>

            <p>But the scruple that seems to hang behind in H.

            <p>
               <hi>Rep.</hi> We do not say it is; but if it be not, are there not more wayes <hi>out of the wood,</hi> as well as <hi>into it,</hi> then one? If that be not the reason why he sayes, <hi>Above all things swear not,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63753:38"/>
               <hi>swearing</hi> is a <hi>sin above all sins,</hi> can no other reason then barely that be rendered for it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> et <hi>I. Ives</hi> resolve <hi>H. Den</hi> in that difficulty, if it be too hard for him to resolve himself in it: For <hi>I.

            <p>One thing more, which is not a little considerable to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the now lawfulness of any <hi>Swearing</hi> is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That by the <hi>Eternal Wisdom</hi> of <hi>God</hi> (in that Book of <hi>Ecclesiastes,</hi> or the <hi>Preacher,</hi> wherein not the <hi>Legal,</hi> but the <hi>Evangelical duties</hi> and <hi>righteousness,</hi> and the <hi>sins</hi> and <hi>unrighteousness</hi> opposite thereto are written of, and the <hi>spiritualities</hi> and <hi>moralities</hi> of the <hi>Everlasting Gospel,</hi> and not the <hi>ceremonialities</hi> of the Law pointed out) whereas To fear <hi>an Oath</hi> is made the <hi>Character</hi> of the <hi>wise, good, clean</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> man that sacrificeth acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptably to God, To swear (at all) is made the <hi>Character</hi> of

the <hi>wicked,</hi> the <hi>unclean,</hi> the <hi>sinner</hi> that (<hi>so</hi>) sacrificeth not, <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</hi> 9. 1, 2. the bare reading of which is enough to win a wise man from the sin of <hi>Swearing;</hi> for howbeit men shall once return and discern the happiness of him that serves God, from his <hi>wo</hi> who serves him not, yet here <hi>one event is to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and the wicked, to the good and to the clean and to the unclean, to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; as he that sweareth,</hi> (mark, not he that swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth exorbitantly onely, or forsweareth) <hi>so he that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth an Oath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much more might be said to these mens <hi>shuffles;</hi> but a <hi>little strength</hi> may serve wherewith to overturn a <hi>little strength;</hi> and as it's <hi>superfluity</hi> to insist too long in <hi>disproving</hi> such <hi>palpable ped<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and <hi>discovering</hi> such <hi>open subtilty,</hi> as shews it self in their two pieces; so its but <hi>meer vanity</hi> to use a <hi>Beetle</hi> and <hi>Wedges</hi> to kil a flye.</p>

                  <p>I Am at this time surprized with a holy passion; and though <hi>Ionah</hi> could not say concerning the <hi>Gourd,</hi> that he did wel to be angry; yet (if my experience in the Word of the Lord doth not deceive) I can truly say, I do wel to be angry with you; who I have had a godly jealousie of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; <hi>viz.</hi> That you would be as easily perswaded to part with,—as unwilling to suffer for, your Spiritual Liberties: Oh my Brethren! where is your first love? How unlike the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians in former times are you? whose zeal was so hot for God, that their eyes prevented the morning, that thereby they might prevent the rage of the adversary, who (as it is now) <hi>Commanded them no more to worship in the Name of the Lord.</hi>—I always did conclude, that those that would—quit the Cause of Righteousness—would quit the Ways of Holiness, as yesterday sad experience hath taught, to the perpetual joy of your adversaries, and the sadning the hearts, and adding afflictions to the bonds of the Prisoners of the Lord: I do therefore conjure you, as you wil answer the great God ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, to consider, That now is the time for you to look to your Ministry, and to the Flock over which the Lord hath made you overseers, that you may be able through grace to say, <hi>You are clear from the blood of all men;</hi> and observe,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:63753:41"/>
that God is now come to prove you, to see whether you wil keep his commandements or not. Remember when that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postates Case was debated, you had no zeal nor indignation against him, but you smothered all with this, If it were in a matter of Faith and Worship that he had fallen from, you would have been as one man against it: Wel, behold the Lord is come home to you; the matter now is purely for worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God; now God is proving to see if you wil obey him or no, and did not yesterdays work witness, that you were willing to prefer the fear of a man that must dye, before the fear of the great God; and the fear of them that can kill the body, before the fear of the Lord that can cast body and soul into Hell? I have no more to say but this, That your Cowardly Temporizing and complying with the precepts of Men, makes me jealous, that your fear towards the Lord is taught by the precepts of Men: I would not be too censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but my Grounds are great, and my <hi>Bonds</hi> are my <hi>Crown,</hi> but your, Cowardly spirit is my <hi>great Cross:</hi> you lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle think what a scandal it is amongst us to hear it affirmed, that one of you should say, <hi>You had rather a given fifty pound then haue sworn,</hi> and yet <hi>swear</hi> that you <hi>swear willingly. Oh for the Lords sake do somewhat that may roul away this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach;</hi> which that you may, is the praiers of your Brother, who could be contented to write himself, your Companion in Tribulation,</p>
