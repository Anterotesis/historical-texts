            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

She thus sitting on the bull, was caried like a shippe, her scarfe seruing in stead of a sayle. Round about the bull Dolphins floted about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and spor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at their loues in such sort, as that you would thinke, you saw their verie motions drawne. There was a litle boy, which led the bull, displaying his wings abroade, holding in his hand a Torch, and turning to <hi>Iupiter</hi> did smile, as though he mocked him, that he for his cause was thus transformed into a Bull. I thus beholding this picture, praysed euery part thereof: but looking more earnestly vpon <hi>Cupid,</hi> which ledde the Bull, I spake thus to my selfe: Beholde how heauen, sea and land, do obey the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements of this litle boy when as a yong man which was then by chance present, and vnderstood my words, sayd: This thing truly I can testifie, to whom for loues sake, so many aduersities haue hapned. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> said I, I pray good fellow tel me what maner, &amp; what they be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast suffered? for thy

countenaunce doth shewe that thou hast had something to doo with the mysteries of this God. Then answered he: you do call me sir backe, to recount a most mingled and confused bedrole of vnfortunate mishaps: all which wil seem to you to be but mere fables, and idle figments. Then said I, no I swear by <hi>Ioue</hi> and god <hi>Cupid</hi> himself, that the recounting of these thy misfortunes will not be troublesome to me, but rather the more acceptable, because they may séeme to be somewhat fabulous: when as I had said so, I tooke the man by the hand, and led him into a wood hard by, where many broad béeches, and dark shadowing plain trées did grow, neare vnto the banks of christal streame: which gently running did yéeld a pleasant murmuring. There when I had chosen a fit seate I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then (said I) now is it time that you begin to declare your hard mishaps, for here is a place altogither full of delight, and fit for such amourous discourses: then hée from the beginning began to speak thus. My Country is <hi>Phaenicia,</hi> borne in <hi>Tyrus</hi>; my name is <hi>Clitophon,</hi> my father called <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pias,</hi> my fathers brother in lawe is called <hi>Sostratus,</hi> for my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had two wiues: This <hi>Socratus,</hi> because of an inheritance which descended to him there by his mother, dwelt alwaies at <hi>Byzantiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> My father dwelt at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> my own mother I neuer saw, for she died whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I was a child; my father therfore married another wife, by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had a daughter called <hi>Caligone;</hi> which he decréed to make my wife: but the destinies which are more mighty the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mortal man, had appointed the contrary, and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued another for that end. For oftentimes the gods do accustome to foretell things to come to mortall men by dreames, not that by foreknowing of daungers they should auoyde them (for no man can auoyde that which the Destenies haue decréed) but that when they fall out, they should beare them with more pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience: for suddaine and vnexpected misfortunes, do quell and rent the minde stroken with their vnlooked for comming: but those which are knowne before and foretold, whilst the minde by little and little is brought to the cogitation of them, doo farre lesse trouble them. Therfore when I came to ninetéene yeares

of age, and my father not long after had appointed the mariage to be solemnized, then fortune began to act her Commedie: for when I had layd mee downe to rest, <hi>Morpheus</hi> beganne to fill my head full of his fantasies, and idle dreames: me thought that I was so ioyned together with a mayde, that from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill to the heade we were but one body, and then after wee grew all into one; me thought there stoode a woman behinde me, whose visage was grim, stature tall, ghastly lookes, bloodie eyes, sharpe chéekes, her haires vipers and adders, holding in her left hand a firebrand, wherewith in a rage she stroke me a blowe, in that part where both our bodies did come into one, and by force did rent her from me againe: wherefore being stroken with feare, I awaked out of my dreame, neither did I disclose this to any: but still by my selfe alone I thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them often. In the meane season there came Letters from <hi>Byzantium,</hi> from my vncle <hi>Sostratus,</hi> to my Father, whose tenour was thus.</p>

            <p>My father hauing read the Letter, rose vp presently, and went vnto the sea shore: and not long after he returned againe with a great traine of seruants and maydes, which <hi>Sostratus</hi> had sent with his wife and his daughter. Amongst them was a most beautifull woman, of stature tall, in rich and sumptuous apparell; vpon whom as soone as euer I had cast mine eyes, I remembred <hi>Europa,</hi> sayling vpon the backe of the Bull: her eyes did séeme to be quicke, rolling with a pleasant kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, her haire yellow and curled, her eye browes were of a pure blacke, her eyes white, saue that the middle was tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a bright delightfull redde, lyke to that die wherewith the <hi>Lydian</hi> women doo colour their yuorie: her mouth begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15835:7"/>
to open her corall lips, like sweet rose leaues, wherfore as soone as I saw her, I presently felt a gréeuous wound pear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to my hart. For beautie is sharper then any dart to wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d withall, &amp; by the eies making passage for his amorous wound, pearceth to the heart. In the very selfe same moment of time, I did both praise her stature, was amazed at her beautie, tremble in mind, and more eagerly admire her beautie, and oftentimes did I striue to withdraw mine eyes from beholding her, but they still resisted: for being allured with the swéetnesse &amp; excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie of her beautie, turned themselues thither againe, and at length they inioyed the victory. But the women being brought in, one part of the house was appointed for the many father co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded supper to be made ready: and when supper time was come, my father had appointed that on euery side of the table two should sit, he &amp; I in the midle, the mothers on the left hand, and the daughters on the right: but when I marked how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly opposite she was placed against me, a sudden ioy rose in my mind of a sudden, to thinke of her who now was the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site marke whom my thoughts should ayme at. For what I did eate in that supper I cannot very well tell: for I was like to the saints to whom meat is offred, yet eate nothing: or else like to those who dreame of supper: but sitting vp directly, my back leaning agaynst the wall, I did altogether behold the Mayd, earnestly beholding and stealing, as it were her beautie. And this was all my supper. After the Table was taken away, one of the boyes of the house came to the Table, and began to play on a Citterne: and first striking the strings with his finger a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, gaue a small shrill sound: then taking a quill when he had timed it, he sung a song to his instrument, howe <hi>Apollo</hi> did blame <hi>Daphne</hi> for flying away, and how he himselfe pursued her: and euen now was about to take hold of her, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maid might be transformed into a trée, with whose leaues he did plat himself a crowne. The which song did minister more heat vnto my fire: for amorous talke is a certaine vehement incitation of desire. And although that a man by nature were temperat, yet by an exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple he would be drawn to folow, &amp; so much the sooner, by how much the example were more excellent: for that same
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15835:7"/>
bashfulnesse, which did call one back from offending, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled by the dignitie of some worthier thing, is chaunged into lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tiousnesse. Wherfore I spake to my self thus what was not <hi>Apollo</hi> taken in loue? and cast away al shame? and openly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sued a virgin, why dost thou therfore languish in slouthfulnes, and being ouercome with shamefastnesse, dost prefer continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, before thy desire? what art thou better then a God? But when it began to wex somwhat late, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> went first to bed, &amp; not long after we also: others hauing bestowed the pleasure of their supper on their bellies, but I on my eies: for being full with the pleasant countenance &amp; most swéete lookes, &amp; euen in a maner drunke with loue it selfe, I went into my cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber, where I accustomed to lie, but no sléepe would harbor in my wearie eies. For surely it is so ordained by nature, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al diseases, yet especially those of the body are more troublesome by night, and when we are at rest they are most busie to torment vs, and do afflict vs wish greater griefe: for when our members are at ease, then hath y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wound time to rage. And such is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of a wounded mind: for when the body doth cease fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> motions, the mind being grieued doth afflict one beyond al measure: for the eies and eares in the day time are occupied about many matters, and do not féele the sharpe cogitations, but withdraw the mind so, that it can haue no time to grieue: but if euery part be detained with pleasing rest, the mind the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gathering himselfe togither is tossed vp &amp; down with the daily stormes of hard mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps: all which till then did lie asléepe, but new are awaked and ready at hand: for in mourning there are sorows: in cares cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: in dangers feare: in loue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall burning fire: thus euery sorrow hath his passions. At length morning appeared, and sléepe taking pitie of me, brought me a little ease: yet would not this we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch out of my mind, but al my dreams were of <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippe,</hi> me thought I talked with her, I plaid with her, I supped with her, &amp; did attaine more pleasures then in the day time: I kissed her, and did attaine more pleasures: not long after came in one of the seruants of the house, and awaked me, whose im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunatenesse I cursed, because he had interrupted me of so swéete a dreame. And rising out of my bedde, I went
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15835:8"/>
of purpose, and walked in the Gallerie which lay before this Maydes doore, and I brought with me a booke, which looking down I did read so, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I came ouer against her doore, I cast mine eies vpon her. And hauing walked thus a while drawing in more loue by beholding, I went my way, my mind miserably afflicted: and after this maner I spent three daies: I had a kinsman in the house, whose father &amp; mother both were dead, his name was <hi>Clinias,</hi> he was two yeares elder then I, and was in loue with a yong boy, to whom he vsed such libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, that hauing bought a goodly faire gelding, the boy co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding him, he presently bestowed it vpon him. Euermore did I mocke and ieast with him, that he had so much leysure from his businesse, to spend his time in loue, and still to be held fast in his delights: but he smiling vpon me, and shaking his head, sayd: I hope yet that at length the time will come, that you be caught in loues snares also; to him then I came, and hauing saluted him, I sate downe by him: now (said I) O <hi>Clinias,</hi> do I suffer punishment for the reproches which I bestowed on thée: for now I my self am taken in loue also: then he clapping both his hands togither, fell into a great laughter: and rising vp kissed my face, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which shewed what amorous watching I had endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and said: true it is that thou art in loue, for thine eyes doe shew as much: he had scant said these words, when <hi>Charicles</hi> (for so was the boy called) came running in, &amp; said: I am come to thée, O <hi>Clinias,</hi> wonderfully gréeued in mind, to declare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thée: and here togither with <hi>Clinias</hi> he fetcht a great sigh: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
               <hi>Clinias</hi> as it were depending of his soule, with a foultering tong, said. Thou dost kil me with thy silence, what it is that tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth thée thus? or with whom dost thou striue? Then said <hi>Charicles,</hi> my father goeth about to marry mee to a wife, and she is hard fauored, and deformed too, that I might be tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a double hell: for since a faire wife is a great trouble, how can it otherwise be, but that an ill fauored one m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15835:8"/>
wexed pale, and inueying bitterly agaynst women kind, he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently disswaded him from mariage, saying: what, doth thy father go about to marry thée? What hast thou deserued, that thou shouldst be cast into bondes? doest not thou heare great <hi>Ioue</hi> himselfe speaking for thée thus?</p>
            <q>
               <l>To these Ile giue the price of the heauenly fire stoln away,</l>
               <l>To be a plague which none shall shun, ne euer shal decay.</l>
            </q>
            <p>Such is the pleasure which is gotten in such matters, that it may be very wel likened to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> nature of the Mermaids, for they by the swéetnesse of their songs, do vtterly destroy those which listen to them: and thou maist behold the greatnesse of the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps insuing, by the very preparation of the marriage: as by the swéete sounding of the Musicke, clapping togither of doores, and burning of Tapers. Now who seeing such great tumults and stirre, would not count him vnfortunate that goeth about to take a wife? to me he seemeth to go vnto a battell: and if that thou didst abhor y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> studie of humanitie, then thou mightest perhaps be ignorant in the misaduentures which haue happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by women: but when thou hast profited so well in that art, that thou canst remember what arguments they haue mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred for the stage, why shouldst thou forget the Iewell of <hi>Ery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phile,</hi> the banket of <hi>Phylomela,</hi> the slaunder of <hi>Sthenoboea,</hi> the incest of <hi>Aerope,</hi> the crueltie of <hi>Progne</hi> in killing her own childe? What and if the beautie of <hi>Chriseis,</hi> did allure <hi>Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memnon,</hi> the fauour of <hi>Bryseis</hi> intice <hi>Achilles,</hi> yet they were cause that both their armies were consumed by the plague. <hi>Candaules</hi> king of <hi>Lydia,</hi> maried a faire wife, but he was slain by her: the nuptial torches of <hi>Helen</hi> burnt <hi>Troy:</hi> the chastitie of <hi>Penelope,</hi> caused a great number of gallant wooers to be slain: <hi>Phaedra</hi> caused <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> whom she loued, and <hi>Clytemne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra,</hi> caused <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> whome she hated, presently to bée made away. O women readie to all wickednesse, which are a lyke pernicious vnto them whom they loue, as to those whome they hate. And what was the reason why
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15835:9"/>
               <hi>Agamemnon</hi> should be slaine, whose beautie was diuine.</p>
            <q>
               <l>His head and eyes were like to almightie <hi>Ioue,</hi>

               <l>And did like maiestie with his person moue.</l>
            </q>
            <p>And yet (oh <hi>Iupiter!</hi>) such a mans head was cut off by a woman: and for faire women let this suffice, in whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany a meane vnhappinesse is alwayes present. For beautie sometimes doth ease calamities: and it alone is one good thing amongest so manie badde. But if shée be (as you say) defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, you are punished indéede with a double hell: and who by any meanes can endure it, especially being of so tender age, and rare beautie? Do not (by the immortall Gods) O <hi>Charicles,</hi> cast thy selfe into seru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then sayde <hi>Charicles,</hi> the Gods and I haue alwayes had a care of this, and the marriage shall not bée yet this good while, and many things may bée done by night: and wée will consider of it at our leysure. Wherefore, nowe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maynes that I go and exercise my selfe with the horse which you gaue mée, for as yet I neuer did ride him. So hée went away about to ende his first and last race: but I went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde to declare vnto <hi>Clinias</hi> howe all my matters stoode, howe I fell into loue, and how I enioyed the sight of her: I tolde him also her lodging, her supper, her beautie. At length perceyuing my selfe to talke somewhat absurdly: O <hi>Clinias</hi> (said I) I can neuer be euen with griefe, for loue hath cast all his furie vpon me, and hath left mée no place to take my rest: <hi>Leucippe</hi> is alwayes in my minde, in my eyes, in my heart, and al my cogitations: neither euer was there any man to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> like mishap euer happened, for my griefe lyeth at home. Thou talkest like a mad man, sayd <hi>Clinias,</hi> since it is not possible to inioy a more happier loue then thou dost: for thou hast no néed
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15835:9"/>
to go to another mans house, no néed of passengers betwéene, fortune hath not separated her from thée, but euen placed her togither with thée in the same house: to another which is in loue, it is sufficient if he can but inioy his mistresse lookes, and he accounteth it the greatest pleasure that is, but to satisfie his eyes with beholding her: but they are thought most happy, who haue libertie to talke togither: but thou dost both sée her, heare her, and eat &amp; drinke togither with her. And although that thou art thus happy, yet thou complainest, &amp; dost beare an vngrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mind towards <hi>Cupid,</hi> who hath done thus much for thée: dost not thou know yet, that there is greater pleasure in behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thy mistresse, then in touching her? For while the eies do looke one vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another, like vnto a looking glasse, they do take in them the true proportion of the body: for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very images of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie sent from the body, &amp; by the help of the eies falling to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> hart, do there, although the bodies be separated asunder, inioy a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie méeting: and it is farre more delightfull then the carnall co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation of the bodies, which doth séeme to me to be but altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vaine: and to tell you briefly my opinion, what I thinke, continuall vse hath greatest force to perswade, and the eyes are the getters of loue: and to get fauor, daily custome doth most of all auaile, whose force truly is such, that it wil tame the very sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage wild beasts, much more women. Moreouer, the equalitie in yeares will auaile much to obtaine her fauour for euer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the like is the best coherence: and so it is ordained by nature, that euery like chooseth his like: so that where she doth perceiue shée is loued, she will requite it with a mutuall loue againe, for euery maid would haue her self accounted faire and beautifull, and doth reioice to be beloued, and doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend her louer as a witnesse of her beautie. And if there be any which thinketh she is beloued of no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therfore this one thing especially I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to do, that you endeuor by all meanes to bring it so to passe, that she may think she is beloued of you: &amp; soone after wil she imitate you: but how may these de done which you tell me?

Then answered <hi>Clinias,</hi> you néed not take such paines to learne this of others, for <hi>Cupid</hi> himselfe herein will be your maister: for euen as litle infants who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no man teacheth to suck, yet they by themselues do learne, &amp; naturally do know norish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be in their mothers dugs: so yong men being first with child of loue, haue néede of no maister to instruct them to bring forth: but if griefe torment you, &amp; the length of time do cause any necessitie, although that this bee your first deliuery: yet you shall not erre in any thing: for this God himselfe will take vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to play the Midwife, as time and occasion shall affoord, so must you apply your talke: but aboue all things take héed of vnchast and immodest dealings: but vse the matter so with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as that by your action they might conceiue your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.

O most vnfortunat art of riding: thou art not taken from me by the accustomed kind of death: neither haste thou the very image which a dead man shoulde haue: in dead bodies though that the liuelynesse of the visage and other parts of the body depart, yet the fauour remaineth, which yet might something lighten my gréefe, for although death take away the life from a man, yet he doth leaue the fauour of his countena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce behind him, but yet these are al taken from thée: wherefore thou doost die a double death, both of body and soule also: so now thy ghost will wander abroad, and thy soule is flowne away, which I shall neuer find more.

O vnhappie man that I am, to buy him which should be the authour of thy death. When all solemnities for the funerall were ended, I went to <hi>Leucippe,</hi> which then was walking in the Gardaine, within the Gardain there was a little arbour compassed round with a little wall, at euery corner was a piller which did beare vp the worke in the toppe, al this arbour within was set with pleasant floures, swéete plants, and wouen rounde with gréene boughes; and bound togither with such art, as that naturally they did séeme to imbrace one another; for the greatest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trées which did grow there, were Iuie, Priuet, and this clipt about a thicke plane trée; the other about the swéete berry trée; so that the tree was the supporter of the Iuie, and the Iuie a Garlande for the trée: about both these trées a great vine did wind about; which being loaden with ripe grapes, did yéeld pleasant fruit for the gatherers: all the ground vnderneath was set with pleasant floures, and when the leaues of the trées shaken by the winde did remoue a litle, and gaue passage for the beames of the Sun, so that all the floures did séeme then to striue, to shewe the bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of themselues: the Rose and the Daffodil did seeme to colour the place purple; which being blowne with a gentle Westerne winde, did breath sweete odours, refreshing the sences with a pleasing smell, sending downe a swéet refreshing to the inward parts within: the Daffodil was almost like the Rose, which sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med as yet to retaine the verie hew it selfe of faire <hi>Narcissus,</hi> when <hi>Eccho</hi> with other of her sister Nymphes, sought to allure the swéete boy: there were also Uiolets, whose colour was like to the colour of a calme sea, on the toppe of which stood, a drop of pure water, as it were a faire spring rising from the roote, and cast the reflexe like vnto a glasse, there séemed to be two Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines, one in déed, the other but a shadow: In this arbor were
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:15835:12"/>
diuers sorts of birds, whereof some were tame, and fedde with the hand, others were at libertie and wilde, skipping vpon the toppes of the boughes; as the Grashopper and the Swallow, noted chiefly for their chattering: some glittering with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their feathers, as the Peacocke, Parret, and Swanne: the Grashopper did recount y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> lodgings of <hi>Aurora,</hi> the Swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low did sing of the banquet of <hi>Tereus:</hi> the Swanne did féed at the head of a spring: the Parret did hang in a Cage among the boughes: but the Peacocke amid the floures displaying of his traine, did striue to excel the brightnesse of the floures, and the bright shining of the other birds: wherefore that I might make the mayd know that my spéeches did tend to loue, I beganne to talke with <hi>Satyrus,</hi> the argument of my talke being taken from the Peacocke, and shee by chaunce walking with <hi>Clio,</hi> stood iust before him as he displayed his traine. Truly sayd I, the Peacocke doth not do this, without great art, for being now readie to loue, and desirous to allure his female, adorneth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe after the manner as you sée: doo not you sée (and poynted with my hand) how the Peahen standes behinde the trée? to her doth hee shewe himselfe thus in his brauery: shewing the bewtie of his plumes, wherein the eyes being set in order in gold, bordered with purple, do cast a radiant shining to the eye: then <hi>Satyrus</hi> knowing my meaning, and to what end this talk belonged, replied: And doth the force of loue extend so farre, as that birds be enflamed with a certaine heate of his fire? Then answered I: yea not onely birds, but also Serpents, foure-foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted beasts, plants and stones are naturally inclined to loue: for the loadstone doth loue yron, that if so be that it touch it, or be but neare it, it draweth it to it, as it were fed with an amorous heate: what I pray you, is not that a kinde of mutuall kissing, betwéene the louing stone and the loued yron. Moreouer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning plants, it is the opinion of all Philosophers (which tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I thought had bene but a mere fable, vntil I saw the proofe thereof) that plants naturally did loue one another: of which number is the Date Trée, for it is reported, that there is both male and female, and that the male doth feruently loue his fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male,

In Serpents also, although there be not the same kind of loue, yet to seuerall sorts, there are seuerall incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations: for the Uiper is a serpent which liues on the land, and naturally doth desire copulation with the lamperd, which by forme is a serpent, but by vse a fish: they when they would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company togither, the Uiper climbes vnto the toppe of a rock, and there hisseth a while, whom when the Lampred heareth, she swimmeth to the shore, neither doth she go forth to this her Louer vpon the sodaine, knowing his venomous téeth to be full of poyson; but climing vp to the toppe of a cliffe, doth expect him there, vntill he hath cast all the poyson from him: In the meane while, these two do behold one another, but assoone as she seeth the poyson cast on the ground, and all her feare is past, she ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steneth to her Louer, to enioy their amorous imbracings, not fearing now to kisse her spouse. When as I had made an ende of my spéech, I earnestly viewed how <hi>Leucippe</hi> hearing this amorous discourse was affected, which truly did so shewe her selfe, as that I ghessed she heard them with a willing minde:

but still <hi>Leucippes</hi> countenance séemed to me stil to surpasse the glittering shewe of the Peacocks traine, for her bewtie might contend very well with the flowers of the Gardaine: the forme of the Dassadill did shine in her forhead, the colour of the Rose did glister in her chéekes, the brightnesse of the Uiclet did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in her eyes, her haire did imitate the curling of the Uine, and such was the admirable bewtie of her face: Not long after she departed thence, for the time was come that she accustomed to play on her Lute, neither did she depart away from me, for stil her image remained in my eyes.

To whom <hi>Dionysius</hi> answered: This water commeth out of the Uine braunch, and this blood commeth forth of the cluster of Grapes: and foorthwith hée ledde the shepheard to his Uineyarde, and shewed him his Uines, and plucking off two or thrée bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of Grapes and crushing them togither, this saith he is the

Among which, the picture of <hi>Dionysius</hi> was drawne, through which shining Glasse, I did more earnestly behold <hi>Leucippe,</hi> for <hi>Loue</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> are two violent gods, which boysterously assailing the heart, doth so heat it with an vnaccustomed fire, that they do co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>strain one to forget all modestie, whilest the one doeth yéeld his accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed fire, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other doth minister matter for this fire, for wine is the food of loue: wherfore I did behold her more attentiuely, and she in like maner did behold me. And after this maner we spent ten dayes, wherein we neither did assay any thing, but onely did behold one another. At length I declared all my loue to <hi>Satyrus,</hi> and beséeched him that he would helpe me in this necessitie. I did know all this, quoth he, before you tolde me, but I would not séeme to know it, or tooke the lesse notice of it: For a secret louer, if any do detect his loue will hate the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vnto death, and neuer cease his hatred, vntill he haue found a iust reuenge.

by the hande, and claspe her fingers, and in clasping sigh: if then that you see shée take this willingly, you may truly call her Mistresse, and kisse her the more often. Truly (quoth I) you haue instructed me verie well, and spoken verie well to the matter: but I feare greatly, least that my weakenesse bée such, that I am not able to bée a fitte Souldier to march vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der loues Banner.

And when hee had sayde so, he departed from mée, but I was left alone, wherefore I felt my selfe no little mooued with <hi>Satyrus</hi> his woordes, and imagining with my selfe how I might so behaue my selfe, that when I came into her presence I might not faile in any thing, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus to my selfe: how long wilt thou effeminate foole bee mute?

When I had spoken thus solitarily to my selfe, I espied vpon a sodaine <hi>Lucippe,</hi> comming to méete me: and as soone as I saw her I wexed pale, but afterwards I blushed: she then was alone, for <hi>Clio</hi> was gone away from her.

And then as we were thus talking, by good fortune it hapned, that a waspe did flie humming round about my face, and occasion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, I stroke her to my face, who instantly did sting me on the lip, so that I feined my self to be in great paine: wherfore the maid running to me presently, tooke me by the hand, &amp; asked me where I was hurt, I answered in my lip: &amp; why dost not y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> O deare <hi>Lucippe</hi> charme it? then she about to charm it, put her mouth to my lip, &amp; touching the very outward part of my lip, mumbled some certaine thing, I know not what: in the meane while I did closely steale a kisse: but she whilest she was in her charm, did so vse her self therin, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> now she would ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, now she

For the mouth is the instrument of the voice, and the voice is the shadow of the mind, the touching therefore of the lippes, whilst it doth ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a kinde of pleasure in the nether partes, doth also draw the minds as it were mutually to kisse one another: neither doo I remember y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euer such a like motion happened to my sences, neither any thing which may contend in pleasure with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous kisse.

Not long after, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had appointed my mariage to be solemnised sooner then first he had appointed, but yet he was often troubled in his dreames, for he dreamed that when the nuptiall tapers were set on fire they presently were extinguished, and wée when

The <hi>Hyacinth</hi> séemed to be like the rose: the <hi>Amethist</hi> doth glister like vnto the colour of gold: in the middle of the iewell were set thrée precious stones, which were placed with such art, that all of them séemed to participate one anothers colour, and did shew as if they were al one substance, the bottome whereof was blacke, the toppe rising vp in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a spire was redde, the middle white, participating also both the blacke and redde.

Wherefore as the maner is before the mariage begin, my father appointed a solemne ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to be said? Which when I vnderstood, I now thought my selfe quite vndoone: &amp; I did deuise with my selfe by all meanes, how this might be deferred vntill another time. While I was in this browne studio, I heard a suddaine vprore of men in the chamber where they doo accustome to kill the sacrifice, and it was after this maner? When my father had killed a lambe for the sacrifice, and taken the entrayles, and laide them on the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, a mightie Eagle came roaring from about, and snatched them away, neither could they that stoode by it helpe it by any way, wherefore she did fly away with her pray? And this was thought to be a signe of ill lucke: and from that day the maria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges were deferred: wherefore my father caused all the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and sooth-sayers, to be sent for: and he declared to them all the matter: wherefore they sayd they should go to the sea, and at midnight sacrifice to <hi>Iupiter Hospitalis,</hi> for thither they sayd, the Eagle did flie, and the entral did there fall from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea. But I greatly reioyced at this mishappe, which had thus deliuered me from a perpetuall seruitude: I commended the Eagle saying, that she worthilie deserued to bee called the Quéene of all birdes. But that which was foretold by this ill lucke, fell out not long after, <hi>Callisthenes</hi> a yong man of <hi>By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zantium,</hi> whose father and mother both were dead, rich, su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous, and giuen to ryot, he hearing that <hi>Sostratus</hi> had a fayre daughter, although he neuer saw her, yet because of her excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding commendations, he desired to haue her to his wife. For such is the lust of intemperate men, that euen with very fame they will be driuen to loue, and will equally be affected by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, as if they had séene her. Wherefore before the war was proclaimed to the <hi>Byzantians,</hi> he was very importunat with <hi>Sostratus,</hi> that he would bestowe her on him for his wife: But he misliking the lewdnesse of his vicious life, aunswered him he would not: therefore <hi>Callisthenes</hi> thinking that <hi>Sostratus</hi> contemned him, was wonderfull wrath, and although he loued

his daughter indeede <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose beautie he conceiued in his minde to be without match, although he did neuer sée her: yet hée sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to him as if he scorned her: And he deuised with himselfe by all meanes possible, how he might be reuenged on <hi>Sostra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi> Moreouer it is a lawe with the <hi>Byzantians,</hi> that if any man doo rauish a mayde, he shall suffer no other penance then marrie her: <hi>Callisthenes</hi> liked this law very well, and sought out a fit time for his purpose: and although that the wars did increase, and that he knew well that she was at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> yet he neuer left of to worke his ambush made, wherein he was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by a strange accident: For there was this oracle giuen to the <hi>Byzantians.</hi>

I iterated these spéeches to her often, and at length I preuailed with her, that she should let me into her cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber at night, <hi>Clio</hi> also which was the Chambermaide promising her helpe herein. That part of the house wherein she did lie, wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> built after this order: there was a great space, hauing two Chambers of the right hand, and two of the left hand, through which went a little nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row entrie, by which they went into them. This entrie had a doore which opened with two leaues: this part of the house was the lodging for the women. The inward chambers were oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site one to another, whereof the mother had one, the daughter the other: of the other <hi>Clio</hi> had that which was next to <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippes,</hi> the vttermost was appoynted for the pantrie. Euery night <hi>Leucippes</hi> mother accompanied her to bed, and depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted not from thence, vntill she did sée her layde downe: and shée did not onely shut the entrie doores, but also caused another en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try doore to be shut by another, and the keyes thereof to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen her in at a hole, which she kept in her owne chamber: but euery morning she called the fellow, whom she had giuen in charge to locke the doores, to open them againe: wherfore <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrus</hi> séeing that it was almost impossible to get in, caused like keyes to bee made: which when as he had tryed, and saw they were fitte for the purpose, hée perswaded <hi>Clio</hi> to bée silent, that by no wayes shee should hinder our determination.
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:15835:21"/>
There was one of the Seruaunts, a curious prating fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe, giuen much to his bellye, who séemed woorthy enough of his name (for hée was called <hi>Cynops</hi>) this fellowe sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a loofe of to watch, and marke whatsoeuer wée went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, euer suspecting that in the night wée would assay some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: wherefore at midnight hée vsed to watch the doores standing open, so that it was a hard matter to doo it that hée shoulde not knowe: which <hi>Satyrus</hi> perceyuing, wont about to growe in acquaintaunce with this fellowe, and woulde of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ieast with him merilie, and call him <hi>Conops</hi> (which sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth a Gnatte) and thus would descant vppon his name. He knowing <hi>Satyrus</hi> meaning, did séeme to ieast with him againe, still carrying a suspicious minde: wherefore turning to <hi>Satyrus</hi> sayde: Go to friend <hi>Satyrus,</hi> because you scoffe at my name, I will tell you a tale of a Gnatte. The Lyon vppon a time accused <hi>Prometheus,</hi> that since he had made him so large, greate, and strong, and had armed his iawes with téeth, his féete with hooked nayles, and had made him stowter then anie other wilde Beastes, yet endued with all these qualityes, hée feared the crowing of a dung-hill Cocke. UUhome <hi>Prometheus</hi> aunswered: Why doe you thus rashly blame mée? I gaue thée all the excellentest gifts I coulde, but herein thou dooest carrie a base cowardly mind; wherefore the Lion wept, and condemned himselfe of feare and cowardise, wishing rather to die then liue. And as he went walking in this melancholie cogitation, hée by chaunce mette with the Elephant: whome when hee had saluted, hée fell into a greate discourse. And as hée was talking with him, hée marked him often shaking his eares: I pray thée, (quoth hée) what meanest thou by this, that euerie Minute thou sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thine eares, and neuer lettest them rest? then sayde the Elephant (and by chaunce at that instaunt a Gnatte did flie about his heade) because I sée this little flie humming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mée, which if he get into mine eares I am vndone. The Lion hearing this: wherefore then (sayde hée) shoulde I wish to die, since I am in this case, and so much the more happie,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15835:21"/>
by how much a Cocke excelleth a Gnat? But <hi>Satyrus</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his spéech to be full of subtiltie, smiled to himselfe, saying: But now friende <hi>Cynops,</hi> also I pray you marke my tale of a Gnat and a Lion, as it was told of a graue Philosopher. But I thanke you first for my tale of the Elephant. The Gnat on a day very bold, méeting with a Lion gréeted him thus. Surely you do greatly deceiue your selfe, if you thinke your selfe king ouer mée, as you doo ouer all other beastes whatsoeuer: For since you are neyther fayrer, valianter in minde, nor better, although you excell in a little strength, why then should you be king ouer me? you scrat with your nayles and byte with your téeth, and what woman when she sighteth doth not doo this? What is the largenesse of the bodie which doeth adorne you? Where is your bewtie? You haue a broad brest I must néeds say, a broad payre of shoulders, a thicke necke, all staring with grisly haires; and doo not you sée how filthie and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some your hinder partes are: my greatnesse is the whole aire, as much as I can compasse about with my winges: my bewtie is the gréennesse of the fields; which to me is in stéede of a garment: which when I leaue flying I put on; neyther doo I euer go into warre without a Trumpette: for my mouth is both my Trumpette and my Daxte, so that I am both a Trumpetter and a fighting Souldiour also. I doo make my bowe and arrowes my selfe, my winges carry mee through the ayre, and beeing thus carryed, where I please I can wounde and sting; which, whosoeuer hée be that receiueth, suddainly exclaime, and looke about for the Authour, but can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not finde him.</p>
            <p>I am both present and absent also: and at the same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant I stande stoutly to it, and flye away: I doo ryde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vppon a man, and sometimes wounde him, and laugh to sée him scratch.</p>
            <p>But why doo I talke thus? Come on let vs go lustily to this battayle. And as he thus spake, he flew in the face of the Lyon, and humming about his head, did sting him in the

eyes, and euerie part which wanted hayre: the Lion verie angrie, turned himselfe, nowe this way, nowe that way, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king for his enemie, byting and fighting with the ayre. The Gnatte taking more delight in his anger and furie, sette vppon his lippes: but hée bowing himselfe downe to that place where hée felt it smart, layde him downe: but the Gnatte like a Wrastler, rushing through his téeth, and passing through his mouth shutte, escaped away: but his téeth deceyued of theyr prey, did resound with the gnashing together: at length the Lion béeing wearie with so vaine a combate, béeing in a great furie, did lie still: the Gnatte flying about his heade, did humme in token of the victorie: but béeing nowe fraught with pride of his newe gotten vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, soared vppe aloft, and by chaunce fell into a Spiders Webbe, and there was quickely taken: but when hée sawe that there was no way left to get out, then hée beganne to blame his owne follie, saying: What a wretch was I that durst prouoke a Lion, yet can not escape out of a poore Spyders webbe: which when <hi>Satyrus</hi> had sayde, I pray thée <hi>Conops</hi> where are the Spyders Webbes, which thou shouldest feare, and therewithall hée fell a laughing: not long after, <hi>Satyrus</hi> marked howe much hée was giuen to his bellie, prouided before a potion to make him sléepe: and inuited him to Supper: hée suspecting some harme, at first denyed, but after his belly the best perswader of all had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lured him, he graunted him: But when he came to <hi>Satyrus,</hi> and had supped, hée would verie willingly haue departed: but <hi>Satyrus</hi> gaue him this potion last in a pot: which when hée had drunke, he stayed no longer then he could go to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for the potion began to worke with him, but came running to me, and told me that <hi>Conops</hi> was sound a sléepe, wishing me now like to <hi>Vlysses,</hi> to bée valiant and couragious; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I went presently to <hi>Leucippes</hi> chamber, he staied at the doore: but I, (<hi>Clio</hi> closely conueying me in,) entered into the chamber, being partly stroken with ioy, partly with feare: for the feare of the daunger did trouble the hope of my minde,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:15835:22"/>
the hope also of obtaining, did mingle my feare with pleasure: that part of my minde which was in hope, was troubled with feare; but that which did grieue, did result with ioy: but a little before I entred into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wenches chamber, I know not what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible thing hapned to her mother in a dreame, for she séemed to sée a théefe armed with a naked sword, to enter in &amp; take away her daughter, and laying her vpon her back, and with his sword ripped her from the lower part of the belly to the brest, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being thus astonied with feare, shée leapt out of her bedde, and with all spéed she could, going softly vpon her tiptoes, shée came readily to <hi>Leucippes</hi> chamber; I then being scant layde downe in the bed: but hearing the noyse of the doore opening, I skipt quickly out of the bedde, and knowing in what daunger I was, with all the spéede I could I got me out of the chamber: <hi>Satyrus</hi> standing at the outermost doore receiued me thus trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and frighted; and so both of vs escaping in the darke, we went euery man to his owne chamber, her mother at first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken with a giddinesse in her head fell downe, but being recouered againe, she went vnto <hi>Clio,</hi> and buffeted her about the face, pulling her by the haire, and at length groned out these words: O <hi>Leucippe</hi> thou hast taken away all my hope; woe is me poore wretch: O <hi>Sostratus,</hi> thou doest fight at <hi>Byzanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> for others marriages, but here at <hi>Tyrus</hi> I know not who hath defiled and polluted thy daughters bedde.

Wherefore assoone as we came into <hi>Clinias</hi> his chamber, we declared vnto him all the matter, and what had happened, and how that we determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to forsake our Countrey. Then said <hi>Clio,</hi> And I also will go togither with you, for I know, assoone as it is day, I shall be put to excéeding torment, vntil I haue confessed: and I do think it better to die, then to fall into their torturing hands.

know yet who that should be, for if <hi>Clio</hi> be sent away, there is no bodie to detect you, and perhaps <hi>Leucippe</hi> will go with vs: we concluded vpon this, and we gaue <hi>Clio</hi> to one of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, to be carried spéedily to a ship, we staid behind to prouide all things necessary for our iourney. At length we thought good that <hi>Leucippe</hi> were mooued herein, that if she were willing to depart, we also should take her with vs; but if not, we also wold stay there, submitting our selues wholly to fortunes pleasure: that which remained of the night, we spent in sléepe, and betime in the morning we came home. But <hi>Panthia</hi> rising vp verie early in the morning, sent for <hi>Clio,</hi> that shée might talke with her about this matter: but when she saw she could find her in no place, she went back again to her daughter, saying: What is the cause you wil not tell me the whole discourse of this which hath hapned? Behold <hi>Clio</hi> she is run away. Then <hi>Leucippe</hi> being now somewhat more bold, said: What should I tell you more? or what truth should I bring? if you can make any tryall of my maydenhead, I pray you do. But it remaineth now, said <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thia,</hi> that we get more witnesses of this our mishap: and with that she went forth a doore, <hi>Leucippe</hi> being now left alone, and being full with her mothers words, was driuen into sundry co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations: she gréeued that she was taken; she blushed that her mother had so reuiled her; she was angry that her mother wold not beléeue her: for bashfulnesse, griefe and anger, are thrée co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of the mind: shamefastnesse falling into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eyes, dooth take away their libertie: griefe being spread abroad into euery corner of the heart, doth quite extinguish the heate of the mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> anger as it were barking about y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart, doth ouerwhelme rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some of madnesse, the cause of all these is the spéech, which as it were directing a dart and aiming at the mind, doth grieue and afflict it with many wounds: for since there are thrée dartes, reproach, declaring of a mishap, and the hitting in the téeth with ones faultes, there must néeds be then thrée wounds: that is, anger, griefe and shamefastnesse, it is proper to all these thrée dartes, to make déepe, yet not bloodie wounds, whose me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is onely to retort the dart vpon the caster, for the spéech which is the arrowe of the tongue, is driuen backe by speech,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:15835:24"/>
which is another weapon of the tongue: so by that meanes the disquieted part of the minde is appeased, and is made merry from the griefe; but if one haue to deale with his superior that he cannot gainsay or retort, then are the woundes made dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per by that silence: for except the griefes raised by the heate of the spéech do cast out their fome, they do make themselues more gréeuous with their owne heape. <hi>Leucippe</hi> being troubled with the vexations, was in great perplexitie: in the meane sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I sent <hi>Satyrus</hi> to know of her whether she would flie away with vs also; but she preuenting his spéech said: I pray you by all the goddes, carry me whither you will, so that I may be out of my mothers sight, for if you depart and leaue me behinde, I will ende my life with an halter: which when I heard, this newes wiped all the griefe from my mind: wherfore we staied two dayes my father being from home, we prouided all things which were necessary for our flight: part of that potion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall <hi>Cynops</hi> was cast into a sleepe <hi>Satyrus</hi> reserued, and whilest he serued vs at supper, he gaue it to <hi>Panthia</hi> in a glasse: wherefore the table being taken away, euery one went to his owne chamber, but <hi>Panthia</hi> féeling the potion to worke, caused vs to make more hast: wherfore <hi>Satyrus</hi> gaue vnto <hi>Leucippes</hi> bedfellow of the same potion, whom hee did faine to be in loue withall. Moreouer, he gaue some of it to the Porter, which made him instantly to sléepe: in the meane season, <hi>Clinias</hi> stood without the doores with a Coach ready furnished, expecting our comming: after all were fast a sléepe, about the first watch of the night, with all silence we departed out of the house, locking the doores fast againe, and laying the keyes vnder the doore. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrus</hi> led <hi>Leucippe</hi> forth by the hand, and by very good chance, <hi>Cynops,</hi> which did accustome to watch vs, was sent foorth a Towne of an arrant: wherefore hauing departed thus out of the house, we came thither where <hi>Clinias</hi> stayed for vs: wée were in number sixe, I, and <hi>Leucippe, Satyrus, Clinias,</hi> and his two men: after we were gotten vp, we directed our course toward <hi>Sydon:</hi> the other part of the night being spent, wee came vnto a citie which was <hi>Berytium,</hi> where hoping to find a

ship readie to saile from thence; neither did our expectation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue vs; for assoone as we came into the hauen, we founde a ship readie to launch foorth, and we went into it before we asked of them whither they went: all our necessary thinges beeing brought into the ship, we were euen now about to sayle foorth, when <hi>Lucifer</hi> began to appeare: Then did we know that we sayled towards <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a most famous Cittie of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> Then did I begin to reioyce, that we were thus safely come to sea, the shippe scant out of the hauen, and new entering into the maine Ocean, after that a fit winde serued vs, there began to arise a great noyse of the Saylers in the shippe; first drawing of the Cables; the noyse of the maister exhorting them; then was the crosse peece brought foorth; the Saileyard hung vp; the Sayles readie to be hoysed vp; the Anchors plucked vp; the hauen being left, we began to sayle foorth a prosperous iourny; the lande did séeme to go backe from the shippe, as if that it did saile it selfe; then was there a great reioycing and clapping of handes throughout all the shippe, and many prayers bestowed on the Gods; praying them to send a prosperous nauigation: In the meane while the winde increased, the saile was full, and the ship sailing very safe: there was by chance in the same ship a yoong man sitting by vs, which because it was now dinner time, very curteously inuited vs, that we also would eate with him: wherefore when <hi>Satyrus</hi> had made readie that which hée prouided for vs, we did eate togither in common, making our selues both partakers of our dinner and talke also; when I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan thus: I pray you sir what country-man are you, and what is your name? Then answered he, I am an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> borne, my name is <hi>Menelaus:</hi> but by your leaue, may I demaund the same of you? Then quoth I, my name is <hi>Clitiphon,</hi> his <hi>Clinias:</hi> both <hi>Phaenicians</hi> by birth. And if it please you sir, first to declare vnto vs the cause of this your trauaile, we also will recompence you with the like. Then said <hi>Menelaus,</hi> the summe of this my nauigation, is vngratefull loue, and an vnfortunate hunting; from which, although I did diuers times earnestly exhort him, yet I could not preuaile: wherefore when he would

not obey my gentle admonitions. I also did then accompany him in hunting, and vpon a day when both of vs went foorth on horseback, we discoursed of many seuerall kinds of hunting, but of all I commended to him the hunting of the Hare and such little beasts, and so long as he pursued such game, I was wel satisfied in mind: but when by chance a wilde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>
                  <l>The Goddes incensed with bewtie of this Boy,</l>
                  <l>To heauen him brought to serue great Ioue aboue:</l>

                  <l>Who can deny, but that the cause was loue.</l>

            </p>
            <p>Neuer was there woman for bewtie brought vp to heauen, although <hi>Iupiter</hi> loued women well. <hi>Alcmena</hi> fell into lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and was constrained to hide her selfe: the Tower and the Sea kept <hi>Dianae</hi> prisoner: <hi>Semele</hi> was consumed by fire: But when he fel in loue with this <hi>Phrygian</hi> boy, <hi>Ganymedes,</hi> he tooke him vp to heauen with him, that he might dwell togi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, and serue him at his table: and cast <hi>Helle</hi> down from heauen, which did supply the place before, for shée was a woman. But I taking his words out of his mouth, thus reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nay quoth I: woman-kinde séeme to be most heauenly, and that for a strong reason; because their bewtie doeth not so quickly fade; that commeth next vnto heauenlinesse, which is farthest from corruption: and contrary, that ought not to bee called heauenly, but earthly; which is most subiect to alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: because it is most like to mens nature. <hi>Iupiter</hi> loued this <hi>Phrygian</hi> boy, and tooke him vp to heauen: what then? This doth not detract any thing from womens bewtie: for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans loue, he transformed himselfe into a Eull; so he did not for the loue of him: for the loue of <hi>Leda,</hi> he chaunged himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Swan: and oftentimes did he take the shape of a <hi>Satyre,</hi> Gold, and many such like things. But let <hi>Ganymedes</hi> fill the

It pittieth me truly, to heare or thinke how he was carryed vp to heauen, a raue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous bird snatched him away, and he was no otherwise dealt withall, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those who fal into the hands of a tirant. Was it not I pray you, a grief to sée a boy catched vp in the talents of such a bird, his head hanging down, as if he were now readie to fall: such a carrion deuouring bird did not carry <hi>Semele</hi> to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but the fire which is the chiefest of the element: and let not this séeme straunge vnto you, that some haue bene taken vp to heauen in flames of fire. For <hi>Hercules</hi> went no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to heauen. Do you laugh at <hi>Danaes</hi> imprisonment in the Tower, and her seruituds at the rocke? I pray you remember <hi>Perseus:</hi> this one thing satisfied <hi>Alcmena,</hi> that <hi>Iupiter</hi> for her fake, tooke thrée whole dayes from the world. But if omitting these fables, you will make mention of that true pleasure which is conceiued in women, although herein I haue not bin much conuersant (but one who hath experience in these matters, may speake more if he please,) neither hath there bene any vse or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, wherewith I haue enured my selfe, yet I will speake as much as I can: their bodies are tender to imbrace, their lippes soft for to kisse, whose whole proportion of the bodie, is onely made to moue delight: and he which doth enioy a bewtifull wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, hath the true felicitie of all pleasure; for he doth imprint in her lippes, as they who seale in waxe: shée also doth kisse as it were by art, seasoning her kisses with a swéeter delight; neither is it sufficient to kisse her lippes, but also to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now marke you me againe, and I will shewe you what pleasure is reaped in the loue of boyes.

the South, did strike the ship with such violence, that betwéene the force of the troubled waues, and the violence of this raine, bringing winde, we thought the shippe would haue presently splitte her selfe, and all of vs togither in a moment should haue perished. Wherefore a suddaine outcry arose in the shippe, and all of vs were constrained to goe downe againe into the shippe: and thus thrée or foure times this chaunce happened to vs; and with the shippe wee were carryed we knowe not whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: being thus tormented with feare and griefe, we euerie one made our prayers to our owne Countrey Goddes; but being ioyned togither in one, we earnestly prayed to <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,</hi> that he would remember vs, and pittie our case; who like to <hi>Leander</hi> are now floating vppon the maine: the God being displeased, would not listen to our prayers: wherefore we expected nothing but death, which truly as it séemed, was not farre from vs: for after noonetide, the Sunne was so ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from vs, that wee could sée one another no more then if it had bene by Mooneshine; the fire beganne to sparkle foorth of the cloudes, and lightening flashed in our faces: all the heauens did rebellow with thunder, and all the ayre was filled with a huge noyse: the waues rysing vp from below and méeting togither, did make a great roaring: betwéene the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sea, there did resound the whis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now was the ship almost emptie, but yet the storme ceased not at all: At length the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster being weary, knowing not now what was best to be done, caused the stearing-yarde to be cast away: submitting himselfe and the whole shippe, to fortunes direction. Moreouer hee cast forth a little cocke boate, wherein he had the marriners to go, and he himselfe went downe first; they also followed him: but a greater mischance happened, for they began to go to buffets, for the marriners had cutte the rope wherewith the boate was tied vnto the ship: The other which were in the ship séeing they had cut the rope, did make the more hast to go downe to them: but they would not suffer them to come in, threatning them with their swords and weapons which they had in their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds, that they would wound him whosoeuer offred to come downe: they as chance serued them, tooke one thing or another, some the broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> end of an old oare, other a broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> boord of the ship, and euery one something, as came next to his hands: the sea vsed violence for a lawe, neither was there euer such a manner of fight by sea: for those which were in the boate, fearing oft that the boate would sinke, béeing oppressed with the multitude of them which were about to come downe, did strike and lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, with staues and swordes: they of the contrarie side, did fight with broken oares, and halfe plankes; some scant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the head of the boate, did fall into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> water; others did striue to thrust those forth which were newly come in: the whole law of fréendship and modestie, was quite fled from amongst them:

and euery man bent to his owne safetie: neglected another, for the very greatnes of dangers doth most commonly break the laws of friendship. In the meane season one of the passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers being a strong and stout man, got holde of the rope, and almost brought y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boat to the ship side, &amp; euery one were made ready, that as soone as it came to the side, to leape down into it, but two or thrée assayed to leape downe at length, but hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they got into it, but first greeuously wounded, others assay<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the like, fell down into the Sea, but the shipmen afraide, cut the rope, and loosed the boate, and suffered it to go whither the winde would carrie it: the passengers which were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ship going about<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to sinke it, but the shippe being tossed vpon the waues, being carried round about like a circle, at length it was blowne vpon a rocke, where imediatly it was split into diuers peeces, the mast whereof, part was hole, part broken, most of the companie which were in the ship, feeling the salt water, died presently, &amp; they were happie which had so speedy an end, for they staied not long in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> horror of death: for a lingring death in the sea, doth sooner dispatch him then he is aware: for the eyes being filled with the vnmeasurable vastnes of the sea, do bring a great feare vnto the beholders, &amp; by so much the death is more greeuous, by how much the sea is broader. Others striuing to swim, were by the force of the billowes, dashed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a rocke and so died: many taking holde of the broken planks of the ship did swim like fishes, many halfe dead floted vp and downe, the ship being thus broken, a good Angell pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the fore part for vs: wherin <hi>Leucippe</hi> &amp; I sitting, were carried through the rage of the sea. <hi>Menelaus</hi> &amp; <hi>Satyrus</hi> and others more, got the mast, &amp; so did swim on that, we saw <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> not far off sitting vpon the crosse yard, who hellowed to vs, wishing vs to sit fast: and as he was thus speaking, a sodaine waue came behinde him readie to ouerwhelme him, which thing caused vs to wéepe: but by the destenies meanes, who were fauourable to him and vs also, brake the sorce thereof, and séemed to slide away vnder him, and then wee saw him againe But I with many teares being shed, prayed

After I had made my prayers vnto him, the force of the winde ceased, the rage of the Water was appeased, the Sea rounde about béeing full of dead courses, the waues carried <hi>Menelaus</hi> vnto the marishes of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which was all inhabited with théeues: we also about night, by good fortune, landed at <hi>Pelusium,</hi> and entring vppon land, wee gaue God thanks for our safe arriuall, we lamented the death of <hi>Clinias</hi> and <hi>Satyrus,</hi> because wee verily thought they were dead. There was at <hi>Pelusium</hi> an image of <hi>Iupiter Cassius,</hi> which was drawen so youthfull, that hee séemed to be almost like <hi>Apollo,</hi> holding out his right hande, wherein was a pomegranade, the meaning of which picture is not made knowne to all: wherefore about to make our praiers to this God, about to demaunde of him what was become of <hi>Clinias</hi> and <hi>Satyrus,</hi> (for it is reported in that countrey, that this God doth foretell things to come, and sheweth what hath beene past) then went wee round about the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, where in the inward parte of the chaunsell, wee found two pictures made by <hi>Euanthe,</hi> that famous Painter of <hi>Athens,</hi> whose picture also wee sawe there: in one of these pictures was drawen <hi>Andromeda,</hi> in the other <hi>Promethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> bound to a rocke with chaines: and therefoe I thinke the Painter did drawe them both together, because their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were almost alike in euery respect: for both were bound vnto a Rocke, and had two tormentours of theyr bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, whereof hee hadde an Eagle which euermore did deuoure his Entrailes, for her was appoynted a huge mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shapen Monster, which driuing a mountaine of waues

before him, came now readie to deuoure her: the people were <hi>Argiues,</hi> which were their beholders: some came to helpe and pitie them, others to grieue and torment them neare with their presence; but amongst them, there were two who came to help them, and deliuer them from these da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers, <hi>Hercules</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus: Hercules,</hi> he with his bowe and arrowes did striue to kill that rauening Eagle. But <hi>Perseus</hi> soaring aloft with his wings, and encountring this huge monster of <hi>Neptune,</hi> drew forth his <hi>Gorgons</hi> head, wherein hee transformed him into a rocke. The rocke wherein <hi>Andromeda</hi> was tyed, did séeme to be made hollow fit for her bignesse: as if it were not made by art, but did growe so of his owne accord. All the other part of the rocke, the Painter had made with such art, as if you verely sawe it with your eyes: therein did the damosell sit, with so goodlie a countenance, as that if you would but onely consider the beautie it selfe, the very picture might be worthy of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but if you would behold the chaines and the monster, you would think you sawe before you a sepulcher ready prepared: in her countenance, was palenesse mingled with her beautie: neither were her chéekes so pale, as that they wanted theyr ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed ruddinesse: with such a pleasing feare had the painter so graced her, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she seemed not to feare the horrour of death, the vglinesse of the monster, neither the reproches of her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: her handes were stretched forth and bound vnto the rocke, which did séeme to hang no otherwise from the arme, then a ripe bunch of grapes from the vine: the whitenesse of her arme, did séeme to be mingled with a kind of blewnesse: her fingers séemed to languish with gréefe; this was the vsage of the mayd, euery houre expecting death. Moreouer, after the manner of brides, as if she should be maried to <hi>Pluto,</hi> they adorned her in a blacke garment, couering it with a kinde of twisted nette, which was white, comming downe to her foote, in forme like vnto a Spiders Webbe: not spunne after the order of wooll, but as the <hi>Indian</hi> women accustome to worke their silke, which they doo plucke from the trées. Against the maide did rise a mightie Whale out of the sea, which did driue
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:15835:30"/>
the water vp before him, as if some mountaine had risen vp from the bottome of the sea: the most part of his bodie was in the water, but no so much, but that you might behold y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his shoulders, the orders of his scales, the bowing of his back, the sharpnesse of his chine, the windings of his taile, his mouth was wide open, of such an innumerable bignesse, that it reached vnto his shoulders. Betwéene the Whale &amp; the mayd, came <hi>Perseus</hi> flying from aboue; his bodie all naked, saue that he had a little Cassocke vpon his shoulders; at his feete hée had shooes whereunto winges were tyed, which lightly carried him through the ayre: his hat was like vnto the helmet of <hi>Dis:</hi> in his left hand he helde the <hi>Gorgons</hi> head, which looked with a grisly countenance, this same he vsed in stéed of a shield: for he did séeme in the picture to looke grimly, shaking his head, and tossing of the Serpents which grew on the monsters head, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to threaten the Whale: in his right hand he held a sword, made after the maner of a Fauchion, wherewith encountring the monstrous fish, hee laide at him with such force, that if <hi>Neptune</hi> himselfe had supplied the place, hée perforce should haue yéelded: but at length hée enioyed the victorie, deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her from the bondes: whome, in presence there of all the Countrey and her parentes, hée married: and this was the picture of <hi>Andromeda.</hi> It remaineth now, that I declare the Historie of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> as it was liuely drawne in the other Table.

grieue with this exceeding torment, for he did plucke vppe his browes, pull in his lips, grind his téeth, and if you had seene the picture you would haue pittied: shewing to you as it were the patterne it selfe of all griefe. <hi>Prometheus</hi> being thus loaden with miserie, <hi>Hercules</hi> came to ayde him, who putting an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe into his bow, and leuelling at this blood-sucking tortorer, séemed to drawe the string to his very breast. <hi>Prometheus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now full of feare and hope, sometimes looked vpon his wound, sometimes vpon <hi>Hercules,</hi> hoping to end this cruell torment ere long.</p>
            <p>But when we had stayed there two dayes, and had béene well refreshed after our great daungers, wée hired an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptian</hi> shippe (for we had alittle money left) and we directed our course towards <hi>Alexandria</hi> from the Riuer <hi>Nilus</hi>: deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining there to leade our life, hoping that it might so come to passe, that we might find out some of our olde fréendes againe. When we had sayled on forward a good way, we heard a great noise of an vprore in a towne néere by, behold our stearman as affraide, was about to go backe againe: But vpon a suddaine all the shore was full of wilde and Sauadge men, they were all of a great stature; of colour somewhat blacke, not like the <hi>Aegiptians,</hi> but almost of the same hewe as the <hi>Indians</hi> are of for the most parte, their heades were vncouered, their féete were little, their bodies bigge and grosse, their spéeche barbarous: Wherefore the Maister of the shippe, stayed his course, saying, we are all vndoone: the riuer was but narrowe, and foure of the théeues comming towards vs in a little boate, quickly landed vs, and tooke away all our money, and whatsoeuer else was in the shippe, which they thought woorth the carriage, then they bound euery one of vs, and layde vs in holde, saying: that the next daye wee shoulde be caried to their King (for so these théeues called their Prince) who did lie two or thrée dayes iourney from that place where we were taken, as we vnderstoode by them which were taken with vs. In the meane season the night came on, &amp; we as we were, lay bound, our kéepers also were fast a sléepe.

as much as it was lawfull for me to doo, began to lament <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he hard misfortune of <hi>Leucippe</hi>: and meditating with my selfe, gréeued greatly in minde, because I was the sole cause shée happened into such calamities: neither durst I mourn or wéepe openlye, but softly to my selfe: O gods or deuills whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you be, and heare: haue we offended so much, that wee haue deserued to bee oppressed with so many calamities, in so short time? You haue cast vs heare amongst the <hi>Aegip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> théeues, who are inexorrable, and will be mooued with no petitions. But the <hi>Grecian</hi> robbers haue béen mooued by prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and haue taken pittie on their captiues. For fine spéeche oftentimes doth mooue men to pittie, and the tongue which is the intreater for the gréefe of the minde, doth often mooue the angry mindes of the hearers: But how shall wee praye to them? what oath maye wee giue? howe can a man yéeld a more pleasant spéeche to perswade, then the songs of the maremaydes: but that is not meant by murthering vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laines: I may now praye by beckenings and gesture of my hands, for they cannot vnderstand my spéeche: O gréeuous ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities! O hard misfortunes! but yet although my mishaps are greater then all mens opinions, I will lesse lament them: But O <hi>Leucippe,</hi> with what mouth shall I complaine of thée? with what eyes shall I wéepe? O most constant in kéeping thy faith! O most kinde towardes an vnhappie louer! behold the magnificent preparations for your marriage: a prison for your chamber, the ground for your bedde, ropes and fetters for your bracelets and Iewels, and in stéede of <hi>Himeneus</hi> merry hymnes, wéeping waylings, and lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

Then did the kéeper cast his eyes vpon <hi>Leucippe</hi>: But she catching me in her armes, and cleauing tome, began to cry out and lament: but one of the theéeues caryed her away by violence, another did beate me the while. Then setting her vppon a horse, they caried her away, kéeping vs vntill more fitter occasion did fall out to send vs: but after we had gone a furlong or two on of our iourney, there was heard a suddaine noise of trumpets, drummes, and flutes, after we sawe a great troupe of horsemen, and another armie of footemen: But assoone as the theeues sawe them, they made themselues ready to fight; and not long after, there were fiftie men ready in armes to resist them; whereof some hadde long targets reaching downe to their féete, others short bucklers, and euery one as hee could procéede vppon so short warning, came forward to méete them. The greater part of the théeues, did begin to fling hard turfes at their enemies: for the <hi>Aegip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> turfe is swifter then any arrowe: and it doth excell them
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:15835:32"/>
in weight, swiftnesse, and hardnesse: for being cast, it doth hurt two wayes: either it raiseth a swelling like the blowe with a stone, or woundeth like a dart: but the souldiers estéemed these theeues nothing at all, because with their bucklers they defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themselues against their forces: being now weary with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, they opened their army: but the light harnised men, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of eueryone had a sword and a target, ranne first to ioyne bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile: they skirmished togither hot on both sides, many wounds and blowes being giuen on either partie: But we which were captiues, séeing that the théeues had the worser side, their army being broken vp, we went to the enemy: who not knowing what we were, at first would haue slain vs: but when they saw vs naked and bound, they perceiued how the matter went with vs, and willingly receiued vs into their armie: appointing vs to come last, that we might rest our selues. In the meane season, there came a fresh supply of horsemen: the army being spred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they went to compasse in the théeues: and being brought into a narrow straight, they slew them: whereof some strooken, fell downe dead, some halfe dead, yet fought: other reuolting, submitted themselues into the souldiers powers. But the day being passed and night comming on, the chiefe Generall of the souldiers, whose name was <hi>Charmides,</hi> called euery one of vs captiues before him, and demaunded of vs what we were, and how we fell into these théeues hands? to whome euery one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted his mishaps, and I also declared at length, the whole historie of my trauailes: he when he had vnderstood all things of vs, commaunded vs to follow him, promising that he would bestow armour vpon vs: for he had decreed, that assoone as his armies came which he looked for, to set vpon the strongest force of the théeues, which was said to be ten thousand. But I called for a horse, for in that exercise I did greatly delight: which as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soone as he was brought, coursing him about, I shewed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to all the company of horsemen, so that <hi>Charmides</hi> gaue me great commendations: wherefore that same day he inuited me to be one of his guestes: and at supper, he requested me to tell him all my misaduentures: which when hée had heard, hée

was mooued with no small pittie: For oftentimes it so falleth: out, that he which heareth another mans mishaps, doth after a manner togither suffer with him, and pittie also most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly doth get goodwill: for their mind which doth conceiue th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But I had so mooued <hi>Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mides</hi> with my tale, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he could not refraine fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wéeping. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, he appointed an <hi>Egiptian</hi> seruant to attend vppon mee: The next day he prouided furniture, carriage &amp; weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, for the field, endeuouring also to fill vp a trench, which was a hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cariage; beyond the which, we did perceiue a great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of théeues in armes, who had raised vp an altar of claye: and not far of had placed a tombe, from the first squadron, wee perceiued two men which ledde a maide bound, who because they were in armour could not easily be knowne: but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> mayde was my <hi>Leucippe</hi> whome they perforce had taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Preparing her thus for sacrifice, they tyed fetters about her head, &amp; leading her round about the altar, a certaine <hi>Aegip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> priest (as it was most likely) did begin a hymne, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shape of his mouth &amp; the opening thereof did shew that he did sing: at length a signe being giuen, all departed from the altar. Then one of the men which lead her, certaine bordes being fastened into the ground, taking her in his armes, laid her vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> top of them, and bound her fast to the table whereon shée lay, after the same maner as <hi>Marcyas</hi> was bound to a trée, when <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo</hi> did flea the skin from his body: and thrusting in his sworde at the lower end of her belly, ript her vp to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heart, wherwith in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly her bowels fell forth of her belly: which they taking in their hands layd vpon the altar, &amp; after boyled them, then cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them asunder, deuoured them most sauadgely. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall &amp; the souldiers séeing this intollerable villanie, could not chuse but exclaime at this so cruel &amp; inhumane a Tyranny: and many turned away their faces; but without any life, soule, se<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, or vnderstanding, altogither astonied did behold this: for the greatnesse of the cruelty had almost drawn me out of my wits, and peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture those things which are fabulously reported of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:15835:33"/>
               <hi>Niobe,</hi> may be very well true; for she being thus estéemed for the death of her childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, was the author of the fable: others thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king perhaps, because beholding so heauy a spectacle, they did not moue, she was transformed into a stone. After that this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice had an end as it séemed to me, the théeues tooke the dead body &amp; laide it in the tombe: whence plucked downe the altar, and not looking back they departed, for so the priest had charged them. At night all the trench was full, and the souldiers went forth &amp; pitched their Tents; then we went to supper. <hi>Charmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des</hi> séeing me thus sad &amp; pensiue, vsed all persuasions, exhorting me to be of good corage. But I about one a clocke in the night, séeing all in a dead sléep, taking my sword in my hand, went to the tombe, that there I also might sacrifice my selfe; and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out my sword, I came neer vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tombe, saying; O wretch <hi>Leucippe:</hi> O most vnfortunate of all creatures aliue: I do not lament thy death, because that either farre from home, or thus violently thou didst die; but that which maketh me most wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of all men, because thou wast a sacrifice for so vncleane théeues; whom being aliue, they did not only rent out thy verie bowels, but ripping thée vp most butcherly from the lower end of thy belly to thy very heart; but also diuided the secret parts of thy wombe, building vp a most execrable aultar, and most hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tombe for thy swéete bodie. Here do thy wretched corps lye, but where are thy entrailes? If they had bin burnt with fire, I should haue thought the misfortune a great deale the lesse; but since their sepulchre is the rauening guts of the théeues, what misfortune can be compared to this mishap (O cruell aulter; O kind of meate neuer heard of before: could the goddes beholde such sacrifices from heauen, and not consume them with fire? But now O <hi>Leucippe,</hi> take these sacrifices worthy of thy ghost: when I had said so, I tooke my sword, and being in despair, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it to my throate, I was now about to giue me my deadly wound: but behold I saw two men running in hast towardes me (for the Moone did shine bright) wherfore I staied my hand, thinking they had bene théeues, I wished rather to be slaine by them: but comming somewhat nearer vnto me, they showted with a loud voice, for they were <hi>Satyrus</hi> and <hi>Menelaus.</hi>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:15835:34"/>
Hauing noted them well, I gessed them to be my friendes by their gesture in comming: but so farre was it from me to shewe them any kinde of entertainment, that I wished rather to dye then beholde them, the crueltie of these mischances had so rent my heart. They tooke me by the right hand, and did striue to take away my sword from me: But I cried out, no by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall goddes, do not enuy this my happie death, or rather the remedie of my sorrowe. For <hi>Leucippe</hi> being thus taken away from me, what <hi>Antidatory</hi> is now left to preserue my safetie? will you then go about to plucke my sword from my handes, knowing that the sting of griefe hath pearced to the quicke, and grated me at the verie heart? what will not you haue me die an immortall death? Then answered <hi>Menelaus,</hi> if you would kill your selfe for no other cause then this, then by <hi>Hercules,</hi> you may very well cast away your sword, for <hi>Leucippe</hi> is aliue, and will be here to reproue this your womanish condition. But I casting mine eyes sternely vpon him, saide; Can you sée me tormented with so great mishaps, and laugh at me? Ah remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Iupiter Hospitalis:</hi> Then hee tumbling downe the graue with his foote, said; Go too <hi>Leucippe,</hi> witnesse your self whether you be aliue or no: since <hi>Clitiphon</hi> will not beléeue me. Scant had he ended his words, when the Sepulchre began to moue three or foure times: and I heard a slender voyce comming from the bottome thereof, wherefore being astonied with feare, I looked gasily vpon <hi>Menelaus,</hi> thinking that he had bene skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the Magicke art: he tooke away the graue stone, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently <hi>Leucippe</hi> arose, looking with a dreadfull and fearefull countenance: her belly was cut vp from the bottome to the top, her bowels being all taken away: and looking vpon me, fell vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my face and embraced me: I also took her in my armes, and sate downe vpon the ground. Being now throughly come to my selfe againe, I asked <hi>Menelaus,</hi> what the cause was why he would not tell me how this had happened: what is not this <hi>Leucippe</hi> which I sée? which I hold? which I heare speake? it is she: what visions then were those which I did beholde ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternight? surely either that was a diuellish illusion, or this is a

dreame. Then said he, you shall sée that in an instant she will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer her entrailes againe: and the wounde of her brest will be whole againe, and no skarre will be séen: Couer you your face, and to this, O <hi>Proserpina</hi> I do call vpon thée: wherfore belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing him, I did sée he began to speak, and to do strange things and while he was speaking, hee tooke away from <hi>Leucippes</hi> belly, those things wherewith he deceiued the théeues, restoring her into her former shape: hée commaunded me boldly to looke vpon her. But I being very fearefull, thinking <hi>Proserpina</hi> her selfe had bene there, I vncouered my face, where I did behold my <hi>Leucippe,</hi> frée from any wound: then greatly wondring at this straunge miracle, saide I: O deare <hi>Menelaus,</hi> if thou bee minister to any god, I pray thée tel me where we are? for what do these mean which I do behold? Then said <hi>Leucippe,</hi> I pray thée <hi>Menelaus</hi> do not holde him in admiration any longer, but delcare to him the meanes wherewith these traiterous Rouers were deceiued. Then said <hi>Menelaus,</hi> thou knowest <hi>Clitiphon</hi> that I am an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> as I told you before when we were in the shippe: the most of my liuing lyeth here in this Towne, where with the Gouernours I am very well acquainted: For when we suffered shipwracke togither, the water brought me to the shores of <hi>Aegypt:</hi> the théeues which were gouernors of that Towne, tooke me togither with <hi>Satyrus:</hi> wherefore they brought vs to their Captaine, but because many of them knew me, they deliuered me from bondes, and bad me be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: and promised also that they would helpe, in whatsoeuer was in their powers to doo. Then I requested them also to let <hi>Satyrus</hi> to goe frèe, which they did willingly graunt. In the meane season, it was reuealed to them by an Oracle, that hée should sacrifice a virgine, and offer it vp as an oblation vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their Altars: and taste togither of the liuer and bowels of her which was dedicated, but they should bury the bodie, and go backe againe: hoping that this sacrifice woulde hinder the comming of the enemies: what remaineth, I pray thée <hi>Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> declare.</p>
            <p>Then saide <hi>Satyrus,</hi> when as I was brought a captiue to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:15835:35"/>
the armie, and was certified of the misfortune of <hi>Leucippe,</hi> gréeuing for her hard mischaunce, I wept, requesting <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> that he would preserue her safe, wherin I know not what God it was which was so fauourable to vs. The day before these sacrifice should be, we sate downe vpon the shoare, heauie and full of sorrow, thinking what we should best do in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: the theeues hauing espyed a ship wandring and floting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the coast<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>made violence vpon her, the marriners within knowing them to be théeues, striued to go back, yet al in vaine: for when they sawe that they could not retire, they beganne stoutly to resist. In that ship there were certaine stage-plaiers, who accustomed to play <hi>Homers</hi> fables in theaters, who with the rest of his companions adorning themselues as they do when they play vpon a stage, beganne to offer force vppon the theeues, and for a short space they did well endure: but with a fresh supplie came in ayde many fishboates of théeues, who imediatly sunke the ship, al the men were put to the sword: there was a certaine chest amongst other fardels, which floted about, whereof they did not know, but onely <hi>Menelaus</hi> and I: wherefore we priuily conueied it away, hoping some treasure to be laide therein, we priuily opened it, wherein wee found a cloake and a knife, whose handle was foure handfull broade, the blade was three fingers broad, when <hi>Menelaus</hi> had wren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched by chaunce vnawares, the knife slipt forth as long as the handle was, which there lay couered like to a case, and turning it the other way, the blade againe ranne vp and was hidden in the handle, when wee thought that those players did vse to make fained wounds vpon the stage. Then said I to <hi>Mene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> if now you will do your good will to saue her, you shall see the Gods wil lend vs their ayde, and we may preserue the maide aliue, and satisfie the theeues expectations: the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, I wil declare how it shall be done, we will prouide a yong shéeps skinne, and fashion it like a mans belly, which we will fill with the entrailes and bloud of some beast, and make it fast to her body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:15835:35"/>The Mayde adorned after this manner, hauing a garment put ouer it, shall be all bounde with fillets: and you sée it falleth out verie fitly, agréeing with the Oracle: which gaue this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere, that a woman adorned with such a garment, should be cut through the middle. Now you do perceiue that the knife is made with such art, that if you would thrust it into my bodie, it runneth vp into the heft as it were into a sheathe; and those which behold it, would thinke it went into her bodie, when all the blade is hidden in the heft; the sharpe end of the knife onely comming foorth, which dooth cut the fayned skinne; and if you pull the knife againe out of the wounde, it runneth foorth againe as much as is hidden before in the heft: and so by this deuise we may deceiue the beholders, which thinke that all that which came foorth of the heft was thrust into her bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die.</p>
            <p>This may we doo, and they neuer espie our craft. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, we will couer the outwarde partes with a thinne cloth, as it were for modesties sake: and the skinne being cut, the entrailes shall leape out; which wee taking foorth, will laye vppon the aultar: neyther at that time shall the théeues come to the dead bodie, which being thus contemned, we will laye in a Tombe.</p>
            <p>You heard a little before the king of the théeues say, that we should showe him something done couragiously by vs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you may make it knowne and satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e him, that you are readie to doo this déede: which when I had sayde, I made my prayers to <hi>Iupiter Hospitalis,</hi> making mention both of our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and shipwracke togither: then thought I with my selfe, <hi>Clitiphon</hi> is yet aliue: for when I demaunded of <hi>Leucippe</hi> where hee was, shée answered, hee was carried amongst the prisoners; and that whilest the théeues fought the last battle, he with other captiues fledde to the enemie: Wherefore the goddes sent downe their helpe, to deliuer this poore soule from this present death; and fortune fauoured our attempts, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I prouided all thinges which were necessary for this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But <hi>Menelaus</hi> wente vnto the Théeues to consulte
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:15835:36"/>
with them, what should be otherwise ordeined in the sacrifice, but the king committed the whole charge into their handes. Then said <hi>Menelaus,</hi> we alreadie haue prouided all things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this sacrifice: and as it is declared by the Oracle, we haue already prepared the mayd, which at the time and houre appointed, shall not bee wanting to satisfie your expectations. Therefore we apparelled <hi>Leucippe</hi> after that order as we had appointed before: and bidding her to be of good comfort, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that she should go into the tombe: and remaine all the day time vntil night, and from whence we would flie vnto the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and come againe and deliuer her from this feare: which when I had said, we brought her to the altar: what was done afterwardes you your selfe did beholde: with this spéech of his, my minde was wonderfully distracted: neither did I knowe what to doo, wherewith I might sufficiently requite <hi>Menelaus</hi> for all his curtesies: wherefore falling downe at his féete, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced him, and worshipped him, as if he had bene some god: when a new pleasure began to reuiue my languishing spirites. After I perceiued that <hi>Leucippe</hi> was safely escaped out of these daungers, I demaunded what was become of <hi>Clinias: Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelaus</hi> answered, that when the ship was broken, he sawe him riding the crosse peece: but what fortuned afterwards to him, was vnknowne: wherefore I could not chuse but be sorrie in the middle of my ioy. But not long after, we departed thence, and went vnto the army: and in my Tent, we spent the rest of the night: but straunge report of this night, was bruted round about: when it was day, I brought <hi>Menelaus</hi> to <hi>Charmides,</hi> and declared to him all the whole matter: who being delighted with the newes, receiued him into friendship, and demaunded of him, what number and force the aduersary had. <hi>Menelaus</hi> answered, that the next village was full of the wicked robbers, who lately had sent for ayde, being now about tenne thousand strong.

you haue accounted of me as your friend, I will do my ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uor that you shall know, you did not amisse when you recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me into your friendship, which when he had said, he came to me, and told me all that <hi>Charmides</hi> had saide: wherefore we began now to thinke with our selues what were best to be done herein: in the end we concluded to deceiue him, for wee could not denie him, for feare least hee should haue vsed vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence vppon vs, neyther could wee escape away, because all places thereabouts were beset rounde with théeues, and hee also had so many Souldiours about him. Therefore a little while after, <hi>Menelaus</hi> went vnto <hi>Charmides,</hi> saying that hee had concluded the matter, shewing how that at the first she was very obstinate, but when I had mooued her with petitions, telling her of your kindnesse shewed vnto her, shee granted me my requestes: but yet shee intreated this one thing which you must needes graunt, that shee may haue leaue to go to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria,</hi> for that is the place where shee was borne, and her friendes do dwell there.

For with venerean sports a man may be satisfied: neither is it any thing worth if you take away kissing: kisses haue no ende, neither do bring satie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, or make a man loath them, but are alwaies fresh. And there are moreouer thrée most excellent things which come from the mouth, her breath, voyce, and kisses, and the lippes which in kissing do touch one another, do yéeld that pleasure which riseth form the fountaine of the mind.</p>

But if all his hope be taken away, then his desire changed, he striued to take away the hinderance: in the means season, while we were thus consulting togither, there came one run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in to vs hastily, who seemed by his countenance to bee somwhat frighted, &amp; told vs y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

From the places which are aboue the <hi>Aegyptian Thaebae</hi> the Riuer <hi>Nilus</hi> runneth downe, and commeth along by the Citie <hi>Memphis,</hi> where it sendeth sorth a little streame, which comming from the mayne channell, compasseth a little péece of ground.

In this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey do the théeues inhabite, for the water falling againe doth make marrish grounds, which do not stand with Water, but are full of lime, wherein they do row the little boates which will containe but one person: for being but little, a little water will suffice to carrie them, and if in some place the riuer be shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,

Nither do these theeues hide them, heere they doo lay theyr plots of their villanie, heere doo they shroud their wickednesse, the rushes seruing them in stéed of a wall. In many of these Ilands which are compassed with the marishes, there are built cottages, so thicke as they séeme to be a scattered towne, whereof the greatest, which contained the most number of houses, was called <hi>Nichocis</hi>: thither did they get themselues as it were into a strong holde, where in the situation and strength of the place they did trust much: the passage to it was very na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So determining that the olde men shoulde carrie theyr branches in signe of peace, and that they should shaddow the Armie of men comming behinde, with theyr boughs, the young men dragged theyr weapons after them that they might not be séene.

This assault beeing giuen thus on the sodaine, they slewe all which they mette, but first they dispatched <hi>Charmides</hi>: the other souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours were in such an amaze, they knowe not what to do: the darts came so thicke vppon them, that they were nowe in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spaire of succour, flie they coulde not, the straights were so narrow, and offer violence to them they were not able: the Water now came vppe to their middle, wherefore many asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with feare, stood still expecting their death, others stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to go forward, were borne downe with the force of the Water, some indeuouring to flie away, stucke fast in the mud: the waters beeing ouerflowen, tooke away the vse of their bucklers, neither could one tel which was the field, or which the marish, for he which thought he was vppon the field run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning apace, stucke fast in the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

drowned in some hole: without doubt this was a new kinde of misfortune and shipwracke by sea, when as round about there was not a ship to be séene; neither was it so straunge, but euen ouercomming humane cogitation, in the water was fought a battaile by land, and on the land was suffred shipwracke. The théeues being now aloft with this successe, began to vaunt and brag, thinking how that they had gotten the victorie by valour, not by deceit, or ambushes; for the nature of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> is, that in aduersitie hee is of no courage, but in prosperitie hée plucketh vp his heart again: so that he is euer in the extremes; for either he cowardly yéeldeth, or else doth proudly dominere. Ten daies were now expired, since <hi>Leucippe</hi> fel into her mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which did not séeme to cease any thing at all; wherefore one day as she was in a sléepe, shée spake verie earnestly these words; For they cause, <hi>Gorgias</hi> did I fall madde: which I hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, assoone as it was day, I told to <hi>Menelaus;</hi> thinking with my selfe whether there were any in the Towne which was called <hi>Gorgias.</hi> Whilest I went downe out of my lodging, there met me a certaine yoong man, which after he had saluted me, spake to me in this maner; I am the preseruer of thée and thy wife: wherefore being amazed; what said I, art thou <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gias?</hi> He answered no: but I am <hi>Chaerea.

Then said he, this <hi>Gorgias</hi> was an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> souldier, which now is dead, for he was one of the first which was slain of the théeues: he was in loue with your wife; and when by nature he was giuen to sorceries, hee made an amorous Potion, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded your <hi>Aegyptian</hi> seruaunt, that hee should mingle it with <hi>Leucippes</hi> drinke: but so it came to passe, that he made the Potion stronger then he should; and in stead to make her loue, he made her madde: all this <hi>Gorgias</hi> seruant tolde mee yesternight, which escaped out of the same warre, where his maister was slaine: and it séemeth to be most likely, that by the sacred Destinies decrée, hee was saued aliue for your sakes.

Thus hauing ended, he demaunded of me foure péeces of gold: promising it I would giue him so much, he woulde presently restore her to her health, saying, that he had a medicine nowe readie mingled, which would cure the former disease. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side this rewarde sayde I, I will giue thée immortall thankes for this thy good turne: but first send for this man which you talked off. So he departed from me: but I comming home, did giue my <hi>Aegiptian</hi> seruant his desert, striking him three or foure times vpon the face, &amp; with threatning words, I asked of him, what that was, which he mingled and gaue to <hi>Leucippe,</hi> and for what cause she fell mad: wherwithall he being affraid, declared all to me as <hi>Chaerea</hi> hadde spoken before. We procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him therefore to be shut vp in prison: In the meane time <hi>Chaerea</hi> returned with <hi>Gorgias</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to whom I presently pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the money, saying. I pray you marke this of me, and heare my opinion héerein: you knowe that the potion was the cause of all this mishappe, wherefore I doo not thinke it good, that her belly béeing once infected with drugges, you go about to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper it with the like: But procéede on forwarde, and shewe me what is in your medicine, and make it ready while I doo stand by: which if you shall bring to passe, I wil giue you both, well double my reward.</p>
            <p>Then sayde the Seruant you doo séeme to feare, not without a cause: But those things which are to be prouided are edible and common, and I my selfe will eate as much of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as I will giue vnto her. And immediately they went and bought euerie thing, and before mée they pund them, and being diuided into two parts, this first said he, will I drinke: this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, I will giue to the maide, which after she hath dronk, she will sléepe all the night: when morning commeth she will both be fréed of her sléep, &amp; disease. So he did drinke vp one part, the other he commanded to be kept vntill night, and then to be ministred vnto her: and he promising that the medicine would worke after this order: hauing taken the money departed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye, the rest I promised I would giue him when <hi>Leucip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi> was recouered againe. When the time came that I should

giue her the medicine, mingling it togither in my hand, I spake after this manner: O Phisicke begotten of the earth and <hi>Aesculapius,</hi> and by him first giuen to mankind, I pray God that his promises of thée doo prou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As I was thus talking with her as though shee hearde me, the morning began to appeare: <hi>Leucippe</hi> awaking called me by my name, but I comming nearer vnto her, enquired of her health: but shée séemed to me not to know any thing that shée did: but séeing her selfe bounde shée fell into a great admiration, and demaunded of mée of whome shée was bound: then séeing her restored to her wittes againe, leaping for very ioy, I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loosed her, and I declared all things which were doone: which when she heard, shée blushed, and vnderstood how that she had béene mad. Wherefore I comforting her, badde her be of a good courage: which I declared to <hi>Satyrus,</hi> demaunding of him the rewards to giue to <hi>Chaerea,</hi> for hée kept all our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision safe since the shipwracke, neither afterwardes did ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Menelaus</hi> or hee or any of vs remaine in the daunger of the théeues.</p>
            <p>In the meane season a newe armye was sent from the chiefe Cittie against the théeues, which did determine to ouerthrowe the Cittie also, wée beeing nowe freed from the iniurie of the robbers which inhabited the riuer, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to goe to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> taking <hi>Chaerea</hi> with vs,

He was a fisherman of the Iland <hi>Pharos</hi>: but at that time he did serue in pay vnder the pyrates, and the war béeing ended, he was dismissed: Wherefore when sayling had béene long intermitted because of the pyrates, their forces being now vanquished, al the riuer was full fraught againe with vessels: and the reioycing of the marriners, the applause of the passen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, the number of ships and boates, the fayrenesse of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, did bréede a great delight to the beholders: for the passage vpon the riuer, did séeme as though the riuer did celebrate a festiuall. But I beeing delighted with the riuer, desired also to taste the swéetenesse thereof: the very first day I did drinke it without any wine, because béeing mingeled with a liquor of greater force, the vertue of it is extinct by a more forcible:</p>

Then <hi>Leucippe</hi> tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to me (for women are desirous to know euery toy) I pray you said shée, tell me, what this picture, these birdes, and these women, about that impudent man do meane? Then saide I, those which you sée now to be birdes, were once men, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men there, <hi>Progne</hi> &amp; <hi>Philomela,</hi> (for these were their names) were sisters born at <hi>Athens,</hi> this was turned into a Swallow, the other into a Nightingall, the mans name was <hi>Tereus</hi> a <hi>Thracian</hi> borne, and the husband of <hi>Progne</hi> was transformed into a Lapwing. To satisfie the lust of a barbarous man, one woman is not sufficient, especially when occasion serueth him to fulfill it by violence: the loue of <hi>Progne</hi> towards her sister, did giue the occasion to this intemperate man, which following his owne sensualitie, did fall into all intemperance and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie: for she sent him being her husband, to sée her sister, which departed her husband, but returned her sisters Louer: and as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:15835:46"/>
he returned he made another <hi>Progne,</hi> which when he would haue made knowne, he gaue her a rewarde for her virginitie lost, he cut out her tongue: notwithstanding he had thus dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred her, yet she found out a dumbe reporter of her mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, for in a cloth with <hi>Stella,</hi> she wrought all the villanie committed by him: her hand serued in stéede of her tongue, when she could not deliuer to the eares what she had suffered, she laid it before the eyes. <hi>Progne</hi> hauing read the worke, and knowing how her husband had rauished her, she determined to torment him with a newe kinde of punishment, surpassing the common opinion. And when both these women did burne in anger, a conspiracy being made, they prouided a supper farre more delectable then the marriage of <hi>Philomela:</hi> They did set his sonne before him at dinner to be eaten. During her anger <hi>Progne</hi> was not his mother, <hi>Itys</hi> was not her sonne, for shée had forgotten that shee brought him soorth into the world: for the rage of slaunder is farre more mightie then the griefe of the wombe: although that this was troublesome to them, yet when they sawe they should reuenge him, who had violated the lawes of wedlocke, they did recompence this trouble with pleasure of reuenge.</p>
            <p>After <hi>Tereus</hi> sitting down at this supper, and hauing eaten sufficiently, these women smiling and fearing, brought foorth in a Charger the reliques of his sonne: which when he saw, perceiuing that hée had eaten the séede of his owne loynes, hée shedde teares aboundantly: then incensed with choler, draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his swoord ranne vpon them, but the ayre tooke them vp suddainly, chaunging them into birdes, with whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so <hi>Tereus</hi> was taken vp, who as yet all doo carry about them a remembraunce of theyr déede: the Nightingale euermore flieth away: the Lapwing pursueth her: which signifieth that hatred doth remaine still after their mutation. And by these meanes at that time, we auoyded his wiles, reioycing great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we did not fall into our enemies hands.</p>
            <p>The next morning <hi>Chaerea</hi> came againe, and we for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desties sake could not deny him the second time: wherefore
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:15835:47"/>
taking shippe we came to <hi>Pharos; Menelaus</hi> staying behind, because hée was not in his perfect health, <hi>Chaerea</hi> first brought vs vnto the top of the tower, shewing to vs the most admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and wonderfull building thereof from the toppe to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome.</p>
            <p>There was a high hill standing in the Sea, whose toppe did almost part the cloudes, at whose foote the water did beate: so that it séemed to hang ouer into the water: in the high tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which is built vpon this hill, there hangeth a light, which as it were a guide doth direct the saylers by night: when wée hadde séene this, we were brought to the furthermost part of the Iland towarde the Sea: the Sunne béeing now readie to go downe, <hi>Chaerea</hi> departed from vs, faining as if hee would go about some necessarie businesse: not long after a great clamour vpon a suddaine was heard before the gates: vppon the very instant, violentlye came rushing in a number of men with swordes drawne, which altogither ranne fiercely vppon <hi>Leucippe</hi> perforce, and tooke her away. I séeing my <hi>Leucip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe</hi> thus caried from me, was wonderfully disquieted, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning amongst the middle of their swordes I receiued a great wounde in my thigh, so that I fell downe, all full of blood, but they getting her into a shippe swiftly fled away. The go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour of this Ilande, hearing the concurse and clamour, which is accustomed to be made at the comming of pyrates, came running downe, who knowing mee well, for I ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in paye vnder him in the warre, I shewed him my woundes, and requested him that hee woulde followe these pyrates: hée getting into one of the shippes which lay in the porte, wherof there were many, pursued them with as much spéede as hée coulde. Moreouer I, my wounde béeing bounde vp, desired to go with him also in the shippe. The pyrates sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that wée were now come something néere them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ready to fight, tyed a mayde with her handes behinde her, vnto the hinder parte of the shippe, and one of them cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a loude voyce: Beholde the rewarde which you séeke: and with a sword stroke of her head, which they tooke and hid
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:15835:47"/>
in the shippe; but the body they cast ouer boorde into the Sea. Which when I saw, I fell into great schriching, and outcries, about to cast my self headlong into the sea: but they which were with me restrained me against my will: Wherefore I reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted them to stay the shippe, and to go downe and take vp the dead body, that it might bée buried. The gouernour comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the rowers to stay, and one of them to go downe in a little boate,, and take it vp: Then two of the marriners slyding downe by a rope, went in a cock-boate and brought vp the carcase into the shippe but the pyrates in the meane time did hasten their flight: yet wée came néere vnto them againe, who when they sawe vs approaching to them, by chaunce they espied another rouer comming néere, which they knewe by the colours, (for the pyrates doo vse purple toppes) and to them they prayed for ayde: wherefore the gouernour sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were strong, without hope to preuayle; retyred backe; but they stayed their flight then, and would haue fought with vs. When we were returned to the shore, &amp; had gon forth out of the shippe, I tooke the dead body in my armes, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it, and I began lamentablye to complaine. Nowe my déere <hi>Leucippe,</hi> thou hast dyed two deaths, both by land and sea: and although I haue the relieues of thy body, yet I haue lost thée; neither is that parte of the body which is restored to the land, like to that which the Sea hath kept, for the least part of thy shape is left to mée, the Sea possesseth it alone: but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though fortune hath dealt so with me that I cannot kisse thy lippes, yet I will kisse thy throate: thus complaining with my selfe, I buried the carcase, from whence I returned backe to <hi>Alexandria</hi>: where I had salue layed to my wound, against my will. <hi>Menelaus</hi> euer comforting me, I led my life with him there in great sorrow. After I had passed six moneths y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of my griefe began to diminish: For time is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> medicine for sorrow, which doth soften the woundes of the minde, (for the sunne is full of mirth) and griefe, which doth ouercome all measure, yet is not so heat, except the mind do rage in heat: and if it be pacified with the pleasure of time, it waxeth colde:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:15835:48"/>But as I walked one day toward the market place, there came one behinde me and strooke me vppon the shoulder with his hand, and after salutations imbraced me, and kissed me: I at the first was ignorant who he was, being amazed at these kinde of salutations, which receiued them no otherwise, then if I had bene a marke to whome they had bene leuelled at: but afterwards looking better vppon his face, for very ioy I cryed foorth, (for he was <hi>Clinias</hi>) I imbraced him, and gaue him the like kindnesse backe againe: and hauing brought him home with me, he declared to me how he escaped shipwracke. I also recounted to him all that had happened to <hi>Leucippe</hi>: and thus he repeated his maner of shipwracke. The shippe being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, I got me to the hinder part thereof, I was constrained to hold the very vttermost partes thereof, for it was full fraught with company, where I did endure the force of the water and weather: being thus tost vp and downe, this relique of the ship by chaunce was dashed against a Rocke, and with the force thereof, recoyled backe hauing no harme: wherefore swim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the rest of the day, hauing no hope of recouery from these daungers, we wandred about: at length being weary, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted my selfe wholly to fortunes disposition, but beholde a farre off I espied a shippe comming towards me, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioycing, helde vp my hand as high as I could, beckening to them to succour me: but they which were in the shippe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they did pittie my case, or were driuen so by the windes, directed their forepart of the shippe towardes me: and one of them did let downe a Cable to mée: which when I had taken hold of, they plucked me vp into the shippe. This vessell say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led towardes <hi>Sydon,</hi> and diuers there were therein which did know me, which did take great care about me: when we had sayled two dayes, we came into the Citie, but I requested the <hi>Sydonians</hi> which were in the shippe, <hi>Xenedamas</hi> the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and his father in lawe <hi>Theophilus,</hi> that they should not detect me to any of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> if by chance they did méet any, nor how I had escaped shipwrack: which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Then said <hi>Clinias,</hi> it is not time for thée to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine now, but rather consider with thy selfe whether it bee better to returne into thy countrey or stay héere: neither, saide I, liketh me at this time, for with what face can I looke vpon him, from whose house I fled away in such manner? wherefore it remaineth now that I depart hence before any of my friends come to make enquirie for me. As wee were conferring thus together, <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Satyrus</hi> came in, and after he had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced <hi>Clinias, Satyrus</hi> turned him to me saying: A fit occasion serueth you now, therefore bee aduised before you let it passe, and héere dispose of all your affaires, taking the counsell of your friendes before rashly you enterprise any thing, let <hi>Clinias</hi> bée your iudge therein. <hi>Venus</hi> surely doth fauour you, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you will little account of that which shee hath bountifully bestowed vpon you. There is therefore an <hi>Ephesian</hi> woman lodging in this Citie of rare beautie, and singular behauiour, which is taken in loue with you so extreamely, that if shee bee frustrated of her desire, it is thought that she will fall madde. For comlinesse and grace you would thinke her a goddesse, her name is <hi>Melite,</hi> very welthie, and not yet come to her ripe yéeres, which very lately lost her husband in shipwracke, and and she doth wish that you would be hir Lord, not her husband, and to you shee will giue both her selfe and her wealth: for your sake shee hath stayed heere two moneths, and requesteth that you would go backe with her to <hi>Ephesus</hi>: but you despise her, neither do I know the cause thereof, except <hi>Leucippe</hi> be raised
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:15835:49"/>
from death againe: then said <hi>Climas, Satyrus</hi> séemeth to giue thée good counsell. For why shouldest thou say, since beautie, riches, and loue doo offer themselues vnto thée, whereby all things do abound, to enioy pleasure, to the necessary vse of the life, and to gette a good name in the Countrey, that is, not to bee accounted the least: fauours are graunted thée by a goddesse, therefore I wish thee to followe <hi>Satyrus</hi> his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, and satisfie the will of the goddesse. Then I sighing said: Go to, leade me whether soeuer you will, since <hi>Clinias</hi> wil haue it so: but is this woman so importunate that shee will haue all things dispatched before shee come to <hi>Ephesus</hi>: I sware when I lost <hi>Leucippe,</hi> that heere neuer any shoulde haue my Uirginitie. Which when <hi>Satyrus</hi> hadde heard, he immediatly went to <hi>Melite</hi> to carrie her this happy newes, which when she heard, shee fell downe astonished for veri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> ioy: not long after hee returned againe, earnestly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mee this night to goe thither to supper, that wee might make a beginning of our marriage: wherefore attyring my my selfe, I came to <hi>Melites</hi> house, who as soone as shee sawe mee, ranne presently to meete me, receiuing mee with many kinde embracings and sweete kisses. Shee truely was both comely and faire, her very body did carrie such a maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, as if that she hadde béene <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe, her colour and her chéekes was so pure and perfect, that you would not say it were smered with painting, but as it were mingled with bloud and milke: her haire was thicke, and did hang downe in curled lockes like Iewels of golde, wherefore it delighted me much to beholde her: in the meane season a sumptuous supper was prepared, and beeing sette vppon the table wee sate downe. But <hi>Melite</hi> did take a little of euery thing which was sette downe, féeding of nought but loue, earnestly with fixed eyes did beholde mee. For there is nothing so pleasant or delightfull vnto louers, as to beholde the thing which they loue: for loue possessing the whole heart, doth stoppe the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage for the foode. But the pleasure which is receiued by the fight, sending downe by the eyes into the minde, remaineth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:15835:49"/>
there, and doth steadfastly imprint the image of the thing séene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it were in the glasse of the minde, for the flowing it selfe of beautie by hidden beames, piercing to the heart, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graue the forme of the thing beloued. Which when I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, I pray you said I, why doo not you also eate of those delicates which you haue prepared? Truely you séeme to mée as if you were a painted guest. Then answered shee: what meate can bee more daintie, what wine more precious then your sight? With these words embracing mee in her armes, shee kissed mee, then often repeated this, Thou art my ioy, my foode, and whole delight. And after the matter fell out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, when night came, shee was very earnest with me to lodge there that night: but when as I had repeated to her that which before I had spoken to <hi>Satyrus,</hi> although very hardly, yet at length shee lette mee go vppon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that the next day I should méete her in this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and there wee should determine the matter before the Goddesse. Wherefore the next day at the time appointed, I went with <hi>Menelaus</hi> and <hi>Clinias,</hi> and there we did sweare: I also tooke my oath that I loued her as sincerely as euer I did <hi>Leucippe</hi> before: shee likewise did sweare that I should bee her husband, and shee would make mee Lorde of all her substance: all which was confirmed there betweene vs, but the nuptials should not bee selemnized before wee came to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and that there as I had sworne before, <hi>Melite</hi> should succéede in <hi>Leucippes</hi> place.</p>
            <p>Afterwarde we went home to her House, where, as before, a magnificent supper was prouided, for that was called the nuptiall feast, but the rest wee did deferre vntill we came to <hi>Ephesus.</hi> As wee were at Supper some merrie conceit came vnto <hi>Melites</hi> minde, which made her leaue her melancholy lookes.</p>
            <p>When euery one hadde wished vs a prosperous marriage, shée whispered in my eare, saying: As tombes are built in vain for them, whose dead bodyes are not to be found to be buried, so
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:15835:50"/>
do I sée my marriage to be prouided for me, and in this madnes did shee slilie rest with me: wherefore a prosperous winde ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing vs fit, we hastened to our ship, and hoysing vp sayle wee left <hi>Alexandria: Menelaus</hi> followed vs to the shoare, and hauing taken his leaue, and wished a prosperous nauigation, he departed from vs. He was a most curteous yong man and most trully friend, who for our departure shed many teares, and wee also béeing not able to refraine from dooing the like, <hi>Clinias</hi> thinking it a gréefe to depart from me, went with me to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> where hee staide so long, vntill all his affaires went well with him in his owne countrey: but our shippe sailed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with a prosperous course, and night comming on, euerie man went to his chamber appoynted: but <hi>Melite</hi> embracing me betwéene her armes, beganne to kisse me, and to repeate her marriage, saying: now haue we passed <hi>Leucippes</hi> bonds, and come to our appointed ende: this is the day decréed, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore should wee deferre it vntill wee come to <hi>Ephesus</hi>? do not you know the calamities of the sea to be dangerous, and that the changings of the windes are mutable. O <hi>Clitiphon</hi> I burne, beléeue mee I burne, and I would I could shewe vnto thee the greatnesse of my fire: I would that by my embracing and kissing I could put the same force into thée, which loues flames haue alreadie kindled in me. But this my fire is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any common flame, which wanting matter to féede it, is quickly burnt out: since all louers do greatly desire to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace one another, this my heart working a more feruent ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in me, will not be contented nor satisfied with it. O hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den fire! O fire shining in the darke! O fire vnwilling to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse thine owne lawes! But why do not wee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> O my most déere <hi>Clitiphon,</hi> sacrifice together at <hi>Venus</hi> Altars. Then said I, good <hi>Melite</hi> do not seeke nor with mee to violate my word before I haue doone my sacrifice to the dead, for as yet wee are not passed the bondes of this vnhappie maide, vntill we are arriued on another coast. Did you heare mee tell you howe that shee lost her life in the water: the vastnesse of the Sea, through the which wee nowe are carried, is the tombe of

               <hi>Leucippe</hi>; for what do you know? may not her ghost wander héere about this shippe? For their soules who perish in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, doo not descend to hell; but as it is sayd, doo flote aboute the waters: And perhaps she may be aboute vs, as we do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace now. But doth this séeme a fitte place to you, to ende the marriages? doo you thinke that they can be sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nised amongst the boysterous waues, and raging billowes of the sea? woulde you haue vs to begin our marriages from so vnsure a bedde? Then saide <hi>Melite,</hi> by <hi>Castor</hi> you talke very pretily? Truly I doo thinke that any place may be a fitte chamber for louers; No place is prescribed to God <hi>Cupid,</hi> wee haue heard that the sea is the most fittest place for his misteries: what I praye you was not his mother gotten of the sea? Wherfore I thinke wée should doo an acceptable thing, vnto this god, if we honour his mother so much, as to finish our nuptialls in this place: For are not they, your ropes, and cordes, which tye the maste, the crospéece, and the sayle yard, present tokens, and signes of our mariage? why then doo we differre it? is it not the best signe of all to beginne ones marriage vnder the yoke? the cables are tyed togither and the masts erected by them: that is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment too, that fortune would haue vs celebrate the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> héere: behold <hi>Neptune</hi> maried his wife <hi>Amphitrite</hi> in the sea, the troupes of the <hi>Nereides</hi> did accompany them, and the swéete murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the windes about the cables, did seeme to sing the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall song to <hi>Hymenaeus</hi>: doo not you sée the sayle, which doth swell as it were, like a belly great with child? which I trulye do hold tokens of good lucke, coniecturing that it will come to passe that shortlye you shall be a father: Wherefore when I saw her so ready for it; lette vs dispute thus <hi>Melite</hi> vntill we do come to the land: Moreouer I doo sweare vnto thée againe, by the sea, and by the good fortune of this our iourney, that my desire is of no other then of thée, if <hi>Leucippe</hi> be not aliue: and now we must kéepe the lawes of the seas, for I haue often heard it reported of marriners, that a shippe ought to be kept cleane and voyd from all libidinous actes, eyther that they bée holye, or else because we ought not to deale any thing lasciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:15835:51"/>
among those daungers which are alwaies readie at the sea. let not vs therefore, defile the sea with our marriages, or mingle terrour to our nuptiall rites: we will not be the sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of our owne mishaps, if the ioy doo not fall out which we do expect. Which when I had said, soothing her vp with kisses, I brought her to be of my opinion: the rest of the night we spent in sléepe. The first day from our departure we arriued at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> where I did beholde the magnificent house of <hi>Melite,</hi> the rich furniture, the stately hangings, the great number of Seruants: when wee were come home, shee appoynted a sumptuous feast to be made, and in the meane while shée carried me forth of the Citie, about halfe a mile into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, whither we both did ride in a coach to take the ayre: when we came thither, we went to walke vnder a most pleasant thicket of trées, so artificially planted, that on what side so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you did looke, they stood all of euen rowes: as we were walking together, there came vnto vs a maide heauie loden with chaines, carrying a spade, her haire cut, her body all ill fauoured, in long and ragged garments, and falling down at our feete, she cried: O mistris take pittie vpon me, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer me which once was free, but now am bound, since it hath pleased fortune to haue it so: with that shee helde her tongue. Then said <hi>Melite,</hi> rise vp good woman, and tell me who thou art, what countreywoman, and who he was which bound thée thus, for thy countenance although thou be plucked down with aduersitie doth shew that thou art nobly borne. Then answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red she: the steward of your house did binde me thus, because I would not submit my selfe to his filthie desire, I am a <hi>Thes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salian</hi> borne, my name is <hi>Lacaena,</hi> to you humbly intreating, do I giue my whole estate, deliuer me then from these miseries wherewith you see I am oppressed, and let mee be your credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour vntill I pay you two hundred peeces of money, (for so much did <hi>Softhenes</hi> giue for me when he bought me of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates) which beléeue me I will pay you againe so soone as I can: in the meane time let me intreate you to accept of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, humbly beséeching you to beholde how hardly hee hath

But <hi>Melite</hi> bad her be of good chéere, saying: I will deliuer thee from these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series, and afterwards thou shalt dwell with me at home. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently they caused <hi>Softhenes</hi> to be sent for, and to deliuer her from these bonds: but <hi>Softhenes</hi> béeing afraide with so sodaine a message, came in presence, to whom <hi>Melite</hi> sayd.

your sake, yet I thought it necessarie to certifie you of a few things: for your sake I left my mother, and vndertooke with you a voiage: for your cause I was a sacrifice, and after fell into the hands of pyrates, I suffered shipwracke, and also I suffered another kinde of death: for your sake also I was bound in iron chaines, I caried a spade, I digged the ground, and was scourged, that you might become another womans husband, and I another mans wife: but I pray the gods forbid it. I haue indured these calamities with a valiant minde: but you not hurt, free from wounds, go about to solace your selfe with new marriages.

we are now betwéene the two nettes, destitute of all hope. I cannot saide I, for a delight and pleasure is spread throughout al the vaines of my body, &amp; the letter doth expostulate with me: Wherefore I red ouer the letter againe, and answered in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, euery thing as if she had bin present, being now absent: Thou speakest to me (O most swéet <hi>Leucippe</hi>) and where thou didst write this, thou hast suffred all these misfortunes for my sake; I must néedes confesse, I was the author of all these thy miseries: but when I came to these words, which contained the reproches and hard measure offred to her of <hi>Softhenes,</hi> I wept as bitterly, as if I had stood by &amp; séene them: For y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations turning the very edge of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind, to those things which are signified in the paper, doth represent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mind those things which are written, no otherwise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if they wer opposite before the eyes: But when shée obiected my mariage, a blushing red did couer all my face, as if I had béen taken in manifest adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, the very letters had mooued me so farre: Then turning to <hi>Satyrus</hi> I cryed.

you yesternight, said <hi>Leucippe,</hi> you say is your husband? for so she had learned of one of her fellowes: what husband sayd <hi>Melite</hi>? truly I haue neuer had more to do with him then with this stone: but euermore he telleth me of one dead <hi>Leucippe,</hi> (for so I think he doth call her) whom neither eating, drinking, nor sléeping, he can forget: for his sake did I stay foure moneths at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> requesting, entreating, promising, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing nothing which might serue to allure him: but as if hée were iron, a stocke, or any such thing which wanteth sence, he neglecteth my prayers, neither doth he obey time, almost gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting me this one thing, that I should onely enioy the sight of him. I do call Lady <hi>Venus</hi> her selfe to witnesse, that I haue bene in bed with him fiue nights, and haue risen vp againe no otherwise, then if I had lyen with an Eunuche: so that I séeme to be beloued of an Image, who doth not enioy his louer but by sight: wherfore I as a woman, do request of thée a woman, that thou wouldst bring me some remedie against this proude mind of his. <hi>Leucippe</hi> hauing heard this, was wonderful glad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when she knew that I had frustrated all <hi>Melites</hi> hope: saying that she would go into the Country to gather hearbes to make this medicine. <hi>Melite</hi> being now encouraged againe with a new hope, cast all her care aside, for the expecting of happie things, although we do not enioy their presence, doth delight vs much. But I which was ignorant of all this which had pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed betwéene them, behaued my selfe toward her after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed maner, cogitating with my selfe, how I might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue <hi>Melite</hi> the night to come, and talke with <hi>Leucippe:</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I think that she went into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try for any other cause, but onely to conferre with her self, and returne in the euening. In the meane season while the Coach was harnised for <hi>Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cippe,</hi> and we scarce had sat downe to supper, there was heard a great tumult, and suddaine concourse at the gate: presently one of the seruants being out of breath with haste, came run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in, and tolde vs, that <hi>Thersander</hi> was aliue, and at the doore: this man was <hi>Melites</hi> husband, whom she thought to be drowned, his ship suffering shipwracke: and this fame did

come of some of his owne seruants which then were with him in his voyage, who séeing the ship dashed asunder against a Rocke, thought that he also had perished there. Scarse had she seruant brought vp this newes, but <hi>Thersander</hi> folowing him, came immediately into the parlour, and hastened towards me to take me, for he had heard at his verie comming, all thinges which could be reported of me. <hi>Melite</hi> although strooken with this suddaine chaunce, yet she went to imbrace her husband, but he thrust her back with great violence, and casting his eies vpon me, said; What is this the adulterer? and violently ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing vpon me, being wonderfull wroth, strooke me a blow vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the face, then he plucked me by the haire, and casting me to the ground, he did beate me with a cudgell: I being amazed at this suddaine: violence, did neither aske him what he was, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther why he did strike me, nor durst offer to speake a word vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: but I thinking with my self vpon the matter, as it was indéed, although I could resist, yet fearing to do it, I besought him with prayers to cease of beating me: at length he weary with striking left of, and I weary also with intreating arose vp: but what art thou said I? or wherefore hast thou thus shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully misused me? but he being more incensed because I replied againe, laid hands vpon me, and called for bondes and setters, wherewith hauing bound me, he cast me into a close chamber: and as I was going, it so fel out, that the letter which <hi>Leucippe</hi> sent to me, fell out of my bosome, and <hi>Melite</hi> tooke it vp pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily: not long after, when she was alone, she read it, and hauing found <hi>Leucippes</hi> name, was certified of the whole matter, and therewithall she was astonished: yet she did not beléeue that she was the same which we found in the Country, because she ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard that <hi>Leucippe</hi> was restored to life againe. But ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing read ouer the letter, and cogitated vpon it, she perceiued the truth more apparantly: then being oppressed with bashful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and anger, with loue, and slaundering, she beganne to be drawne into diuers opinions, for both she feared her husband, and also could not chuse but be angry with the letter: but loue was opposed against her anger, that hauing aide of slaunder, at
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:15835:55"/>
length gotte the victorie: wherefore when night was come, <hi>Thersander</hi> went to a friendes house of his in the Cittie, but <hi>Melite</hi> went to the man who had the custody of me, &amp; hauing talked with him, she came in to mée, the other Seruants not knowing but onely two, whom she had appointed to stay at the doore vntill her returne again, and hauing found me lying vpon the grounde, and comming neere to mee, although shee coulde not speake all her mind at that instant, yet her countenance did séeme to deliuer it, saying: O vnhappie woman that I am, and borne first to my owne perdition, which also do so much desire that which I cannot attaine; O more then mad, which loue him that despiseth me, which being tormented with gréefe, doo take pitie vpon him which is light affected, &amp; yet I cannot cease to loue the author of these so many my mishappes: against me there is both a man and a woman conspiring, wherof the one doth scorne me, the other is gone to gather hearbes, &amp; yet could not I know before, that I craued aide of my veriest enemie. Hauing spoken thus, incensed with furie, she flung it into my face, which when I vnderstood I was astonied, and cast down my head as if I hadde béene guilty of some hainous crime. But she beganne still to lament and wéepe, crying out, Alas, alas, what shal be come of me, affliected with so many calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for thy sake I lost my husbande, neyther yet could I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy thée: but shortly also I shall loose thy sight, which alone is graunted to me.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, that which was the most reprochfull of all, abandoning my kissing, embracing and toying, as if you were nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected towards me: I pray you what is this but a shadowe of mariage? you did not ly with one which was past child bearing, who did refuse your kindnesse, but with a yong one, a louing, and another perhappes will say, faire and beautifull.

When <hi>Melite</hi> had pleaded thus (for loue taught her to speak,) she loosed my bands and kissed my hands, first put them to her eyes, then to her heart, saying; Doest not thou sée, how it leapeth, and lifting it selfe vp and downe euer panting; full of feare and hope togither: (I would it were full of pleasure;) it séemeth with trembling to intreate for me. After I was losed from my bonds, she imbraced me wéeping, and I also was in a great passion: and that I might confesse truly, I was affraid lest the god of loue would be offended with me; especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Leucippe</hi> being recouered, I should shortly dismisse <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite,</hi> and the marriages which were appointed betwéene vs were not solemnized: wherefore I imbraced and kissed her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and not long after, I fulfilled all the expectation of her long desire: we neither had bed, nor any other such preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is required for such matter, for Loue himselfe is his owne crafts maister, and he prouideth all things necessary out of hand, making any place fit for his secrets. And this also is most certaine, that vnlooked for sportes are euermore swéeter then those which are prouided, and expected long before: for she alwayes bringeth with her, her cousin Pleasure.</p>

For when hee came home and exclaimed againe; Thou hast deliuered the adulterer, thou hast set him frée from his bondes, thou hast sent him out of the house: why doest not thou follow him: why doest thou stay heere? rather follow thy louer, that thou maist beholde him bounde in more stronger chaines. Then said <hi>Melite,</hi> what adulterer do you meane? are you well in your wits which talke thus vainly. If you wil lay aside your choler &amp; heare what I shal say, you may easily know the truth. This one thing I request you, that you would shew your self an equal iudge, and casting slaunder out of your eares, &amp; placing reason in stéed of anger, I pray you listen to my tale.

Of those which haue escaped the daunger of the sea, he is one, and the last: whom when I offred, what other thing did I doo then be obedient vnto you? he sayled as you did: and therefore deare husband, I pittied his mishappe as a picture of yours. Now doo you knowe after what order I brought him hither: Moreouer, he did bewaile the death of his wife, whome hée thought to haue perished, although she did not; whom I know not who it was which did certifie me that she was aliue, and did lodge at our Steward <hi>Sosthenes</hi> his house.

Thus talking together, they came to <hi>Leucippes</hi> chamber, where when they had stood, they heard a great groning of one lamenting, wherfore they sate downe at the doore, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they might heare al that she said, for she being alone, began thus to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plain. Alas O <hi>Clitiphon</hi> (that name she often repeated) thou dost not know where I am, neither in what place I am kept, neither do I know what is become of thée, but both of vs ignorant of one anothers estate, do liue a miserable life.

But why doe I speake thus? I haue often gone about to aske for thee, neuer yet could I bring my tongue to aske the question, but yet I did often complain thus to my self: O my husband <hi>Clitiphon,</hi> the onely hope of <hi>Leucippe,</hi> and my constant husband, whom no other woman yet could allure to lie withal: although that I did verily think thou hadst forgotten al thy loue to me, when I did behold thée in the countrey.

Wel, I will put on my counterfeit personage again, and call my selfe <hi>Lacaena. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander</hi> hearing her speake thus, turning him to <hi>Sosthenes</hi> said; Hast not thou heard her spéech, full of gréefe, heauinesse, and sorrow, how shee hath spoken of many things? how gréeuously she hath complained? how she hath accused her selfe? an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer is preferred before me.

Then <hi>Thersander</hi> began to pluck vp his mind: for those words which do bring any hope to obtaine the wished thing, are easily beléeued, because it commeth so to passe, that the desiring part of the mind, hauing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wished thing his companion, compelleth a man to hope: <hi>Thersander,</hi> after that <hi>Leucippe</hi> had thus spoken to her selfe alone, staied a little, that hee might not séeme to haue heard any thing, &amp; setting his countenance that he might séeme more tractable, at length hée w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

embraced hir, yet he refrained himself as wel as he could. Thus sitting by her he began to finde some idle talke, and scant han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging well together (a thing it is which often happeneth to lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, if by chance it so fall out they haue some conference with their loues, neither do they speake from their heart, but hauing their minde fixed on her, they doo talke smoothing with theyr mouth) and as he was talking he laide his arme ouer her neck about to kisse her: which she foreséeing, cast down her head and hid it in her bosome, yet he was very desirous to embrace her, and by her resistance was more eager, but she holding downe her head more and more, denied his fauour: when he had spent a good while in talking thus, being incensed with an amorous desire with his left hand he held her by the chinne, with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he fastned on her haire, by force assaying to view her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she might looke him in the face. At length, whether being wearie, or whether hauing obtained, hee left off to force her, but <hi>Leucippe</hi> said <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> within hir. For loue and anger are two firebrands of the mind, anger hath his fire contrary in nature to the heate of loue, but like in power, for the one doth constraine one to prosecute with heate. the other with good will: the mansion places of both these fiers is néere to one another, for when a man is possessed with both of them, his mind is like a ballance wherin both the fires are weighed, &amp; the one doth séeme to expell the other, but most commonly loue doth ouercome, when as he obtaineth that first which he did desire. But if he find himselfe to be neglected, hee prayeth in aid of anger, as by reason of vicinage, who presently is at hand, and they both do kindle their fires: but if that anger do once beate downe loue, and as it were driue him out of his house, then he is so farre from helping him to enioy his beloued thing, that hee doth striue to binde him like a slaue in bonds,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:15835:63"/>
neither will he euer come in fauour againe, although he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire it. Whereby it commeth to passe, that loue ouercome must néedes yéeld, and desirous to returne to his accustomed place is not able: but when anger hath exercised his forces sufficiently, with very sacietie being loathed, is at length remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and then loue taketh his force againe, and bringeth foorth desire into the fielde, casteth anger nowe quite out of his seate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thersander</hi> at the beginning doubted not to be frustrated of his desire, but when he perceiued all his hope to be lost, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his pleasure conceiued in his mind, strooke her a blow vpon the chéeke, saying: thou vile bondslaue, puft vppe with fil this lust, for I know all thy affaires very well. Dost not thou thinke thy selfe happie that I would talke with thee? Dost not thou thinke it a great felicitie to kisse thy maister? wherfore dost thou dissemble that which thou dost most desire, counterfetling thy selfe to bée dispayred? but doo not I knowe that thou hast liued an harlots life, which hitherto hast followed this adulterer: but since thou wilt not receiue me into thy famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aritie, I will teach you minion what it is to denie mée. Then sayde <hi>Leucippe,</hi> if you haue a delight to play the tyrant, I will endure it as well as I can, so that you shall not take from mee my virginitie: and turning her to <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> shée said, and beare thou witnesse also with what a minde I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure these iniuries, thou knowest thou hast offered me greater wrong then this.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Sosthenes</hi> whose guiltie conscience accused him of this crime, blushed for shame, and turning to his maister said: you must beate her sir with roddes, vntill her tormented bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy aske forgiuenesse for her trespasse, conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Then said <hi>Leucippe,</hi> I pray you aske your man <hi>Sosthenes</hi> whether after so long and great violence offred to me by him, I am a virgin or no: for he indéede playd the théefe with me. The Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates were more modest then you: for not one of them would once offer such a thing, but since you dare do such villanie, why should not I rather call this your seate a den of théenes, which are not ashamed to commit those things which they haue ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred to do? you perhappes knowe not what commendation this your impudencie will bring you.

This fellow assoone as he was come in to me, began to tell me a tale, and of purpose he sighed and groned: what life said he, shall we lead in the world to come? what way to saluation may we looks for, if to liue vprightly be not sufficient? Imminent dangers do hang ouer our head, it did behoue me to haue coniectured with my self, what he was, and what he had committed, before I had taken my iourny with him. These &amp; such like did he talke to him selfe of set purpose, assaying to make the beginning of his talke by me, that I might aske him the cause of this his lamenting: but my owne cares troubled me more: wherfore when he had shed a shower of teares, one of them which was bold with vs; (for vnhappie men desire to heare of other mens misfortunes, because that the communication of grief, is as it were an ease<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a sorrowfull heart) said, what misfortune is this which hath hapned to thée? what is it credible y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thou hast falne guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse into these mishaps? then he rehearsed the cause, why hée himself was cast into bands, but I listened not to his tale: when he had made an end of his spéech, now also said he, I pray thée let vs heare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cause of thy misfortune? Then said he, yesterday as I tooke my iourney out of the citie towardes <hi>Smyrna,</hi> there came a certain man to me, and enquired of me whither I wit: to whom I answered, that I was going to <hi>Smyrna:</hi> and I also said he, Godwilling do determine to go thither: we went on our iourny togither, and as the maner of trauellers is, we eased our iourny with some talke: about dinner time, we we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to an Inne

After I had heard this tragicke discourse, I could neither speak a word, nor shead a teare, for my voyce fayled me in my mouth, and the moysture was fledde from my eyes, all my members quaked for feare, and my very heart was broken: neyther had I any life left in my bodie.

or into what place did they fling the carkasse? But assoone as he had giuen me this bone to gnawe on, and had brought that to passe, for which he came, began to be so mute, that I could not writhe one word out of him, except that which I had demanded of him before: you séeme to me, said he, to be partaker also of her death, for this one thing did I heare certainly of the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But they the next day hired a house, and there dwelt in that, that they might not be séene in companie with <hi>Melite</hi>: the next day I was brought into the Court, and where <hi>Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sander</hi> was present with a great apparance, hauing brought no lesse then ten lawyers to plead his cause, neither I, being readie: to die, would go about to sue for <hi>Melites</hi> defence.</p>
            <p>After that they had made an ende of theyr argument, and licence was graunted to mee to speake: all these sayd I, which haue pleaded for <hi>Thersander</hi> and <hi>Melite,</hi> haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared nothing but méere toyes, you shall heare mee faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and dilligently declare the whole matter as it is. I hadde a friende sometimes, borne at <hi>Byzantium,</hi> her name was <hi>Leucippe,</hi> which I did thinke to haue perished (for shee was violently taken from mee by the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> pyrates) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it so chanced I fell in companie with <hi>Melite</hi> at <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> with whome growing into better acquaintance, I came from thence hither, where I found <hi>Leucippe</hi> seruing <hi>Sosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> chéefe steward of <hi>Thersanders</hi> landes: but howe <hi>Sosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> could receiue a frée woman into bondage, or what fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliaritie hee hadde with the Pyrates, I leaue to your gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle consideration. <hi>Melite</hi> after shee perceiued that I hadde recouered my olde loue againe, fearing least I shoulde set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle my minde vppon her, tooke counsell to make her awaie, which I also allowed, for why shoulde I denie it? and when shee had promised to make me Lorde of all her wealth, I hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a damned pesant to murther her, promising him a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth péeces of Gold: so he hauing committed the fact, fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, neither since that time did I euer heare of him. But loue séeing himselfe thus troubled, suffered me not to go long vnreuenged, for knowing the mayde was murthered, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing charged with an euill conscience, I neuer ceased to wéepe since that time, but nowe being burned with the desire of her, I do loue her dead, neither do I accuse my selfe for any other

cause, but that I would haue you send me thither where my louer is, since that in your presence I am a murtherer, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to die, I cannot endure to liue any longer: which when they had heard me apparantly confesse, were amazed at the vnlooked for issue of the matter, but especially <hi>Melite.</hi> The lawyers which defended <hi>Thersanders</hi> cause, when they heard that, cryed out for ioy, but they of <hi>Melites</hi> side did examine her, if the cause were thus certaine. But she being wonderfully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempered, denied vtterly some things, other things she granted and of purpose very closely she séemed to confesse: but what I had told of <hi>Leucippe</hi> she verily affirmed, that all was most true except her death: wherefore when her spéech agréed with my confession, they which defended <hi>Melite</hi> came so into suspition of her, as that they were vncertain what spéech they should vse to defend her. But <hi>Clinias</hi> when there was a great cry and tumult risen, stood vp in the middle: giue me leaue (said he) to speake a little, since the iudgement is now to be giuen of his life: which when he had obtained he wept, saying: O you men of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> doo not rashly condemne this young man to death, which you sée is desirous to die, which is the onely easing of mischiefes to miserable men, he hath taken vpon him the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious fact of wicked men, that suffering punishment hee might finde some refuge for his aduersities. I will declare to you in few words as breefe as I can, what his misfortune is. This yong man (as he said) had a louer, neither did he faine any thing which he spoke of her concerning the Pyrates and <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> for whatsoeuer he said which did happen before her death were true: shee was sodainely taken away cut of all mens sightes, but howe that was doone, whether shée bée yet dead or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue I cannot tell: this one thing I did learne, that shee was beloued of one <hi>Sosthenes</hi> an acquaintance of the pirates, and because she would not yéeld to his filthy desires, hee execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his villany vppon her: now since he thought that shee was dead, he denieth also to liue any longer, finding himselfe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of her death: he himselfe confessed to me that hee did desire to die, and chéefely for the gréefe which hee conceiued for her

death. Thinke you with your selues againe and againe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it seeme any thing likely to you, that hee which hath killed another would be willing to die with him whom he hath slaine? or whether any one can bee founde exercising his enemities so familiarly, as that mooued with pittie of him whom hee hath slaine, he would desire to ende his life and to accompanie him. What hatred I pray you can be cast away so soone: by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall gods do not beléeue this, neither cast away one which is rather worthie of pittie then punishment: but if he be the authour of this murther, as he saith he is, let him bring foorth that hired varlet: shewing the maide slaine, with the time and place where it was doone: but if he can neither name the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer nor shew the body murthered, wherfore should any man accuse him of the murther? I loued (said he) <hi>Melite,</hi> therefore I tooke away <hi>Leucippe</hi>: but why doth hee thus often repeate her name whom he hath slaine, and not once name her whom he loueth so earnestly? Do you thinke any man so inconstant to himself, as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he hateth that which he loueth, &amp; loueth that which he hateth? Do not you rather thinke that a louer, although con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted, yet to saue his loue, will denie the fact? but you must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider why he did accuse <hi>Melite</hi> if she did neuer commit such a hainous crime. I request you againe to consider, not that you might thinke me to vse this spéech to bring <hi>Melite</hi> into contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie, but that I may repeat the whole matter in order. <hi>Melite</hi> was in loue with this yong man, with whom she hath had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten conference concerning their marriages before this seafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring man came home. Moreouer, his louer whom he thought had béene slaine by the pyrates, was founde (as hee saide) with <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> not knowing that she was his loue, deliuered her from bondes wherewith <hi>Sosthenes</hi> had bound her: shee recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued her into her house, and being now fréed from his bondage, she had her in great estimation: then perceiuing the truth, shée sent her into the countrey, that shee might apply her selfe to husbandrie, and after that time she was neuer séene of any: <hi>Melite</hi> her selfe and both her maids wil witnesse that I speake the truth. But this brought him into suspition, fearing least she

being ouercome with the heate of rage or slaunder, should pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uily kill her. Moreouer, another thing increased this misd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>
               <hi>Melite</hi> brought forth the maides, and requested that <hi>Sosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> also might be brought into the Court, supposing that hée had <hi>Leucippe.</hi> But <hi>Thersander</hi> fearing least by him the matter would come to light, sent one priuily to <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> to bidde him flie away with as much spéede as might be, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they came thither who were sent to fetch him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking a horse he rode inpost hast, beeing certified that if he were once taken the whole matter would be detected. <hi>Sosthenes</hi> was then with <hi>Leucippe,</hi> about to salue her woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des: wherefore beeing called on with a great clamor, he went foorth, and vnderstanding the matter, full of feare, thinking that the Sergeants were at hande to attach him, taking a horse hee rode in all haste towardes <hi>Smyrna.</hi> The messenger returned backe to <hi>Thersander,</hi> and that is most true as it sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to me, that the memorie is often ouerwhelmed with feare.</p>

But I would to God <hi>Sosthenes</hi> liued, and that it were possible that I could bring him foorth to you: but lette vs imagine that hee were héere, what would you demaund of him whether hee bought a mayde? and whether <hi>Melite</hi> redéemed her from him?

what may wee thinke to become of her? what will you haue more? she is sent away? to whom? they are silent: wherefore it is manifest enough, that some one which hath murthered her was hired by them? which the maides do knowe very well, but would not declare it to any more, least the matter should come to light.

            <p>Héere <hi>Thersander</hi> had made an end of all his spéeches, and had approued it with an oath, that he could not tel what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> it séemed to the Prince to giue iudgement, (he was of the kings stocke, in whose power it was to examine all matters of life and death, and to giue iudgement thereof, although it was decréed by the ancient laws, that hee should haue councellers which should direct him what to doe) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (saide he) it séemeth to me, the matter béeing communicated also to my fellowes in this office, according to the order of the lawe to punish him with death, which saith that hee which accuseth himself should be condemned without any further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quissition: but for <hi>Melites</hi> iudgement, it shall be deferred vntill the two maides be examined. <hi>Thersander</hi> caused his oath to be registred down, that he was altogether ignorant what was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of <hi>Sosthenes,</hi> &amp; it was decréed that I should be tormented vpon some engine, to confesse whether <hi>Melite</hi> were guiltie or no: my clothes being plucked from my backe, I was hoised vp aloft, some bringing fire, some whips, some a whéele, but <hi>Clinias</hi> wept bitterly, when behold a Priest of <hi>Diana</hi> crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with a garland of bayes, beganne to c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Goddesse appeared in the night priuatly to <hi>Sostratus,</hi> and foretolde him that he shoulde finde a daughter and a sonne in law at <hi>Ephesus.</hi> By this time <hi>Leucippe</hi> hauing opened the doores of the house, fearing least <hi>Sosthenes</hi> which went foorth a little before, hadde stood at the doore, looked round about to sée if she could espie him; but when she saw that he was not there, she beganne to be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage: séeing then that vnlooked for she was deliuered out of these dangers, she beganne to plucke vppe her heart, and decréed to vse the benefit of fortune: for when as <hi>Diana</hi> her Temple was not farre off from those fieldes, going out of the house, shee went thither. This temple in ancient times was not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, without some great occasion, wherein it was lawfull for men and virgins to enter, especially when any matter of life was in question.

But he calling vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the goddesse, began thus to complaine; O goddesse is this the cause wherefore thou didst bring me hither? Is this that which thou didst foretell me in my dreame? I truly did beléeue it, thinking I should finde my daughter also: and surely I haue receiued a goodly reward, I haue found her murtherer.

the kéepers thinking that I would haue runne away, spake to euery man that met me, to take holde of me, and stay me: but I ran as if I had wings at my féete.

The kéepers, when as the lawe would not quit me to go frée, would not let mee loose, vntill a priest, at the request of <hi>Sostratus</hi> promised to be my suretie: wherefore beeing loosed of my setters, I ranne with as much spéede as I could to the temple, <hi>Sostratus</hi> following me, but I know not whether with like ioy, being certainly assured, that there is no courser so swift whom fame cannot ouerrunne: for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer, both our brethren went toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with vs, and I doo kéepe my virginitie (if men haue any as yet vntouched, as <hi>Leucippe</hi> doth hers) since that I hadde learned long before to consecrate it to the honour of <hi>Diana</hi> But you O Lady <hi>Venus,</hi> be not displeased with vs, though you may séeme as yet neglected, wee would not cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate our marriages our father being away, hee is now héere present, wherefore be thou fauourable vnto vs: which when they had heard, the priest was astonied with the very admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. <hi>Sostratus</hi> wept when I repeated the misfortunes of <hi>Leucippe.</hi> After I had made an end of my spéech, I haue (said I) rehearsed all our mischances, but yet, O diuine priest, I would very willingly know one thing of you, what that was which <hi>Thersander</hi> when he went out of the temple, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to do to <hi>Leucippe.</hi> Then said he, your question I like very well, and it is méete also that I should declare this vnto you. Sée you yonder wood (said hee) behinde the temple, therein is a caue, into which it is not lawfull for any to enter but virgins, a little within the doore there is a pipe hanging vp, which kinde
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:15835:73"/>
of instrument is much vsed amongst the <hi>Byzantians:</hi> now you do vnderstand what I say, but if any of you haue any skill in musicke, I will declare vnto him the whole vse of it, with all the historie of God <hi>Pan,</hi> and to what end it belongeth. This pipe is compacted of many little pipes, all made of Réedes, all which ioyned together doe yéelde a sound as if they were but one pipe, they are so placed one by another, that they doo séeme to ioyne in order together, the foreside and the hinder be all alike, but yet one réede is higher then another, which are so placed for the better consort, for as much as the first is higher then the second, and the second higher then the third, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the like equall portion vnto the ende, their sound is very pleasant, at the top very shrill and loude, but at the bottome low and base, and both these are in the outermost side of the pipe. This pipe is like to that of <hi>Pallas,</hi> but here the fingers do distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the sound, there the mouth: it was vpon a time when this pipe was no pipe, neither a reede, but a most beautifull damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, which when she did flie from God <hi>Pan</hi> who then pursued her, she got her selfe into a most thicke wood, but <hi>Pan</hi> pursuing her with fresh sute, laide hands on her, and when he thought he had her fast by the haire, he saw he had his hand ful of réeds, which they say did rise out of that place where the virgin did sinke down: but the god being ouercome with wrath, cut down these réeds, vnder which he thought she had hid her self, but not hauing found hir, he was moued with the wicked fact, thinking that he had put his loue to death wherfore he sighed, groned, &amp; gathering y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> réedes, cut as though they were her members, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them in order, &amp; began to kisse them, &amp; while he thus amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously lamented, &amp; breathing into the hollownes of them, as it were into the wounds of the virgin, the breath being inclosed therin, through y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> narrow passage therof there came a sound, and this was the first beginning of the pipe, which afterward <hi>Pan</hi> himself did hang in his caue &amp; there to this day it is kept, &amp; the report went that this god would often resort thither, and play according to his accustomed maner, but in latter times the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the country thinking to obtain fauor of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goddesse
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:15835:74"/>
               <hi>Diana,</hi> consecrated vnto her such a pipe, vpon this condition, that shee should suffer none to play thereon except they were virgins: wherefore if any mayde come in suspition of her maidenhead lost, the people doth bring her to the gates of this caue, that they may be tryed by this pipe, for shee which is suspected of whoredome, adorned in a long garment appointed for that purpose, doth descend into the caue, where taking the pipe and putting it to her mouth, if she be a virgin a most sweet and a most heauenly sound is heard, whether it be because that place hath a shrill sound hidden in reedes, or whether because <hi>Pan</hi> himselfe doth play vppon it, the gates she open of theyr owne accord, and the virgin returneth crowned with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of pine trée, but if shée fame her selfe a virgin, in stéede of playing on the pipe, the caue sendeth weeping and mourning, wherefore the people leauing the woman there, depart away. But the third day the virgin which is gouernour of the place, goeth into the caue, where shée findeth the pipe throwen downe, but the woman is not to bee founde: this triall must you abide, wherefore be thinke your selfe before you go downe, if <hi>Leucippe</hi> be a virgin (as I truely would haue her) shee shall finde the pipe fauourable vnto her, whose triall neuer deceiued any. <hi>Leucippe</hi> before the priest hadde ended his tale, Doo not you (said she) take care for me, for I will very willingly descend therein, wishing to be locked fast without any companion. I am very gladde (quoth the priest) that you are so well resolued, reioycing at this your felicitie. But when it beganne to waxe late, euery one went to his lodging where the priest had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed: <hi>Clinias</hi> did not sup with vs because he would not seeme to trouble our host, but he returned thither where he lodged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But <hi>Sostratus</hi> hauing heard that which was reported of the pipe, séened vnto vs to feare, least that for modesties sake to him wee would belie our owne virginitie: wherefore I beckened to her priuily that she should rid her father of that fear, for she had learned before how to perswade him to beléeue it, seeming also to suspect the like matter, because she perceiued so soone what I meant by my beckening, for she going to bedde
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:15835:74"/>
hauing done her dutie to her father, bad him be of good comfort, saying, father beléeue my wordes, for neuer a one of vs here (so <hi>Diana</hi> preserue me) hath dissembled in any thing. The next day when the sacrifices were readie, <hi>Sostratus</hi> and the priest went about their offerings, and the multitude of people assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled togither, to be partakers of their oblations: and they cried out with great applause to the goddesse. But <hi>Thersander</hi> (for he also was then present) went vnto the Gouernour, saying: Let vs deferre the appearance vntill to morrow: for whome you yesterday condemned, many haue let go free, but <hi>Sosthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> is not to be found, wherefore in the meane time, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide that my witnesses bee readie.

I bid thee speake the cause of his damnation, thou wilt say he is condemned of murther: then he hath killed one? But what is shee? Canst thou shewe her? No truely, thou canst not. Her whome thou sayest was murthered, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth here before thy face, and yet art not thou ashamed to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse one of murther. This is not the Image of the Mayde: neither hath <hi>Pluto</hi> sent her hither dead to reprooue thée: but thou art rather to bee condemned of murther, and that of a double one too, which did kill the Mayd by report, and wouldst haue slaine the man in deeed: thou wouldest haue slain her in deede, we knowe all that that theu didst to her in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie.

But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> history of the fountain of <hi>Stix,</hi> was in this maner: there was a certaine beautifull virgin whose name was <hi>Rhodope,</hi> which did delight much in bunting, being very swift in running, &amp; skilfull in casting of a dart, she was girt with a girdle, with a miter vpon hir head, hir clothes tucked vp to her knee, her haire long and hanging vpon her shoulder. <hi>Diana</hi> méeting with this maide by chance on a day, and liking her very well, lead her a hunting with her, their pray which they tooke, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should be diuided amongst them, wherfore she did swere that as yet she had kept her virginitie, &amp; that she fled the company of men, and would not suffer the shames of <hi>Venus</hi>: which when <hi>Venus</hi> heard, being mooued with anger, shee determined with her selfe to reuenge the pride of this maide: it so fell foorth there was a yong youth of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> equally as faire amongst men as <hi>Rhodope</hi> was accounted amongst women: this youth was called <hi>Euthini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> he was wonderfully delighted in hunting as <hi>Rhodope</hi> was, he also did abhorre from <hi>Venus</hi> sports, wherefore on a time they went both a hunting. <hi>Venus</hi> got her thither also, and droue both their wilde beasts together into one place, <hi>Diana</hi> then was absent: wherfore <hi>Venus</hi> thus spake vnto her boy: my son, dost thou not see this couple, how they are expert of our secrets, and enemies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so? and that bold girle very brauely swore a great oath against me, thou séest them yonder following the harts, wherefore go thou and hunt, and first take reuenge of this malapert girle, for thy dart will now flie more certainely, wherfore both dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

if any be accused of their virginitie lost, they go down to this spring, whose water scant commeth vp to the mid-leg. The triall is made after this manner: she which is suspected is brought forth, &amp; first she solemnely taketh her oath which is writen down in paper, &amp; hanged about her neck, &amp; thus discendeth into the spring: if her oath be true, the water neuer moueth at al, but if she be forsworne, it riseth to her neck, &amp; couereth the paper: while we were talking thus, it drew to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards night, &amp; euery man after supper went to his chamber where they lodged before. The next day the people came togither againe, before whom <hi>Thersander</hi> went with a merrie countenance: but <hi>Leucippe</hi> being adorned in a long white garment comming down to her féete, which was wouen of fine thréedes, hauing a girdle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout her middle, her head adorned with purple tyre, her féete naked, she went into the caue, which when as I did beholde, I was asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with asodaine feare, and beganne thus to speake to my selfe: I do not doubt but that <hi>Leucippe</hi> is as yet a virgin, but when I doo remember what this God was, I was in a great feare least be the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> would be the pipe: she flied from this god into the woods, but wée haue included within thy gates our pledge, that if thou wouldst pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue her, shee would not flie away. But O thou God <hi>Pan,</hi> be merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto vs, neither breake the lawes of this place which we kéepe holy, but restore <hi>Leucippe</hi> vntouched: this league was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene <hi>Diana</hi> and thée, do not therfore violate it &amp; deceiue a virgin. Whilst I did talke thus to my selfe, I heard a swéete sounde, and they which stood by reioyced, saying: that they neuer heard a more pleasant sounde: the leaues of the doore did open of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and <hi>Leucippe</hi> came forth, all the multitude shouting for ioy, begen to rayle vppon <hi>Thersander</hi>: but I could not declare in any spéech the ioy which I conceiued in my minde.</p>
            <p>Hauing gotten this famous victorie, wee went to the fountaine of <hi>Stix,</hi> that we might make trial of the other condition: the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple came together to beholde, all the other things were in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinesse, wherefore they tyed the writing about <hi>Melites</hi> necke, and with a merrie countenance shée went downe into the spring, the Water as it was remained lowe, neyther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded his accustomed bounde, wherefore when the time was come that shee shoulde come frooth of the spring, the Prince tooke her by the hande, and lead her forth of the water, <hi>Tersander</hi> being

Then said she: The woman which you saw was slaine, was one of them which sell apples and peares by the sea shore, whom they got into their ship, promis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And hauing thus attired her, they placed her vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the top of the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der end of the ship, that she might be séene of them which pursued her, and there they cut off her head, the bodie as you saw they floong into the sea, but the head they kept a little space in the ship. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they perceyued that no bodie pursued them, they cast it out also. I do not certainly knowe for what intent they tooke in that woman, except that as it happened to mee afterward, that they would sell her, but she was slaine in my stead, that the pursuers might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued, thinking that they could gaine the more by the sale of mée, then of her. There did I beholde <hi>Chaerea,</hi> which was the authour
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:15835:79"/>
and counsellor of her death, to suffer worthy punishment. For when as the other pyrates denied that he should inioy mée alone, because that he had taken that other woman, and slaine her, which perhaps might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue béene againe to them, said that I should be sold, and the money equally distributed amongest them: but he defending his owne cause, denied, saying that he agréed with them before that hée should take her for his priuate profite alone, and not to the common vtilitie: but one of them which stoode behind him, hearing him thus wrongfully chalenging me alone, tooke his swoord and stroke off his head: and so suffering iust punishment for his rape, was cast into the sea. Two dayes after being carried I know not whither, the py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rats solde me to a merchant, who receyuing his money againe sold me to <hi>Sosthenes.</hi> Then said <hi>Sostratus,</hi> since that you my children haue reported your mishaps, heare of me, what happened to <hi>Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, Clitiphon</hi> his sister at home, that I may not go frée alone without declaring something: but I hearing my sisters name did listen more attentiuely: speake, sayde I, father when you please, so that you say she liueth. Then he rehearsed all, as I had shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Oracle, as well the sacrifice, as the shippe, and the maner of her rape, adding moreouer, that when <hi>Callisthenes</hi> perceiued she was not his daughter, although he knew that the matter went forth otherwise then he thought, yet he ceased not to loue her, but casting himselfe downe at her féete, he spake to her in this sort. O mistresse do not think me to be a pyrate, or such a wicked person; I am borne of a noble house in <hi>Byzantium,</hi> and will giue place to none in birth: loue constrained me to lay after the maner of théeues, these ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes for you, but thinke me henceforward your seruant. And first, I giue to you my self, and willingly also bestow on you all my wealth and substance, which neuer your father would haue imparted to you: I will abstaine as long as you will from violating of your virginitie. With these words and many other, more apter to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade (for he was of comely personage, and in talke very pleasant and earnest to moue) he woonne the maid to his owne desire. And after he returned to <hi>Byzantium,</hi> he indowed her with most of his liuing, he atired her richly with goold and precious stones, and many other iewels which are requisite to the adorning of a woman. And as shée was a virgin when he tooke her away: so he suffered her to continue before he had promised: but hée himselfe in handling
