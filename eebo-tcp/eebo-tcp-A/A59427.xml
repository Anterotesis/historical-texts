            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

You have not been content onely to surmount all your own Sex in the excellent Qualities of a Lady and a Wife, but you must overcome all ours in wit and understanding. All our Sex have reason to envy you, and your own to be proud of you, which by you have obtained an absolute Victory over us. It were a vain thing in me to endeavour to commend those excellent Pieces that have fallen from your <hi>Graces</hi> Pen, since all the World does.

And this is not intended for a Panegyrick, but a Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I humbly desire your <hi>Grace</hi> to pardon.</p>
            <p>The Play was intended a Satyr against Vice and Folly, and to whom is it more properly to be presented than to your <hi>Grace?</hi> who are, above all your Sex, so eminent in Wit and Vertue.

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>THis Play (besides the Errors in the writing of it) came upon the Stage with all the disadvantages imaginable: First, I was forced, after I had finish'd it, to blot out the main design of it; finding, that, contrary to my intention, it had given offence. The second disadvantage was, that notwithstanding I had (to the great prejudice of the Play) given satisfaction to all the exceptions made against it, it met with the clamorous opposition of a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous party, bandied against it, and resolved, as much as they could to damn it right or wrong, before they had heard or seen a word on't. The last, and not the least, was, that the <hi>Actors</hi> (though since they have done me some right) at first were extreamly imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in the Action of it. The least of these had been enough to have spoil'd a very good Comedy, much more such a one as mine. The last <hi>(viz.)</hi> imperfect Action, had like to have destroy d <hi>She would if she could,</hi> which I think (and I have the Authority of some of the best Judges in <hi>England</hi> for't) is the best Comedy that has been written since the Restauration of the Stage: And even that, for the imperfect representation of it at first, received such prejudice, that, had it not been for the favour of the <hi>Court,</hi> in all probability it had never got up again; and it suffers for it, in a great measure, to this very day. This of mine, after all these blows, had fallen beyond redemption, had it not been revived, after the second day, by her kindness (which I can never enough acknowledge) who, for four days together, beautified it with the most excellent <hi>Dancings</hi> that ever has been seen upon the Stage. This drew my enemies, as well as friends, till it was something better acted, understood, and liked, than at first: By this means the poor Play's life was prolonged, and, I hope, will live in spight of Malice; if not upon the Stage, at least in Print.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62242:4"/>Yet do not think I will defend all the faults of it: B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>fore it was alter'd, I could better have answer'd for it: yet, as it is, I hope it will not wholly displease you in the reading. I should not say so much for it, if I did not find so much undeserved malice against it.</p>
            <p>My design was in it, to reprehend some of the Vices and Follies of the Age, which I take to be the most proper, and most useful way of writing Comedy. If I do not perform this well enough, let not my endeavors be blam'd.</p>
            <p>Here I must take leave to dissent from those, who seem to insi<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nuate that the ultimate end of a Poet is to delight, without cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection or instruction: Methinks a Poet should never acknowledge this, for it makes him of as little use to Mankind as a Fidler, or Dancing Master, who delights the fancy onely, without improving the Judgement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horace,</hi> the best Judge of Poetry, found other business sor a Poet</p>

               <l>Recte facta refert, orientia tempora notis</l>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>t Exemplis:</l>
            </lg>
            <p>I Confess a Poet ought to do all that he can, decently to please, that so he may instruct. To adorn his Images of <hi>Vertue</hi> so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfully to affect people with a secret veneration of it in others, and an emulation to practice it in themselves: And to render their Figures of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Folly</hi> so ugly and detestable, to make people hate and despise them, not onely in others, but (if it be possible) in their dear selves. And in this latter I think Comedy more use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than Tragedy; because the Vices and Follies in <hi>Courts</hi> (as they are too tender to be touch'd) so they concern but a few; whereas the Cheats, Villanies, and troublesome Follies, in the common conversation of the World, are of concernment t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> all the Body of Mankind.</p>
            <p>And a Poet can no more justly be censured for ill nature, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testing such <hi>Knaveries,</hi> and troublesome impertinencies, as are an imposition on all good men, and a disturbance of Socie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ies in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
<pb facs="tcp:62242:4"/>
than the most vigilant of our Judges can be thought so, for detesting Robbers and High-way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>men; who are hanged, not for the sake of the money they take (for of what value can that be to the life of a man) but for interrupting common communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and disturbing Society in general. For the sake of good men ill should be punished; and 'tis ill nature to the first, not to punish the last. A man cannot truly love a good man, that does not hate a bad one; nor a Wiseman, that does not hate a Fool; this love and hatred are correlatives, and the one necessarily implies the other. I must confess it were ill nature, and below a man, to fall upon the natural imperfections of men, as of Lunaticks, Ideots, or men born monstrous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But these can never be made the proper subject of a Satyr, but the affected vanities, and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial fopperies of men, which (sometimes even contrary to their natures) they take pains to acquire, are the proper subject of a Satyr.</p>
            <p>And for the reformation of Fopps and Knaves, I think Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy most useful, becau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>e to render Vices and Fopperies very ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, is much a greater punishment than Tragedy can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> upon 'em. There we do but subject 'em to hatred, or at worst to death; here we make them live to be despised and laugh'd at, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly makes more impression upon men, than even death can do.</p>
            <p>Again, I confess a Poet ought to endeavour to please, and by this way of writing may please, as well as by any way whatsoever, (if he writes it well) when he does <q>Simul &amp; Iucunda &amp; idonea dicere vitae.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Men of Wit and Honour, and the best Judges (and such as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be touch'd by Satyr) are extreamly delighted with it; and for the rest <q>Odi profanum vulgus &amp; Arceo.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The rabble of little people, are more pleas'd with <hi>Jack Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> being soundly kick'd, or having a Custard handsomely thrown in his face, than with all the wit in Plays: and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>higher

sort of Rabble (as there may be a rabble of very fine people in this illiterate age) are more pleased with the extravagant and unnatural actions, the trifles, and fripperies of a Play, or the trappings and ornaments of Nonsense, than with all the wit in the world.</p>
            <p>This is one reason why we put our Fopps into extravagant, and unnatural habits; it being a cheap way of conforming to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of those brisk, gay Sparks, that judge of Wit or Folly by the Habit; that being indeed the onely measure they can take in judging of Mankind, who are Criticks in nothing but a Dress.</p>
            <p>Extraordinary pleasure was taken of old, in the Habits of the Actors, without reference to sense, which <hi>Horace</hi> observes, and reprehends in his Epistle to <hi>Augustus</hi>
            </p>

               <l>Garganum mugire putes nemus, aut Mare Tuscum,</l>

               <l>Dixit adhuc aliquid! nil sane, quid placet ergo?</l>
            </lg>
            <p>But for a Poet to think (without wit or good humor, under such a Habit) to please men of sense, is a presumption inexcusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. If I be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ilty of this, it is an error of my understanding, not of my will. But I challenge the most clamorous and violent of my Enemies (who would have the Town believe that every thing I write, is too nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ly reflecting upon persons) to accuse me, with truth, of representing the real actions, or using the peculiar, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed phrases, or manner of speech of any one particular Man, or Woman living.</p>
            <p>I cannot indeed create a new Lauguage, but the Phantastick Phrases, used in any Play of mine, are not appropriate to any one <hi>Fop,</hi> but applicable to many.</p>
            <p>Good men, and men of sence, can never be represented but to their advantage, nor can the Characters of Fools Knaves, Whores, or Cowards (who are the people I deal most with in Comedies) concern any that are not eminently so: Nor will any apply to themselves what I write in this kind, that have but the wit, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty, to think tolerably well of themselves.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:62242:5"/>But it has been objected, that good men, and men of sence e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, may have blind-sides, that are liable to reprehension, and that such men should be represented upon a Stage, is intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, excellent men may have errors, but they are not known by them, but by their excellencies: their prudence over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes all gross follies, or conceals the less vanities, that are una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable Concomitants of humane nature; or if some little errors do escape 'em. and are known, they are the least part of those men, and they are not distinguished in the world by them, but by their perfections; so that (if such blind-sides, or errors be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resented) they do not reflect upon them, but upon such on whom these are p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>edominant; and that receive such a Biass from 'em, that it turns 'em wholly from the wayes of Wisdom or Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>And, even this representation, does not reflect upon any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular man, but upon very many of the same kind: For if a man should bring such a humor upon the Stage (if there be such a humor in the world) as onely belongs to one, or two persons, it would not be understood by the Audience, but would be thought (for the singularity of it) wholly unnatural, and would be no jest to them neither.</p>
            <p>But I have had the fortune to have had a general humor (in a Play of mine) applied to three, or four men (whose persons I never saw, or humors ever heard of) till the Play was acted.</p>
            <p>As long as men wrest the Writings of Poets to their own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted sense, and with their Clamors prevail too, you must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver look for a good Comedy of Humor, for a humor (being the representation of some extravagance of Mankind) cannot but in some thing resemble some man, or other, or it is mons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>rous, and unnatural.</p>
            <p>After this restraint upon Poets, there is little scope left, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less we retrieve the exploded Barbarismes of Fool, Devil, Giant, or Monster, or translate French Farces, which, with all the wit of the English, added to them, can scarce be made tollerable.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> I believe, was very unjustly taxed for personating particular men, but it will ever be the fate of them, that write
<pb facs="tcp:62242:6"/>
the humors of the <hi>Town,</hi> especially in a foolish, and vicious Age. Pardon me (<hi>Reader</hi>) that I name him in the same page with my self; who pretend to nothing more, than to joyn with all men of sense and learning in admiration of him; which, I think, I do not out of a true understanding of him; and for this I cannot but value my self. Yet, by extolling his way of writing, I would not insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate to you that I can practise it; though I would if I could, a thousand times sooner than any mans.</p>
            <p>And here I must make a little digression, and take liberty to dissent from my particular friend, for whom I have a very great respect, and whose Writings I extreamly admire; and though I will not say his is the best way of writing, yet, I am sure, his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing it is much the best that ever was. And I may say of him, as was said of a Celebrated Poet, <hi>Cui unquam Poetarum magis proprium fuit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>

Quis, ubi incaluit, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, &amp; falicius debacchatur.</hi> His Verse is smoother and deeper, his thoughts more quick and surprising, his raptures more mettled and higher; and he has more of that in his writing, which <hi>Plato</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, than any other Heroick Poet. And those who shall go about to imitate him, will be found to flutter, and make a noise, but never rise. Yet (after all this) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it impudence in him, or any man to endeavour to imitate Mr. <hi>Johnson,</hi> whom he confesses to have fewer failings than all the English Poets, which impli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sar</hi>) to run from his Colours, and be none; or to speak of a less thing, why should any man study <hi>Mathematicks</hi> after <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes, &amp;c.</hi> This Principle would be an obstruction to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of all learning and knowledge in the world. Men of all Professions ought certainly to follow the best in theirs, and let not their endeavours be blamed, if they go as far as they can in the right way, though they be unsuccessful, and attain not their ends. If Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> be the most raultless Poet, I am so far from thinking it impudence to endeavour to imitate him, that it
<pb facs="tcp:62242:6"/>
would rather (in my opinion) seem impudence in me not to do it.</p>
            <p>I cannot be of their opinion who think he wanted wit, I am sure, if he did, he was so far from being the most faultless, that he was the most faulty Poet of his time, but, it may be answered, that his Writings were correct, though he wanted fire; but I think flat and dull things are as incorrect, and shew as little Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Author, nay less than sprightly and mettled Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sense does. But I think he had more true wit than any of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries; that other men had sometimes things that seemed more fiery than his, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>s because they were placed with so many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ordid and mean things about them, that they made a greater show.</p>

            </lg>
            <p>Nor can I think, to the writing of his humors (which were not onely the follies, but vices and subtleties of men) that wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> was not required, but judgment; where, by the way, they speak as if judgment were a less thing than wit. But certainly it was meant otherwise by nature, who subjected wit to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of judgment, which is the noblest faculty of the mind. Fancy rough-draws, but judgement smooths and finishes; nay judgment does in deed comprehend wit, for no man can have that who has not wit. In fancy mad men equal, if not excel all others, and one may as well say that one of those mad men is as good a man as a temperate wiseman, as that one of the very fancyful Plays (admired most by Women) can be so good a Play as one of <hi>Johnson</hi>'s correct, and well-govern'd Comedies.</p>
            <p>The reason given by some, why <hi>Johnson</hi> needed not wit in writing humor, is, because humor is the effect of observation, and observation the effect of judgment; but observation is as much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in all other Plays, as in Comedies of humor: For first, even in the highest Tragedies, where the Scene lies in Courts, the Poet must have observed the Customs of Courts, and the
<pb facs="tcp:62242:7"/>
manner of conversing there, or he will commit many inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencies, and make his Persons too rough and ill-bred for a Court.</p>
            <p>Besides Characters in Plays being representations of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues or Vices, Passions or Affections of Mankind, since there are no more new Vertues, or Vices; Passions, or Affections, the Idea's of these can no other way be received into the imagination of a Poet, but either from the Conversation or Writings of Men. After a Poet has formed a Character, (as fuppose of an Ambitious Man) his design is certainly to write it naturally, and he has no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ule to guid him in this, but to compare him with other men of that kind, that either he has heard of, or conversed with in the world, or read of in Books (and even this reading of Books is conversing with men) nay more, (besides judging of his Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter) the Poet can fancy nothing of it, but what must spring from the Observation he has made of Men, or Books.</p>
            <p>If this argument (that the enemies of humor use) be meant in this sense, that a Poet, in the writing of a Fools Character, needs but have a man sit to him, and have his words and actions taken; in this case there is no need of wit. But 'tis most certain, that if we should do so, no one fool (though the best about the Town) could appear pleasantly upon the Stage, he would be there too dull a Fool, and must be helped out with a great deal of wit in the Author. I scruple not to call it so, first, because <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>is not your down-right Fool that is a fit Character for a Play, but like Sir <hi>John Dawe</hi> and Sir <hi>Amorous la Foole,</hi> your witty, brisk, aie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y <hi>Fopps,</hi> that are <hi>Entreprennants.</hi> Besides, wit in the Writer, (I think, without any Authority for it) may be said to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of remote and pleasant thoughts of what kind soever; and there is as much occasion for such imaginations in the writing of a Curious Coxcomb's part, as in writing the greatest Hero's; and that which may be folly in the Speaker, may be so remote and pleasant, to require a great deal of wit in the Writer. The most Excellent <hi>Johnson</hi> put wit into the mouths of the meanest of his people, and which, is infinitely difficult, made it proper for 'em.
<pb facs="tcp:62242:7"/>
And I once heard a Person, of the greatest Wit and Judgement of the Age, say, that <hi>Bartholomew Fair</hi> (which consists most of lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> persons) is one of the Wittiest Plays in the World. If there be no wit required in the rendering Folly ridiculous, or Vice odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, we must accuse <hi>Juvenal</hi> the best Satyrist, and wittiest Man of all the Latine Writers, for want of it.</p>
            <p>I should not say so much of Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi> (whose Merit suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently justifies him to all Men of Sense) but that I think my self a little obliged to vindicate the Opinion I publickly declared, in my <hi>Epilogue</hi> to this <hi>Play;</hi> which I did upon mature consideration, and with a full satisfaction in my Judgement, and not out of a bare affected vanity of being thought his Admirer.</p>
            <p>I have onely one word more, to trouble you with, concerning this Trifle of my own, which is, that, as it is at present, it is wholly my own, without borrowing a tittle from any man; which I confess is too bold an attempt for so young a Writer; for (let it seem what it will) a Comedy of humor (that is not borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is the hardest thing to write well; and a way of writing, of which a man can never be certain.</p>

            <p>That which (besides judging truly of Mankind) makes Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy more difficult, is that the faults are naked and bare to most people, but the wit of it understood, or valued, but by few. Wonder not then if a man of ten times my parts, miscarries in the Attempt.</p>
            <p>I shall say no more of this of mine, but that the Humors are new (how well chosen I leave to you to judge) and all the words and actions of the Persons in the Play, are alwayes sutable to the Characters I have given of them; and, in all the Play, I have

            <lg>
               <l>THe Mighty Prince of Poets, learned <hi>BEN,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Who alone div'd into the Minds of Men:</l>
               <l>Saw all their wandrings, all their follies knew,</l>
               <l>And all their vain fantastick passions drew.</l>
               <l>In Images so lively and so true;</l>
               <l>That there each Humorist himself might view.</l>
               <l>Yet onely lash'd the Errors of the Times,</l>
               <l>And ne'r expos'd the Persons, but the Crimes:</l>
               <l>And never car'd for private frowns, when he</l>
               <l>Did but chastise publick iniquitie.</l>
               <l>He fear'd no Pimp, no Pick-pocket, or Drab;</l>
               <l>He fear'd no <hi>Bravo,</hi> nor no Ruffian's Stab.</l>
               <l>'Twas he alone true Humors understood,</l>
               <l>And with great Wit and Judgment made them good.</l>
               <l>A Humor is the Byas of the Mind,</l>
               <l>By which with violence 'tis one way inclin'd:</l>
               <l>It makes our Actions lean on one side still,</l>
               <l>And in all Changes that way bends the will.</l>
               <l>This—</l>
               <l>He onely knew and represented right.</l>
               <l>Thus none but Mighty Johnson e'r could write.</l>
               <l>Expect not then, since that most flourishing Age,</l>
               <l>Of <hi>BEN.</hi> to see true Humor on the Stage.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:62242:50"/>All that have since been writ, if they be scan'd,</l>
               <l>Are but faint Copies from that Master's hand.</l>
               <l>Our Poet now, amongst those petty things,</l>
               <l>Alas, his too weak trifling humors brings.</l>
               <l>As much beneath the worst in <hi>Johnson's</hi> Plays,</l>
               <l>As his great Merit is above our praise.</l>
               <l>For could he imitate that great Author right,</l>
               <l>He would with ease all Poets else out-write.</l>
               <l>But to out-go all other men, would be</l>
               <l>O Noble <hi>BEN!</hi> less than to follow thee.</l>
               <l>Gallants you see how hard it is to write,</l>
               <l>Forgive all faults the Poet made to night:</l>
               <l>Since if he finn'd, <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>twas meant for your delight.</l>
               <l>Pray let this find—</l>
               <l>As good success, tho' it be very bad,</l>
               <l>As any damn'd successful Play e'r had.</l>
               <l>Yet if you hiss, he knows not where the harm is,</l>
               <l>He'll not defend his Non-sence Vi &amp; <hi>Armis.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>But this poor Play has been so torn before,</l>
               <l>That all your Cruelty can't wound it more.</l>
