         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat auncient Poet Lucil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
was wont to say, that
neither learned nor vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
should read any of his
doinges: for that the one,
was too ignorant to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
his true meaning: &amp; the other too
wise for him to aunsweare their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Reading of bookes is aptly compared
to eating of cheese: the talant whereof, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
so diuers in taste: as amongst ten men,
two, can hardly agree in one iudgement.
One saith it is too fresh: another thinkes it
too salt: It is too milde (sayth he.) nay sayth
his fellow, it is too strong of the rennet for
me. In like manner, my SVMMONS
FOR SLEEPERS was no sooner pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished
abroad: but it seemed to haue four
seuerall rellishes. First, it pleased the wise
and learned: courteously to pardon my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections,
accept my good will, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
all things to the best. The second sort:
iudged it, rather to proceede from naturall
or arteficiall giftes, then spirituall or diuine
grace. The third company: finding the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:21112:3"/>
not fitting their fancy: bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> maliciously
to discredite and deface, both the author
and the booke. The man in his yong time
(quoth they) delighted too much in hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
shooting, and good fellowship, to be
studious or learned, &amp; therefore sure it is but
some od, vaine conceit, vnworthy the view.
The fourth crew, forasmuch as it was not
correspo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dent to their owne seditious vaine:
condemned it straight for no better then
playne Papistry. Thus to recompence my
painefull labours, seeking in some measure
to discharge my duety, &amp; profite my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try:
the whole race of my former life was
called in question: ript vp as an anotomy, &amp;
tost from post to piller, as a tennis-ball.
Whereuppon I haue taken occasion, not to
rip and lay open, the conditions and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of that vncharitable brotherhood: for
loathing of honest eares, or vncouering their
shame to the enemy: but rather to spend a
little more time in my old pastime of hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
Not the wyly Fox, nor harmeles Hare:
but that seuen headed monster Antichrist of
Rome: &amp; the three headed Cerberus, ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog
of Hell, and his whelpes: the intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Sectes of Seditious Scismatikes, sprung
vp in our time: dayly barking against the
<pb facs="tcp:21112:3"/>
most Christian and well reformed Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall
state of the Church of England. Who
seeke together continually, like ramping &amp;
roaring lions, with tooth and naile: to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shonour
our God, extinguish his Gospell, &amp;
&amp; deuour hys poore saintes. Not with cries
of yelping hounds, to fray the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: nor strength
of coursing grey-hounds to chace them: nor
fangs of rauening mastiffes to baite them:
but the sound of godly Patriarkes, valiant
Prophets, couragious Apostles, and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible
successours to destroy them: the
breath of Gods holy spirite, to subuert and
utterly confound them: and the two edged
sword of his eternall woord, to pierce and
thrust them thorough, euen to the diuiding
a sunder of their iointes and marow. Besee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
thee in curtesy gentle Reader, to iudge
charitably, censure wythout partialitye,
make choice to thy profite, &amp; yeld God the
glory. <hi>Vale in Christo.</hi> Leonard Wright.</p>

the holy scriptures, and learned mens

it were as simple a scholer as Balaam asse,

the Sea of Rome remayned in some reasonable order, not
presuming to exalt her selfe aboue her sister-Churches, till
Boniface the third succéeding in that sea within thrée yeares
after his decease, obtained of Phocas that wicked vsurper
(who of a common souldier, by consenting traiterously to
murther Mauritius his soueraigne, with his wife and sonne,
aspired to the Empire) that he and all his successours should
bée called supreme head of the vniuersall Church.<note place="margin">About this time began Mahomet to conquere aud reigne in the East.</note> The

swelled in pompe and pride. And the more they shut vp

hee pulled out their eyes, of some he cut out their
tongues, and of some their noses. He made the Palace of

is in this maner. The passion of Christ, and the
merits of the blessed virgine Marie, Saint Peter, Saint
Paul, and all other hée Saints and shée Saints of Paradice,
be vnto thée in remission of thy sinnes. In these and such like
dependeth their whole religion.</p>
            <p>Thus was the worde of God neglected, true religion de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced,
the right way to saluation abolished: and vice vnder a
shew of vertue maintained. For vnder a cloke of professed
pouertie, they possessed the riches of all lands. Under a sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of being dead to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, they ruled it at their pleasure.
Under the colour of hearing the keyes of heauen and hell:
they crept both into mens purses and their consciences. And
like as the Scribes and Pharssies in bragging so highly of
the Temple of the Lord, destroyed in déede the true Temple
of the Lord: so these vnder the title of Christ and his religion,
haue indéede persecuted both Christ and his true Religion.
And vnder the name of Catholike Church:<note place="margin">In nomine domini, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitomne malum.</note> haue most
cruelly oppressed the true Catholike Church. And colouring
their procéedings with <hi>in nomine domini:</hi> haue put the true
members of Christ to death, <hi>pro nomine domini.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And like as in the Primatiue Church, Satan percey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:21112:7"/>
turned all his force and malice against his poore mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
So being let loose again in this latter age, worketh stil
what hee can to hinder the glory of God, and saluation of
man. Whose speciall instruments, God and Magog, the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous
Turke and bloud-thirstie Pope, ruling the worlde
at their pleasure, haue so vehemently conspired with all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueritie
and meanes possible to subuert, deface, and vtterlie
abolish both Christ, his Church and religion: as if either the
furie and malice of Satan, the strength and power of man,
the wit and pollicie of the world, cruell tormentes, paines of
death, or hell gates, coulde haue preuayled: no crueltie could
euer bée inuented, which hath not béene attempted. Yet so
mightily hath the Lord alwayes preserued his poore despised
truth, and strengthned his afflicted members: as no threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
paines, or kinde of death, could euer so feare or terrifie
them: but that from time to time, they haue alwayes stoode
in defence of the truth against the tyrants of the world, and
preuailed. In whom both in their liues and deaths appeared
manifest tokens of Gods diuine working, far beyond mans
reach: being so readie in their answeres, so patient in their
imprisonment, so strong &amp; constant in their sharp torments,
so willing to pardon their enemies, and so chéerefull &amp; coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
in suffering, that so they might winne Christ, they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
neither gallowes, tearing their members, pressing theyr
bodies, nor all the grieuous tormentes that wicked world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
could deuise Hauing two special markes of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren:<note place="margin">Iohn. 16. 33</note>

                  </note> One Peter Waldus Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen
of Lyons, a man both rich and verie well learned,
walking amongst others in their accustomed place of mée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting:
it chanced one of the companie to fall suddenly downe
and yéeld vp the Ghost: which heauie example so terrified
the sayd Waldus, as thereupon he was striken with a déepe
and earnest repentance of his former life, &amp; séeking with a
seruent desire to reforme the same: began first to giue large
almes to the poore and néedy. Secondly, to instruct himselfe
and his householde, in the doctrine of the Gospel. Thirdly,
to exhort all men that came vnto him, to repentance and
amendment of life. And the more his fame spred abrode, the
more did the people frequent about him, some to heare his
doctrine, and some to receiue his almes. Which geare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
at last to the eares of the Romish Prelates, they neuer
ceased vexing, and persecuting both him and his fauorers,
till at length by violence they were all driuen out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:
who dispersing themselues into diuerse countries, were
compelled to liue poorely: some in Bohemia, some in Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
and some in the valleyes of Angron, Lucern and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousse
in the countrie of Piedmont, vnder the Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoy.
From those that dwelt in Piedmont, came the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:21112:10"/>
people of Merindoll and Cabriers to inhabit in certaine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sart
places in the Countrie of Prouence in France:<note place="margin">Anno. 1380.</note> some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Lions, and some at the foote of the Alpes: being men of
such honest behauiour, vpright conscience, and vertuous
conuersation,: so iust and constant in their dealing, pitifull
and charitable one to another, diligent and painefull to get
their liuing with truth and honestie (offering that it all the
Uniuersities in Christendome, were able by the worde of
God to reprooue their doctrine, to yéeld and confesse their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours)
that their very enemies who continually sought their
déstruction, could not iustly accuse them of any crime: saue
onely for speaking against the corruption of the Romish
Clergie: and forsaking the Bishop of Rome his authoritie,
cleauing onely to the worde of God. For which cause
they were so odiously detested and abhorred: that a law was
made vtterly to destroy them all, both man, woman and
childe, as a people vnworthie to liue vpon the earth. Till it
pleased the Lord after many horrible murthers, cruell con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts
and grieuous persecutions for the Gospell, to fight for
them to the confusion of their enemies, and preseruation of
his truth. Some called them Lowlards: some the poore
people of Lyons: but for that they were the followers of
Waldus, they were all called Waldenses till the time of
Luther, when they began to be called Lutherians and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants.</p>

eleuen bloudie battels, whose very name in the field was a
terrour sufficient to quaile the enemie: at last falling sicke
and readie to yéelde his debt due vnto nature, did valiantly
comfort and cheare vp his sorrowfull countrimen in this
maner. When I am dead (quoth hee) take my skinne, and
make thereof a drum to vse in your warres: for as my name
was a terror to those Romish woolues in time of my life, so
will the very ratling of my skinne, enforce them for feare to
runne away when I am dead.</p>

onely: yet most commonly it is taken rather for the currish
kind, whose qualities are to bite and pinch, not the noysome
woolfe, but harmelesse sheepe, and in stead of false théeues to
barke and snatch at true men. According to Saint Augustin,<note place="margin">August in epist. 120. Phil. 3. 3. Erasmus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothege.</note>

called him dogge (quoth he) because that of those, which giue

               <p>Some are like the dogge called Lunarius, the Mooner,
whose nature is continually to barke at the Moone-shine in

that neither prince, prelate, nor people, can either rest for
them, or know when danger is by them: &amp; therefore better no

And euerie inferiour Subiect, dare nowe take vpon him

Prince and Prelate. Surely this kinde of learning is
too déepe for my vnderstanding. If it stretch beyonde the
boundes of Christian duetie and obedience to gouernours

               <p>But me thinks I doe heare, some inferiour Magistrates

to whisper in mine eare and say: they are so backt and borne

but to backe and maintaine them against law and order, I

but they had their bandes of men readie to take their
part. Iohn Leadon in Munster had no sooner set abroch
his pestilent doctrine, but he had a multitude of followers, to
the great disturbance of the Church: and so haue these (no
doubt) whole swarmes of Disciples to ioyne with them:
some hauing riotously spent their patrimonie, are tickled in
the eares by hearing of the spoyle of Ecclesiasticall liuings:
some pettiefoggers wanting worke at Westminster hall in
hope to haue their Clyents well increased, may gape for
the ouerthrowe of ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, with some
Atheists, some Neuters, some Anabaptists, and some
Brownings, with the Familie of loue, and such like:
who if they might once haue their purpose: woulde soone

the Church of England to vtter ruine and miserie: being in

as it is more offensiue to speake in defence of her maiesties

               <p>Notwithstanding, if the magistrate shall command any

of our Bishops: I wonder why they
should séeme offensiue to any: séeing I
partly knowe by that which I haue read,
and great Clearkes haue taught, that the
best and most principall pillers of the
Church, since the time of Christ vntill this day:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 3.</note> haue taken
the same vpon them.<note place="margin">Titus. 1.</note> The Apostle himselfe setteth downe
the office of a Bishop:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 19.</note> and I doe finde in Ecclesiasticall Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories,
that Iames was Bishop of Ierusalem, Peter of
Antioch, and Marke of Alexandria.</p>
               <p>We must weigh and consider the order of the Lordes
procéedings in his Church from time to time: and make a
difference betwéene the infancie and strength of the same.
As first vnto the children of Israel, Moyses was sent onely
with a rodde in his hand,<note place="margin">Exod. 4.</note> and had Aaron giuen him for
his mouth. When the people were deliuered from the
bondage of Egypt and came into the wildernesse,<note place="margin">Exod. 18.</note> Moyses
by the counsell of Iethro his father in lawe: appoynted
Captaines ouer hundrethes,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> fifties and tennes. When the
lawe was giuen, the Arke and ornaments thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing,
with ceremonies, sacrifices, the Priestes office and
garments was ordained. And after the people were setled in
the land of promise, were kings and prophets appointed. So
when Christ himselfe was sent downe from his father, hee
made choyce of his Apostles, who after his ascention accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their commission:<note place="margin">Mat. 28. 19.</note> went foorth and preached through
the whole worlde:<note place="margin">Act. 6. 5.</note> ordained Elders and Deacons in euerie
congregation. And after when the Church grewe to more
ripenesse, were Bishops appointed to haue the charge and
ouersight of the rest, And as it appeareth by the Apostle
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21112:17"/>
himselfe, there was great difference betwéene a Bishop
and an Elder: the Bishop was taught, not sharply to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
an Elder, but gently to admonish him, and to receiue
no accusation against him vnder two or thrée witnesses:<note place="margin">1. Tim. 5. 1. 19</note> but
we reade not that the Elders were permitted to reprehend
or receiue accusation against a Bishop.</p>
               <p>And as for Archbishop, Patriarke or Metropolitan,
being titles of equall degrée, they are verie auncient, euen
since the time of the Primatiue Church, as before is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
               <p>But say some, they were not called Lorde Bishops:
sure I thinke so, because the people of those countries could
speake no English: but rather in the Lattin tongue, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi>
which signifieth Sir or Lord. The Elders that rule
well (saith the Apostle) are worthie of double honour:<note place="margin">1. Tim. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

they which labour in the worde and teaching. And
why should we be more curious, in yéelding vnto our godly
and reuerend Bishops those titles of honour: then Hanna

                  </note> thought she had beene drunke: Not so my
Lord (quoth she) I haue drunke neither wine nor strong
drinke: I am a woman of a sorrowfull heart, and haue pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out my soule before the Lord. Againe when that good

Helia,<note place="margin">3. King. 18.</note> he fell downe before him, and said: art not thou
my Lord Helia: who did not reproue him for giuing him that

               <p>But the chiefe thing which these doe shoote at, is their
large Reuenues. They keepe (say they) too great a state.
Here we are to consider, in godly policie, which is the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid
of religion, that the nature of vs Englishmen, is not to
estéeme either of ciuil or ecclesiasticall gouernours, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their vertue and graces as they deserue, but rather
in respect of their outward countenance, pompe, &amp; wealth.
Which as it séemeth by Ecclesiasticus, was a great fault in
his time: for saith he, though a poore man speake wisely,
yet can it take no place: but when a rich man speaketh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:21112:18"/>
man holdeth his tongue:<note place="margin">Eccle. 13.</note> And looke what he saith, they
prayse it vnto the cloudes: and if a poore man speake, they
say,<note place="margin">Wealth is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</note> what fellow is this? which is the very fashion of the
world at this day.<note place="margin">Exod. 39.</note> When Aaron the high Priest stoode be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the people to worship, he was commanded to bee deckt
with rich and sumptuous ornaments of gold, silke, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
stones: not that God himselfe was delighted with such
externall glory, but in respect of mans infirmitie: the more
to moue the people to honour and reuerence him, as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
of God: in which deuine regard (as I take it) doe
Christian Princes honour their prelates, whom God hath
honoured,<note place="margin">Prou 22. 4.</note> with gifts méete for so high a calling: who as he
hath not bestowed them in equall measure vnto all, but gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to some fiue talents,<note place="margin">Mat. 25. 15.</note> some two, and some one: and called
some to be Euangelists,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 12. 28.</note> some gouernours, some pastors, and
some helpers in his Church:<note place="margin">Ephe. 4. 11.</note> so are they not all to be had in
like honour and estimation: but euery one according to his
wisedom, learning, grauitie and discretion: without which
learning is but as a sword in a mad mans hand.</p>
               <p>Finally, suppose that such a pettie-Doctor as our new
Reformers would allow of: were now in his Consistory
with his company of Elders about him: of which (you must
imagin) there is good choice to be had in euery parish in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:
and being without that state and countenance, which
our common wealth affordeth our Bishops, should there
procéede with his discipline against some mightie man in
authoritie within the compasse of his iurisdiction: hee should
well sée and féele his Consistory and discipline to be litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.
It would soone be said vnto him: What, Doctor
hedgecréepe: dare you take vpon you to controll me? and
much worse I warrant you: so as he might with the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
of London, command beggers to the stockes: but hee
must not bind Beares, nor once touch the high Cedars of
Libanus.</p>
               <p>And by the way: my masters of the Cleargie, which are
so vehemently set on fire to séeke alteration: whatsoeuer you

The storie of Aereus, who vnder a pretence to frame a
pure vnspotted Church, did seperate himselfe (as you nowe
do) drawing a sort of vnstable people after him, from Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
to Chambers, and from townes to woods (till in the end
by the iudgement of Epiphanius, they were brought to be as
holy a Congregation as that procession where the deuill bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
the Crosse) perswadeth mee,<note place="margin">Epiphanius</note> that the people by your
wished reformation, would mend as fast in all vertue and
godlinesse, as sowre Ale in summer. And not onely the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey-lands,
so well pretended to be imploied to the inriching
of the king, maintaining of schooles, &amp; relieuing the poore, but
also the example of your fellow reformers in Scotland (who
by altering the ancient state and propertie of ecclesiasticall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings,
haue brought their Cleargie so bare &amp; beggerly, as for
want of maintena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, a nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber are glad to pike their croms
vnder other mens tables) may bee a warning sufficient to
teach you: not to be ouerhastie in excommunicating your
Church-liuings, least your selues bee the first that repent
and soonest smart for it. Yea, if those which nowe séeme in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouring
your follies, to smile full smoothly, might once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
&amp; get that they gape for, their countenance no doubte
would soone be altered: so as your selues, your wiues and
children might lie in the stréetes and sterue for all them: and
you in the ende haue greater cause to lament your owne re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued
miserie, then nowe to exclaime so vehemently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a state, which for good gouernment all the realmes
in Christendome can neither mend nor match.</p>
