         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

suspected of the Premises?</p>
            <p>The Punishments inflicted on it all over
the World, partly shew how much it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested.
By the <hi>Levitical</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Law of
<hi>Moses</hi> it was rewarded with <hi>Death.</hi> The <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi>
use that Punishment; the Father forcing
his Daughter, the Husband his Wife, and the
Brother his Sister to the Place of Execution.<note place="margin">Heylin.</note>
And among the <hi>Turks,</hi> the Offending Woman
is sentene'd to be Drown'd, and the Man
Dismembred. The <hi>Babylonians, Arabians, Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,
Indians, Iavans, Brazilians</hi> and <hi>Mexicans</hi>
also made it capital; so did the ancient Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Laws: but latter Ages are contented
with <hi>Confinement</hi> and <hi>Whipping;</hi> and the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical
Canons prescribe <hi>Excommunication.</hi>
By a Constitution of the Church, in the time
of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> such lewd persons were compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to Murderers, and equally denied Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<hi>Burial.</hi> And there was a Law about
the Year 1032, whereby the Adulteress was
to lose her <hi>Nose</hi> and <hi>Ears.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, No such
person shall enter into the Kingdom of God:
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102572:3"/>
and as to this World, the Gospel allows us to
<hi>put</hi> her <hi>away,</hi> Matth. 5. 33. and <hi>c.</hi> 19. 9.</p>
            <p>If instead of <hi>Allowance</hi> I had said <hi>Precept,</hi>
I think I might do it with more reason than
St. <hi>Mark</hi> had to call the Bill of Divorcement
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, when it was only an Indulgence
wrested from <hi>Moses,</hi> because of the <hi>hard hearts</hi>
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> who otherwise might have mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
their Wives, if they had not had leave
to part with 'em. They were a stiff-necked
people, as God himself often called them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to slaughter, saith St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> filling
their Houses with Relations Blood, and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
neither their Neighbours Families, nor
their Own. On this Consideration it was, we
find that permission, <hi>Deut. 24. 1. When a man
hath taken a wife and married her, and it come to
pass she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath
discovered some uncleanness in her; then let him
write her a bill of divorcement, and give it into her
hand, and send her out of his house</hi>—If he did
not like her, he might dismiss her. The
ground of this dislike is said to be some <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,</hi>
or matter of <hi>nakedness;</hi> which cannot
mean <hi>Adultery,</hi> because Adultery, if proved,
was punished with Death, as I said; and if
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102572:4"/>
only suspected, the guilt of it was determined
by the <hi>Water of Iealousy,</hi> Numb. 5. 27. The
word therefore must signify something dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable
in her Person, Humour, or Actions,
which the Husband could not digest, and
thereupon desired to be rid of her, as
Mr. <hi>Ainsworth</hi> and <hi>A lapide</hi> conceive, who cites
<hi>Origen</hi> and <hi>Chrysostom</hi> for this Interpretation;
and the Assembly of Divines explain it of the
<hi>Leprosy,</hi> or some other <hi>bodily disease</hi> and <hi>ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish;</hi>
and in general, <hi>any thing</hi> else to make
the Husband loath her. This fully appears
in the practice of that people, who thought
it a good Foundation to build a Divorce on,
if the Wife were <hi>sterilis, deformis, rixosa, morosa,</hi>
barren, ugly, peevish or disagreeable: and in
the words of <hi>Siracides,</hi> Eccl. 25. 29. <hi>If she did
not go as her Husband would have her, he cut her
off from his flesh, and gave her a bill of divorce,
and let her go:</hi> As it is said of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> That
he dismiss'd his Wife, because he did not like
her Manners.</p>
            <p>This, doubtless, was straining the Point too
far, to make the <hi>uncleanness</hi> depend more on
the imagination or prejudice of the Man, than
on the Wife's <hi>ill conduct,</hi> or whatever else of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:102572:4"/>
like nature she was chargeable with. Yet we
have not these Examples in <hi>Iudaea</hi> alone, but
in other Countries also, where Men pretended
to more Civility and a better Temper. <hi>Q. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tistius,</hi>
a Noble <hi>Roman,</hi> Divorced his Wife for
talking familiarly <hi>cum libertina. C. Sulpitius</hi>
used his Wife in the same manner, because she
went abroad without her <hi>Veil.</hi> Another did
the same, <hi>propter praetextum sterilitatis,</hi> on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Barrenness; which was an Objection
his Wife could not help, and not her fault,
but misfortune. <hi>P. Sempronius,</hi> because his
Wife went to a <hi>Play</hi> without his knowledge,
put her away. <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> dealt so with <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peia,
Quia mala laboraret fama,</hi> being suspected
to have to do with <hi>Clodius.</hi> But <hi>M. Tullius</hi>
acted on much slighter Reasons; and, <hi>Levibus
de causis Terentiam dimiserit.</hi> And <hi>Augustus</hi> out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
'em all in this matter, for he could except
nothing against <hi>Scribonia,</hi> but that <hi>he was
weary of her.</hi> I omit <hi>Montanus,</hi> the <hi>Cataphrygae,
Pepusiani, Ebionitae, Massalini,</hi> and Others in
Church-History, who took the same liberty.
And we read of an Ecclesiastical Law in <hi>Wales,
Circa</hi> 940, which made it a sufficient Cause
of Divorce, if a Woman Kissed <hi>any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
her Husband.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:102572:5"/>
In all these Cases, I must confess, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal-Knot</hi>
was not look'd on so sacred and
strong as it ought to have been: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Christian Lawgiver corrects these Abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and puts every one in mind of the Nature
of Marriage, which out of <hi>two</hi> makes <hi>one;</hi>
and so strictly unites 'em together, that after
this Union <hi>they are not two, but one Flesh.</hi>
This was it God intended in the first Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to which Christ called back the <hi>Iews;</hi>
and then added, <hi>What God hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But though this Language shows what a
close conjunction Matrimony makes between
a <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Wife,</hi> which is not rashly, or,
<hi>quâcunque de causâ</hi> (as the Jews <hi>said</hi> and <hi>did)</hi>
to be dissolved; yet plainly our Lord's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof
of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> is not to be taken <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi>
as if nothing in the World could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joint
these two persons; but <hi>relatively,</hi> and
with respect to them he was disputing with,
and in opposition to those Reasons they went
upon for their frequent Divorces. <hi>I say unto
you, Whoever shall put away his Wife,</hi> except it
be for Fornication, <hi>and shall marry another, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth
Adultery,</hi> Matth. 19. 9.—So that the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102572:5"/>
               <hi>instance excepted</hi> is a sufficient Cause of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away the Wife, though the Text will not
admit of any other. For though a <hi>Rule</hi> or
<hi>Law</hi> is universally binding, where no Clause
is inserted to provide for particular Cases; yet
whenever such provision is made, the <hi>exception</hi>
is safe, and as strong in <hi>its sense</hi> as the Law is
in the <hi>other</hi> quite opposite to it; for so we
usually speak, <hi>Exceptio ponit contraria in casu
excepto.</hi> And therefore though in the general,
it is not lawful upon any pretence to lay aside
one's Wife, <hi>saving for the cause of Fornication,</hi>
Matth. 5. 33. this <hi>saving</hi> infers, That though
<hi>no</hi> Reason <hi>besides</hi> this has force enough to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve
Marriage consummated, yet <hi>this</hi> must
be allowed a sufficient Reason for it, or else
the <hi>Exception</hi> was in vain.</p>
            <p>They say St. <hi>Mark</hi> and St. <hi>Luke</hi> have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
this Exception, and thereby signified the
little Stress to be laid on't. But we answer
with St. <hi>Augustine,</hi> That the Four Evangelists
do<note n="a" place="bottom">Mutuas operas tradere, &amp; quod unus brevius &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurius posuit, illud alter suppleat &amp; clarius explicet.</note> supply one another; and where one
omits, the rest make it up to compleat the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102572:6"/>
Gospel. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> is copious, and full in
the Matters he treats of. St. <hi>Mark</hi> (as St. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome</hi>
calls his Book <hi>Epitomen Evangelii à Mathaeo
scripti)</hi> giving only an Abstract of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi>
he industriously let go many particulars, which
however must not lose their Evidence, because
he past 'em. This is the usual way of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviators.</hi>
But then it cannot be imagined
that <hi>Short-hand</hi> is plainest, or best adapted to
every Reader's capacity: Or that St. <hi>Mark</hi>
should speak more intelligibly <hi>without</hi> the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
than St. <hi>Matthew with</hi> it; especially
considering He was one of the Disciples pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
at this Discourse with the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> and
so had better opportunity to know his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster's
meaning. The Rule is, <hi>Pauciora ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poni
debent secundum plura, &amp; regula generalis
per exceptionem alibi traditum est limitanda.</hi> And
this shews, how S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke</hi> are to be
understood in this affair.</p>
            <p>But for further light, let us reflect on the
Occasion of these words, and debate the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
in this short Dialogue between the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risees</hi>
and <hi>Christ.</hi>

away your Wives; but from the
beginning it was not so. You
confound the Laws concerning
Marriage, or rather propose a <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration</hi>
instead of a <hi>Law.</hi> The
Question between us is not <hi>de lege</hi>
Forensi, of a Municipal; but <hi>de
lege</hi> Morali, of a Moral Law; and
concerning the Sense of the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of Marriage immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the Creation. The <hi>former</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
permitted Divorce, because
of your Cruelty to your Wives;
but still with respect to Conscience,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102572:7"/>
you cannot safely use that liberty,
for it is a Sin against the <hi>latter</hi> Law;
and be well assured, that though
<hi>Moses</hi> doth not <hi>punish,</hi> yet God
doth not <hi>approve</hi> it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Pharisees.</speaker>
               <p>Do you deny then all Causes of
Divorce?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Christ.</speaker>
               <p>No; I except what the Law pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes,
and ought to punish, as a
thing in its own Nature not to be
reconciled to the notion of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
I mean <hi>Fornication,</hi> which
makes it impossible for the Man
and the Woman to continue <hi>one</hi>
Flesh any longer: And if at any
time the Penalty of the Law be
not exacted in this Case, yet the
Party guilty by that Act of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness
voids the Obligation,
forfeits the Interest she had in her
Husband, and by joining herself
to another, becomes Morally dead
to him to whom she was united
before. So that, <hi>I say unto you, Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
shall put away his Wife, except
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:102572:7"/>
it be for Fornication, and shall marry
another, commitetth Adultery; and
whoso marrieth her which is put away,
doth commit Adultery.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>Can words be plainer? Nothing but <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication</hi>
can untie the Marriage-Knot, and
make Divorces innocent. <hi>Fornication</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is a just Ground and sufficient Warrant
for so doing; or else what sense is there in
these words? and what End could Christ have
in making the <hi>Exception?</hi> So that in this case,
and upon this account, whenever there is a
Divorce, it is not <hi>Man,</hi> but <hi>God</hi> parts 'em.
No; <hi>Homo non separat, quos poena condemnat,
quos reatus accusat, quos maleficium coarctat.</hi>
The same Authority which made 'em <hi>one</hi>
flesh, dissolves the Union; and because of
<hi>Fornication,</hi> makes 'em <hi>two</hi> again.</p>
            <p>It is said, <hi>Ex matrimonio duo sunt facti una
caro:</hi> and the Insinuation is, That nothing
can divide'em, but that which disjoints Soul
and Body, the Death of either Party: And
this is true in the main. But the Case of <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>
shakes the Proposition; and the Wife who
goes astray, by the <hi>Carnalis copula,</hi> becomes <hi>one
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102572:8"/>
flesh</hi> with the Fornicator, as he that is joined
to an Harlot is <hi>one body</hi> with her, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>
speaks, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. So that the <hi>Vinculum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugale</hi>
is hereby dissolved, because it is not
to be conceived how She can be <hi>one</hi> with her
Husband, and with the <hi>Adulterer</hi> too, for the
Apostles Reason immediately following;
wherein he asserts, that only <hi>two</hi> can be <hi>one
flesh.</hi> I spake in the Actual Tense, and said,
It is <hi>dissolved,</hi> though not literally done; but
there is the <hi>Cause</hi> of dissolving it; and if a
Man will not use his Right, and lay hold on
the Forfeiture, 'tis his own fault, and he will
be much to blame. I call it <hi>his fault,</hi> because
he who <hi>Celat crimen uxoris,</hi> conceals his Wife's
fault, makes himself <hi>Turpitudinis patronum,</hi> a
Patron of her Lewdness: And herein I am
of St. <hi>Chrysostom</hi>'s mind, or whoever else is the
Author of the imperfect Work; That <hi>as it is
a cruel and wicked thing to put away a chaste Wife,
so he is a Fool that will keep an Whore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>An Husband may, if he please, <hi>Cedere de
jure suo,</hi> and forgive an unclean Wife: but
<hi>Calvin</hi>'s Judgment I take to be safer, To cleanse
his House and Bed of so gross a defilement,
and be rid of her and her Sin together. And
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:102572:8"/>
hence the word <hi>repudium</hi> has its Name, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusatio
propter rem pudendam;</hi> and I think a
Man ought to be very careful how he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessory
to any thing that will bring him shame.
This is one Reason they usually give for Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce;
namely, To secure our own Integrity
and Honour, and keep off the suspicion of
being privy to the Sin. And I must not omit
another of very great Consequence, and that
is, <hi>prolis incertitudo,</hi> uncertainty of the Issue;
which, without a Contradiction, brings <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardy</hi>
into <hi>Wedlock;</hi> because though it be a
Rule in Law, that, <hi>Pater est quem nuptiae de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant,</hi>
He is the Father who is Husband
to the Wife; yet in <hi>foro Conscientiae,</hi> the Court
of Conscience, perhaps the Man, to be sure
the Wife, is convinced to the contrary: And
for my part, to speak in the way of Morality
and Religion, I find no difference between
these two Bastards, but that the one is <hi>really,</hi>
and the other <hi>legally</hi> so. And on this account
it is, That although the Sin of Adultery is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
great both in the Husband and the Wife;<note n="a" place="bottom">Quantum ad bonum prolis plus peccat adulterium uxoris.</note>
yet, as to the Issue, the Wife is much more
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102572:9"/>
blameable: And it must be consider'd, that
the Wife's Incontinency ruins the Family of
her Husband, who leaves in his spurious Issue
nothing but the Name, and conveys to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity
not one drop of his Ancestors Blood
to continue the Relation between 'em.</p>
            <p>We may observe at the Office of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
in the Exhortation to the Young
Couple, the Minister <hi>requires</hi> and <hi>charges</hi> them
both, That if <hi>either of 'em know any Impediment
why they may not be lawfully joined together, that
they confess it: For,</hi> saith he, <hi>be well assured, that
so many as are coupled together otherwise than
God's Word doth allow, are not join'd together by
God, neither is their Matrimony lawful.</hi> So that
in Marriage there is a conditional Contract;
Neither doth God so join the Man and the
Woman together, but that they may be part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if there be a just Reason for it; and in
case of such Impediment, their Matrimony is
not Lawful. <hi>Fornication,</hi> I confess, is in this
Question a <hi>subsequent Act,</hi> and is not called
an <hi>Impediment;</hi> but they differ only in point
of Time; and if the <hi>Impediment</hi> keeps the Knot
<hi>untied,</hi> notwithstanding the Ceremony is pass'd
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:102572:9"/>
upon them; why, if once effectually tied,
should not <hi>Adultery</hi> have the same strength to
undo it? The <hi>Tie</hi> consists in this, That they
<hi>two are made one flesh:</hi> But if the Adulteress
alters the property, and becomes the Flesh of
another Man, in this case she dissolves the
Bond with respect to her Husband, and is no
longer <hi>one flesh</hi> with him. <hi>Solvitur carnis uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,
nefariè rumpitur conjugalis fides &amp; peccatur
contra ipsa matrimonii substantialia.</hi> So that if
the Gospel had been silent in this Cause of
Divorce, yet not <hi>forbidding</hi> it, it must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood
from the very Nature of the Conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal-Union,
which supposes neither Party alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
in Affection or Duty, as one of them
must needs be in case of Fornication. This
Union, I say, being the very Essence of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony,
the Name is lost, when an Act is
done which divides one Party from the other.
However, the Gospel of Christ doth allow it,
and lays as great a stress on it, as the Church
can on any other Impediment whatever;
which being proved, makes the Matrimony
unlawful.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, That the <hi>mutual Troth</hi>
given each to the other, before the Minister,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102572:10"/>
runs in this Form of Obligation, That the
Husband takes the Wife, and the Wife the
Husband, <hi>for better, for worse, till Death parts
them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We Answer: 1. These words, <hi>for better,
for worse,</hi> do not imply an irreligious or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral
Sense, (for this amounts to such an
Impediment as our Church proposes to make
Marriage unlawful;) but their meaning is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd
by the following Clauses, <hi>For richer, for
poorer, in sickness, and in health.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Si sit jurgiosa, petulans, prodiga, rustica, ebria, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formis, stulta, &amp; aliis mille vitiis molesta.</note> If she be a scold,
peevish, prodigal, clownish, drunken, ugly,
a fool, troubled with a thousand such de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects;
which are very ill qualities, and such
as makes <hi>Solomon</hi> confess, That <hi>it is better to
dwell in the Wilderness, than with a contentious,
angry Woman,</hi> Prov. 22. 19.<note n="b" place="bottom">Si uxor sit sterilis, debilis, caeca vel clauda, vel surda, vel siquid aliud cogitari potest, excepta fornicatione.</note> If the Wife be
barren, sickly, blind, lame, or deaf; or if you
can think of any thing else, saith St. <hi>Augustine,</hi>
except Fornication. And accordingly the Rule
of the Law is,<note n="c" place="bottom">Fortuna afflicta, si absit culpa, patienter in conjugio ferenda est.</note> Adverse fortune, if there be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:102572:10"/>
no fault, is patiently to be born in Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.
And so <hi>Aristotle</hi> concurs in his Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomicks,
and saith, <hi>It becomes a Wife to acquit
her self well towards her Husband, not only in a
good, but a bad fortune: and should his Estate
suffer by ill chance or mismanagement, or his body
by sickness, or his mind by phrenzy, she is to bear
the affliction cheerfully, and retain the same respect
and affection she had for him before.</hi> And the
Rule in this Case is, <hi>Quod semel placuit, displi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
non potest;</hi> meaning, <hi>non debet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Till Death us do part.</hi> Doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a simple Obligation, from which there
is no release, until Death makes it; because
the Lord Christ pronounces <hi>Fornication</hi> to be
a sufficient reason to break the Bond, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss
the Wife, if she be found guilty; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
to the Qualities or Circumstances of the
Wife in the words before; which though bad
enough, are no legal incapacities for Cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
neither is the Wife thereupon to be
discharged from her Husband without her
own consent, who either must keep her at
home, or otherwise provide for her. Besides,
This period of the Obligation is grounded on
the antecedent Supposition, That the Woman
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102572:11"/>
               <hi>forsakes all other</hi> Men, <hi>and keeps only to</hi> her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
<hi>as long as they both shall live.</hi> And this
Promise being observed, the Bond is not can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled
till <hi>Death</hi> doth it. But if the Wife for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sakes
her Husband, and keeps company with
others, the Condition is broken, and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ceases on which he married her. For the
Condition of this solemn Engagement was,
That She forsake the rest of Men, and be from
thence-forward entirely his own.</p>
            <p>Lastly, The Marriage-Vow, however word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is to be taken <hi>according to God's holy Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:</hi>
But the Ordinance of God, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to Marriage, is, To make of <hi>two</hi> one
flesh; yet with this Caution and Proviso,
That there be no <hi>Fornication;</hi> for if so, the
innocent Husband has a power left him to
put her away. So that the same Ordinance
which makes the Obligation, allowing this
liberty, Though where <hi>Fornication</hi> interposes
not, the Husband and Wife are to keep close
to one another <hi>as long as they live;</hi> yet where
Either transgress, there is a remedy left; and
if the Woman will offend, (and perhaps in
a daring, bold way, void of all shame, and
in defiance of her Husband) without doubt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102572:11"/>
the Husband in this Case may lay hold of the
Forfeiture, and as soon as he pleases send her
away.</p>
            <p>And truly otherwise the Case of the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
would be very hard, <hi>Quod inducitur in
favorem alicujus,</hi> should, <hi>facere ei prejudicium,</hi>
as they say: That a thing intended to ease
the burden, should add more weight to it.
The Causes for which Matrimony was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
we have in the Exhortation to the Couple
going to be married, which are designed for
the Comforts of life, and not to be plagues
to one another. We do not serve an hard
Master. He considered our condition, and
of himself said,<note place="margin">Gen. 2. 18.</note> 
               <hi>It is not good for man to be
alone, I will make him an help-meet for him.</hi>
This was the Motive he had to produce Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and did it out of him who was to be
her Husband, to let her see how near the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
is between 'em, and how she ought
to cleave to him. This he did as <hi>Creator;</hi> and
then as a <hi>Law-giver,</hi> he instituted Marriage
to confirm their mutual Indearment; that as
in their <hi>Original</hi> they had <hi>one</hi> beginning,<note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> 
               <hi>[Bone
of my bones, and flesh of my flesh,</hi> saith <hi>Adam;]</hi>
so the Ordinance was contrived to unite 'em
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102572:12"/>
by Consent, and engage 'em into a voluntary
Promise to love each the other. And because
he foresaw it would sometimes otherwise hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
and there be a Violation of Faith, though
never so solemnly given, he appointed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
a severe, terrible one, no less than
Death it self, to signify the Violence done this
Union of two Bodies, which he would have
us look upon full as strict as between Body
and Soul, not to be divided till Death parts
'em. 'Tis true, the Clemency of the Gospel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprets
the Punishment now into no more than
<hi>putting her away;</hi> but then this is a <hi>Moral death</hi> to
the guilty Party, and it lies in his Breast who
is thereby injured to put it in Execution, as
soon as he shall think fit to do it.</p>
            <p>Ay,<note place="margin">Obj.</note> but this rigour may be thought not to
consist with the Patience and Sweetness of our
Christian Profession.</p>
            <p>I must acknowledge,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> That <hi>Charity suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
long, and is kind:</hi> But the same <hi>Charity
doth not behave it self unseemly. Non patrat quod
pudendum est,</hi> saith the <hi>Syriack,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, doth
nothing <hi>foedè</hi> or <hi>inhonestè,</hi> as certainly a Man
must do who keeps an Adulteress in his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som,
and by a wicked Indulgence contributes
to her Sin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:102572:12"/>
The Instance of the <hi>Adulteress,</hi> whom Christ
no otherwise punishes than by bidding her <hi>go
and sin no more,</hi> John 8. is answered by that
Rule of the Law,<note n="a" place="bottom">Quod alicui gratiosè conceditur non debet ab aliis in exemplum trahi.</note> That an Act of Grace
ought to be no Example to Criminals: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
if this passage be well considered, What
Christ did was as much an Act of <hi>Iustice</hi> as
<hi>Mercy;</hi> and though he did not condemn, yet
he did not expresly forgive her. <hi>Neither do
I condemn thee:</hi> Nor indeed had he reason to
do it, for he acted judicially in this case; and
if the Evidence withdrew, and would have
no hand in the stoning of her, what could he
do otherwise than to discharge her? discharge
at least the Punishment at this time, though
he did not fully and simply absolve her. At
most this treating her with so much Clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
only inclines Husbands to be merciful
and tender, but <hi>obliges not:</hi> And though Men
may forgive this Offence in their Wives, if
they see good; yet if upon Reasons of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
and Safety they do not, 'tis no Sin at
all, no pinching upon Conscience to use 'em
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:102572:13"/>
as they deserve; and in that manner the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel
allows it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>David</hi> took <hi>Michol</hi> again, though
married to another Man, is nothing to the
purpose; because this was no <hi>Adultery</hi> in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chol,</hi>
who had no design to leave <hi>David;</hi> but
being young, she was forced to accept of
<hi>Phalti,</hi> the Son of <hi>Laish,</hi> at the Command of
<hi>Saul,</hi> her Father and King. And therefore
<hi>David</hi> considered this Act in her (as indeed
it was) a matter of Constraint; and so with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
much scruple receives her again.</p>
            <p>These and some other such Reasons St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi>
presses, and saith, <hi>Adulteram nec posse
nec debere repudiari, sed partem innocentem de
jure teneri ad reconciliationem.</hi> The truth is,
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> was a very compassionate and
tender-hearted Man, sensible of his own faults,
and ready to retract 'em; so that he was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
led to argue for Reconciliation on
any occasion, and almost on any terms; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could he tell how to put off a Penitent
without forgiving him. And it is good Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
in the general: But his Master St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi>
never taught him this Lesson in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.
For as this Father asserts three Causes
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102572:13"/>
for a Man to part with his Wife, so he makes
the <hi>first</hi> and principal of 'em to be <hi>Fornication.</hi>
St. <hi>Ierome,</hi> who, as he could not agree with
St. <hi>Augustine</hi> in other Points, so he is directly
opposite to him in this; and avouches, <hi>Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teram
nec posse nec debere retineri,</hi> That an
Adulteress neither can nor ought to be taken
again. Nay, he goes farther, and saith, That
not only <hi>ubicunque est fornicatio,</hi> where there
is Fornication, but <hi>fornicationis suspicio,</hi> sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion
of it, <hi>Uxor dimittitur,</hi> the Wife is
to be dismiss'd.</p>
            <p>And as for <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> I think <hi>Bucer</hi>'s
Conclusion unanswerable; Who reflecting on
that Law in <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> 24. 2, 3. concerning
the Bill of Divorcement, whereby leave is
given the Woman to marry another—If this
Second Husband should either die, or hate her
likewise, and so give her another Bill, the
First Husband must never receive her again,
for this reason, <hi>Because she is defiled—and that's
an abomination unto the Lord,</hi> v. 4. Now, as
that Author argues, if she be <hi>polluta,</hi> who was
not only <hi>married</hi> to this second Man, but did
it by her former Husband's permission, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102572:14"/>
was justified in it by Law: If, I say, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
this Allowance, she was so pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted
by this Second Marriage, as to be made
ever incapable of being re-married to the First
Husband; much more polluted must that
Woman be, who has committed Adultery
against both the <hi>Law,</hi> and her <hi>Husband</hi>'s Will:
and unfit is she either to be retained, or in
case of departure to be received again. No;
<hi>David</hi>'s Resolution is a good Precedent in this
Case: <hi>There shall no deceitful person dwell in
mine house; the party that telleth Lies shall not
tarry in my sight. I will not dwell with vain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
neither will I have fellowship with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful.
I hate the Congregation of the wicked, and
will not sit among the ungodly.</hi> And all this
not barely as a <hi>Duty,</hi> but in point of Safety;
because <hi>evil communications corrupt good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi>
and though <hi>with the clean I may be clean,
yet with the froward I may learn frowardness.</hi>
And therefore to secure our own Innocence,
we are bound to shun them who are Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But what saith the Prophet?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj.</note> Take heed to
your spirit, and let none deal treacherously against
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:102572:14"/>
the Wife of his youth; for the Lord God of
Israel saith, That he hateth putting away,
<hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 16, 17.</p>
            <p>No doubt but God hates it,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> when a Man
deals <hi>perfidè</hi> and <hi>iniquè</hi> with his Wife, and
when he causelesly leaves her, and not She
him. Here was no crime of Adultery char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged;
no fault, but that the Husband liked
another better. As matters thus stood, no
wonder is it that God hated such <hi>putting away.</hi>
God, who was a witness between him and his
Wife, <hi>v.</hi> 14.—yet he ventures to break the
Matrimonial-Covenant, made in the Presence
of God, who being a God of Judgment,
he could not be thought to delight in such
a Man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Well, the Apostle is express,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj.</note> 1 Cor. 7. 10,
11. Unto the married I command; yet not I, but
the Lord; Let not the Wife depart from the Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
and let not the Husband put away his Wife—
<hi>And elsewhere he allows no remedy, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease
but Death,</hi> Rom. 7. 2, 3.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:102572:15"/>
But as to the words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in those
two Epistles,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> answer is made, That to speak
of <hi>Matrimony</hi> in it self, or as it is in its first
Institution; and as it is <hi>abused,</hi> or with respect
to those Crimes directly against it, is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.
It is one thing to propose what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
and ordinarily done, according to
Law; and another, what happens in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
Cases. What the Apostle saith in these
Chapters, is to be taken <hi>regulariter,</hi> and not
<hi>in casu.</hi> The ordinary Tie of Marriage lasts
unto Death; and then, and not till then, it
is dissolved. But <hi>Fornication</hi> or <hi>Adultery</hi> dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solves
it sooner. So that the Holy Man dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing
here of the Nature of Marriage, and
not of the Nature or Causes of Divorce, is
not engaged in this dispute; and citing him
on this account, makes little to the purpose.
The Interpreters of these Passages deliver
themselves warily: <hi>Let not the Husband put
away his Wife</hi>—What? Upon no account?
Yes, but let it not be done <hi>exceptâ causâ fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi>
say <hi>Primasius</hi> and St. <hi>Ambrose. Non sine
justâ causâ,</hi> saith <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> who supposes an
Ellipsis in the Expression. <hi>Nisi sit legitima cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sa;</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:102572:15"/>
so <hi>Marlorate.</hi> But when there is <hi>just cause,</hi>
that is, <hi>in case of Fornication:</hi> Hammond.
It must not be <hi>ultro suoque arbitrio,</hi> and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>legitimâ praeeunte cognitione, &amp;c.</hi> saith <hi>Beza;</hi>
not arbitrarily, and without a lawful provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
And this Author calls them <hi>ineptissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos,</hi>
who from this Text would infer, That
there can be no Divorce, no, not in the Case
of <hi>Fornication; Contra manifestè expressam à
Christo adulterii exceptionem,</hi> are his words.
<hi>Non sine gravi &amp; justa causa;</hi> A lapide. <hi>Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem
quam Mathaeo referente dominus expressit—
hic subintelligas;</hi> Estius. The Assembly of
Divines name not the Exception, but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
to St. <hi>Mathew,</hi> both as to the Chapters and
Verses, where notice is taken of it; and their
meaning is, That we are to supply from thence
what is omitted by St. <hi>Paul. Calvin</hi> indeed
wonders why he did not except <hi>Adulterii cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam;</hi>
but what Reason was there for him to
mention the Exception, when the drift of his
discourse did not lead him to it?</p>
            <p>But <hi>Marriage</hi> is said to <hi>signify to us the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical
Union between Christ and his Church.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obj.</note>
Now as there are many Offences done against
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:102572:16"/>
him, which he forgives his Spouse; so ought
we to be Followers of Christ, and of God, as
dear Children: Be merciful, as our heavenly
Father is merciful; and we ought to forgive,
as we desire to be forgiven. <hi>Christianus est
Christi imitator.</hi> Aug.</p>
            <p>And questionless this Divine Example is
good,<note place="margin">Ans.</note> and we ought to imitate it. <hi>Ut sicut
ille agit cum Ecclesia, sic nos agamus, cum conjuge;</hi>
though the Case be different, yet God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
we should do otherwise. But be it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,
That though God is <hi>patient, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi>
and <hi>kind,</hi> yet he has been provoked
to give a Bill of Divorcement to his best-beloved
People. And of this the <hi>Iewish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is an undeniable proof, with the Seven
famous Churches of <hi>Asia,</hi> which have their
Candlesticks removed, and are at this day
overwhelm'd with <hi>Mahometan</hi> Darkness. God's
forbearance teaches us to do as He did, bear
with many faults; but thorough-Apostacy is
too black a Sin to expect so much Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
and Adultery too gross to be pardon'd
at all, or easily done.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:102572:16"/>
I am no more for this kind of Separation,
<hi>quacunque de causa,</hi> after the practice of the
<hi>Iews,</hi> than I am for falling under the Censure
of <hi>Mecaenas,</hi> who was taxed of very great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constancy
and Lightness, because he parted
with his Wife more than once, and received
her again. For if her Faults were small, the
Usage was too severe to turn her out of
doors; but if so notorious as to oblige him
to it, 'twas an unaccountable Fondness and
Easiness to re-admit her.</p>
            <p>The Law takes notice of many Causes of
Divorce, besides the gross One of Adultery.
Consorting with, or entertaining Wanton
Company against the Advice and Will of
the Husband; Practising, or Consenting to
Practices against his Life or Health; Lying
abroad without his Knowledge, and without
any just Reason for it; Going against his Will
to Plays, or other suspected Places; <hi>Morbus
contagiosus;</hi> and some other like Causes, which
must needs make a Virtuous Man very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easy,
his Life comfortless, and his Expences
perhaps beyond his Ability. Any of these are
great Provocations. All of 'em together who
can bear? Especially when <hi>Adultery</hi> consum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:102572:17"/>
'em; <hi>Adultery</hi> publickly known, talk'd
of, and made the common Subject in every
private House and Tavern; and, which is a
very sad Aggravation, when the concern'd
Party glories in the Lewdness, and with the
Harlot in Scripture, wipes her Mouth, and
saith, <hi>All is well.</hi> The <hi>Sin</hi> in secret is bad
enough; And if a Man be so good a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,
has so much Affection and Patience as
to <hi>caution, intreat, admonish, earnestly seek</hi> and
<hi>persuade Amendment,</hi> and all to no effect, but
the Wife will run on in her ill way; and not
only so, but <hi>laugh</hi> at, <hi>flout</hi> and <hi>threaten</hi> her
Husband, and (whereby her Tongue is <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium
malae mentis</hi>) maintain Doctrines which
necessarily call his Safety into question, in
case he uses his Authority and Power to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
her at home; and, in a word, have so
little regard to her self, or him, as to make
the Crime become a scandal to all the World;
What then remains in this Extremity, but to
take the Example of God; Let her be gone;
give her wholly up to her vile Affections, the
Lusts of her heart, and all manner of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:102572:17"/>
Yet I am not against <hi>Repentance.</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
what the Church saith,<note n="a" place="bottom">Vehementèr optamus ut integra persona damnatae ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niam indulgeat &amp; illam ad se rursus assumat.</note> We earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wish that the innocent person would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
the guilty, and take her to him again:
but then it must be<note n="b" place="bottom">Si credibilis melioris vitae spes ostendatur.</note> when there are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
hopes of amendment. But, alas! how
will this appear? Can a few words, extorted
it may be from Necessity, or the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Friends, be called Indications or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of a penitent Heart? <hi>Res magis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuenda
quam verba;</hi> Repentance is grief of
mind for Offences committed: It rigorously
chastises what is done amiss: It always pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
the crime; and hence it derives its
name: <hi>Poenitentia à poena,</hi> or <hi>qua<add>si</add> punientia;</hi>
and if it be sincere,<note n="c" place="bottom">Aut aequat crimina, aut excedit.</note> either equals or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
the crime, saith St. <hi>Ierom.</hi> The Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican
<hi>smote on his breast, and said, Lord, be
merciful to me a sinner.</hi> And the true sign of
Repentance is a thorough change, a real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
I take all this to be a work of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:102572:18"/>
Time.<note n="a" place="bottom">Septem annis poenitentiam agat. <hi>Concil. Ancyr. &amp; Wormac.</hi>
               </note> The Council of <hi>Ancyra</hi> determin'd
Seven years Repentance: The Thief indeed
did it in a few moments; but his life was
short, and on that account the Divine Grace
the stronger.</p>
            <p>Besides, <hi>Restitution</hi> is one necessary part
of Repentance. But how? which way shall
this be expected? when, as St. <hi>Ierom</hi> speaks,
it must puzzle Omnipotence to bring it
about; and though God can do every thing,
I am bold to say it, He cannot restore <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stity</hi>
when a Woman has lost it: And who
will go about to propose an Equivalent for
an inestimable Loss, never to be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered?</p>
            <p>You will say, We are to accept such <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution</hi>
as the nature of the thing will bear;
that is, an <hi>hearty sorrow</hi> for what is past, and
amendment for the future. Neither do I
deny, but these are good fruits or proofs of
Repentance, and may be a means to save
the Sinner in the other World, yet are not
a proper Restitution in this. The <hi>Murderer,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:102572:18"/>
the <hi>Traytor,</hi> the <hi>Felon,</hi> has the same Plea; yet
they must bear the present Punishment of
the Law, and suffer now, tho' saved here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>But how shall an Husband be convinced
of such a Repentance?<note n="a" place="bottom">Semel malus semper presumitur esse malus.</note> 
               <hi>Once bad, and ever
so,</hi> say the Lawyers upon very good grounds.
For though it be possible for a Man or a
Woman to become penitent, yet we ought
to have as good Proofs to demonstrate their
Repentance, as we had Overt-Acts before of
their being Criminals.</p>
            <p>For my part therefore, I think<note n="b" place="bottom">Periculosum post commissum adulterium inter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juges tentare reconciliationem.</note> 'tis dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to attempt Reconciliation after Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery:
And one Reason is, Because<note n="c" place="bottom">Vulnus subinde recrudescit.</note> the
Wound is apt to bleed afresh; and the
Wound ought to be well and leisurely heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
before we hazard the rubbing it. The
innocent Party may perhaps be thought hard
of in this Case: But <hi>P. Aemilius</hi>'s Answer
ought to satisfy unbiass'd People; who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102572:19"/>
found fault with for putting away a
beautiful Wife, excused himself thus:<note n="a" place="bottom">Neminem scire qua in parte calceus licet speciosus fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret, suos premeret digitos.</note> 
               <hi>No
body knows where the shooe pinches but he that
wears it.</hi> It appears by this, That the crime
of <hi>his</hi> Wife was somewhat <hi>secret:</hi> and as
such, I believe it one Testimony of his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to her, That he rather suffer'd the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's
Censure, than in his own Vindication
to expose her Nakedness. And in other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
where the Publication is made already
by her own folly, I take it for a piece of
Affection in the Husband not to divulge it
further, or load the Vice by being particular
in all the Aggravations of it.</p>
            <p>And if at length the Husband will be
melted, and is contented to pass by all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations,
he may, and there is no injury
done him: <hi>Scienti &amp; consentienti non fit injuria.</hi>
But it behoves him to consider well what he
is about; He ought to enquire, Whether it
will consist with his Happiness, his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and other Conveniences of Life to do
so: Whether it be agreeable to Conscience,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:102572:19"/>
and the Duty he owes God and Religion,
to give this countenance to a Crime of that
nature; and whether he can find any great
difference between cohabiting with an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teress,
or an Harlot who is vicious through
Necessity, and has not Bread to eat with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
it.</p>
            <p>I have avoided the Citation of Councils
and Laws, to keep my self from being tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
But, in short, some of 'em allow <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Marriage</hi> upon the Reasonableness of the
thing it self, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> favours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 9.
Others reject it for its ill consequence, as
tempting people to be weary of the <hi>first:</hi>
which indeed is no reason; for a distinction
is to be made between a real and a feigned
Cause; and if, on this Indulgence, Men may
be tempted to bribe Evidence against their
Wives in order to be rid of 'em, so may
such Evidence take away Lives and Estates;
and the Danger is full as great in the one
Case, as in the other. However, for <hi>put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
away,</hi> they generally agree in that; and
where we read some <hi>Canons</hi> seemingly against
it, they must be understood <hi>absque causâ,</hi> and
in unlawful Cases: As <hi>Canon 48. Apostolorum;</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102572:20"/>
which Excommunicates him who puts away
his Wife: This is meant, saith <hi>Balsamon,</hi> if
it be done <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, without Cause. And
<hi>Zonaras</hi> Expounding the same Canon, has
these words,<note n="a" place="bottom">Maritus pollutam ex sedibus suis excludet.</note> 
               <hi>Let the Husband send her
packing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And for <hi>Fathers,</hi> they consider <hi>Fornication</hi>
a just Cause to dismiss one's Wife: And
those who oppose <hi>second Marriage,</hi> do it on
a principle of Tenderness, and to leave room
for a Reconciliation after a serious and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
Repentance; which if the Husband,
for Reasons best known to himself (and of
which he is the proper Judge) will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept,<note n="b" place="bottom">Utitur suo jure, &amp; nulli facit injuriam.</note>
               <hi>Let him use his right, for he doth no
one wrong in it:</hi> And though thereby he may
seem unkind to his polluted Wife, yet he
cannot be said to be unjust to her, but she
has been so to her self and him.</p>
            <p>And this principle of Tenderness I take
to be the Motive for those Distinctions or
Degrees of Divorce; à <hi>thoro,</hi> à <hi>mensa</hi> &amp; <hi>thoro,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:102572:20"/>
à <hi>vinculo matrimonii;</hi> the two first being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
in a way of opportunity to make
their peace with one another; whereas the
last bars the door, and parts 'em both for
ever.</p>
