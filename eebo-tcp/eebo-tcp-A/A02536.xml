            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

both weighty, and vſe-full: for hence may we frame our ſelues either to preuent, or imitate them: To imitate them in what wee may; or preuent them in what they ſhould not. I meddle not with the meanes of their firſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings: the munificence of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Princes, the honeſt deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of wel-meaning Contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the diuiſion of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world, the buſie indeauours of forward Princes, for the recouery of the holy land, with neglect of their owne, the ambitious inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of that ſea, the ſame and large dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe ſeuen hils; the compacted indulgence, and conniuence of ſome treacherous, of other timorous rulers; the ſhameles flattery of paraſites, the rude ignorance of Times; or if
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:26853:8"/>
there be any other of this kinde; My thoughts and wordes ſhall be ſpent vpon the preſent, and lateſt age. All the world knowes, how that pretended chayre of <hi>Peter</hi> tottered, and cracked, ſome three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares agoe, threatning a ſpeedy ruine to her fearefull vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: How is it that ſtill it ſtands, and ſeemes now to boaſt of ſome ſetledneſſe? Certainely, if hell had not contriued a new ſupport, the Angell had long ſince ſaide, It is fallen, it is fallen; and the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, Alas, Alas, the great Citie. The brood of that lame <hi>Loyola</hi> ſhall haue this miſerable honour, without our enuie; that if they had not beene, Rome had not beene. By what meanes, it reſts now to enquire.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo much their zeale
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:26853:9"/>
for falſhood; which yet wee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, and admire not. If Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan were not more buſie then they, we had loſt nothing. Their deſperate attempts, bold intruſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, importunate ſolicitations haue not returned empty; yet their policy hath done more then their force. That Popiſh world was then foule, and debauched, as in doctrine, ſo in life; and now beganne to be aſhamed of it ſelfe; when theſe holy Fathers, as ſome Saints drop't out of heauen, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly profeſſed an vnuſuall ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſad piety, reſolued mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; and ſo drew the eyes, and hearts of men after them, that poore foules beganne to thinke it could not be other then diuine, which they taught; other then holy, which they touched. The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:26853:9"/>
very times (not ſeldome) giue as great aduantage, as our owne beſt ſtrength: and the vices of others giue glory to thoſe which eyther are, or appeare vertuous. They ſaw how ready the world was to bite at the baite, and now follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſucceſſe, with new helps. Plenty of pretended miracles muſt bleſſe, on all ſides, the in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours of this new Sect; and calls for both approbation, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Thoſe things by the report of their owne pennes (other wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes I ſee none) haue beene done by the ten Patriarcks of the Ieſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Religion, both aliue and dead, which can hardly bee mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched of him, whoſe name they haue vſurped. And now the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar can ſay, If theſe men were not of God, they could doe nothing:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:26853:10"/>
How can a man that is a ſinner do ſuch miracles? not diſtruſting either the fame, or the worke, but applauding the Authors, for what was ſaid to bee done. But now leſt the enuie of the fact ſhould ſurpaſſe the wonder, they haue learned to caſt this glory vpon their woodden Ladies, &amp; to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the gaine vnto the whole Religion: Two blocks at <hi>Hale</hi> and <hi>Scherpen-heuuell,</hi> haue ſaide and done more for Popery, then all Fryers, euer ſince <hi>Francis</hi> wore his breeches on his head. But becauſe that praiſe is ſweete, which ariſes from the diſgrace of a riuall, therefore this holy ſociety hath beſides, euer wont to honor it ſelfe by the brokage of ſhameles vntruthes againſt the aduerſe part; not caring how probable any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:26853:10"/>
is, but how odious. A iuſt volume would not containe thoſe willing lies, wherewith they haue purpoſely loded religion, and vs; that the multitude might firſt hate vs, and then enquire: and theſe courſes are helde not tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but meritorious. So the ende may be attayned, all meanes are iuſt; all wayes ſtraight. VVhom we may, we ſatisfie: but wounds once giuen, are hardly healed with out ſome ſcarres: and commonly accuſations are vocall, Apologies dumbe. How eaſie is it to make any cauſe good, if we may take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of tongue, and conſcience? Yet leſt ſome glimpſe of our truth and innocence ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps lighten the eyes of ſome more inquiſitiue Reader, they haue by ſtrict prohibitions, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:26853:11"/>
of bookes, or conference, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained all poſsibility of true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations; Yea their owne wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, wherein our opinions are reported with confutation, are not alowed to the common view, leſt if it ſhould appeare what we hold, our meere opinion ſhould preuaile more then their ſubtileſt anſwere. But aboue all, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of Gods booke hath gained them moſt; If that might be in the hands of men, their religion could not be in their hearts; now, the concealement of Scriptures breeds ignorance, and ignorance ſuperſtition. But becauſe forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance doth but whet deſire, and worke a conceite of ſome ſecret excellence in things denyed; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue they deuiſed to affright this dangerous curioſity, with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:26853:11"/>
that cruell, butcherly, helliſh In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition. Wherein yet there is not leſſe craft then violence. For ſince they haue perceiued the blood of Martyrs to bee but the ſeed of the Church, and that theſe perfumes are more diſperſed with beating; they haue now learned to murder without noyſe, and to bring forth (if, at leaſt, they liſt ſometimes to make the people priuie to ſome examples of terror) not men but carcaſſes. Behold, the conſtant confeſsions of the dying Saints haue made them weary of publique executions: None but bare walls ſhalll now teſtifie the courage and faith of our happy Martyrs. A diſguiſed corps is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought forth to the multitude either for laughter, or feare. Yet becauſe the very dead ſpeake for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:26853:12"/>
truth in a loude ſilence; theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles are rare; and the graues of heretickes are become as cloſe as their death.</p>
               <p>Yet leſt (ſince neither liuing mouthes, nor faithfull pens may be ſuffered to inſinuate any truth) thoſe ſpeeches ſhould perhaps be receiued from the Ancients, which in vs were hereticall; the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of vnpartial antiquity muſt be depraued, all witneſſes that might ſpeake againſt them muſt be corrupted, with a fraudulent violence; and ſome of them pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to the death. So whiles ours are debarred, and the Ancients al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, poſteritie ſhal acknowledge no aduerſarie.</p>
               <p>What ſhould I ſpeake of thoſe plauſible deuices; which they haue inuented to make ſuperſtitious,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:26853:12"/>
and fooliſh Proſelytes? Their proud vaunts of antiquity, vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſality, ſucceſsion, and the name of their fore-fathers, doe not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwade, but amaze, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſot an ignorant heart. The glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhews of their proceſsions, the gaudy ornaments of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, the pompe and magnificence of the places, and maner of their Seruices, the triumphes of their great Feſtiuals, are enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch any childiſh, ſimple, or vaine beholders. VVho knowes not that nature is moſt led by ſenſe? Sure, children and fooles (ſuch are all meere naturall men) cannot be of any other religion.</p>
               <p>Beſides all theſe, their perſonall vndertakings, what for cunning, what for boldnes, could promiſe nothing but ſucceſſe. They can
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:26853:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
transforme themſelues into all ſhapes; and in theſe falſe formes thruſt themſelues into al Courts, and companies, not oftner chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging their habit, then their name. They can take the beſt opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to worke vpon thoſe which are either moſt vnable to reſiſt, or moſt like to beſtead them. That I may not ſpeake of the wrongs of vnſeaſonable trauell: wherein many vnſettled heads haue met dangers, and ſolicited errors: who like fond and idle Dinahs, going abroad to gaze, haue beene raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed ere they returne.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:26853:13"/>
if not by precept, yet by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample: their very ſilence is perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory, and imperious. But alas for that other ſexe: Still the diuel begins with <hi>Eue;</hi> ſtill his aſſault is ſtrongeſt, where is weakeſt reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> had his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena, Nicholas</hi> the Deacon had his <hi>choros foemineos</hi> (as <hi>Hierome</hi> cals them.) <hi>Marcion</hi> had his <hi>Factoreſſe</hi> at Rome; <hi>Appelles</hi> his <hi>Philumena, Montanus</hi> his <hi>Priſca</hi> and <hi>Maximilla; Arrius</hi> his <hi>Conſtantines-ſiſter, Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> his <hi>Lucilla, Elpidius</hi> his <hi>Agape, Priſcillianus</hi> his <hi>Galla:</hi> and our Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites haue their painted Ladies (not dead, but liuing) both for obiects and inſtruments. VVhen they ſaw they could not blow vp religion with French powder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to heauen, they now try by this Moabitiſh plot to ſinke it downe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:26853:14"/>
to hell. Thoſe ſilly women, which are laden with ſinnes, and diuers luſts, muſt now bee the ſtalls of their ſpiritual fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But for that theſe enterpriſes want not danger; that both parts may ſecurely ſucceede, beholde publike liberty of diſpenſations, whether for diſſembled religion, or not vnprofitable filthineſſe. Theſe meanes are (like the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors) diſhoneſt, and godleſſe. Adde (if you pleaſe) hereto, thoſe which pretend more innocent policy: their common dependan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces vpon one commaunder, their intelligences giuen, their charges receiued, their rewards and honors (perhaps of the Calender, perhaps of a red hat) duely conferred. Neither may the leaſt helpe be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the conference of ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:26853:14"/>
(the conioyned labours of whole Societies directed to one end, and ſhrouded vnder the title of one Author:) to large mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, raiſed from the death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beds of ſome guilty benefactors: from whence flow both infinite numbers, and incomparable helpes of Students. Vnder which head, for the time paſt, not a fewe are mooued by the remembrance of the bounteous hoſpitality of the religious; who hauing ingroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the world to themſelues, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med liberal in giuing ſomething; like vnto ſome vaineglorious theeues, which hauing robbed wealthy Merchants, beſtow ſome pence vpon beggars. Further, the ſmothering, if not compoſing of their frequent ſtrifes, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of brawles within their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:26853:15"/>
owne threſholds; with the nice men aging of their knowne op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, hath wonne many ignorant friends. Laſtly, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent correſpondence of their doctrines vnto nature, hath been their beſt ſolicitor. Wee haue exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined particulars in a former E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle: wherein we haue made it euident, that Popery affects no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to make nature either proud, or wanton: it offers diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, but carnall; and ſuch as the greateſt louer of himſelfe would eaſily imbrace for an aduantage. That we may therefore ſumme vp all; I neede not accuſe our careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, indifferency, idleneſſe, looſe carriage; in all which, would God we had not aided them, and wronged our ſelues; Nor yet their zeale and forwardneſſe; worſe

meanes are guily of their gaine.

In theſe caſes, they did, what we need not: and we may, what they did not God meant vs no bondage in their example: their Canons binde vs whether for maners, or doctrine, not their Ceremonies. Neither Chriſt, nor his Apoſtles did all things for imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: I ſpeake not of miraculous Acts. We neede not be ſilent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Iudge, as Chriſt was; wee need not take a towel, and gird our ſelues, and waſh our ſeruants feet, as Chriſt did; we need not make tents for our liuing as <hi>Paul,</hi> nor go

armed as <hi>Peter;</hi> nor cary about our wiues, as he, and the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. I acknowledge the ground not onely of ſeparation, but Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme; and wonder that theſe conceits doe not anſwere them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues who can chooſe but ſee a manifeſt difference betwixt thoſe lawes, which Chriſt and his great Ambaſſadors made for eternall vſe, and thoſe rituall matters, which were confined to place, and time? Euery Nation, euery perſons ſinnes that obſerues not thoſe; Theſe for the moſt part, are not kept of the moſt; and are as well left without ſinne by vs, as vſed without preſcription or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsity by the Authors.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:26853:19"/>
can cure the ſicke by ointment, and impoſition of hands? The Diſciples did it.

Vnleſſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome bold Papiſts, who haue brought in groſſe magicke inſtead of miraculous authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and daube very chrcaſſes in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtead of healing diſeaſes. There be more yet, which we neede not doe: VVhat neede wee to chooſe Miniſters by Lot? VVhat neede we to diſclaime all peculiarity in goods? VVhat need wee to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten in riuers; or to meete vpon their bankes? VVhat need wee to receiue Gods Supper after our owne? VVhat to leane in each others boſome while we receiue
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:26853:19"/>
it? what to abhorre leauen in that holy Bread? what to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate loue feaſts vpon the receipt? what to abſtaine from all ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled and bloud? what to depend vpon a maintenance arbitrary, and vncertaine? what to ſpend our daies in a perpetuall pererrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as not onely the Apoſtles but the Prophets and Euangeliſts ſome ages after Chriſt? whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer would impoſe all theſe on vs, he ſhould ſurely make vs, not the Sonnes, but the ſlaues of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Gods Church neuer helde her ſelfe in ſuch ſeruile termes; yea Chriſt himſelfe gaue at firſt ſome precepts of this nature, which he reuerſed ere long: when hee ſent the Diſciples to preach, hee char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, take not gold, nor ſiluer, nor money in your girdles; afterwards

                  <hi>Iudas</hi> carried the bag.

Is it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that what he once commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhould be obſerued alwayes? The very next age to theſe Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Patriarcks, neither would nor durſt haue ſo much varied her rites, or augmented them if it had found it ſelfe tyed either to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or kind: As yet it was pure, chaſt, and (which was the ground of all) perſecuted. The Church of Rome diſtributed the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Bread: the Church of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria permitted the people to take it: the Churches of Affricke and Rome, mixed their holy wine with water; other colder regions dranke it pure. Some kneeled in

their prayers, others fell proſtrate; and ſome lifted vp eies, hands, feet towards heauen: ſome kept their Eaſter according to the Iewiſh vſe the foureteenth of March; the French (as <hi>Nicephorus)</hi> the eight of the Calends of Aprill, in a ſet ſolemnity: the Church of Rome the Sunday after the fourteenth Moone; which yet (as <hi>Socrates</hi> tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly writes) was neuer reſtrained by any Goſpell, by any Apoſtle. That Romiſh Victor ouercame the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world in this point, with too much rigour; whoſe cenſure ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the Aſian Churches was iuſtly cenſured, by <hi>Irenaeus.</hi> VVhat ſhould I ſpeake of their difference of facts? there can ſcarce bee more variety in daies, or meates.

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:26853:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of different ceremonies in all Churches, hath iuſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended their vnitie in faith. The French Diuines preach couered (vpon the ſame rule which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Corinthians to be vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerd) we bare: The Dutch ſit at the Sacrament, we kneele; Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua vſeth wafers, wee leauened bread; they common veſtures in Diuine ſeruice, we peculiar: each is free: no one doth either blames, or ouer rule others. I cannot but commend thoſe very Nouatian Biſhops (though it is a wonder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny precedent of peace ſhould fall from ſchiſmaticks) who meeting in Councel together, enacted that Canon of indifferency, when the Church was diſtracted with the differences of her Paſchall ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities; conluding how inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:26853:21"/>
this cauſe was to diſquiet the Church of Chriſt. Their owne iſſue (our Separatiſts) will needes be vnlike them in good; and ſtriue to a further diſtance from peace: whiles in a conceit not leſſe idle, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſcrupulous, they preſſe vs to an vniforme co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity in our faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Apoſtles.

Thoſe tooles which ſerue for the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, are not of vſe for the roof.

The ſame holds in this: Faith ſees more inward diffrence, then the eye ſees outward reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance. This point is not more high, then material: which that it may appeare, let me ſhew, what it is to be a Chriſtian: You that haue felt it, can ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d me with your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; and ſupply the defects of my diſcourſe. He is the liuing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the liuing God, where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity is both reſident &amp; worſhipped. The higheſt thing in a man is his owne ſpirit; but in a Chriſtian the ſpirit of God, which is the God of ſpirits. No grace is wanting in him;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:26853:24"/>
&amp; thoſe which there are, want not ſtirring vp. Both his hart &amp; his hands are cleane: All his outward purity flowes from within; neither doth he frame his ſoul to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fait good actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, but out of his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, commands and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them, in the ſight of God. Let vs begin with his beginning, and fetch the Chriſtian out of his nature, as another <hi>Abraham</hi> from his Chaldea: whiles the wordling liues and dies, in nature, out of God. The true conuert therfore after his wilde and ſecure courſes puts himſelfe (through the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of gods ſpirit) to ſchoole vnto the lawe; there he learnes what he ſhould haue done, what hee could not do, what he hath done, what he hath deſerued. Theſe leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, coſt him many a ſtripe, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:26853:25"/>
many a teare, and not more griefe then terror: For this ſharpe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter makes him feele what ſinne is, and what hell is: and in regard of both, what himſelfe is. When he hath well ſmarted vnder the whip of this ſeuere vſher, and is made vile enough in himſelfe, then is he led vp into the higher ſchoole of Chriſt, &amp; there taught the comfortable leſſons of grace; there he learnes, what belongs to a Sauiour, what one hee is, what he hath done, and for whom, how he became ours, we his; &amp; now fin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ding himſelfe in a true ſtate of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, of humilitie, of neede, of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, of fitnes for Chriſt, he brings home to himſelf al that he learns, and what he knowes he applies. His former Tutor he feared, this hee loueth; that ſhewed him his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:26853:25"/>
wounds, yea made them: this binds and heales them: that killed him, this ſhewes him life, and leades him to it. Now at once he hates himſelfe, defies Satan, truſts to Chriſt, makes account both of pardon and glory. This is his moſt precious Faith, whereby he appropriates, yea in groſſes Chriſt Ieſus to himſelfe: whence hee is iuſtified from his ſinnes, purified from his corruptions, eſtabliſhed in his reſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, comforted in his doubts, defended againſt tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ouercomes all his enemies. Which vertue, as it is moſt imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and moſt oppoſed, ſo carries the moſt care from the Chriſtian hart, that it be ſound, liuely grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Sound, not rotten, not hollow not preſumptuous: ſound in the Act; not a ſuperficiall conceit, but
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:26853:26"/>
a true, deepe, and ſenſible appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; an apprehenſion, not of the braine, but of the heart, and of the heart not approuing, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, but truſting, and repoſing Sound in the obiect, none but Chriſt: he knows, that no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in heauen can do him good, without this; The Angells can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: God will not: Ye beleeue in the Father, beleeue alſo in me.</p>
               <p>Liuely; for it cannot giue life, vnleſſe it haue life; the faith that is not fruitfull is dead: the fruits of faith are good workes: whether inward, within the roofe of the heart, as loue, awe, ſorrow, piety, zeale, ioy, and the reſt; or outward towards God, or our bretheren: obedience and ſeruice to the one: to the other reliefe and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: Theſe he beares in his time:

ſometimes all, but alwayes ſome.</p>
               <p>Growing: true faith cannot ſtand ſtill, but as it is fruitfull in workes, ſo it increaſeth in degrees; from a little ſeede it proues a large plant, reaching from earth to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and from one heauen to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: euery ſhowre and euery Sun addes ſomething to it. Neither is this grace euer ſolitary, but alwaies attended royallie: For hee that beleeues what a Sauiour hee hath, cannot but loue him: &amp; he that loues him cannot but hate what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer may diſpleaſe him: cannot but reioice in him, &amp; hope to inioy him, and deſire to enioy his hope, and contemne all thoſe vanities which he once deſired and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His minde now ſcorneth to grouell vpon earth, but ſoareth vp to the things aboue, where Chriſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:26853:27"/>
ſits at the right hand of God: and after it hath ſeene what is done in heauen, looks ſtrangely vpon al worldly things. He dare truſt his faith aboue his reaſon, and ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hath learned to weane his appetite from crauing much: Hee ſtands in awe of his owne conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and dare no more offend it, then not diſpleaſe himſelfe. Hee feares not his enemies, yet neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects them not; equally auoiding ſecurity, and timorouſneſſe: Hee ſees him that is inuiſible; and walks with him awfully, famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly. He knowes what he is borne to, and therefore digeſts the miſeries of his wardſhip, with patience: hee findes more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in his afflictions, then any worldling in pleaſures. And as hee hath theſe graces to comfort
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:26853:27"/>
him within, ſo hath hee the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to attend him without; ſpirits better then his owne, more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, more glorious; Theſe beare him in their armes, wake by his bed, keepe his ſoule while hee hath it and receiue it when it leaues him.

Ambroſe</hi> ſtiles it, the paune and image of our reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yea (as <hi>Baſil)</hi> the power of God to reſurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but (as <hi>Ignatius</hi> expoundes this phraſe aright) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in his death, wee are by baptiſme made partakers of his reſurrection. Baptiſme therefore without faith cannot ſaue a man,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:26853:32"/>
and by faith doth ſaue him; and faith without baptiſme (where it cannot be had; not where it may be had, and is contemned) may ſaue him: That Spirit which workes by meanes, will not bee tyed to meanes.</p>
               <p>Examples. Caſt your eyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that good theefe: good in his death, though in his life abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: hee was neuer waſhed in lordan, yet is receiued into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe; his ſoble was foule with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, and iniuſtice, yea bloody with murders: and yet being ſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted onely with the blood of his Sauiour, not with water of baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me; it is preſented glorious to God. I ſay nothing of the ſoules of Traian, and <hi>Falconella,</hi> meere heathens, liuing and dying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, without baptiſme:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:26853:33"/>
which yet their honeſt Legend reports deliuered from hell, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to heauen, not ſo much as ſcorched in Purgatorie: The one by the prayers of <hi>Gregory,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Tecla.</hi> VVhat partiality is this to deny that to the children of Chriſtians, which they grant to knowne, infidels? The promiſe is made to vs, and our ſeed; not to thoſe that are without the pale of the Church. Thoſe Innocents which were maſſacred for Chriſt, are by them canonized for Saints, and make one day in their Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar (each yeare) both holy, and diſmall; whereof yet ſcarce any liued to know water, none to know baptiſme. Yea, all Martyrs are here priuiledged; who are Chriſtened in their owne blood, inſtead of water: but where hath
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:26853:33"/>
God ſaide, All that die without baptiſme, ſhall die for euer, except Martyrs? why not, except belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers? It is faith that giues life to Martyrs; which if they ſhould want, their firſt death could not auoyde the ſecond. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doubted not to ſay, his <hi>Valentinian</hi> was baptiſed, becauſe hee deſired it; not becauſe he had it: he knew the minde of God, who accounts vs to haue what we vnfaynedly wiſh.</p>
               <p>Children cannot liue to deſire baptiſme, if their parents deſire it for them, why may not the deſire of others be theirs, as well as (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Auſtins</hi> opinion) the faith of othe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rs beleeuing, and the mouth of others confeſsing? In theſe caſes therefore of any ſoules but our owne, it is ſafe to ſuſpend,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:26853:34"/>
and dangerous to paſſe iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Secret things to God: Hee that made all ſoulesv, knowes what to doe with them, neither will make vs of counſaile: But if we define either way, the errors of charity are inoffenſiue. wee muſt honour good meanes and vſe them, and in their neceſſarie want depend vpon him, who can worke, beyond, without, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt meanes.</p>

the carnall heart preſuming: and what follows to the one, but his maſters ioy? what to the other, but the loſſe of his ſoule? Bleſſed bee that God which hath giuen you an heart to fore thinke this, and in this dry, and dead age, a will to honour him with his own: and to credit his Goſpell, with your beneficence; Lo we are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayded with barrenneſſe: your name hath beene publikly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to theſe challenges, as in whom it ſhall be ſeene, that the truth hath friends that can giue. I neither diſtruſt, nor perſwade you, whoſe reſolutions are happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed on purpoſes of good: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giue mee leaue to haſten your pace a little, and to excite your Chriſtian forwardneſſe, to begin ſpeedily, what you haue long and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:26853:48"/>
conſtantly vowed. You would not but doe good; why not now? I ſpeake boldly, the more ſpeede, the more comfort: Neither the times are in our diſpoſing, nor our ſelues: if God had ſet vs a day, and made our wealth inſeparable, there were no danger in delaying; now our vncertainty either muſt quicken vs, or may deceiue vs. How many haue meant wel, and done nothing, and loſt their crowne with lingring? whoſe deſtinies haue preuented their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and haue made their good motions the wards of their execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, not without miſerable ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe: to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that they wold haue done good, is not ſo great a praiſe, as it is a diſhonor that they might haue done it: their wracks are our warnings, we are equally mortal,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:26853:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
equally fickle. Why haue you this reſpite of liuing, but to preuent the imperious neceſſity of death? it is a woful and remedileſſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that the end of our dayes hath ouer-runne the beginning of our good workes. Early benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence hath no danger, many ioies: for the conſcience of good done, the prayers and bleſsings of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, the gratulations of the Saints, are as ſo many perpetuall comforters, which can make our life pleaſant, and our death happy our euill dayes good, and our good better. All theſe are loſt with delay, few and cold are the prayers for him that may giue: &amp; in lieu, our good purpoſes fore flowed, are become our tormenters vpon our dead-bed. Little difference is betwixt good differred, and euill
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:26853:49"/>
done: Good was meant, who hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it, will our conſcience ſay? there was time enough, meanes enough, neede enough, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered? Did feare of enuy, diſtruſt of want? Alas what bugs are theſe to fright men from heauen? As if the enuy of keeping, were leſſe then of beſtowing: As if God were not as good a debtor, as a gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: he that giues to the poore lendes to God, ſaith wiſe <hi>Salomon;</hi> If hee freely giue vs what wee may lend, and grace to giue; will he not much more pay vs what wee haue lent; and giue vs becauſe wee haue giuen? That is his bounty, this his iuſtice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Oh happy is that man that may be a creditor to his maker: Heauen and earth, ſhall be empty before he ſhall want a royall pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If wee dare not truſt God
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:26853:50"/>
whiles we liue, how dare we truſt men when we are dead? Men that are ſtill deceitfull, and light vpon the ballance, light of truth, heauy of ſelfe-loue. How many execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors haue proued the executioners of honeſt wills? how many haue our eies ſeen, that after moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full choiſe of truſtie guardians, haue had their children and goods ſo diſpoſed, as if the parents ſoule could returne to ſee it, I doubt whether it could be happy? How rare is that man that prefers not himſelfe to his dead friend? profit to truth? that will take no vantage of the impoſsibility of account? What euer therefore men either ſhew, or promiſe, happy is that man that may bee his owne audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, ſuperuiſor, executor. As you loue God and your ſelfe, be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:26853:50"/>
of being happie too ſoone. I am not worthy to giue ſo bolde aduice, let the wiſe ſonne of <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rach</hi> ſpeake for me. Do good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou die, and according to thine ability ſtretch out thine hands, and giue: Defraud not thy ſelfe of thy good day; and let not the portion of thy good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ouerpaſſe thee: Shalt thou not leaue thy trauels to another, and thy labours to them that will deuide thine heritage? Or let a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then he, <hi>Salomon:</hi> Say not, to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow I will giue, if thou now haue it: for thou knoweſt not what a day will bring forth. It hath beene an old rule of liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, he giues twiſe that giues quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas ſlow benefites argue vnchearefulneſſe, and loſe their worth. Who lingers his receits is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:26853:51"/>
condemned as vnthriftie: he that knoweth both, ſaith, it is better to giue, then to receiue. If we be of the ſame ſpirit, why are we haſty in the worſe, and ſlacke in the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? Suffer your ſelfe therfore good Sir, for Gods ſake, for the Goſpels ſake, for the Churches ſake, for your ſoules ſake, to bee ſtirred vp by thoſe poore lines, to a reſolute and ſpeedy performing of your worthy intentions: and take this as a louing inuitation ſent from heauen, by an vnworthie meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

Now, when ſleepe is rather driuen away, then leaues mee; I would euer awake with God; my firſt thoughts are for him, who hath made the night for reſt, and the day for trauell: and as he giues, ſo bleſſes both. If my heart be earely ſeaſoned with his preſence, it will ſauour of him all day after.

After this, out of no ouer-great variety, J call forth thoſe, which may beſt fit my occaſions; wherein, I am not too ſcrupulous of age: Somtimes I put my ſelfe to Schoole, to one of thoſe Auncients, whom the Church hath honoured with the name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; whoſe Volumes, I confeſſe, not to open, without a ſecret reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their holineſſe, and grauitie: Sometimes, to thoſe later Doctours, which want nothing but age to make them claſsicall: Alwayes to GODS

One while mine eyes are buſied, another while my hand, &amp; ſometimes my minde takes the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from them both: Wherein, I would imitate the skilfulleſt Cookes, which make the beſt diſhes with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold mixtures: one houre is ſpent in

Neither know I whether it workes or playes in theſe thoughts: I am ſure no ſport hath more pleaſure, no work more vſe: Only the decay of a weake body, makes me thinke theſe delights inſenſibly laborious. Thus could I all day, (as Ringers vſe) make my ſelfe Muſicke with chaunges, and complain ſooner of the day for ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, then of the buſineſſe for toyle; were it not that this faint moniter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupts me ſtil in the midſt of my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie pleaſures, and inforces me both to reſpite &amp; repaſt I muſt yeeld to both;

               <p>After my latter meale, my thoughts are ſlight, onely my memorie may be charged with her Taske, of recalling what was committed to her cuſtodie in the day, and my heart is buſie in examining mine hands and mouth, &amp; all other ſences of that dayes behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.

Vnder this head therefore, there is ſure remedie againſt ſinne, by looking vpwardes, backwards, into our ſelues, forwards.

Beſides hundreds of this kind, there are hereſies in acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, contrary to thoſe fundamentall practiſes which God requires of his: As prohibitions of Scriptures to the Laity: Preſcriptions of deuotion in vnknowne tongues: Tying, the effect of Sacraments and Prayers to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall worke: Adoration of Angels,

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his ſpouſe to an army with ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: as order is to an army, ſo is Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline to the Church: if the troups be not well marſhalled in their ſeuerall ranks, &amp; moue not forward, acording to the diſcipline of warre, it is an army ſtil: co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fuſion may hinder their ſucces, it cannot bereaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their name: it is, as beautiful proportio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the body, an hedge to a vineyard, a wal to a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, an hem to a garment, ſeeling to an houſe.

Your Citty hath a Bricke-wall indeede, but it ſhould haue one of hewen ſtone; your Vineyard is hedged, but it ſhould be paled &amp; ditched: while they cauill at what wee want, wee thanke God for what wee haue; and ſo much we haue, in ſpight of all detraction, as makes vs both a true Church, and a worthy one.</p>
               <p>But the mayn quarrel is againſt our Miniſtery, and forme of worſhip: let theſe be examined; this is the Circle of their cenſure.

Are we all vnlearned, vnſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient? Not a man that knowes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the word aright? As <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthes,</hi> is it ſo that there is not one wiſe man amongeſt vs? No man vvill affirm it: ſome of them haue cenſured our exceſſe in ſome knowledge; none, our defect in all: What then? Haue we not a true deſire to do faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to God and his Church? No zeal for Gods glory? Who hath beene in our harts to ſee this? Who dare vſurp vpon God, &amp; condemn our thoughts? Yea, we appeale to that only Iudge of harts, whether he hath not giuen vs a ſincere longing for the good of his <hi>Syon:</hi> he ſhall make the thoughts of al hearts manifeſt: and then ſhall euerie man haue praiſe of God: if then wee haue both ability and will to do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good: our inward calling (which is the mayne poynt) is good and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect:

Giue a childe ſome painted Babe; he ioyes in it at firſt ſight: and for ſome daies wil not abide it out of his hand or bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; but when hee hath ſated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the newe pleaſure of that gueſt, hee now (after a while) caſts it into Corners, forgets it, and can look vpon it, with no care: Thus do we by ours. Their firſt times finde vs not more fond, then carefull: we doe not more follow them with our loue, then ply them with inſtruction: When this delight beginnes to grow ſtale, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to grow negligent. Nothing that I know can be faulted in the ordering
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:26853:104"/>
of Child-hood, but indulgence Foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Mothers, admit of Tutors, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre rods? Theſe, while they deſire their Children may learne, but not ſmart, as is ſayde of Apes, kill theyr young ones with loue; for what can worke vpon that age, but feare? And what feare without correction? Now at laſt, with what meaſure of Learning their owne wil would vouchſafe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, they are too earely ſent to the Common Nurſeries of Knowledge; There (vnleſſe they fal vnder carefull tuition) they ſtudy in ieſt, and play in earneſt. In ſuch vniuerſal meanes of Learning, all cannot fal beſides them; what their company, what their recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation would either inſtil or permit, they bring home to their gladde pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. Thence are they tranſplanted to the Collegiate Jnnes of our common Lawes: and there too manie learne
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:26853:105"/>
to be lawleſſe, and to forget their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer little. <hi>Paules</hi> is their <hi>VVeſtminster,</hi> their Study, an Ordinary, or Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, or Dauncing Schoole; &amp; ſome <hi>Lambert</hi> their <hi>Polydon.</hi> And now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they haue (not without much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence) learned faſhions and licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, they returne home, full of welcomes and gratulations. By this time ſome bloſſomes of youth appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in their face, admoniſh their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to ſeeke them ſome ſeaſonable match; Wherein the Father inquires for Wealth, the Sonne for Beautie, perhappes the Mother for parentage, ſcarce any for Vertue, for Religion. Thus ſetled, What is their care, theyr diſcourſe; yea, their Trade, but ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Hound, or an Hawke? And it is wel, if no woorſe: And now, they ſo liue, as if they had forgotten that there were Bookes: Learning is for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:26853:105"/>
Prieſts, and Pedants; For Gentlemen, pleaſure. Oh! that eyther wealth, or wit ſhould bee caſt away thus baſely: That euer Reaſon ſhould growe ſo debauched, as to thinke any thinge more worthy then knowledge: with what ſhame and emulation may wee looke vpon other Nations (whoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh faſhions we can take vppe in the Channelles, neglecting their immita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble examples) and with what ſcorn do they looke vpon vs? They haue their ſolemne Academies for all thoſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, which may accompliſh Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: from which they returne richly furniſhed, both for action and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. They account knowledge and ability of diſcourſe as eſſential to great neſſe, as bloud: neither are they more aboue the vulgar in byrth, then in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding: They trauel with iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and return with experience: ſo
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:26853:106"/>
do they followe the excerciſes of the body, that they neglect not the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the mind. From hence growes ciuility, and power, to mannage af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres either of Iuſtice or State; From hence incouragement to learning, &amp; reuerence from inferiors.

               <p>Amongſt them, the ſons of Nobles ſcorne not, either Marchandiſe, or learned profeſsions; and hate nothing ſo much, as to do nothing: I ſhame &amp; hate to thinke, that our gallants hold there can be no diſparagement, but in honeſt callings.
