            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Pariſhioner of mine, an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
<hi>Plain-man,</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
upon by the Importunity

without <hi>Infallibility</hi> there is no

            <p>The <hi>Plain-man,</hi> with whom
<hi>Saying</hi> and <hi>Doing</hi> are two things,
very bluntly demands; How it
appears that the Church of Rome

            </p>
            <q>
               <p>By the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> we
do not mean the particular Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oceſs
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Church or Aſſembly, but
the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> ſpread over
the face of the whole World,
in Communion with the <hi>Biſhop</hi>

of the Church of Chriſt.</p>

            </q>
            <p>In this Deſcription here are
<hi>three</hi> Things ſuppoſed.</p>
            <p>1. That the Church of Rome is
the Catholic Church.</p>
            <p>2. That the Biſhop of Rome is the
Supream Paſtor of the Church of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>3. That the Catholick Church,
ſpread over the face of the whole
World, is in Communion with the
Biſhop of Rome.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Two</hi> former are deny'd,
therefore I expect their Proof.
And the <hi>Third</hi> muſt not be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
without its due explication.</p>
            <p>1. As to the firſt, the <hi>Plain-man</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:48030:5"/>
hath told him; That though it is
the noted <q>miſtake of ſome wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to call the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
the Church <hi>Catholic</hi> (and then
to apply all the Promiſes of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and Preſervation to her
as ſuch) yet this is only their
own confident Suppoſal, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the leaſt manner of
Proof. <bibl>[<hi>Plain-mans Reply</hi> p. 10.]</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Being thus admoniſhed, why
did not the Prieſt confirm this
Propoſition wherein his Cauſe is
ſo much concern'd? Nay! Why
did he thus prevaricate in omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to do it, when ſo fair an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
was offer'd?</p>
            <p>For; Several Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
(of which more anon) being
cited by the Miſſioner, To prove
the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the Church of

            <q>

            <p>This Demand was rational and

            <p>Whoever ſhall pretend to

            <p>1. The nature of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>

            <p>As to the nature of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an

            <p>And this Church is ſtiled <hi>Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick</hi>
in theſe <hi>Two</hi> reſpects.</p>
            <p>1. With reſpect to the Perſons
who make this Profeſſion. <hi>Who are
not now confined to one Nation,
or limited to one People, as the</hi>
Jewiſh <hi>Church was.</hi> But in every
Nation, he that feareth God, and
worketh Righteouſneſs, is accepted
with him. <hi>Hence St.</hi> Auguſtine.
[Ep. 170.] <hi>tells us.</hi> The Church is
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48030:6"/>
called CATHOLIC, becauſe it
is ſpread throughout the whole
World.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>With reſpect to the Faith which

In which ſenſe <hi>Particular</hi> Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,
and the Biſhops of thoſe
Churches, in antient Writings,
are often ſtiled <hi>Catholic;</hi> in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to Hereticks and Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</p>
            <p>Now in whether of theſe <hi>Two</hi>
reſpects will this Miſſioner pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend,
that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is
the Catholic Church?</p>
            <p>1. Will he affirm that ſhe is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic
<hi>with reſpect to the Perſons
who make this Profeſſion?</hi> Then,
ſhe is the whole Church. Then,
there is no other Church but the
<hi>Roman</hi> (taking in thoſe other
Churches which ſubmit to her Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,)
In ſhort; Then the
Roman-Catholics <hi>alone</hi> do make
Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, and
there are no other Chriſtians in
the World but Papiſts.</p>
            <p>If this be his meaning, for his
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48030:7"/>
conviction, let me then deſire him
to reſolve me.</p>
            <p>When any Member of the
Church of <hi>England</hi> is reconciled,
as they phraſe it, to the Church
of <hi>Rome;</hi> Was that Perſon, before
his Reconciliation, a Member of
the Church of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or was he
not? Was he a Chriſtian, or was
he not? If not Why then do they
not admit him into the Church
by Baptiſm?</p>
            <p>But if this Miſſioner is forced to
grant; That ſuch a Convert was
a Chriſtian, and a Member of the
Church of Chriſt even before he
was a Roman-Catholic; Then,
there are other Chriſtians beſides
Papiſts; and there are other
Churches beſides the Roman.
Then the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not
the <hi>Whole</hi> Church; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
in this firſt ſenſe of the
wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d, is not the <hi>Catholic</hi> Church.
But</p>
            <p>2. Will this Miſſioner pretend,
That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the
<hi>Catholic</hi> Church, in the other
notion of the word, <hi>i. e. Sound</hi>
and <hi>Orthodox?</hi>
            </p>

If this be his Project 'tis then
expected, that he prepare us an
Anſwer to that larg Bill of Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which the Reformed Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have prefer'd againſt her.
And when he ſhall have given us
Satisfaction, as to all thoſe Errors
and Corruptions with which ſhe
is charged; As for inſtance <hi>The
Sacrifice of the Maſs; Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
Half-Communion, Prayers
in an unknown Tongue, Worſhip of
Images, Invocation of Saints, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory
and Prayers for the Dead,</hi>
&amp;c. Then, and not till then, we
may grant; That the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is <hi>Catholic</hi> in this <hi>Second</hi>
ſenſe of the word: And that ſhe
is a <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>And ſo I leave him to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
(which he may prepare at
his leaſure) and proceed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
his <hi>Second</hi> Suppoſition, <hi>viz:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. That the Biſhop of Rome is the
Supream Paſtor of the Church of
Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is the Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Faith. And yet
there is not one word of it in the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48030:8"/>
Apoſtles Creed, which is the Sum
of the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith. No nor
yet in the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> out of
which that Creed was taken.</p>
            <p>That <hi>de facto</hi> this Supremacy
was not granted to the Biſhops of
<hi>Rome,</hi> in the <hi>firſt</hi> and pureſt Ages
of the Church, but that their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments
were ſtill oppoſed;
is moſt evidently ſhewed by the
Learnd <hi>Dr. Cave,</hi> in <hi>A Diſſertati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
concerning the Government of the
Ancient Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the <hi>Britannick</hi> Churches
were ever exempted from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Juriſdiction for the firſt
<hi>Six Hundred</hi> Years, and ſo ought
to continue (if this Miſſioner will
be ſo modeſt as to hearken to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction)
the renowned Arch-Biſhop
<hi>Bramhal</hi> hath undeniably
proved.</p>
            <p>And therefore, if proſperous
Uſurpation may be called in
Queſtion, I would ask <hi>Quo jure?</hi>
This Supremacy of the Pope
whence was it? <hi>from Heaven or of
Men?</hi> Who gave him this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
to Rule and Govern the
whole Church of Chriſt? ch</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:48030:8"/>
Their uſual pretence for ſuch
exorbitant Power, is known to be
this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That our Bleſſed Saviour, before
his Aſcenſion, did conſtitute <hi>St.</hi> Peter
his Vicar, Deputy and Vicegerent:
and as ſuch gave him a Monarchical
Supremacy and Juriſdiction over the
reſt of the Apoſtles, and the whole
Church. The which Supremacy was
not Perſonal and Temporary, to ceaſe
with his Perſon (as the Apoſtleſhip
did) but was to be transfer'd to his
Succeſſor. The which Succeſſor
(<hi>ſay they</hi>) is the Biſhop of Rome.</p>
            <p>This is their Plea. In confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of which theſe following
Propoſitions muſt be eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>1. That St. <hi>Peter</hi> had a Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
over the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>2. That this Primacy did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
a Supremacy of Power, and
Dominion or Juriſdiction over
the Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>3. That St. <hi>Peters</hi> Primacy
with its Rights and Prerogatives
was not Perſonal, but derivable,
to his Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>4. That St. <hi>Peter</hi> was Biſhop
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48030:9"/>
of <hi>Rome,</hi> and continued till his
Death in poſſeſſion of that Office.</p>
            <p>5. That the Biſhops of <hi>Rome,</hi>
as Succeſſors of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Gods inſtitution and by
original Right derived thence)
ſhould have an Univerſal Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy
and Juriſdiction over the
Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>6. That in fact the <hi>Roman</hi>
Biſhops continually from St. <hi>Peters</hi>
time have enjoyed and excerciſed
this Sovereign Power.</p>
            <p>7. That this Power is inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectible
and unalterable.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Pillars of the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> Cauſe. And therefore if
this Miſſioner will be ſhewing his
ſkill, let him practiſe upon theſe
Points. But when he attempts
it he ſhall find to his coſt, that
the Learned Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi> hath
examined them before him: In
his excellent <hi>Treatiſe</hi> of the <hi>Pope's
Supremacy.</hi> To which I refer
him.</p>
            <p>So much for that. I am next
to examined his <hi>Third</hi> Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:48030:9"/>
3. That the Catholic Church,
ſpread over the face of the whole
world, is in Communion with the
Biſhop of Rome.</p>
            <p>To determine this matter, we
muſt conſider the nature of
Church-Communion. Of which
briefly thus.</p>
            <p>Church-Communion, to ſpeak
properly, doth chiefly reſpect the
Univerſal Church. For to be in
Communion with the Church, it
is to be a member of the <hi>Church
Catholick;</hi> in plain terms it is to
be a Chriſtian; as we were made
by Baptiſm, the Seal of the New
Covenant. Into which Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
being thus admitted, we are
united to the whole Church.
And by virtue of this union, as
Church-Members, have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Right to all Church-Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
and Bleſſings, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
obligation to all Church-Offices
and Duties.</p>
            <p>The which Communion (or
Communication) in Religious
Duties, though it be limited and
reſtrained, in the uſe and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48030:10"/>
of it, to particular Churches
and Congregations (for all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
in the world cannot meet
together) yet all ſuch Acts of
Worſhip (as <hi>Prayers, Sacraments,
Hearing the word, &amp;c.</hi>) are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by us, as Members of the
Catholic Church. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are obliged to Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
in theſe Duties, not only
with our own National Church but
alſo, if our occaſions do call us
abroad, with any other Church
in the world: Provided that we
may do it upon Catholic Terms
and Conditions.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premiſed, we are
now prepared to Determine,
How far the Catholic Church,
ſpread over the face of the whole
world, is in Communion with
the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which will eaſily be decided by
obſerving. That there is a <hi>Two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold</hi>
Communion.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Of</hi> Co-ordination <hi>or</hi> Friendſhip.</p>
            <p>2. Subordination <hi>or</hi> Subjection.</p>
            <p>As to the former we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affirm; All the Churches in
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48030:10"/>
the world are thus far in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi>
That they may own him for a
Chriſtian Biſhop; as acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> to
be a true Church, though indeed a
very corrupt Church. And if
they do not Communicate fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with him, it is his own
fault.</p>
            <p>But this it it ſeems will not
ſatisfie this Miſſioner: Who
moſt vainly fancy's that there
is no Communion without Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.
And that no Church
can be in Communion with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> without ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
to her Authority.</p>
            <p>When therefore it is affirmed;
That the Catholic Church is thus
Subject to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome:</hi>
If this Miſſioner pleads; That
<hi>de facto</hi> all other Churches are
actually thus Subject; we then
deny it; for the greater part of
Chriſtendom doth proteſt againſt
the Errors, and oppoſe the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpations
of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome.</hi>
But if he contends that <hi>de jure</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48030:11"/>
they ought ſo to be, and that this
Subjection is their Duty, then
let him prove it.</p>
            <p>What I have now ſaid, is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to convince this Miſſioner,
of his miſtaken Notion of the
<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> Which if he
thinks fit to Defend, he muſt
then prove.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>That the Church of Rome is
the Catholic Church.</hi> i.e. He muſt
convince us, Either (1.) That ſhe
is the <hi>whole</hi> Church, and that
there is no other Church beſides
her; or elſe (2.) That ſhe is the
only <hi>true</hi> and <hi>Orthodox</hi> Church.</p>
            <p>2. That the Biſhop of Rome is
the Supream Paſtor of the Church
of Chriſt. <hi>Which when he hath
proved, I ſhall then grant him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. That the Catholic Church
ſpread over the face of the whole
world, is in Communion with <hi>i. e.
is Subject to</hi> the Biſhop of Rome.</p>
            <p>And here ſhould I now hold
my Pen, and proceed no further
in my Reflections, I have given
this Miſſioner work enough.</p>
            <p>But if he will be ſo modeſt as
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48030:11"/>
to confeſs his miſtake, I'le help
him to a better Definition of the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and leſs liable
to exception.</p>
            <p>
               <q>By the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, we do
not underſtand the particular
Dioceſs of <hi>Rome;</hi> but we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand,
that vaſtly extended
Community of Chriſtians which
hold Communion with the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſubmitting
themſelves to the Biſhop of
<hi>Rome</hi> as to their Head; ſo that
whatſoever he Decrees with a
General Council they embrace
as the Definition of the true
Church, which they hold In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible.

and <hi>Duration,</hi> but an <hi>unerring
Direction</hi> in neceſſary points of

Church (<hi>of Rome</hi>) is infallible,
we mean; that Almighty God
hath given an Authoritative
Power to the Church (of <hi>Rome</hi>)
to declare, in caſe of Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
which is the <hi>Faith which
was once delivered to the Saints,</hi>
Jude 3. So that in caſe of Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences
about the ſenſe
of <hi>Scripture,</hi> or any divinely
revealed Truths, the Church
(of <hi>Rome</hi>) is to decide the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
and end the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie.
And to perform this,
we ſay, ſhe is aſſiſted by the
Spirit of Almighty God, who,
as he hath ordained her for our
Direction, ſo he ſecures her
from erring whilſt ſhe Directs.
Which aſſiſtance we call Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

               <q>3. From whence had ſhe [<hi>the

            </p>
            <p>To which he gives us this

            <p>
               <q>You muſt not think that the
Church [of <hi>Rome</hi>] has this
power from her ſelf; for we
know that all men may fail;
All Communities and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
are ſubject to error and
miſtakes (<hi>where then is the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility

But ſhe has it from God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>This he tells us, is evident

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far I do readily Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe;
That if the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> is Infallible, She muſt have
this Priviledg from God himſelf.
And if there is ſuch a Promiſe of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48030:13"/>
unerring Guidance it muſt be
found in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Let it therefore appear from

and I ſhall then Diſpute no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,

            <p>Now to prove this <hi>Infallibility,</hi>
this Miſſioner hath cited <hi>Twenty</hi>
Places of Scripture, which the
<hi>Queſtion</hi> of <hi>Queſtions</hi> tells him are
in the Bible. But how little they
are to his purpoſe, I do thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to convince him, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining
them in their order.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Firſt</hi> Text is that noted
Place, <hi>Deut. 17. 8. &amp;c.</hi> From whence
the Argument is this. <hi>The Jewiſh
Church was Infallible,</hi> Therefore
<hi>The Church of Rome is Infallible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I thus Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Both Propoſitions, <hi>Antecedent</hi>

From what Circumſtance in

ſuch a Concluſion?</p>
            <p>Was it 1. Becauſe in that

The Sentence of the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi>
whereby our Bleſſed Saviour was
condemned as a Blaſphemer, was
it a juſt and Legal Sentence, or
was it not? If not. Then the
Jewiſh Church, which pronounced
it, was not Infallible. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
this Argument, ſo
triumphantly repeated, is utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
loſt.</p>
            <p>But if this Miſſioner dares pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend;</p>
            <p>That the Sentence of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrim</hi>
was a Legal Sentence; and
that the Holy Jeſus was juſtly
condemn'd as a Blaſphemer; let
him take heed; leaſt contending
for <hi>Infallibility;</hi> he forfeits his
<hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, for Arguments ſake,
ſuppoſe it were granted; That
the <hi>Jewiſh Church was Infallible;</hi>
Muſt it thence be inferr'd; That
the Chriſtian Church hath the

think's this Miſſioner. For to
<hi>her</hi> hath been given <hi>a Covenant
with better Promiſes.</hi> True! But
was <hi>Infallibility</hi> any of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes?
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48030:14"/>
This ought not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

            <p>But now let it be further

            <p>Thats granted. God will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly

            <p>Now all extraordinary ways
being ceaſed, the Divine wiſdom
ordinarily doth inſtruct us only

               <hi>a more ſure word of Prophecy</hi> then

            <p>

            <p>But now if the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
for inſtance, ſhall leave this <hi>good
old way</hi> of Truth, to wander in
By-paths of her own; If ſhe
ſhall neglect, vilify and forſake
the Holy Scriptures, to follow
her own blind Traditions; 'Tis
not her confidence that ſhe is in

of the <hi>Ditch,</hi> or ſecure her from

            <p>
               <hi>He tells us moreover,</hi> 
               <q>That
God will not be wroth with his

all her Children ſhall be taught of
the Lord, <hi>That</hi> ſhe ſhall be esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed

ſhall gather together against

that</hi> every Tongue that ſhall riſe

            </p>
            <p>Furthermore he tells us, <q>that
God hath made a Covenant
with his Church. That <hi>his
Spirit ſhall be upon her, and his
words which he hath put into her

mouth, nor out of the mouth
of her ſeed, nor out of the

            <p>What hath the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>
to do with theſe Scriptures? Did
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ever hear the
Sermons and Diſcourſes of our
Bleſſed Saviour? If not. How can
they be brought to her Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance?
Is it not therefore evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
from ſeveral Paſſages in

Promiſes do belong only to the
Apoſtles, who perſonally conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with our Saviour. As being
made to thoſe, <hi>To whom he had

               <p>YOu ſay, Sir, <hi>the Church is my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Guide.</hi> Pray, what do
you mean by this <hi>Church?</hi> Is it, in
your Language, the <hi>Teaching</hi>
Church, or the <hi>Learning</hi> part of
the Church? <hi>p.</hi> 14. Or, in more
proper Terms, Is it the Church
<hi>Repreſentative,</hi> or the Church <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive?</hi>
ſure not the Church <hi>Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſive.</hi>
For that comprehends e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<hi>private</hi> Chriſtian, even the
moſt ordinary Mechanick. <hi>And
in caſe of Differences about the ſenſe
of Scripture, or any Divinely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed
Truths,</hi> I hope theſe are no
fit Perſons <hi>to decide the Difference,

               <bibl>[Miſſioners Anſwer. <hi>p.</hi> 10.]</bibl>
               <p>It remains therefore, That the
Church <hi>Repreſentative</hi> is this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Guide. And then our next
thought is to inquire; who this
infallible Repreſentative is. And
though you aſſured the <hi>Plain-man,</hi>
That he <q>may ſecurely rely upon
what the Church teacheth,
without troubling himſelf to
ſearch whether this or that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Perſon in her be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

or no; <bibl>[<hi>pag.</hi> 16.]</bibl>
                  </q> yet in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
to your ſelf you are forced
to Declare;</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That a General Council, the
Supream Court of Judicature, is
the Legal Infallible Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
of the Church. <hi>p.</hi> 18. So
that whether the Controverſie
be about the ſenſe of Scripture,
or about the Canon of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
there muſt be a Living Judg
to determine it; and this I ſay,
is the Church in her General
Councils, in which ſhe is ſecured
from Error. <bibl>

                  </q>

               <p>And now why was not this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
made at the firſt?
When the <hi>Plain-man</hi> deſired you to
tell him diſtinctly; who is this
Infallible Guide, why did you not
then roundly and boldly Anſwer;
<hi>I tell you</hi> diſtinctly <hi>A General
Council is my Infallible Guide?</hi>
Why ſuch ſhuffling and ſhifting in
ſo plain a matter?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doth not this evidently confirm

expreſſed with ſuch diffidence

               <p>[Plain-mans Reply. p. 8.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>However at laſt you have taken
the courage to Declare;</hi> That a
General Council is this Living In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Judg, this unerring Guide.</p>
               <p>The truth of which pretence I
do thus briefly examine.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In St.</hi> Mathew's <hi>Goſpel the</hi>
Plain-man <hi>finds theſe words.</hi> And
he took the Cup, and gave thanks,
and gave it to them, ſaying, Drink
ye ALL of it, <hi>Math.</hi> 26, 27.</p>
               <p>This Text, he obſerves, is
controverted betwixt the two
Churches, and the ſenſe of it
Diſputed.</p>
               <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> (in
obedience to that laſt precept of
her Lord, <hi>Teaching them to obſerve
all things whatſoever I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
you,</hi> (Math. 28. 20.) hath
thus Determined.</p>
               <p>The Cup of the Lord is not to
be denied to the Lay-people: For
both the parts of the Lords Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by Chriſts ordinance and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48030:22"/>
commandment, ought to be miniſtred
to all Chriſtian men alike. <hi>ART.</hi> 30.</p>
               <p>But the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (in
direct oppoſition to our Lords
Command) hath thus Decreed, in
her Councils of <hi>Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Trent.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Although our Redeemer hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
the Sacrament in his laſt
Supper, and hath delivered unto the
Apostles in both kinds. <hi>Yet,</hi> The
Synod hath decreed, That it ſhould
be received for a Law, that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
be adminſtred in one kind.
<hi>And</hi> whoſoever ſhall ſay, That by
the command of God, all the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ought to receive in both kinds;
Let him be accurſed. <hi>Concil. Conſt.</hi>
Seſſ. 13. <hi>Concil. Trident.</hi> Seſſ. 21.
Cap. 2. 3. Can. 1.</p>
               <p>Now my <hi>Plain-man</hi> deſires to
be inſtructed, whether Church
is in the right? The Church of
<hi>England</hi> which gives the Cup to
Lay-people; or the Church of
<hi>Rome</hi> which denies it. If his
Reaſon might be Judge, he is
then convinced; that the Church
of <hi>England</hi> is Orthodox, and holds
the truth in this matter. For he
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48030:23"/>
thinks it very reaſonable, in the
Adminiſtration of a Sacrament,
to obſerve the Inſtitution of our
Bleſſed Saviour.</p>
               <p>But you <hi>Miſſioners</hi> do tell him,
he muſt not judg by Reaſon, but
muſt ſubmit to the Authority of
an infallible Judge. Well! 'tis
now hoped at laſt we ſhall bring
the matter to a ſhort iſſue.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>You have declared;</hi> That
whether the Controverſie be about
the ſenſe of Scripture, or about the
Canon of a Council, there muſt be
a living Judg to determine it;
and this you ſay is a General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
<bibl>[<hi>Miſſioners Anſwer.</hi> p. 19.]</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I demand therefore, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
me diſtinctly. Is there any
General Council actually now
ſitting, which (by its infallible
Authority) may explain this
Text and determine theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted
Canons, of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
of <hi>Constance</hi> and <hi>Trent?</hi> If
there is ſuch a Council, pray
where is it to be found? in what
part of the world are the Fathers
aſſembled? But if there is no
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48030:23"/>
ſuch Council. Then there is
no Living infallible Judg, to
Determine this Controverſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Half-Communion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I am not able to conjecture,
what you can poſſibly ſay to this,
unleſs you will be ſo dull as to
repeat your own words,</hi> viz.
<q>
                     <hi>That as</hi> there is not any General
Council actually now ſitting, to
end our Controverſies, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
needs there any, the Church
having ſo fully expreſſed her ſelf
in the Canons and Definitions of
her preceeding Councils, and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
in that of <hi>Trent.</hi> 
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>p.</hi> 19.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay, to urge this would be
dull and impertinent. For you
your ſelf have confeſſed; That
<q>theſe Canons of preceeding
Councils are but mere Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and a mere Writing can be
no Judg though indeed it may
be a Rule. So that theſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
of former Councils being
mere Writings they cannot, in
caſe of a Controverſie ariſing
about their ſenſe, determine
themſelves and explain their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48030:24"/>
own meaning. So that in ſuch a caſe as this,
Where there is a Controverſie about the
Canon of a Council, there muſt be a Living
Judg, which you ſay, is a General Council.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now, Sir, to make Application. Here is a
Canon of the Council of Trent [<hi>Seſſ. 21. Can.</hi>
1.] That is controverted, and the ſenſe of it
Diſputed. I do again beg of you to reſolve
me; Where is this Living Judg, this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council, to determine this Canon? If
there is none; Then the evidence of Truth
doth conſtrain me to pronounce; That
there is no Living Infallible Judg in the
preſent Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe Things are plain and convincing,
and admit of no Reply. But ſome men, I
obſerve, are not to be ſilenced. Theſe
Miſſioners are ſo trained up, even from
their Childhood, in the habit of wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
(which they call Diſputing) that they
will hold the Concluſion in ſpight of all
Premiſſes. And you, Sir, for your part
will be ſtill ſaying ſomething, though no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to the purpoſe. For thus you go on.</p>
               <p>You have granted; That when there
is a Controverſie about the Canon of a
Council, there muſt then be a living Judg
to determine it: another Council muſt be
called. <q>But, <hi>ſay you,</hi> pray take notice,
that we have no ſuch Controverſie at
preſent. All perſons are agreed as to
what this Church hath defined, and the
ſenſe of her Canons is not Controverted.
We ſee it in her Practice, we read it in
her Catechiſms, we hear it from her
Paſtors, &amp;c. <bibl>
                        <hi>p.</hi> 20</bibl>

That this <hi>3d</hi> Canon of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil

               <p>I could deſcend to the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi>

now before us. Where indeed the
Queſtion is not <hi>de facto,</hi> whether you
deny the Cup to Lay-people? For <hi>we ſee
it in your Practice, we read it in your
Catechiſms, we hear it from your Paſtors.</hi>
But the Queſtion is <hi>de jure.</hi> Whether the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath Authority, to null
and contradict the Inſtitution of our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not miſtaken, hath
not actually erred, and ſo loſt her Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?
For, if in this or any other
inſtance, we can prove that ſhe hath actually
erred, 'tis too late to pretend that ſhe is
Infallible. This is the point wherein my

               <p>And now, where is this living Judg,
this General Council actually now ſitting

<hi>actually now ſitting;</hi> for when the Council
is diſſolved, and the Prelates and Fathers
are in another world, it doth then ceaſe to
be a Living Judge.</p>
               <p>To conclude.</p>
               <p>If, as you ſay, a General Council is this

ſince there is no General Council actually
