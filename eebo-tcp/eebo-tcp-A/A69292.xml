            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To all true hearted Engliſh men
dwelling in their native ſoile.</head>
            <p>HOwſoever (my deare country-men) it is mine
hap to abide on this ſide the ſeas; yet I cannot
but hearken after the proſperitie of my gracious
Soveraigne, &amp; naturall countrey, eſpecially in the
Parliament time. I am not (indeed) in any ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as where I may be ſure to have a
perfect relation of all remarkeable affaires: yet by
my diligent indevour, I obteyne (in time) more
probable intelligence, than many of you doe. Of
which the love of my countrey compelleth to make
ſome preſent vſe, occaſioned by a Publication (for
not one word thereof is in the Kings name) dated
31. December laſt. Wherein the worthieſt houſe of
Commons that ever was, is covertly traduced for
ſpending long time, and great charges, and yet
failing an earneſt expectation of a good concluſion
for the Eaſe, and Freedome of his Maieſties ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.
I could not therefore but indevour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
(as I may) the heart-burning which (I feare)
that publication may occaſion between the King
and his Commons, and 2. to make it appeare that
no houſe of Commons had ever a greater zeale for
the eaſe &amp; freedome of the ſubiects than the late
houſe had. The former, by demonſtrating that the
ſayd covert imputation is not the Kings, but the
pen-mans. For whereas Proclamations (in deed)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:23332:3"/>
ſpeake in the first perſon, as thus, Our ſubjects;
&amp;, We are reſolved, that publication ſpeaketh in
the third perſon thus, His Maieſties ſubiects; &amp;,
His Maieſtie is reſolved. Therefore it was not
penned by his Maieſtie. Againe, How can cloſe
ſuggeſting the ſaid imputation to be cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
the Parliament agree with that which is
expreſley ſaid, That his Maieſty, for many good
conſiderations knowne to himſelfe determined to
diſſolve, &amp;c? Doth not this ſhew, that the over
large preamble of that publication is the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,
&amp; onely the body thereof was by the Kings
direction? Moreover, In a Proclamation dated
24. September last, his Majeſty findeth fault
with former proclamations, in regard of their
penning. Which ſheweth, that, when his Majeſty
hath ſignified his mind touching the ſubſtance of a
proclamation; he doth not alwayes review the
penning thereof. Therfore it may be ſuppoſed, that
he did not peruſe the penning of the publication.
So that I think it may be well concluded, that
the ſaid imputation is not the Kings, but the
pen-mans.</p>
            <p>As for the Zeale of the commons in parliament
for the eaſe, &amp; freedome of the ſubjects, let that
appeare by that which is here publiſhed. Onely I
ſuppoſe it not amiſse to remember, that in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
ſeſſion of the late parliament, there paſſed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:23332:3"/>
theſe billes in the houſe of commons. 1. An act
for the better obſerving and keeping holy the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath
day, or Sunday. 2. An act againſt ſuch, as
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to church, doe refuſe to receive the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Lords ſupper. 3. An act for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
of a learned, &amp; godly Miniſtery. and 4.
An act to inable ſuſpended, and deprived Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
to ſue, &amp; proſecute their appeales. I reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
theſe, becauſe that worthy Knight, or burgiſſe
(whoſe speach is here recorded) doth not speak
of them; Intending (belike) to mencion no other
billes, but ſuch as paſſed in the houſe of commons,
in the fourth, that is, the laſt ſeſſion of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I ſay, The laſt, becauſe the fifth cannot be
accompted a ſeſſion, ſeeing nothing was concluded
therein, the Speaker, ſundry mornings before the
houſe met togither adjourning the ſame from day
to day, til the parliament was prorogued, &amp; there
diſſolved. Well, I pray God; that, whenſoever
we ſhall haue an other parliament, Counties, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
and burroughes may not be moved by letters
from ſuch common-wealth-men, as the pen-man
of the ſaid publication is feared to be, to chuſe ſuch
Knights and burgiſſes, as will have leſs Zeale for
the eaſe and freedome of the ſubjects, than had the
Knights, and burgiſſes of the late parliament.</p>

            <head>A memorable ſpeach in the houſe of Commons.</head>
            <p>MR. Speaker, I perceive we are all much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
by the evill ſucceſſe which we have had
in the great contract concerning tenures and
purveiance, after our long travell and much
tyme ſpent therein, and in other cauſes of good impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:
ſo as many have taken occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> therby to ſay of us,
that although there was never a more honourable aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,
in the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons howſe of Parliament, of godly, wiſe,
and learned men, then at this time, that yet there did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
leſs fruit appeare of their labour to the world, at any
time before, then now: which fruitleſſe labour if it
might be truly imputed unto us, it might worthily grieve
vs all. but I hope that in ſeeking out meanes of redreſſe,
or reliefe in this caſe, I ſhall make it appeare to all, that
will rightly weigh of the thinges, that if furtherance had
been given by others, whom it concerns, to our labours
and good indevours, many abuſes had been reformed, &amp;
much good done to the common wealth of England.</p>
            <p>But as it is true, which that great wiſe Lord, who hath
the chief charge of the treaſure of the Realme; ſayd unto
vs at our laſt meeting with the honourable Lords of the
vpper howſe of Parliament, in the paynted chamber at
Weſtin: touching the great contract, viz. that he did
well perceiue, that we had a great deſire to haue effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that great contract, that the Kings maieſly had wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
given his aſſent to the ſame, &amp; that yet neverrhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
it proceeded not, wherein he could not finde the
impediment, but that God did not bleſſe it: ſo is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
true of the reſt of our proceeding in Parliament,
that God hath nor bleſſed the ſame with good ſucceſſe,
which troubled me at the firſt, vntill I did further conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of many other parties of the Realme, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
callings, and ſocieties of the Realme, to whom God
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23332:5"/>
hath given as little bleſſing, as to the Parliament howſe.
For it did appeare plainely to vs in this howſe, vpon the
treatie and examinations of the grievances of the Church
and common wealth, that the Merchants of England
who were a calling of very great vſe in this Realme, for
the wealth, ſtrength, and credit thereof, and as it were
the leggs of the common wealth, whereon it goeth, had
not received ſuch bleſſing of late, yea in their merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizing,
as in former times, although they labor aſmuch,
and adventure aſmuch, as in former times they did. And
that likewiſe the clothiers being a trade whereby many
thowſands ſubjects are mainteyned, although they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
in their calling as much at this time, as ever before
they did; doe of late finde ſo litle fruit of their labour, as
that many of them are decayed, and many of them have
given over that trade to the hinderance of the Realme.</p>
            <p>And alſo the like is fallen to the Marriners, and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights
of this Realme, which number is greatly decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and with them the ſerviceable ſhipp: and ſhipping
very much weakened, which threatneth a decay of the
walls, and ſtrength of the Realme, which by good ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
and good Marriners, is well defended.</p>
            <p>And I find alſo, that God hath not bleſſed the treaſure
of the Realme, for it is gone from us, as if God had blown
upon it, to turne it out of the land, ſo as Prince &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
want.</p>
            <p>And I finde alſo in the calling of lawyers that there is
not the like increaſe of their labors, as in times paſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it be ſome fewe favorites; and I think that divers
Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes now here preſent about
me, could ſay the like of divers ſorts of men in their cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes,
cities, and Burroughes, if they liſt to ſpeak: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I doe aſſuredly think, that for ſome publique ſinns
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:23332:5"/>
of the land, God hath a quarrell to the land, whereby he
doth withdrawe his ordinary bleſſings; which publique
ſinnes this great Councell of the Realme ought firſt to
ſeeke out, and as much as in our power to redreſs the
ſame, that God being thereby reconciled vnto the land,
an happy bleſſing might inſue to all the eſtates thereof:
which to effect you ſhall ſee what we for our parts have
done to obteyne Gods loving countenance to the land,
as a ſhield, by removing the publicke ſinnes thereof,
which as a thick cloud doth keepe from vs Gods ſun-ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
grace.</p>
            <p>Firſt we did ſee, and conſider, that the precious name
of God, which we ought to regard more then our lives,
is not by the lawes of England, ſo tenderly regarded, &amp;
preſerved, as the name of all ſortes of people in the land:
For if ſome evill wordes be vſed againſt the King it is
high treaſon, for which the offender ſhall dye. And if
ſome evill words be vſed againſt noble men, it is publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the ſtatute <hi>de Scandalu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> magnatum.</hi> And
that for ſome evill words vſed by any private perſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
another, an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the caſe doth lye, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
law, to puniſh the offender, and to recompence the
partie wronged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But for abuſing the holy name of God,
and tearing him in peeces by wicked oathes, there is no
puniſhment by the lawes of the Realme, whereby both
men, women, and children increaſe in that ſinne gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly,
every day, without puniſhment or checke:
wherefore to prevent that ſinne, we did, at two ſeverall
ſeſsions of Parliament, make two ſeverall bills, which
did paſſe our howſe of Commons, to be made lawes for
puniſhment of ſuch Offenders.</p>
            <p>And to take away that crying ſinne which doth moſt
provoke God, &amp; moſt greeve the ſubjects, viz, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23332:6"/>
priving, diſgracing, ſilencing, diſgrading, and impriſoning,
ſuch of Gods Meſſengers (being learned and godly
preachers) as he hath furniſhed with moſt heavenly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to call us to true repentance, for no other cauſe, but
for not conforming themſelves otherwiſe than by ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
limited in the ſtatutes made in the 14. yere of
the late Queene Elizabeth of famous memory, thereby
making the lawes of the Church, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth to
iarre: which to reforme we made a lawe for ſubſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
agreeing to the intent of the foreſayd ſtatute, which
every wiſe ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will approue, &amp; willingly ſubſcribe unto,
whereby much peace, &amp; unitie would grow in the chnrch
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, &amp; be an occaſion that many ſubiects
might be well taught the meanes of their ſalvation, who
now want ſufficient knowledge of the word of God to
ground their faith upon.</p>
            <p>And to take away another groſſe ſin, which is made
lawfull by act of Parliament, whereby the land is made
guiltie thereof, viz. concerning non reſidents, and plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of benefices, we did paſſe a bill in the laſt Seſſions of
Parliament, &amp; have another bill concerning that offence
ready to paſſe being twice read, and agreed upon at the
Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mittees, whereby we abrogate ſo much of the ſtatute
of the 21 yere of K. He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. the 8. as did inable non reſide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
or the taking of more benefices then one with cure of
ſoules, for by the proviſoes in that Statute, the Kings
Chapleines may haue as many benefices, as they can
get, without ſtint, &amp; ſome others may have 4. benefices
with cure at one time, in ſeverall counties, &amp; ſome two
benefices, &amp; yet be reſident upon none of them, ſo long
as he attendeth upon his Lord, or Mr. which is a thing
intolerable in a Chriſtian common wealth.</p>
            <p>And for that ſome ſcandalous Miniſters of evill life do
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:23332:6"/>
bring a great ſlaunder to all the reſt, being many godly &amp;
learned preachers, we did make a good law to remove
ſuch ſcandalous Miniſters from their place.</p>
            <p>And where by the lawes of God, and the lawes of this
Realme the eccleſiaſticall perſons ſhould, in their gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
uſe onely the ſpirituall ſword by exhortation, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,
and exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication, which are the keyes of
the Church to exclude impenitent ſinners, &amp; to receive
into the Church, the penitent and faithfull perſons,
and to leave the temporall ſword, to the temporall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
which was alwayes ſo uſed in England untill the
ſecond yeare of King Hen. 4. at which time the popiſh
Prelates, following the example of the man of ſinne at
Rome, obtayned a ſtatute without the free conſent of
the ſubjects (as is ſet forth by Mr. Foxe, and in ſome ſort,
appeareth by the record of the Towre) by which ſtatute
they got the temporall ſword into their handes, which
ſtatute was ſince, by ſeverall acts of Parliament, made
voide with great diſgrace, and yet by colour of that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
authoritie once, by a ſhort ſpace by them uſed,
ſome eccleſiaſticall perſons doe uſe both ſwords, to the
great griefe, and trouble of the ſubjects, and with thoſe
two ſwordes, they doe alſo uſe the oath ex officio, which
began firſt in England, by that ſtatute of the 2. yere of K.
Henry the 4. being contrary to the lawes of England, &amp;
(as I verily think) contrary to the lawes of God.</p>
            <p>Wherefore we to reforme thoſe great abuſes, made 2.
good lawes, the one to abridge the force of the eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion in many pointes: thother to abrogate,
and take away the power of eccleſiaſticall perſons to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
the oath ex officio being a very hatefull thing, and
unlawfull.</p>
            <p>Andi for that among the Canons, late made by the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:23332:7"/>
clergie of England in their Convocation, it was thought,
that ſome of their canons did extend to charge the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
landes, and goods of the ſubjects of the Realme, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then was lawfull, and meet, we therefore made a
good lawe to make voide ſuch Canons, as doe charge
the bodies, lands and goods of the ſubjects, unleſſe
that the ſame Canons were confirmed by Parliament.</p>
            <p>And as we had care of the Church, ſo had we care of
the common wealth, touching impoſitions layd upon
the ſubiects goods, and merchandize, and other thinges,
&amp; therefore, after long travel taken by us in ſearching an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Records in the Tower of Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; in other places,
&amp; after great diſpute made herevpon, in open houſe, by
many learned Lawyers, we found it cleare in our opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that impoſitions layd upon merchandize, or other goods
of the ſubiects of this Realme, by the Kings Maieſty, with
out the free conſent of the ſubiectes in Parliament was
not lawfull, and therefore we did make and paſſe a bill,
by the generall conſent of the houſe of Commons, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by us all to be a lawe, thereby to declare, that
by the lawes of England, no impoſition could be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
layd vpon goods, or merchandize of the ſubiects of
England, without conſent of the ſubiects in Parliament.</p>
            <p>And becauſe that many ſubiects were greatly troubled
by purueyance, and cartaking, notwithſtanding the
good lawes in that behalf made to reſtraine the ſame, a
bill was preferred by ſome member of the houſe, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of that abuſe, at the beginning of the laſt
Seſſions of Parliament; which bill, by all likelihood, had
long ſince paſſed this howſe of commons, if the matter
of purveyance had not been comprehended in the great
contract, which matter of great contract being nowe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
a new bill concerning purveyance, and cartaking is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:23332:7"/>
in my hands, now preſently to be delivered into the houſe
to receive ſuch proceeding therin, as ſhalbe thought meet.</p>
            <p>And touching wardſhip &amp; tenures, becauſe it is thought
a heavie law, and grievous to the ſubjects, after the death
of the father to have the ſonne, &amp; heire within age; taken
from the mother and kindred, to be bought and ſold, &amp;
with the heire alſo to take all the lands and tenements of
the father, that ſhould many times mainteyne both the
heire, &amp; the reſt of the children, for the onely benefit of
the gardian: therefore we made a very large offer to free
the land thereof, which we laboured earneſtly to effect,
but God hath not bleſſed it, nor brought to good effect
any of thoſe good intended lawes above by me mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
although we much deſired the ſame, and had done
therein as much as perteyned to vs to doe, which if they
had been well effected, and paſſed as lawes and ſtatutes,
and that all ſuch grievances, concerning the Church and
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, as wee carefully co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended unto his Ma:
in writing (whereof the copies doe remain in this houſe)
had procured ſuch amendeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of things, as we expected,
it had made England ſo honourable and happy in the
government thereof, as ever was kingdome in this
world (as I think). And which when the ſame ſhalbe
well effected, will (as I think) make both King, and
ſubjects more happy, then ever they were. For if
all theſe thinges had ſo concurred togither, as wee
wiſhed, and laboured for, what would wee not give
to ſupply the Kings wants, and to ſupport him in a moſt
Roiall, &amp; princely eſtate. But <hi>rebus ſic ſtantibus,</hi>
as is before declared, without reformation of thoſe
things, which were by us ſo earneſtly ſought, we cannot
give much to ſupplie the Kings wants, becauſe we know
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:23332:8"/>
no certainty of that which ſhould remaine to us after
our gift, ſo as, in mine opinion, the good proceeding
of this Parliament hath not been hindred by us, which
is all I meant to ſay at this time.</p>

&amp; mercie towards us, to call your Majeſtie to

you with ſupreme power, aſwell in the Church, as in the

generall benefite of all the ſubjects of this land, Weo
doe with all humilitie preſent, at the feet of your excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Ma: our ſelves, and our deſires full of confidence in
the aſſurance, of your religious minde, and princely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
That you wilbe graciouſly pleaſed to give life,
and effect to theſe our petitions greatly tending (as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
we conceive) to the glorie of God, the good of
his Church, &amp; ſafetie of your moſt royall perſon, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
we acknowledge our greateſt happines to conſiſt.</p>
            <p>1. Whereas good and provident lawes have beene
made for the maintenance of Gods true religion &amp; ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
of your Majeſties moſt royall perſon, iſſue, and eſtate,
againſt Ieſuites, ſeminarie Prieſts, and popiſh recuſants.
And although your Majeſtie by your godly learned, and
judicious writings have declared your princely, &amp; chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
zeale in the defence of the religion eſtabliſhed, &amp;
have very lately (to the comfort of your beſt affected

princely will and pleaſure, that recuſants ſhould not be
concealed, but derected and convicted: yet for that the
lawes are not executed againſt the Prieſts, who are the
corrupters of the people in religion, and loyaltie, and
many Recuſants haue already compounded, and (as it
is to be feared) more and more (except your Ma: in your

therefore would be pleaſed, at the humble ſute of
your commons in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, in

preſervation of true religion, of your Majeſtie and ſtate,
to ſuffer your highnes naturall clemencie to retire it ſelf

Prieſts and Recuſants (of what kind and ſect ſoever) to
be duely, and exactly executed, without dread, or delay.
And that your Majeſtie would be pleaſed likwiſe to take
into your owne hands, the penalties due for recuſancie,
and that the ſame be not converted to the priuate gaine
of ſome, to your infinite loſſe, the imboldning of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,
and decay of true religion.</p>
            <p>2. Whereas alſo divers painfull, and learned Paſtors,
that haue long traveiled in the work of the Miniſterie,
with good fruit and bleſſing of their labours, who were
ever ready to perform the legal Subſcription appointed
by the Statute of 13. Elizab: which onely concerneth the
confeſſion of the true Chriſtian faith and doctrine of the
Sacraments, yet for not conforming in ſome points of
ceremonies, and refuſing the ſubſcription directed by
the late Canons, have been removed from their eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall
livings, being their freehold, and debarred from
all meanes of maintenance, to the great griefe of ſundry
your Majeſties well affected ſubjects; ſeing the whol peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
that want inſtruction, are by this meanes puniſhed,
and through ignorance, lye open to the ſeducements of
popiſh, and ill affected perſons; Wee therefore moſt
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:23332:11"/>
humbly beſeech, your Majeſty would be gratiouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
that ſuch depriued, and ſilenced miniſters may by li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence,
or permiſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the reverend fathers, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
dioceſſes, inſtruct, and preach vnto their people in
ſuch pariſhes, and places, where they may be imployed:
ſo as they apply themſelves, in their Miniſtery, to whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
doctrine, and exhortation, and live quietly, and
peaceably in their callings, and ſhall not by writing, or
preaching, impugne thinges eſtabliſhed by publick au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>3. Whereas likewiſe through pluralitie of benifices, &amp;
toleration of non recidencie in many, who poſſeſs not
the meaneſt livinges with cure of ſoules, the people in
diverſe places want inſtruction, and are ignorant, &amp; ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy
to be ſeduced, whereby the adverſaries of out religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
gaine great advantage, and although the pluraliſts, and
non-reſidents doe frame excuſe of the ſmalneſſe of ſome
livinges, and pretende the maintenance of learning, yet
we finde by experience that they, coupling many of the
greateſt livings, doe leave the leaſt helpleſs, &amp; the beſt
as ill ſerved, &amp; ſupplied with preachers, as the meaneſt.
And where pluraliſts heaping vp many livings into one
hand, doe by that meanes keep divers learned men fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
maintenance to the diſcouragement of Students, &amp; the
hinderance of learning &amp; the non-reſidents (for ſeeking,
or abſenting themſelves fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their paſtorall charges) doe
leave the people, as a prey, vnto the popiſh Seducers. It

               <note place="margin">New Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</note>THe policie and conſtitution of this your
kingdome appropriates unto the Kings of
this Realme, with the aſſent of the Parliament,
as well the ſoveraigne power of making lawes,
as that of taxing, or impoſing upon the ſubjects
goods, or merchandizes. Wherein they haue
juſtly ſuch a proprietie, as may not, without
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23332:13"/>
their conſent, be altered, or changed. This is the cauſe,
that the people of this Kingdome, as they ever ſhewed
themſelues faithfull, and loving to their Kings, and ready
to ayde them in all their juſt occaſions, with voluntarie
contributions, ſo have they been ever carefull to preſerve
their owne liberties and rights, when any thing hath
been done to prejudice or impeach the ſame. And
therefore when their Princes occaſioned eyther by
their warres or their over great bountie, or by any
other neceſſitie, haue, without conſent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ſet impoſitions, eyther within the land, or
upon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities eyther exported, or imported by the
Merchants, they have, in open Parliament, complained
of it, in that it was done without their conſents. And
thereupon never failed to obteyne a ſpeedie, and full re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe
without any claime, made by the Kinges of any
power, or prerogative in that point. And though the
lawe of proprietie be originall, and carefully preſerved
by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon lawes of this Realme, which are as ancient
as the kingdome it ſelfe; yet theſe famous Kings? for the
better contentment, and aſſurance of their loving ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
agreed, that this old fundamentall right ſhould be
further declared, and eſtabliſhed by act of Parliament.
Wherein it is provided, that no ſuch charges ſhould e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be layd upon the people, without their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

as may appeare by ſundry records of former times.
Wee therefore your Majeſties moſt humble co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mons aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
in Parliament following the example of this
worthy care of our anceſtors, and out of a dutie of thoſe
for whome we ſerve, finding that your Majeſtie without
adviſe or conſent of Parliament, hath lately, in time of
peace, ſet both greater impoſitions, and farre more in
number, then any your noble anceſtors did ever, in time
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:23332:14"/>

this moſt iuſt, and neceſſarie Petition unto your Ma:
That all impoſitions ſet without the aſſent of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t

auncient iuriſdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> over the ſtate eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall,
&amp;c. power was given to the
Queene, and her ſucceſſors to conſtitute,
and make a Commiſſion in cauſe eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall,
the ſaid Act is found to be incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
of dangerous extent in d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.
Firſt, for that it inableth the
making of ſuch a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion as wel to any
one ſubiect borne, as to more. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that whereas by the intention, and
wordes of the ſayd ſtatute, eccleſiaſticall
iuriſdiction is reſtored to the crown, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:23332:14"/>
highnes, by that ſtatute inabled to give only ſuch power
eccleſiaſticall to the ſayd co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners, yet under colour
of ſome words in that ſtatute, whereby the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners
are authoriſed to execute their Commiſſion according
to the tenour, and effect of your highnes letters patents.
And by letters patents grounded thereupon, the ſayd
Commiſſioners doe fine, and impriſon, and exerciſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
authoritie not belonging to the eccleſiaſticall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
reſtored by that ſtatute, which we conceive to
be a great wrong to the ſubiect; And that thoſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
might as well by colour of thoſe words, if
they were ſo authorized by your highnes letters pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts,
fine without ſtint, and impriſon without limitation of
time, as alſo according to will, and diſcretion, without
any rules of law, ſpirituall or temporall, adiudge and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
utter confiſcation of goods, forfeiture of lands, yea,
and the taking away of limme and of life it ſelfe; &amp; this
for any matter whatſoever perteyning to ſpirituall iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.
Which never was, nor could be meant by the
makers of that law. Thirdly for that by the ſaid ſtatute
the King, and his ſucceſſors may (howſoever your
Maieſtie hath been pleaſed out of your gracious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
otherwiſe to order) make, and direct ſuch Comiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
into all the Counties, and Dioceſes, yea into every
pariſh of England, and thereby all cauſes may be taken
from ordinarie iuriſdiction of Biſhops, Chancellors, and
Arch deacons, and lay men ſolely be inabled to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
&amp; exerciſe all other cenſures ſpiritual. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for that every petty offence perteyning to ſpirituall
iuriſdiction, is, by colour of the ſayd wordes, and
letters Patents grounded thereupon, made ſubiect to
excommunication and puniſhment by that ſtrange and
exorbitant power, and commiſſion, whereby the leaſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:23332:15"/>
offenders, not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting any thing of any enormous, or
high nature may be drawne from the moſt remote places
of the kingdome to London; or York, which, is very
grievous, and inconuenient. Fifthly for that limit,
touching cauſes ſubject to this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, being onely
with theſe words, viz. <hi>Such as perteine to ſpirituall
or eccleſiaſticall iuriſdiction;</hi> it is very hard to knowe,
what matters, or offences are included in that number.
And the rather becauſe it is unknown, what ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,
or lawes ſpirituall are in force, &amp; what not: from
whence ariſeth great incertaintie, and occaſion of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>And whereas upon the ſame ſtatute a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
is made; Therein is grievance apprehended
thus. Firſt for that thereby the ſame men have both
ſpirituall and temporall juriſdiction, and may both force
the party by oath to accuſe himſelfe of an offence, &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
inquire thereof by a jurie, and laſtly may inflict for the
ſame offence, at the ſame time, and by one and the ſame
ſentence, both a ſpirituall and temporall puniſhment.
Secondly whereas, upon ſentences of deprivation, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſpirituall cenſures given by force of ordinarie juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
an appeale lyeth for the partie grieved; that is
here excluded by expreſſe wordes of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
here is to be a tryall by iury, yet no remedy by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,
nor attaint. Neyther can a man haue any writ of
errour, though a Iudgement or ſentence be given againſt
him, amounting to the taking away of all his goodes, &amp;
impriſoning him during life, yea to the adiudging him
in the caſe of Praemunire, whereby his lands are forſey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and he out of the protection of the lawe. Thirdly,
that whereas penal lawes, and offences againſt the ſame
cannot be determined in other courts, or by other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:23332:15"/>
then by thoſe truſted by Parliament with the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
thereof, yet the execution of many ſuch ſtatutes
(diverſe whereof were made ſince 1. Eliz.) are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted to theſe Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners eccleſiaſticall,
who are eyther to inflict the puniſhment conteyned in
the ſtatutes being premunire, and of other high nature,
and ſo to inforce a man upon his own oath to accuſe, &amp;
expoſe himſelf to theſe puniſhments, or els to inflict o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
temporall puniſhment at their pleaſure. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
and after that done, the partie ſhalbe ſubiect in
the Courtes mentioned in the Acts, to puniſhments by
the ſame actes appointed and inflicted: which we think
very vnreaſonable. Fourthly, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion giveth
authority to inforce men called into queſtion to enter
into recogniſance not onely for appearance fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time, to
time, but alſo for performance of whatſoever ſhalbe, by
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners ordered. And alſo that it giveth power
to enioyne parties defendant, or accuſed, to pay ſuch
fees to miniſters of the court, as by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners ſhal
be thought fit.</p>
            <p>And touching the execution of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, it is
found greivous theſe wayes among other. Firſt for that
laymen are by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners puniſhed for ſpeaking
(otherwiſe then in iudiciall places, and courſes) of the
ſymonie and other miſdemeanours of ſpirituall men,
though the thing ſpoken be true, &amp; the ſpeach tending
to the inducing of ſome condigne puniſhment. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in that theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſioners uſually appoint and allot
to weomen diſcontented at, and unwilling to live with
their husbands ſuch portions, &amp; allowances for preſent
maintenance, as to them ſhall ſeeme fit: to the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
of wives to be diſobedient, and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
againſt their husbands. Thirdly, in that their
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:23332:16"/>
purſuivantes, or other miniſters imployed in the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of ſuſpected offenders in any things ſpirituall,
&amp; in the ſearching for any ſuppoſed ſcandalous bookes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
vſe to breake open mens houſes, cloſets, &amp; deskes, rife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
all corners, and ſecret cuſtodies, as in caſes of high
treaſon, or ſuſpition thereof. All which premiſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
other things conſidered, your Majeſties moſt loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
and dutifull commons, in all humblenes, beſeech
you, that for the eaſing of them, aſwel from the preſent
grievance, as from the feare, and poſſibility of greater in
tymes future; your highnes would vouchſafe your roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

freedome which your Majeſties ſubjects of
this kingdome have inioyed under your
royall Progenitors, Kings and Queenes of
this Realme, there is none which they have accounted
more deere, and precious then this, to be guided,
and governed by the certaine rule of the law (which
giveth both to the head, and members, that which of
right belongeth unto them) and not by any vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
or arbitrary forme of government. Which, as it
hath proceeded from the originall good conſtitution,
and temperature of this eſtate: ſo hath it been the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
meanes of upholding the ſame in ſuch ſort, as
that their Kings have beene juſt, beloved, happy &amp;
glorious, and the kingdome it ſelfe peaceable, flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:23332:16"/>
and durable ſo many ages. And the effect, aſwell
of the contentment that the ſubjects of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
haue taken in this forme of gouernment, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
of the love, reſpect, and dutie which they have,
by reaſon of the ſame, rendred unto their Princes,
may appeare in this, That they haue, as occaſion
hath required, yeelded more extraordinarie and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
contributions to aſſiſt their Kings, than the
ſubjects of any other knowne kingdome whatſoever.
Out of this roote hath growen the indubitable right
of the people of this kingdome: not to be made
ſubject to any puniſhment, that ſhall extend to their
lives, landes, bodies, or goodes, other then ſuch, as
are ordeyned by the common lawes of this land, or the
ſtatutes made by their common conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Nevertheleſſe it is apparant both that
proclamations have beene, of late yeares, much more
frequent, then heretofore, and that they are exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
not onely to the libertie, but alſo to the goods,
inheritances, and livelihood of men, ſome of them
tending to alter ſome points of the lawe, and make
anewe. Other ſome made, ſhortly after a ſeſſion
of Parliament, for matter directly rejected in the ſame
ſeſſion; other appointing puniſhments to be inflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before lawfull triall, and conviction; Some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning
penalties in forme of penall ſtatutes: Some
referring the puniſhment of offenders to the courts
of arbitrary diſcretion, which have layd heavie and
grievous cenſures vpon the delinquents: Some,
as the Proclamation for ſtarch, accompanied with
Letters commaunding inquirie to be made againſt
the tranſgreſſors, at the quarter ſeſſions: and ſome
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23332:17"/>
vouching former proclamations to countenance, and
warrant the later, as by a catalogue here vnder written
more particularly appeareth. By reaſon whereof there
is a generall feare conceived, and ſpread amongſt your
Maieſties people, that proclamations will, by degrees,
grow vp, and increaſe to the ſtrength, and nature of
lawes. Whereby, not onely that ancient happynes, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

which their anceſtors haue ſo long inioyed: but the ſame
may alſo (in proces of time) bring a new forme of arby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
government vpon the Realme. And this their
feare is the more increaſed by occaſion aſwel of certeyn
bookes lately publiſhed, which aſcribe a greater power
to Proclamatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s then heretofore hath been conceived
to belong unto them; as alſo of the care taken to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce

it is in many things very viſible<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo it is in
nothing more apparant, then in this matter
of impoſitions: which beginning at the
