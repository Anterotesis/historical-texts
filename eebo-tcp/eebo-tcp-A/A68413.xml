         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that oftentimes I thought to giue

to the Chriſtian Faith, and the great honour of your high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,

Like as it doth continue thoſe actes of the Gréeks, and
of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> the which long ſince is paſt ſo many

ſame to be true, did trauaile all that was poſſible to leaue

whereas there is maintained alſo vpon your charges manye

beſides others that I haue made, hath ſome taſt or kindred

for that as I ſay, there may remaine a perpetuall memorye
of ſo notable actes as ſo many Gentlemen and Knights of
<pb facs="tcp:9295:6"/>
the <hi>Portingales</hi> your ſubiects hath done, the which hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited

I ſpent all my youth in learning, and gaue my ſelfe greatly

the <hi>Indias,</hi> but after my comming to <hi>Portingale</hi> didde the
lyke. For as thoſe matters the which I meant to write
of, were many and of ſundrye orders, ſo it was neceſſarye
to enforme my ſelfe of the ſame by manye: and beſide that
thoſe that gaue me this inſtructions wer ſworn, yet I was
licenſed to preſent them as witneſſes. There were of them
that I ſought in the moſt part of <hi>Portingale:</hi> for what with
the great trauell of my perſon, and expences of my goodes,
for that they were ſeperated in ſundry parts, and in this I
haue ſpent the moſt part of my lyfe, forſomuch as this was
my onely recreation, hauing ioyned together all theſe infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
ſince my being in the Vniuerſitie of <hi>Coimbro,</hi> in
your Highnes ſeruice, at ſuch time as I found my ſelfe not

(not onely of the body, but alſo of the ſpirite) made an end

about the Ilande, to ſée if there were anie riuer of ſwéete

his boate along the coaſt to ſéeke out water, which he found
fowre leagues of from thence, the which he named <hi>Sancty

they had no knowledge of the ſame. Then they gaue them
bells, little rings of tinne, and counters, and of theſe things
they wer very glad, and from thence forward vnto the next

<hi>Negroes</hi> tooke vp, and ſome of them came ſo neere vnto
him, that he gaue them the bells into their owne handes,
whereat he wonderfully meruailed, for that <hi>Bartholome
Dyas</hi> had informed before, that when he was there, they did
run away, and wold not be allured to come ſo néere view.
The Generall therfore finding &amp; perceiuing contrary to his
expectation, the gentleneſſe of thoſe blacke people, hée then
leapt out on lande with his men, making exchaunge of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
red night caps with the <hi>Negroes</hi> for Bracelets of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uory
which they had, and ſo for that time departed. The
Saterday next after came to the number of two hundreth
blacke men: and more, ſome little, ſome great, bringing with
them twelue Oxen and foure ſhéepe, and as our men went
on ſhore, they began to play vpon foure Flutes according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with foure ſundry voyces, the Muſicke whereof ſounded
very well, which the Generall hearing, commaunded the
trumpets to ſound, and ſo they daunced with our men. In

ſaw certaine little <hi>Nigroes,</hi> which were hidden in certayne

ſort of men: wherein our men coniectured, that ſome trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

our people to retire to another place, which was of
more ſecuritie, and thoſe blacke men went all along the
ſhore directlye againſt our boates, vntill they came to the
place where ours diſimbarked themſelues, and went vppon
the lande in armour. The <hi>Nigroes</hi> then ioyned themſelues
as though they intended to fight, which the Generall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing,

a Croſſe, which being there ſet and erected, the <hi>Nigroes</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

thus paſſed ouer, the Captaine generall with the reſt of the
Fléete departed thence towards the Riuer called, <hi>Ryo del

which was the Feaſt daye of the conception of our Lady,
and in ſailing forward on their voyage, ther aroſe ſo great
a ſtorme with a forewinde, vpon the daye of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi>
that our whole Fléete did runne with there ſmall ſayles,
and that alſo verye low. In this courſe they loſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of <hi>Nicholas Coello,</hi> howbeit the next night after they
all met, and ioyned together againe. Now hauing paſt and
ſailed through this great ſtorm, or rather torment of wind,
which then was ceaſed, the Captaine Generall, vppon the
ſixtéenth daye of December did diſcouer lande, which were
certaine ſmall Rockes, being diſtaunt from the Harbour of
Saint <hi>Blaze</hi> thréeſcore leagues, and fiue leagues alſo from
the other part of the Rocke called <hi>De la cruze,</hi> where <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholome

is very pleaſant and ſightly in viewe, and in the ſame
is great ſtore of Cattell, and the further our Fléete ſayled
on that Coaſt, the better and higher the Trées were, all
which things our men might well perceiue and diſcerne, by
reaſon they went ſo néere the ſhore with their ſhips. And
vpon the Saterday they paſt hard by, and within ſight of the
Rocke <hi>De la cruze,</hi> and for that they were then come ſo far
forward as the Riuer <hi>Del infante,</hi> they were loath to paſſe
the ſame, and thereof taking counſell all the next night,
they went ſomewhat wide from the Coaſt, with a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde,
vntill Euenſong time, and then the Winde came
to the Eaſt, which was right againſt them, wherefore the

December, at the ſetting of the Sunne, the winde then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to the Weſt, which was a forewinde, and whether
to attayne to haue knowledge of the Lande they conſulted
all that night, which were beſt to doe. The next daye at

Rocke aforeſayde, which is thrée ſcore leagues a ſtearne the
place, wherevnto they minded to goe.</p>
               <p>This Rocke, is the cauſe of the great Currents that

good Fortune was to haue paſſed the ſame in manner as
<hi>Bartholome Dyas</hi> before that time had accordinglye done.
Wherefore the Captaine generall, béeing animated and
encouraged with this his great good lucke and Fortune,

gaue commaundement to many of his chiefe men to

for in the companie of fortie women there are no more but

they weare many braceléets of Copper, and ſome péeces of

manifeſt, that they haue in that Countrie plentie of copper
and tinne: Moreouer they haue great ſtore of Salt, which
they make of Salt water, carrieng the ſame from the Sea

they make the Salt: Theſe kinde of people were ſo gladde
of the linnen that our men carried with them, and brought

They alſo were ſo quiet amongeſt our men, that they
brought them water to their boates from a riuer which
was two Croſbowe ſhotte from the place where our men

From this place our Fléete departed the fiftenth daye

glad, ſuppoſing vppon ſight of thoſe people and view of

howbeit all naked, ſauing their priuie members, which wer
couered, with little péeces of linnen made of Bomebaſt or
Cotten, they came neere and entered into our ſhips without
any feare, and in ſuch ſorte vſed themſelues towardes our

The Captaine Generall ſéeing thoſe men ſomewhat addic<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted

great frindſhip to our men. He aſked of our Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
whether they came from the Turkes Countrey,
for that as he had heard ſaye, the people of the ſame are
white as ours were, requeſting alſo to haue a ſight of
their Countrey bowes, and of the bookes of theyr Lawes:

they were of a great Kingdome, which confined vppon the
ſame, and as touching theyr bowes and weaponnes, hée
ſhoulde with verye good will ſée them: But as for the
Bookes of theyr Lawes, they had none there with them,

               <p>By occaſion of this méeting and feaſting, the Captaine

on his voyage with a ſmall winde. The Tueſdaye after,
being within ſight of lande from whence he departed, hée
was incalmed, which did indure Tueſdaye and Wenſdaye,

repent him of the breach of peace &amp; friendſhip he had made

returned aunſwere by that meſſenger to this effect, that he
would make no peace with the Gouernour, neither would
he be his friend, vntill ſuch time as he did ſend to him his
Pilot whom he had hired and payed, with this aunſwere,
the Miniſter departed, and neuer came againe. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

winde, there came to him after the Minſter was gone,
a certaine Moore, who brought his Sonne with him being
a boye, and aſked the Generall whether he woulde carrye
them in his ſhips with him to the Citie of <hi>Mylynde,</hi> which
he ſhould finde in the courſe he ſhoulde kéepe towards <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycut:</hi>
Declaring that he would gladly goe with him, and

therewith aduertiſed the Generall, not to tarry vppon any
aunſwere, from the Gouernour, who he was aſſured would
make no peace with him, for that he was a Chriſtian.
The Captaine was verye gladde of the comming of this
Moore, for by him hée déemed, to gather ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of information and intellygence of the Strayghtes
of the Redde Sea, and alſo of the Townes that lye
and be ſcituated along the Coaſt, by the which he muſt
ſayle to <hi>Mylynde,</hi> and therefore he commaunded to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the ſame Moore and his Sonne into his Shippe,
and by reaſon it was then ſomewhat late, and that
they had no ſtore of water, the Generall with the
other Captaines determined to enter into the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of <hi>Monſambicke,</hi> to take in there ſo much as they
néeded, appointing alſo there ſhoulde be great watch, for

ſet on fire the ſhips. Vpon this determination and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
prepared accordingly, they procéeded and entered the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
on thurſday, and when the night was come, they laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
out their boates to go with them for water, for the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot
of <hi>Monſambicke</hi> informed the Generall, that it was
within the firme lande, offering to bring him to the ſame.
Wherevpon taking the Pilot with him, he departed about

and leauing <hi>Paulo de la gama</hi> in charge of the ſhips.
Being come to the place where the Pilot informed the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be, it could not ſo be found, for he no doubt, went
more to make eſcape and runne awaye, then to perfourme
what before he promiſed, but whether that he was amazed
with imagination of eſcape, and ſo could not finde it, or that
of mallice (ſince he could not run away) he would not finde
it, he cauſed them to ſpend that night without attaining the
purpoſe of their repaire thether, wherefore the day light ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing,
and ſéeing they could not finde the water, the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
would remaine no longer, hauing but a ſmall compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

ſet vpon him, did therefore determine to goe to his ſhips, of
purpoſe to fetch more men, and ſo if néed were to fight with
his enimies, knowing alſo he ſhould farre better finde the
water by day then by night. So hauing bene at his ſhips,
and there furniſhed his boates with more force of men and
armour, he retourned to ſhore ward againe, carrieng with
him the Pilot of <hi>Monſambicke,</hi> and hauing alſo <hi>Nicholas
Coello</hi> in his companye as before to take in water. And
when they drew néere to the ſame, the Pilot ſéeing that hée
by no meane or deuice coulde runne awaye, did then foorth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
ſhew them the water, which was harde by the ſhore
ſide, where alſo then were in ſight the number of twentie

away to the Moores, wherof when the General vnderſtood,
he was very ſad and ſorrowfull for the ſame, ſince he was
a Chriſtian: Vppon the griefe and ſorrow héereof he remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there Fridaie following: Vpon the Saturday, béeing
the xxiiii daye of March, and the euen of the Annunciation

with alowde and ſhrill voice, ſaieng, that if our men wold
haue wate, they ſhould nowe come for the ſame thether,
where they ſhould finde ſuch as would inforce them to
returne. The Captaine Generall perceiuing how ſmall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
they made of him, remembring alſo the iniury done
him in not deliuering the Pilot, and therwith hauing freſh
in memorie the loſſe and running away of the <hi>Nigoe,</hi> his
Pilots ſeruant, did therevpon grow into ſome cholar, and
ſo determined to ſhoote of the ordinaunce of his ſhips, into
the towne of his enimies, thereby to be reuenged vpon the
ſame for the iniuries done him, by the inhabitants thereof,
and this his determination, he imparted to his Captaines,
who hauing liking of the ſame, yéelded therevnto, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
imbarked themſelues in their boates, arming the
ſame with ſuch men as they had, and ſo comming before
the towne, and againſt the ſame, there were Moores along
the ſhore, which had made a pale of boords ſo thicke, that
our men could not perceiue who was behinde the ſame. And
betwéene that pale or defence and the ſea, vppon the ſhore
there was one hundreth Moores, armed with Targets,

ſhields, darts, bowes, arrows, &amp; ſlings, who ſo ſoone as our boates

after beaten downe with our ordenance, &amp; the enimies running

land from that towne to another, with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> feare they had of our men,
and from thence they went by water to another place, which was
on the other ſide. After dinner our men went with their Captains
to ſee whether they could take any Moores, verely beleeuing that
by taking of ſome, they ſhuld for the ſame haue reſtitution of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braies

moreouer they thought to recouer two <hi>Indians</hi> which the Pilot
Moore tolde the General were captiues in <hi>Monſambicke.</hi> In this
iourney onely <hi>Paulo de la Gama</hi> did take foure Moores in a boate.
And although ther were other boats wherin many Moores were,
yet could not they be taken, for making haſt to the ſhore, &amp; atteining
the ſame, they ran away, leauing their boats as a pray to our men,
who found in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame much linnen cloth made of cotten, &amp; alſo books
of their lawes of <hi>Mahoma,</hi> which the Generall commanded to bee
ſafely kept: And albeit he went that day along and before the town

yet could not they procure anie talke or ſpeach with anye of the

were Chriſtians as the Pilots had informed him, and that they had
willingly loſt their courſe, for that the ſhippes ſhould not arriue at

<pb facs="tcp:9295:27"/>
reaſonable excuſe, ſaieng, that as the winde was greate, ſo
were the currents ſwift, by reaſon whereof the ſhippes had
further made ſaile then they thought for: But the truth was
indéede, that they more ſorrowed their miſſing and paſſing
by the Iland where they informed to be Chriſtians, then
did our Captaine Generall: For they were verely in hope
to haue ben reuenged ther, vpon our men by death of them
all: But GOD beholding the daunger and perill meant to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them, of his diuine goodneſſe and mercye deliuered
them from the ſame, and that by a great miracle: For if our
men had gone thether, not one of them had eſcaped with
lyfe, ſince the Generall hauing ſuch a beliefe &amp; opinion, that
there were Chriſtians in that Iland (as the Pilot had tolde
him) would no doubt haue gone preſently on land at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuall
there, and ſo thereby runne headlong into a place
where he and his people ſhould haue bene put to ſlaughter:
The Generall thus ſorrowing the miſſe of that Iland, for
that he ſuppoſed there to haue found Chriſtians, and the
Pilots Moores in chafe with themſelues for that they had
miſſed their courſe thether for purpoſe afore ſaid, it was then
on each part determined, to goe back and aſſaie to finde the
ſame: neuertheleſſe although they earneſtly bent themſelues
to attaine vnto that deſired Ilande, and ſpent that daye in
trauell to winne their purpoſe therein, yet coulde they not
preuaile thereto: For ſtill the winde was ſo contrarie, and
the currents ſo great, as doe what they could, they failed of
their wills, and were put off from arriuall there, which no
doubte was done by Gods prouidence, and of his méere
fauour and goodneſſe towards our men: as not willing they
ſhould receiue anie daunger, or ſuſteine crueltie, or loſſe of

preſerued our people from the effect and ſequele of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice

which had imagined in their mindes, and trauailed to bring

downe, to and fro, as well with their ſhips, as alſo in their

intent to deceiue our men, and to traine them thether, of
purpoſe there to kill them, for that in déede that Ilande

that from thence to <hi>Mombaſſa</hi> are ſeauentie ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

towards Euening, they ſawe a great Ilande ſcituated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the North, in which the Moores Pilots ſayde there
were two Townes, one of Chriſtians, and the other of
Moores, as aforeſayd. Thus they ſayd and inuented to the
intent to bring our men in opinion, and make them beléeue
that there were in that Land, and thoſe Coaſts many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
In this ſort our ſhips going vnder ſaile, certayne
dayes, the ſhip called Saint <hi>Raphael</hi> by fortune one mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
two houres before daye light, came on ground vppon
certaine ſhoells, two leagues from the firme lande, and as
ſhe ſtrake on ground, they within made ſignes to the other

ſhoells and came to an Ankor, launching out their boats to
giue ſuccour to <hi>Paulo de la Gama</hi> Captaine in the <hi>Rapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi>

then he well knew, that at the next floud the ſhip would be
afloate againe, ſo that now he loſt the feare and iealouſie he
had conceiued, vpon the doubt he had that ſhe was loſt.
Thus recomforted with the certaintie they ſaw of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſafetie
of the ſhip, they foorthwith layed into the ſea many ankers.
By this time it was daye lyght, and after that it was a
lowe water, ſhe then remained drye vpon the ſhore being a
Sandie ground, which was the cauſe ſhe tooke no harme,
by ſtriking vpon the ſame. Our men placed their Ankers
which were layd foorth right ouer againſt themſelues, and
walked vpon the Sandes whileſt the Ebbe endured.

So ſtaieng for the floud, and beholding and viewing that

was no queſtion demaunded by our two meſſengers, what
Priſoners thoſe were, howbeit they beléeued the ſame to

before hearde) that there were in that Ilande ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,

themſelues to be ioyfull thereof, both imbracing and

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:9295:30"/>
of the holy Ghoſt, the which they did worſhippe, and
before them made their Prayers vppon theyr knées, and
that with ſuch a counteuaunce, and ſhew of greate deuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as though they were ſuch men inwardlye indéede, as
in appearaunce outwardlye they then pretented, and made
ſhewe off: Furthermore, the Moores then tolde our men
by ſignes, that manye other Chriſtians as thoſe were, did
dwell in another place farre from thence, and therefore
they would not carrie them thether: howbeit they ſayde,
that after our Captaine Generall were come into the
Porte or Harbour, they ſhoulde goe and ſée them.
All theſe thinges thoſe wilie people, ſhewed and imparted
to our men, of purpoſe to deceiue them and to allure them
to come within that Porte, where they were determined
to deſtroy and kill them all.</p>
               <p>After they had ſéene the Citie, they were then brought
to the preſence of the King, who commaunded to ſhew them
Pepper, Ginger, Cloaues, and Wheate, giuing them of
euerye ſorte thereof ſome portion to be carryed and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Generall, and ſent him worde by his meſſenger,
that of all thoſe commodities he hadde greate ſtore, and
woulde giue him his loading if that hée woulde. Alſo that
he had Golde, and Siluer, Amber, Waxe, Iuorye, and
other riches, in ſo greate plentie, that hée ſhoulde haue
and finde there when hée woulde for leſſe valour and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
then in anie other place.</p>
               <p>This Meſſage was brought to our Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
vppon Mundaye, who hauing ſéene the Spices, and
hearing of the Kinges promiſe, to furniſhe him the ſame,
and to lade him therewith, was meruailous gladde of
that offer, and ſo much the rather, was hée confirmed in
opinion of good lucke, for that our two baniſhed men,
hadde gathered ſuch intelligence, and made him ſo full
and good declaration of the People, Citie, and Lande
there, and chiefelye of the two Chriſtians, they
founde in the Houſe of the Merchauntes of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9295:31"/>
Wherefore he &amp; his Captaines immediatly aduiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
thereof, and ſo entering into counſel for the ſame, it
was by them thought good, to come within the port, and to
accept the offer of Spices, and afterwarde to goe on theyr
voiage to <hi>Calicut,</hi> where if they could not haue the like,
they would remaine content, with that they ſhould haue in
this place, and thus hauing concluded vppon theſe pointes,
they determined to enter into the harbour the next daie: in
this meane while came certeine Moores to our ſhips with
ſo great quietneſſe, and humilitie, and with ſuch ſhew and
appearance of friendlineſſe and loue, as though they had ben
of long acquaintance and familiaritie with our men: The
next day following in the morning, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> floud being come, the
Generall commanded to take vp their Ankors, minding to
enter the harbour, but God not willing that he and the reſt
ſhould enter into that preſent miſchiefe,<note place="margin">God ſent them fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly checks to keepe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vtter deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </note> nor to ende theyr
liues in that place (as the Moores had determined they ſhuld
haue done,) did therefore cauſe and prouide the meane that
preuented that perill, and wrought their ſafetie: For when
the Generalls ſhip had wayed her Ankor, and was going
to enter the port, ſhe ſtrake vpon a ſhoel that was aſterne
the ſame, which hap when he perceiued, and fearing hée
ſhould caſt himſelfe away, he then forthwith commanded,
to let fall his Ankor, &amp; in like ſort did the other Captaines
alſo: which chance when the Moores that were in the ſhips
ſawe, &amp; that the Generall was come to an ankor, they then
imagined that during that daye, they ſhoulde not gette the
Fléete into the harbour, and therefore they ran to theyr
boate, which they had on the ſhips ſide to goe to the Citie,
at which inſtant alſo the Pilots of <hi>Monſambicke,</hi> falling
a ſtearne the Admirall, tooke the water, and thoſe of the
boate tooke them in and carried them away with them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Generall called vnto them, requiring them to
bring backe, and deliuer them to him againe: But when he
ſawe they would not ſo doe, then he apparantlye perceiued
that ther was an euill meaning in their King and them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him and his, and that it was his great goodneſſe and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:9295:31"/>
fauour to giue him cauſe of ſtaye, by happening vppon that
ſhoell, thereby to preſerue him from their treaſon imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and put in practiſe: Thus hauing declared to all his
company, the opinion he conceiued of that which then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
their eyes was done, and appeared to be deuiſed and
wrought againſt them, he then commaunded the night bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come, to giue ſome torments or torture, to two of the
Moores, which he brought captiues with them from <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſambicke,</hi>
thereby to ſée whether they had practiſed any tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and to inforce them to open and diſcloſe the ſame:
which commaundement being obſerued, and put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
by heating and dropping of bacon vppon their fleſh,
they immediately confeſſed, they had conſpired treaſon, and
that the Pilots tooke the Sea, as fearing the ſame had ben
diſcloſed: wherevpon the Generall, altogether altered his
minde and purpoſe of going into that Harbour. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
being vnquiet and greatly gréeued at their falſhood, he
was deſirous to vſe lyke torture to another Moore captiue
alſo: to make tryall whether he were of counſell and in
conſort with the reſt.</p>
               <p>But this Moore perceiuing preparation made for that
purpoſe, did caſt himſelfe his hands being bound, into the
ſea, as in lyke manner another of them did, before it was
daye light. The ſecrecie of the miſchiefe prepared, being
thus come to apparaunt view, and ſo diſcouered, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
gaue great thankes to God, by whoſe only goodneſſe, he
and his company were delyuered from imminent death and
ſlaughter amongſt thoſe Infidells, and therefore in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
and thankes giuing for the ſame, he and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
béeing aboord the Admirall, ſayd the <hi>Salue Regina.</hi>
After this being mindfull of their ſafetie, and fearing leaſt
the Moores would attempt ſome matter againſt them in the
night time, they therefore ordained ſtrong and diligent
watch, commaunding euerye man to watch armed: And
héere by the way is to be noted one thing, and that to bee
meruayled at, which is this: That when our men came
firſt before the Towne of <hi>Mombaſſa,</hi> all ſuch amongeſt
<pb facs="tcp:9295:32"/>
them as then were ſicke, (which indéede were many) began
then preſently to be whole: ſo that in this time of theyr
great neceſſitie, and daunger, they felt and found themſelues
ſound and ſtrong, which as it was paſt all hope and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of man, and farre aboue the common courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and operation of the ſame, ſo the more liuely it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be the meruailous and ſupernaturall worke of God,
and therefore miraculouſly done at this inſtant time of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie,
when his diuine power was to be ſéene and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
for the preſeruation of that poore diſtreſſed number,
which then had their onely affiaunce in him. The watch
thus prepared and ſet for that night, it fortuned that thoſe
which watched in the ſhippe <hi>Berrio,</hi> felt the gabell of the
ſame wagging, whereat an Ankor lay into the Sea, and at
the firſt they adiudged that the gabell had bene wagged or
ſhaken by a kinde of Fiſh called a <hi>Tunnie</hi> whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were there about which be very great and good meate,<note place="margin">Tunnie good meate &amp; plentifull in the coaſt of Mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>baſſa.</note>
but giuing better and more attentiue eare thereto, they then
perceiued that their enimies were at the ſame, who in truth
did ſwimme about the gabell, and were cutting of it with
their woodkniues or fawchings, and hoping or rather vere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
knowing, that perfourming their enterpriſe thereof the
ſhippe would runne a ſhore, and ſo both ſhe and our men in
the ſame be caſt away and taken: For by any other deuiſe
they coulde not accompliſh their willes, and therefore they
practiſed this meane. Howbeit our men hauing diſcryed
whereabout they were, preuented them, by crieng out and
calling to the other ſhippes, ſhowing what was in dooing,
and willing them alſo to beware and looke to the ſame,
wherevpon they of the ſhippe <hi>Raphael,</hi> came preſentlye to
their ſuccour and reſcew, finding ſome of their enimies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the cheines of the tacklings of their formaſt, who
perceiuing how they were diſcouered, ſodainly caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
vnder water, and with the others that were cutting
the gabell of the ſhippe <hi>Berrio,</hi> fledde away ſwimming to
certaine boates, which they had lyeng ſomewhat farre off,
wherein (as our men afterward vnderſtoode) were many
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:9295:32"/>
Moores, who taking them in, rowed faſt awaye, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
to the Citie. The Wenſday and Thurſday follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
our Fléete ſtill remained there, about which in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> night
time came the enimies in boates, which alwayes lay harde
by the ſhore, from which ſome of them did ſwimme of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to eſpie, if by any meane they could cut a ſunder the
gabells of the Ankors, but our men obſerued and kept ſuch
diligent and warie watch, that they could not preuaile, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe
our men were greatlye troubled, and put in
feare of burning their ſhippes. For truly it was to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayled
at, that the Moores came not about the ſame in ſuch
ſhippes as they had, which if they had done, it had bene
then lykely by all coniecture of man, that they ſhould haue
deſtroyed and killed vs all. It was coniectured that they
béeing in feare of the Ordinaunce in our ſhippes, durſt
not giue attempt to ſet vppon the ſame by force, but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſouer
cauſe appeared in our ſightes to bée a lette in that
reſpect to them: It was moſt certayne in déede, that it
was God his good will and fauour, to put their hearts
in feare to deale with vs in anye forceable manner,
whereby we might be preſerued from the crueltie inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

a great boate hard to our Fléete, apparelled
in a Caſſocke of Crimſon Damaſke, lined
with gréene ſatten, hauing vpon his head a
rich towell. He was ſitting in a chaire, ſuch
as was vſed in olde time, very well made and wrought
with wire, being in ſight very faire, and in the ſame was
a cuſhion of ſilke, and another like vnto that hard by him,
which was couered with a hat of Crimſon ſatten. There
ſtood hard by him as his Page, an olde man, who carried a
very rich ſword, the ſcabered wherof was ſiluer: he brought
with him manye Shagbuts, and two Flutes of Iuorie,
which were eight ſpans of length each of them, they were
very well wrought, and vppon the ſame they played by a
little hole that is in the midſt thereof, agréeing and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
well with the ſhagbuts. There came with the King,
about the number of twentie Moores Gentlemen all richly

the Captaine generall came forth to méete him in his boat

great honour &amp; curteſie as though he had alſo ben a King:
he very earneſtly noted &amp; beheld him &amp; his men, as a ſtrange
ſight and matter to him and his people: he required the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
to tell him the name of his King, and being tolde, he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:9295:36"/>
commaunded the ſame to be then preſently written: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
inquired matter perticularly of him, &amp; of his power, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
the Generall aunſwered, and in euerye point ſatiſfied
his demaund, declaring alſo for what cauſe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
had ſent him to diſcouer <hi>Calicut,</hi> which was to haue
from thence ſpices, whereof in his dominion &amp; countrey was
none. And after he had thus talked with the King &amp; infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
him ſomewhat of the ſame &amp; of the ſtraights of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> red

<hi>Calicut,</hi> &amp; alſo very earneſtly deſired him to goe with him
into his Citie, there to take his pleaſure, &amp; ſolace himſelf in

and take ſome reſt: further then promiſing, that if
he would ſo do, that afterward he in like manner would go
with him to ſée his ſhips, &amp; make merry in the ſame, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto
the Generall aunſwered, that he had no licenſe of the
King his Maſter to go a ſhore, &amp; therefore if he ſhuld varie
from his Princes wil &amp; commaundement therein, he ſhuld
then giue an euill accompt of himſelfe, to which excuſe the
King replied, ſaieng, that if he ſhuld go to ſée his ſhips, what

might they déeme &amp; adiudge of him therein: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

King, promiſed him to returne y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> way, &amp; whileſt they were
thus talking there, did ſend for thoſe Moores, which he had
taken captiues, and gaue them to the King, ſaieng that if
he could do him any further pleaſure, he would gladly doe
the ſame: with which gift the King was ſo content, that he
ſaid, he did more eſtéeme of the ſame, then if he had giuen
him ſuch another Citie as that of <hi>Mylynde</hi> was.
Now hauing ended their talke and confirmed the friendſhip
betwéene them, the King then rowing amongſt our ſhips,
<pb facs="tcp:9295:37"/>
and behelde the ſame, with great pleaſure and admiration<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
out of which great ſtore of ſhot of Ordinaunce paſſed,
wherewith they were greatlye delyghted, all which time
our Generall went with him, to whom he declared, that he
neuer ſaw any men of whom he tooke ſo great pleaſure, as
he did of thoſe of <hi>Portingall,</hi> whereof he woulde gladye
haue ſome with him, to helpe him in his warres, which
he hath ſometime with his enimies: for it well appeared
they were men apt to offend their enimie, and to abide and
ſuffer any trauell or paine, that ſhould happen vnto them.
To which his ſpeaches the Generall aunſwered, that if hée
had experience of their doings, he woulde then a great
deale better lyke of them, and further that they would helpe
him, if the King his Maſter would ſende his ſhips of warre
to <hi>Calicut,</hi> as he doubted not but he would, if it wer Gods
good pleaſure to permit the ſame to be diſcouered. After the
King had in this ſort ſolaced himſelf, he then deſired the
General, that ſince he would not go with him to his Citie,
he ſhuld then let him haue two of his men to go and ſée his
Pallaice, and for pledge of the ſame, he would giue him his
ſonne, and one of his chiefe Chaplaines, the which they call
<hi>Cacis,</hi> wherevnto the Generall yéelded and appointed two of
our men to go with the King, who at his departure, reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted
the Generall that the next day he would goe along in
his boate hard by the ſhore, where he ſhuld ſée his horſmen
running, &amp; ſo they departed for that time, the next day being
Thurſday, the Captaine generall &amp; <hi>Nicholas Coello,</hi> went
in their boates armed along the ſhore, the one ſomewhat di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
from the other, betwéene whom vpon the ſhore were
many men on horſebacke ſkirmiſhing, &amp; as our boats appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
néere the ſhore, there came certaine footemen downe
certaine ſtayres of ſtone from the Kings houſe, which was
in ſight, where they tooke the King vp in a chaire, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him verye néere to the Boate of the Generall, to
whom he ſpake verye louing wordes, and once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
him to enter vpon land, and go to his Citie, for that
his father being a lame man, was deſirous to ſée him, and

that whileſt he ſhould remaine on ſhoare,<note place="margin">The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall vvould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to go on la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d at Mylynde</note> both he and his

going on land, alleadging hée muſt obey his Prince, who
gaue him no licenſe or commiſſion ſo to do at anie time.
And ſo taking his leaue of the king, hée went a while hard
by the ſhips of the <hi>Indias,</hi> ſhooting off much Ordinaunce,
who when they ſawe vs paſſe by lifted vp their hands, ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng:
<hi>Chriſte, Chriſte,</hi> and that night with the kings licenſe
our men made them a great feaſt, with much paſtime alſo

Fléet thus lyeng in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> harbour, there came vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſundaie
béeing the. 21. day of Aprill, from the king, a man that was
in great credit with him, to viſite the Captaine Generall,
who at that inſtant was very ſad and heauie: for that it
was then two daies ſince any man came to the Fléet from
the Citie, by reaſon whereof he feared leaſt that the king
were offended with him, as taking occaſion of offence, for
that he refuſed to go on ſhoare, ſuppoſing alſo that he wold
therevppon, breake the peace and league made betwéene
them, for which he was ſorrowfull, eſpecially ſince as yet
he had no Pilots. And when he ſawe, that he which was
ſo great with the king, did bring him no Pilots, he then
began to haue ſome iealouſie, and ſuſpition of the king, who
being informed therof, and knowing the Generall remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
there for that cauſe, did therefore forthwith ſend him
a Pilot, a Gentile (called in their language <hi>Goſarate</hi>)
whoſe name was <hi>Canaca,</hi> making excuſe that hée had not

<pb facs="tcp:9295:39"/>
whoſe foundation was on this ſort: This Prouince of

king, who made his aboade in the Citie of <hi>Conlan,</hi> and in
the laſt kings daies of this land (whoſe name was <hi>Sarana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimal,</hi>
and died ſixe hundreth yeares agone) the Moores
of <hi>Meca</hi> diſcouered the <hi>Indias,</hi> and came to the Prouince
of <hi>Malabar,</hi> the inhabitaunts wherof then were Gentiles,
and the king himſelfe was a Gentile: From the time of
the comming of theſe Moores, they beganne to account, the
yeares as we account, from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> birth of our Lord God: And
after they came thether, they grew into ſuch familyaritie
with this king, and hée entered into ſuch conference &amp; good
opinion of their lawes, that he renounced the manner of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
of his owne Countrie, and minded thence forth to
imbrace theirs, and the loue and liking he had of this ſect
of <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſo déepely tooke roote, and entered into his

The king of <hi>Calicut</hi> and all the other kings of <hi>Malabar,</hi>

appointed to no other office or affaires, but to fight when

wherewith they fight themſelues, which is bowes,
arrowes, ſpeares, daggers made like a hooke, and targets,
and march with them very honourably and gallantly, but
they goe naked, carrieng onely certeine linnen cloth of cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
painted, with the which they couer themſelues from
the girdle to the knée, they are bare footed: and weare vppon
their heads certeine towels. They all liue by the king, and
by the noblemen of the countrie, of whome they haue ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie
ſtipends and allowaunce for their maintenaunce:
They doe ſo greatly eſtéeme and make account of theyr
gentrie, and of their cleanlineſſe, that they will not touch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
huſbandman, neither permit any of them to come into
their houſes. The huſbandmen are bound when they goe
in the ſtréetes to crie with a lowde voyce, and ſaye, <hi>Hoo
they goe,</hi> for if theſe Gentlemen doe come, and bid them
goe out of the way, and they doe not obey their commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
therein: then may they kill them: The king cannot
make Gentlemen, except they be of the ſtocke of Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
They ſerue very well and faithfully, with them of
whome they haue their interteinment, and vnder whoſe
obeyſaunce they liue, not ſparing by night nor daie, anye
opportunitie of time for ſhewe of their beſt indeauour in
ſeruice of the ſame, nor making anye account of meat
or of theyr perſon or of ſléepe, whenſoeuer their trauell or
dilligence, may take effect or purpoſe of well doing. They
haue ſo ſmall charge and occaſion of expence, that with
halfe a crowne a péece (which is their ordinarie allowance
for one moneth) they may very well and ſufficiently, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
themſelues, and each of them a boye to ſerue him.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:9295:42"/>
The <hi>Nayres</hi> by the law of the country, cannot marry, and
for that cauſe they haue no children certain, but thoſe which
they haue are begotten of Lemmans, with which thrée or
fowre of them do lie, by accord &amp; agréement had and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
amongeſt themſelues, hauing one woman onelye to

wherein he commeth, to the other halfe of the day next
following, at which time he departeth from hers, and then
commeth another, who continueth the lyke time: Thus
they paſſe ouer and ſpend their life time without care and
trouble of wife and children: They mainteine their lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
verie well according to their degrées and birth. And
if any of them will at any time leaue and forſake her, they
may at their pleaſure doe it, and likewiſe ſhe maye refuſe
anye of them at her will. Theſe women are all Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women,
for the <hi>Nayres</hi> amye not take anye Countrie wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and they alſo doe not marrie: And for that there bée
ſo many men to one women, they take not them for theyr
children which bée begotten of her, although the ſame bée
lyke vnto them: and therefore theyr brothers children, doe
inherit their lands, and haue their goods: This lawe that
theſe Gentlemen ſhoulde not marrie, the king ordeined and
made, for that they hauing no wiues nor children, on whom
they ſhould haue care and fixe their loue, might the better
indure the warres, and liue at more libertie to ſerue in the
ſame.</p>
               <p>And becauſe they are Gentlemen, and that they ſhould
be the more animated and incouraged to liue in that order,<note place="margin">The Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s kill no kine for they vvorſhip them.</note>
and to ſerue well, they be ſo priuiledged, that none of them
can be impriſoned for any cauſe, nor be put to death by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
meane of ordinarie iuſtice: Howbeit when one of them
doth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> kill another, or elſe doth kill a Cowe, (which amongſt

Then will the king, hauing true information of any of theſe
offences, giue out his warrant in writing vnder his owne
hand, directed to one <hi>Nayre,</hi> commaunding him therby, that
he with two or thrée other, doe forthwith kill the <hi>Nayre,</hi>
that hath ſo offended and ſinned contrarie to the Law: By
vertue of which warrant, they hew and cut him with their
ſwoords, whereſoeuer they doe finde him, and when he is
dead, they hang vpon him the kings writing, to the end that
all men may know and vnderſtand wherefore they killed
him: Theſe <hi>Nayres</hi> cannot take their weapons, nor enter
into any combat, before they be armed knights: when they
atteine to the age of ſeauen yeares, they bée forthwith ſet to
learne to play at all weapons; &amp; to the ende they ſhould bée
very perfect, their Maiſters doe hale and wreſt the ioyntes
of their armes, and afterward they teache them their fence
ſuch as bée apt for the ſame: The weaponnes that are

The Maiſters which teach them, be graduats in the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons

him, doe to him reuerence and worſhip, and this by lawe is
ordeined: and further all of them are bound to take at their
hands a leſſon two monthes in euery yeare, during theyr
liues: By reaſon whereof they be very perfect and ſkilful
in theyr weapons, and for that cauſe they greatly eſtéeme
of themſelues.</p>
               <p>When any of them will be an armed knight, hée then
goeth well accompanied with all his kinred and friends, &amp;
preſenteth himſelfe before the king, to whome he firſt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth

Wherevnto he aunſwereth and ſaith, yea. Then hée com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundeth

ſo well obſerue and inuiolably kéepe, that if their Maſter in

not preſent at the déede doing, then will they goe afterward

through whoſe onely fauour, good will, and pleaſure, that
good lucke and great good benefite, had happened to them.
And then the Generall imbraced <hi>Bontaybo,</hi> and cauſed him
to ſit downe by him, aſking him if he were a Chriſtian, and
how he came to <hi>Calicut?</hi> For aunſwere whereto y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Moore
told him of whence he was, and what he was, and how he
came to <hi>Calicut</hi> by the way of <hi>Cayro,</hi> alſo he ſhewed him
by what meanes he came to knowledge of <hi>Portingals,</hi> and
that alwaies he had bene a friend to them, for that in all
reſpects &amp; at all times, their doings &amp; manners appeared to
him to be good and worthy of friendſhip. Finally he ſayde,
that as he had in time paſt bene a friend to them, ſo would
he now at this preſent continue his good will, and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and would be to doe all that in him was to pleaſure &amp;
further them, and the effect of their purpoſe in comming the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
The Captaine generall gaue him great thankes, and
promiſed to recompence him very liberally in reſpect of that
his good will, and for any pleaſure or friendſhip he ſhoulde
thenceforth ſhew to him and his company, he ſhuld be wel
aſſured to be thankfully conſidered of. Declaring alſo that
he was the moſt ioyfull man of all the world to finde him
there, and to haue him for a friend and an ayde, verely belée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
that God had ſent him thether, to giue an ende to the
enterpriſe of the voyage, which he ſo deſired in diſcouering
of thoſe <hi>Indias,</hi> and had entered into, and paſſed through ſo
many daungers by long tract of time to attaine vnto the
ſame, and now notwithſtanding his arriual ther, he thought
to haue but ſmall fruite of his trauaile, without his helpe &amp;
friendly furtheraunce.</p>
               <p>Then he requeſted him to declare, what manner of
man the King of <hi>Calycut</hi> was, and whether he thought he
would receiue him with good wil as an Embaſſadour from
the King of <hi>Portingale.</hi>

                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:9295:45"/>

that he no doubt would receiue him gladly, for Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour,
from a ſtraunge king, eſpecially if his comming were
to ſettle and intreate for eſtabliſhment of tract or trade of
merchaundiſe in <hi>Calicut,</hi> and had brought with him anye

thereof to the king, ſo is the ſame indéede the verye
principall rents or reuenewes he hath for his maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce:
Moreouer he informed the Generall that the king
at that inſtant was in a certaine village fiue leagues from

he aduiſed him to ſend vnto him, &amp; to declare of his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall

of the ſpeaches and aduiſe of <hi>Bontaybo,</hi> did therefore giue
vnto him certeine gifts, and ſent with him two of his men
in meſſage to the king of <hi>Calicut,</hi>

to direct them on their waye to <hi>Panane,</hi> which he accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
did. Theſe meſſengers being nowe come before the
king, one of them whoſe name was <hi>Fernan Martyn,</hi> by an

from his Captaine who is arriued in the port of <hi>Calicut</hi>
with certeine ſhippes, <q>and is come thether from the king

a Chriſtian prince, &amp; that all thoſe whom he had ſent were
chriſtians, hauing paſt many troubles and daungers vpon
the ſea, before their arriuall there at <hi>Calicut.</hi> The king hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
all the diſcourſe of their voiage (wherof <hi>Fernan Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tynes</hi>
ſomwhat at large informed him) did greatly maruell

then were all theyr trauaile loſt. To excuſe all this,
and that they might remaine vppon this good aſſuraunce,
it were very good ſayd hée, that hée did not goe a ſhoare,
but that hee did ſende one of them, or ſome other, who
might doe that which he ſhoulde doe, for thoſe that are

themſelues in ſuch daungers, but where there were
<pb facs="tcp:9295:47"/>
ſuch great neceſſitie, that they coulde not otherwiſe excuſe
themſelues. Of this minde were all the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
vnto whome the Captaine Generall aunſwered, that
although he knew or did vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> by his comming it
were preſent death vnto him, yet he woulde not let but goe
and viſit the King of <hi>Calicut,</hi> and the rather to ſée whether
he would ſettle a friendſhip and trade there, and to haue
out of his Citie, Spices and other commodities, for that
the ſame (at our arriuall in <hi>Portingale</hi>) might repreſent as
a witneſſe the diſcouerie of <hi>Calicut.</hi> For if ſo be that at

then ſaid he, it would be hard to be beléeued that wée
had diſcouered <hi>Calicut:</hi> And our credit and honour woulde
ſtand in ſuſpence or ballance, vntill ſuch time there ſhould

as we haue ſpent, and are lyke to ſpend, and others ſhall
come to diſcouer y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth of our ſeruice: ſo that in the meane
while, thoſe that are enuious, ſhould iudge our trauaile as
it ſhuld pleaſe them, certeinly I had rather die then to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vpon the ſame: Much more friends I doe not aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
my ſelfe to ſo great a daunger of death as you do ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,
neither yet that they ſhould remaine in ſo great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as you doe preſuppoſe, for I goe to a Countrie where
there are Chriſtians and to talke with a king, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
that vnto his Citie ſhould come many Merchants,
for the profit that doth ariſe thereby vnto him: for the
more Merchants that do reſort vnto it, the more wil be his
profit. I doe not goe thether to ſtay there many daies that
the Moores ſhall haue any ſuch time to vſe anye treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
me. And for ſo much as I doe minde to talke with
the king it ſhall haue an end, and that within thrée dayes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and in this time you may be in a readineſſe: And as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the honour and credit that I ſhall get by making or
eſtabliſhing this trade, if it pleaſe God that he doe accept
the ſame I will not giue it for any treaſure. And the king
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:9295:47"/>
can ſettle the ſame with no other better then with me, for
that he will eſtéeme me, and beare ſome reuerence towards
me, being once knowen vnto him that I am the Captaine
generall of this Fléete, and the King of <hi>Portingales</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour,
rather then with any other perſon whatſoeuer.
Furthermore whoſoeuer he be that ſhall goe in my ſteede,
the King will thinke himſelfe to be mockt, or that I do not
eſteeme him, as one that is worthy that I ſhoulde goe to
ſpeake with him, or els that I doe not truſt him on his
word. Beſides all this, I cannot giue ſo large inſtructions
to him that I ſhould ſend thether, that he might doe in all
things which is néedfull as much as I my ſelfe: and if ſo
be that for my ſinnes he ſhoulde kill me, or take me as a
priſoner, it were a great deale better for me that ther ſhuld
chaunce to me all this for doing of my duetie, then to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
alyue, and not to doe the ſame. And you my friendes
remaining in the Sea and in good ſhips,<note place="margin">The Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to goe to Calicut</note> as ſoone as you ſhal
heare that any of theſe things ſhall chaunce vnto me, get
you hence, and carrie newes of this our diſcouerie, and as
touching this, let there be no farther talke, for that I by
the grace of God will goe to <hi>Calicut</hi> to ſée the King. When
that his determination was perceiued, they all aſſented that
they were contented with his going: and therevpon they
appointed him twelue of his men to goe with him, that is
to ſay, <hi>Diego Dias</hi> his Secretarie and <hi>Fernan Martines</hi> the
interpretour, <hi>Iohn de Sala,</hi> which was afterward Treaſurer
of the houſe of the <hi>Indias.</hi> &amp;c. So that with him in all they
were thirtéene. They appointed alſo that in his abſence ther
ſhould remaine for Captaine generall his brother. Alſo hée
gaue commaundement that he ſhoulde not ſuffer any man
to come aboord his ſhip, and all thoſe that were deſirous to

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this Andor, departed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the Catuall, who was carried

of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany went afoote, the people of the country was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded

&amp; being in <hi>Capocate,</hi> they ſtaid to refreſh themſelues: where
the Captaine generall being in one houſe &amp; the Catuall in
another they did eate,<note place="margin">the fruits of Calicut</note> &amp; to al our men was giuen to eat ſod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
fiſh, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> rice &amp; butter, beſides fruits of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey, which
differ from ours very much, yet they are very good. The one
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:9295:48"/>
ſort of theſe is called <hi>Lacas,</hi> and the other <hi>Mangas,</hi> howbeit
they haue figs alſo. The water y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they did drinke, was very
excellent, as good as any in <hi>Portingal.</hi> Thus after they had
eaten, they went againe to imbark themſelues, for that they
ſhuld go vp a riuer, which from thence runneth into the ſea:
the Captaine generall did imbarke himſelfe with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
into 2. <hi>Almadias,</hi> lieng the one cloſe to the other, which
in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> countrey they did call <hi>Enſangada.</hi> The Catuall w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his
traine were imbarked in many others, and the people that
came to the riuers ſide to ſée and view our men were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
number, for ſo much as that countrey is well inhabited.
And after that they had gone in this riuer about a league,
and that along the ſhores ſide, they ſaw lieng a ground ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great ſhips, the Captaine generall with the Catuall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſimbarked, did returne to their Andors, and following
their waye, there reſorted alwayes about them thouſandes
of people to ſée them, wherein they tooke ſuch a felicitie that
the very women alſo with their children hanging at theyr
backes, did not féele the waye they went in, following to
féed their eyes. From this place which I haue made menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of, the Catuall did carrie him vnto a certaine <hi>Pagode</hi> of
their Idolls, into which when they were entred, he told him
that the ſame was a Church of great deuotion, which the
Captaine generall beléeued to be true, &amp; to be ſome church of
the Chriſtians, &amp; therfore he gaue the more credit therevnto,
the rather for that he ſaw y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ouer the principall dore therof,
there hanged ſeuen little bells, &amp; afore the ſame there was a
pillour made of wier, the which was as high as the maſt of
a ſhip, vpon the top thereof there ſtoode a wether cock, made
likewiſe of wier. This church was as great as a good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtary,
and was made all of frée ſtone, and couered or vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ouer with bricke, which gaue an outwarde ſhewe, as
though within ſide it ſhoulde be of verye faire workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe.
Our Captaine was very glad to ſée the ſame, for
that he thought himſelfe to be among Chriſtians, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
within this Church with the Catuall, they were
receiued by certaine men, naked from the girdle vpwarde,
<pb facs="tcp:9295:49"/>
and from thence downe to the knée, couered with certaine
linnen cloth made of cotten, with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which their arme holes
were couered alſo, without any thing vpon their heads, and
vpon their left ſholders they had certaine number of thrids,
which came vnder their right ſhoulders, much like as the
Prieſts were wont to weare their ſtoles héere amongſt vs,
when they went to Maſſe. Theſe men are called <hi>Cafres</hi> and
are Gentiles, which ſerue in <hi>Malabar</hi> in their <hi>Pagodes,</hi> who
with a ſprinkle tooke water out of a certaine fountaine &amp;
threw the ſame vpon the Captaine generall &amp; vpon the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
and on the reſt of the companye.<note place="margin">Holy vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Ca<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>licut</note> After all this
they gaue them Saunders in pouder to caſt the ſame vpon
their heads as they did héere their Aſhes,<note place="margin">Holy aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</note> &amp; as alſo they ſhuld
do y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> like vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> brawns of their armes, but they could not
do ſo, by reaſon of their apparrel which they had on, but yet
they did not let to doe it on their heads: ſo going about this
Church, they ſaw many Images painted vpon y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> wal, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
ſome ther wer y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> had great téeth, which appeared to be ſo
monſtrous y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were of an inch of length without their
mouth. Others ther wer y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> had foure armes, &amp; therwith wer
ſo ill fauoured, that they ſéemed to be very diuells, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
ſight made our men ſtand in doubt, whether the ſame wer a

hauing reſted himſelfe, &amp; being in great ioy to ſée ſo good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of his buſineſſe, determined on the next day being
Tewſdaie, to ſend a preſent to the king.
<pb facs="tcp:9295:53"/>
And for that he knew he could not ſend the ſame, but that
the Factor and the Catuall ſhould haue the ouerſight ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
did therefore ſende for them that they might haue the
view thereof,<note place="margin">A preſent for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut.</note> who béeing come, he ſhewed the ſame vnto

foure braunches of Gorall, twelue <hi>Almaſares,</hi> a fardell of
Braſſe, in the which there were ſeauen péeces, a Cheſt of
Sugar, two Barrels of Oile, &amp; two of honnie. The Factor
and the Catuall hauing ſéene theſe parcels, began to laugh
therat, ſaieng, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame was nothing to preſent the king
withall, for that the pooreſt Merchant that commeth to his
port doth giue him much more then the ſame, wiſhing him
that ſince he would néeds giue him a preſent, to ſende him
ſome golde, for that the king woulde not accept any other
thing. At this their anſwere the Captaine general was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
&amp; ſo he ſhewed himſelfe to be, ſaieng, that if ſo be he
were a Merchaunt or that his comming thether were to
trade, he would then haue brought him golde: But he was
no Merchaunt but an Ambaſſadour, which was the cauſe
he brought none with him, &amp; that this which he doth now
ſend to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of <hi>Calicut,</hi> is his own goods, &amp; not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king his
Maiſters, who for that he did not certeinly know that hée
ſhould haue met with the king of <hi>Calicut,</hi> did therfore giue
him nothing to preſent him withal: but at his next returne
knowing for certeintie that he ſhall finde him, the king his
Maiſter will ſend him golde, ſiluer, &amp; other rich things. To
this they anſwered and ſayd that it might be ſo, howbeit it
was accuſtomed in that countrie, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whatſoeuer ſtranger he
be that doth come &amp; ſpeake with the king, he ſendeth hm a
preſent, which is according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> greatnes of his eſtate. Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which the Captaine generall did reply, ſaieng y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was
good y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their cuſtome ſhuld be kept, &amp; that for the preſeruatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of the ſame, he did make him this preſent, which is of no

them to ſuffer him to carrie the ſame to the king,
which if ſo be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they would not let him doe that, then hée
would ſend the ſame backe to his ſhippes againe.
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:9295:53"/>
They aunſwered him that immediately he might ſo do, as
he laſt determined, for that they would not conſent that the
ſame ſhould be carried to the King. With this aunſwere
the Captaine generall was very angry, and ſaid vnto them,
that ſince they would not conſent that he ſhould ſende that
preſent to the King, he would therefore go himſelfe &amp; ſpeak
with him, and would now returne to his ſhips. This was
his meaning, to enforme the King what had paſt about this
preſent. They ſaid y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was well done ſo to do, but for ſo
much as they ſhould remaine with him in the Court a good
while, it were for them very neceſſary to goe about a little
buſineſſe in the meane ſpace, which they will go to doe, and
immediately retourne to goe with him, ſince that the King
wold not be pleaſed that he ſhuld go without them: for ſo
much as he was a ſtraunger, and for that there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Moores in the Citie. The Captaine generall giuing cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
to their words concerning their retourne, immediately
aunſwered them that he would tarry for their comming:<note place="margin">Treaſon conſpired againſt the fleete</note>
but they did not returne all that daye, for that they were
enimies to the Captaine generall, by reaſon of the Moores,
who were his enimies alſo, and had receiued newes what
he had done in <hi>Monſambicke,</hi> and of the taking of the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buco</hi>
in <hi>Mylynde,</hi> and that we were Chriſtians, and that
our comming was to diſcouer <hi>Calicut. Bontaybo</hi> alſo told
the Moores, that Spices were eſtéemed in <hi>Portingale</hi> very
much, and that as he iudged they wer not come to diſcouer
<hi>Calycut,</hi> but to ſettle there a trade, and to carrie Spices in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their Countrey, in the which there is of all ſorts of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunts
that come to <hi>Calycut</hi> by the way of the ſtraights,
and great ſtore of golde and ſiluer, and hauing the Trade
ſetled there, woulde redowne vnto the King great profite
thereby. To the which words the Moores gaue great eare,
and made their reckoning vpon <hi>Bontaybos</hi> ſpeach, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the ſame: That we being Chriſtians and once come
to ſettle a Trade in <hi>Calycut,</hi> their commoditie then would
fall of the price they were at, and ſo would abate the moſt

<pb facs="tcp:9295:54"/>
to worke all meanes they could poſſible with the king,
to take the Captaine generall priſoner, and to commaunde

the rather, for that in no wiſe they ſhould retourne to <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingale,</hi>
to carry newes of <hi>Calicut.</hi> And héerevpon they ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thoſe that were in credit with the King, and went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, and one in the name of them all, ſaid vnto the king:
That he ſhoulde not deceiue himſelfe with our men,<note place="margin">the Mores oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the king</note> for
that the Captaine Generall was no Embaſſadour but a

we were come to <hi>Monſambicke,</hi> wher the <hi>Xeque</hi> went to

him a Pilot to carrie him to <hi>Calicut,</hi> whether he ſaid
that he would goe. He after this ſhot his Ordinaunce at the

certaine <hi>Sambucos</hi> laden with Merchaunts, and handeled
both him and his like vnto Enimies. And being departed

who being determined ſo to doe, whether that it was
for that he ſaw within the ſame many ſhips, or y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he thought
he could not make his partie good, did flye away ſo faſt, that
he left one of his Ankors behinde him: and from thence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
the Pilot ran away, which he caried from <hi>Monſambicle,</hi>
for the ill lyfe which he lead with him, with whipping of
him, and putting of him vnto other puniſhment. And being
departed from <hi>Mombaſſa,</hi> and come néere vnto <hi>Mylynde,</hi>
did take perforce a <hi>Sambuco</hi> laden with Moores, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
there were ſome that dyed in the battaile, &amp; others that are
yet aliue remaining captiues. And for that thoſe that were
captiues willed him to carry them to <hi>Mylynde,</hi> ſaieng, that
there they woulde giue him a newe Pilot to carrye him to
<hi>Calycut,</hi> by that meanes onely he came thether. And hauing
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:9295:54"/>
there by the King of <hi>Mylynde</hi> bene receiued very well, yet
the Captaine generall would no more come a lande, fearing
the hurts which he had done, and taking the Moore priſoner
which the King had ſent to viſit him, and would not dely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
him, vntill ſuch time that he had a Pilot ſent him. Wher
by it might well be conſidered, that if ſo be that he were an
Embaſſadour and were come to maintaine peace, he would
neuer haue vſed thoſe diſorders, but wold haue brought the
King a preſent with him. Of this his demeanour, we giue

newes the king remained amazed, and told the Moores that
he would determine himſelfe what ſhall be thought moſt
conuenient: they ſéeing this, thought the ſame not to be the
waye to cauſe the King to doe as they would haue him, and
did afterward tell the Catuall thereof, who was in great
credite with the King, requeſting him to perſwade with the
King, not to receiue any ſuch Embaſſage as that was, and
the cauſe thereof the rather was, that he tooke this preſent
for ſo ſmall a valew. With this the Catuall went immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
to the King, who told him what the Moores had ſaid,
to whom the Catuall gaue counſaile, to doe as the Moores
had requeſted him: immediately the King began to change
his countenaunce againſt the Captaine generall, but not ſo
much as the ſame might be perceiued. But as ſoone as the
Moores had knowledge by the Catuall concerning the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
that the Captaine generall would haue ſent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King,
and that he would not conſent therevnto, the Moores tooke

ſame was not a preſent for to be ſent to a King, neyther

him to diſcouer men, how doth it chaunce then that hée ſent

The Captaine generall was partly aſhamed to ſée the
King ſo altered, for that he had not brought him a preſent.
And now moreouer to demaund without all honeſtie that
Image. To whom he aunſwered, that the <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi>
which they tolde him of, was made of woode, and gylded ouer
and not of Maſſie golde. And although that it were (yet
would he not depart therewith) forſomuch as the ſame had
preſerued him in the Sea, and had brought the ſame from
his Countrey. The King did not reply vpon this anſwere,
but demaunded thoſe Letters the which the King had ſent
him: whereof the one was in the <hi>Portingale</hi> tongue, the
other in the <hi>Arabian</hi> language. Theſe he tolde him were
ſent in this order, for that the King his Maſter did not know
whether of theſe two languages was vnderſtoode in his
Countrey. Wherefore he deſired that ſince the <hi>Portingale</hi>
language was not vnderſtood in his Countrey but the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian,</hi>
and that there were Chriſtians of the <hi>Indias</hi> that did
vnderſtand the ſame, one of thoſe might read his Letter, and
the rather for that the Moores are enimies to the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
of whom he was afeard, leaſt that they ſhould chaunge
the ſenſe thereof. The King commaunded them ſo to bée
read: howbeit there could be founde no <hi>Indian</hi> that coulde
read the ſame, or at the leaſt would ſhew himſelfe that hée
could read them. The Captaine generall ſéeing that there
was no other remedy, but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the Moores muſt néeds read the
ſame, was driuen then to requeſt the King, that <hi>Bontaybo</hi>
might be one of them. This was done, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as he thought
he would ſpeake and vſe more truth then the others, for the

the ſame to be read by other thrée, who hauing read y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
firſt of all to themſelues,<note place="margin">The effect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Portin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the king of Calycut</note> &amp; afterward with a loude voyce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
to the King the effect thereof, the which was, That

And therefore if ſo be he will giue him licenſe to ſende for
the ſame, that then he wil ſend vnto him from his kingdome
many things which he hath not in his, as his Captaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
and Embaſſadour will tell him. And if ſo bée that
with thoſe things he were not pleaſed, he will ſende him
money both of golde and ſiluer to buy them withall, &amp; how
that as well of his Merchaundize as of the money, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

as he was deſirous that for the increaſe of his rents there
ſhould come many Merchaunts vnto <hi>Calycut,</hi> ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be wel pleaſed with this letter, &amp; alſo made vnto the

named many, ſhewing how that of all he had brought with
him part, and alſo of their money, requeſting him licenſe

more credite to that which he ſpake, then to that the

that they ſhould remaine a lande, &amp; that he ſhould bring his

that it were a great deale better to tarie vntill y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next

anſwere, that if ſo be that he would not giue him an <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madias</hi>
or Pinnace, he woulde immediatly returne to the
king &amp; complain vpon him, forſomuch as the king had ſent
him to his ſhips, and he would ſéeme to ſtay him, which
was very ill done, ſince that he was a Chriſtian as they
were. This was ſpoken with ſuch a coulour as if he wold
haue returned to <hi>Calicut.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Catuall</note> The Catuall for to diſſemble

ſo many. Howbeit he tolde him that he did counſell him
for the beſt, and to remaine. But if ſo be that he would goe
he was contented therewith. Thus on one parte he ſent
to ſéeke out <hi>Almadias</hi> or Pinnaces, and on the other part
commaunded the owners of the ſame to hide themſelues
out of the way becauſe they ſhuld not deliuer the ſame. In
the meane ſeaſon while they went to ſéeke thoſe Pinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
the Captaine Generall went along the water ſide, and
for that he had an euill ſuſpition of their dealing, for that
which they had done to him in <hi>Calicut,</hi> he commaunded
<hi>Gonſallo Peres,</hi> a Marriner, with other two of his men, to

ſo leaſerly to prouide for this boat, that the night drew
on, ſo that it was thrée houres within night ere he coulde
heare of any thing what hée had done, and what for that &amp;
alſo to tarrye the comming of thoſe that went to <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas
Coello,</hi> the Captaine Generall was the willinger
to ſtay there that night. After that the Catuall had placed
the Generall in a Moores houſe, tolde him that he woulde
<pb facs="tcp:9295:58"/>
goe to ſéeke out <hi>Gonſallo Peres,</hi> &amp; the other two that went
with him. Howbeit he came not backe till it was the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
And as ſoone as the Captaine Generall had fight of
him, immediatly he required a boate for to goe in vnto
his ſhippes. But as ſoone as the Catuall heard him, he then
ſpake vnto his <hi>Nayres</hi> that were there preſent in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
who afterward willed the Captaine Generall to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde
his ſhips to be brought néere vnto the ſhoare, and
that being done he ſhoulde haue licenſe to goe his waye,
with this the Captaine Generall was ſomewhat afearde,
howbeit he aunſwered him with a ſtout ſtomacke, that as
long as he was on land, he would commaund no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to be done, forſomuch as then his brother woulde iudge
him to remaine in priſon, and that he did commaunde the
ſame to be done more for feare then any thing els, whervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he wold immediatly depart toward <hi>Portingal,</hi> without

               <p>To this the Catuall made anſwere with the others that
were with him,<note place="margin">The Catu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>als pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</note> ſpeaking with a ſtoutneſſe, that if ſo be that

they will not let him go a boord. To the which ſhewing
himſelfe to be therewith offended, he made anſwere that if
ſo be that they would not let him go, that then he wold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
to the king of <hi>Calicut,</hi> and make his complaint, who
if then he would ſtey him in his countris, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> then he would
be verie glad to dwel in the ſame. The Catuall therevpon
willed him ſo to do, &amp; to goe to the king to make his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
but yet for all his ſaieng he would not conſent ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto,
for that he had commaunded the doores of his lodging
to be kept ſhut, placing within the ſame ſundry <hi>Nayres</hi> with
their weapons. And if ſo that any of our men ſhould goe
forth, there were appointed many of the enmyes to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
them. Neuertheleſſe it was Gods pleaſure that the
Catuall durſt not venture to kill the Captaine Generall,
nor yet any of his men for all that the Moores hadde bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
him with a great ſumme of money, and for all that hée
was in great credit with the king, for hée ſtoode in ſuch a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:9295:58"/>
feare thereof, that he durſt not doe it.</p>
               <p>Tho cauſe why he required the ſhippes to be brought to
the ſhoare ſide was, for that they being there, the Moores
might the better laye the ſame a boorde, and ſo take them
and kill all thoſe that were within them, which thing for
that it did ſo manifeſtly appeare to the Captaine General,
he would not commaund the Shippes to bée brought anye
néerer. And alſo for that the ſame was ſo appareaunt
vnto the others of his men that were with him. They
gaue him counſaile not to deale therein. The Catu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
ſéeing that he would not commaunde thoſe Shippes to
bée brought néere the ſhoare, and for that there was no
cauſe to ſtaye him or offer him any wrong, and ſéeing that
hée could not kill him, did then beginne to requeſt him to
bring his Sailes and the Rudder of the Shippes a lande.
With that the Captaine Generall beganne to laugh, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng,
that he would neither doe the one, nor yet the other,
ſince that the king did giue him frée licenſe to goe without
any condition.</p>
               <p>And therefore hée willed him to doe what he would, and
how that of all the iniuryes which hée had offered him, the
king ſhoulde bée made priuie, who he knewe woulde doe
him iuſtice, but yet for all this, both hée and his remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in ſome feare of ſuſpect, although they did not outwardly
ſhew the ſame.</p>
               <p>At length the Captaine Generall with the reſt feigning
themſelues to be an hungred,<note place="margin">The Gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rals vnef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall excuſe.</note> and that they were vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided

might goe to prouide the ſame, and hée woulde remaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,
but for all that the Catuall woulde not agrée there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.
Nowe our men béeing in feare to ſée themſelues
in ſuch a daunger. Then came <hi>Gonſallo Peres,</hi> ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
that the Captaine Generall had ben at his liberty, and
that they were tarrieng for him and the others, who tolde
him that hée hadde mette with <hi>Nicholas Coello,</hi> and with
the others which tarryed for him with theyr Boates a
lande.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9295:59"/>
This newes being brought to the Captaine Generall, hée
was afeard leaſt the Catuall ſhould know thereof, which
if he had knowne indéed he would haue ſent Pinnaces and
many men in them,<note place="margin">Gonſallo Peres ſent back to the ſhips</note> for to haue taken them. Therefore did
he procure by all the meanes he could, that <hi>Gonſallo Peres</hi>
ſhoulde ſecretlye returne, from thence vnto their ſhippes,
and put themſelues in good order. And alſo that he ſhould
goe with them and informe them in what caſe he doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine.
<hi>Nicholas Coello</hi> hauing receiued this diſpatch,
did forthwith depart, and that in haſt, and immediatly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he was departed, the Catuall was aduertiſed thereof,
who ſent after him ſundrie Pinnaces well appointed, but
yet they could not ouertake him, and therefore they retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
againe vnto the Catuall. Then the Catuall after that
they were come did once more requeſt the Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
to write vnto his brother to bring the ſhippes néere
to the lande, but he could not perſwade the Captaine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
ſo to doe, ſaieng that if he ſhould doe it, yet his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
would not conſent therevnto, and although he would,
yet he knew that the companye would not. To this the
Catuall did replye, that he ſhoulde not make him beléeue
that, forſomuch as he did well know that all things ſhould
be done as he would commaund. Howbeit the Captaine
Generall wold write no ſuch letter; for that he was afeard
of the bringing of the ſhips ſo néere the ſhoare, for the cauſes

And for that he would giue as it were no outwarde
ſhew that he was offended, he would néeds come to ſupper
to him that night, at the which they hadde both Rice and
Hens, which he commaunded to be bought the day before.
The Catuall did much meruaile to ſée how little they did
paſſe for their cloſe kéeping, after that ſort, and of the great
conſtancie of the Captaine Generall, that he woulde not
commaund thoſe ſhippes to be brought néere to the ſhoare,
nor yet condeſcended to any of the other his requeſt. And
for that hée thought that it was but a follye to kéepe him

for that he gaue him frée lybertie to goe to his ſhippes.
The next day which was Saterday the ſecond of Iune, hée
then tolde him, that ſince he had certified the king that he
would bring his Merchandiſe a land, he ſhould command the

vntill ſuch time that hée were there himſelf, with this the
Catuall was content for that he thought to make himſelf
poſſeſſour of the Merchandiſe, hauing a ſpeciall hope that
they were of a great value, as the Captaine Generall had
tolde him.</p>
               <p>Then he diſpatched two of his men with a letter vnto
his brother,<note place="margin">The effect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rals letters vnto his brother.</note> in the which he had made relation after what

               <p>He that carried theſe letters béeing come to <hi>Paulo de

               <p>The Merchaundiſe béeing landed, the Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

<hi>Aluora de Braga</hi> the Scriuenor, who remained in a houſe
which the Catuall had ſought out for them. In this ſpace
the Captaine Generall made himſelfe in a readyneſſe to
goe aboorde his ſhippes, but firſt the Catuall did reforme,
and make himſelfe friendes with him.</p>
               <p>After that hée was a boorde, hée would ſend no more

thought that if ſo be that he would come a land, that there
they might doe him more hurte then a Seaboorde.</p>
               <p>And for that they woulde the rather ſo do, they beganne to
make a mocke at the merchandiſe which he had left a land.

touching their Merchants, promiſing notwithſtanding, that

had ſo vſed him, which out of doubt were naughtie chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
ſo that it did well appeare that it grieued him verye
much to heare thereof. And as touching the Merchaundiſe
he promiſed to ſende thether ſuch as ſhoulde buye the
ſame, as hée did indéede ſeauen or eyght Merchauntes, which
are Gentiles <hi>Guſarates,</hi> and with his Factour hée ſent a
<hi>Nayre,</hi> which was a principall honeſt man, to the intent
hée might remaine in the Factorye with the Factour, to
whome hée gaue commaundement diligentlye to beware
that there ſhoulde not come any Moores to kill him.</p>
               <p>But for becauſe that this was done but vnder couloure
that the Moores ſhoulde not ſéeme to ſubborne the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes,
they bought nothing, but rather did abate the
price, of the which the Moores were verye gladde, and ſaid,
that nowe it did well appeare that they were not alone
that woulde not buye of theyr Merchaundiſe, yet for all that
ther durſt come no Moore to the Factorie, they once hauing
notice that there was placed a <hi>Nayre</hi> by the kinges com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement.
And if ſo be that before they did not abide or

they vſed with our men, and how quietly they went in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut,</hi>
without receiuing either hurt of the <hi>Moores</hi> or of the

the King his Maſter, was the occaſion that almoſt in thrée
moneths that our men had trade in <hi>Calycut</hi> they did receiue
no manner hurt, either of the Moores or of the <hi>Nayres.</hi> Hée
did therfore determine to eſtabliſh the Factorie which was
there, with all ſuch Merchandize as he had lefte at that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

there was now layde a good foundation or ground worke,

to ſende againe, and if it might pleaſe God to giue him
life, that he might bring him newes of this Diſcouerie, ſo
that it ſhould not be néedfull to make any new conſent or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gréement
for the Factorie. And by the counſaile of his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
and of the other Principalls of his ſhips, he ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> a preſent, of ſkarfes of ſundry cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
of ſilkes, Coralls and other things, which was caried
vnto him by <hi>Diego Dias,</hi> deſiring the King to pardon him,
for that he was ſo bold as to ſend him that preſent, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
he did the ſame for no other purpoſe, but onelye to
ſhew what ſeruitour he was of his, who is and will bée al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
at his commandement, which was the occaſion that
he ſent it, and not for that he thought that things of ſo ſmal
valew, were of ſufficient dignitie, for to repreſent a King
withall of ſo great a power as he was. And if ſo be that he
had in his cuſtodie, that which he might eſtéeme or think to
be of a more worthie price, he would ſende it with a better
good will. And for that the time now drew néere y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to depart, he ordained for the ſame, and alſo if ſo bée
that he did minde to ſend any Embaſſadour to the King his
Maſter to confirme the amitie or friendſhip betwéen them,
he deſired him to commaund him to be in a readineſſe, for
that he had a confidence that as touching that which he had
agréed vpon with his highneſſe, as alſo preſuming on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gifts
which he had receiued at his hands, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he might as he was

but alſo for a teſtimony of the truth of his Embaſſage, &amp; of
that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King his Maſter ſhuld ſend héerafter, as ſoone
as he had news of him, &amp; alſo for confirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

one <hi>Bahar</hi> of cinamon, &amp; another of cloues, &amp; another of ſome

he had not wherewith to paye. After that <hi>Diego Dias</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9295:63"/>
had receiued his meſſage, there paſt foure dayes afore the
King would conſent that he ſhould come in his preſence, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that he went euery day vnto his Pallaice. After that
he had commanded him to come into his preſence, he view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
how and after what ſort he came laden, and therevpon
aſked him with a frowning countenaunce, what it was that
he would haue: but <hi>Diego Dias</hi> at that time was afearde,
that he would commaund him to be killed. But after that
he had told him his meſſage and would haue deliuered him
the preſent, he would not ſée it, but commaunded it to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
to his Factor. The aunſwere that he gaue touching
the Captaine generall was, that ſince he would néedes goe
his waye,<note place="margin">The kings aunſvvere vnto Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go Dias.</note> he might ſo doe: but firſt or that he doe depart, he
muſt giue him 600. <hi>Seraſynes,</hi> for ſo it was the cuſtome of
the Countrey. <hi>Diego Dias</hi> being returned with this preſent,
was accompanied by manye <hi>Nayres,</hi> which he ſéeing,
thought it to be for the beſt: but as ſoone as he was come
to the Factorie,<note place="margin">Diego Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as kept in priſon,</note> they remained at the dore, and woulde not
conſent, that he or any other ſhoulde come forth. And after
this proclamation was made in all the Citie, that vpon pain
of death there ſhould goe aboord our Fléete no boate or <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madias:</hi>
but yet notwithſtanding all this <hi>Bontaybo</hi> went,
and gaue warning to the Captaine generall in ſecrete, not to
goe a lande, nor conſent that any of his ſhould goe: for that
he knew for moſt certaine by the Moores, that if ſo be that
he or they ſhoulde ſo doe, the King would commaunde theyr
heads to be ſtroken off. And as touching all his faire words
and good entertainment, which he had ſhewed him vnto that
preſent, as alſo to giue him a houſe in the which his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
might be layd, as alſo the good entertainment that
our men had, was but méere diſſimulation, and to the ende,
he might haue taken him a lande with them, &amp; ſo haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them all to be killed, which was wrought by the
induſtrie of the Moores onely, which had made the King be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue,
that they were théeues and went a rouing, and that
he came not vnto his Harbour, but to ſteale ſuch Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
as ſhould be brought to the Citie, and alſo to eſpie the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:9295:63"/>
Countrey, and after to come with a great Fléete for to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uade
the ſame. In the ſelfe ſame order was the Captaine
generall informed by two <hi>Malabars,</hi> which are Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore now in a ſtudie what was beſt to be done, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
this aduertiſement for moſt certaine, as ſoone as it was
night, there came aboorde the Generalls ſhip, a ſlaue of the
colour blacke, which was naturally borne in <hi>Guynee,</hi> &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
vnto <hi>Diego Dias</hi> and alſo was a Chriſtian, and had
the Portingall tongue very well, who tolde him that <hi>Die<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go
Dias</hi> and <hi>Aluoro de Braga</hi> did remain in priſon, &amp; what
aunſwere the King of <hi>Calycut</hi> had made to his meſſage, &amp;
what he had commaunded to be done with his preſent, and
alſo what Proclamations there were made: <hi>Diego Dias,</hi>
for that he thought good to giue him knowledge of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which
had paſt, had bribed a Fiſher man to carrie this meſſenger,
and that in the night ſeaſon that he might not be knowen.
After that the Captaine generall had heard all this, he was
much offended therewith: howbeit, for that hée woulde ſée
the end thereof, would not depart, but did let paſſe that day,
to ſée whether that any would come aboord him. The nexte
day which was Wedneſdaye,<note place="margin">Boies ſent for ſpyes</note> being the xv. of Auguſt, there
came one onlyPinnace or <hi>Almadia</hi> aboord the General, in
the which were foure boyes, which brought fine precious
ſtones to ſell, and for that they came after ſuch ſort he tooke
them to be ſpies, and that their comming was for no other
purpoſe but to ſée what they did: and by this meanes hée
thought he might vnderſtand in what reputation they were
with the King. This was the occaſion the Captaine
generall did receiue them with as good a countenaunce as
he did before, giuing them nothing to vnderſtand y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he knew
of the impriſonment of <hi>Diego Dias,</hi> and wold not therefore
laye hand vpon thoſe, but vpon ſuch as ſhoulde come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(which as he thought ſhould be of more credite) vntill
ſuch time as he had recouered thoſe that were impriſoned.</p>
               <p>Vnto thoſe alſo he wrote a Letter by thoſe Boyes,
with fained words, ſaieng that he did vnderſtande of theyr
impriſonment: this was done in ſuch order, that if ſo be this
<pb facs="tcp:9295:64"/>
letter ſhould haue come to any other mens hands, they could
not haue vnderſtood the ſame. Theſe Boyes did deliuer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him this letter, who afterward told the king what great
entertainment they had at the Captaine generalls hands,
which made him to beléeue that he knewe nothing of the
impriſonment of his men, whereof he was very glad &amp; did
retourne and ſend aboord others, and thoſe that ſhoulde goe
had warning giuen them not to diſcloſe,<note place="margin">The king of Calicuts treſon to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wards the Captaine generall.</note> that the Factour
with the others did remaine priſoners. This was done by
pollicie, for that he made this reckoning to deceiue the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
generall on this ſort, vntill ſuch time that he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to ſende a Fléete of ſhips vpon him, or til that the ſhips
of <hi>Meca,</hi> ſhould come and take him. On this ſort went the
<hi>Malabars</hi> aboord, vnto whom the Captaine generall made
a good countenaunce, and commaunded them to be enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
very well: all this he did for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he ſaw none worth
the ſtaieng. On the Sunday next, there came ſixe principal
<hi>Malabars,</hi> with other fiftéene which waited vpon them, in
another Pinace. And for that the Captain generall thought
that for thoſe the King would ſend him his Factor and his
Scriuenour, he laid hands vpon them all, onely he lefte two
Mariners in a pinace, by whom he ſent a letter to the kings
Factors,<note place="margin">Certaine Malabars ſtayed in exchange</note> written in the <hi>Malabars</hi> tongue, in the which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
for the Factor and his Scriuenor, &amp; then he wold
ſend thoſe which he had ſtaid. The kings factor hauing peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
this letter, he enformed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which had paſt, who
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded, the Factor &amp; Scriuenor to be brought home to
his houſe as priſoners, that he might from thence ſend for
them, and to diſſemble therewith as though he knewe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of their impriſonment, &amp; ſo cauſe them to be ſent from
thence to the Captaine generall, for that he might ſend him
thoſe <hi>Malabars</hi> which he had detained, whoſe wiues made
exclamation for the impriſonment of their huſbands. And
therefore the King was the more willinger to ſet our men
at libertie, who afterward remained a while in the Kings
Factors houſe.</p>

The Captaine Generall for that he ſawe the king to

came by the Moores procurement, the which he knew wel,
that as they tooke his goods, ſo they meant to do him ſome
ſhrewd turne in his perſon, if ſo bée that they coulde haue

did therefore write vnto him a letter in the <hi>Arabian</hi>

And for that he lefte no Factorie in <hi>Calycut</hi> (the which he

ſhoulde be erected a marke with a croſſe in the ſame, with
the royall armes of <hi>Portingale,</hi> in token that the <hi>Portingals</hi>

called <hi>El Padron de Sancta Maria.</hi> Now to this day by the

along the coaſte on the Thurſdaie after, béeing the

he came to an Ankor, and going a lande to take in water
did there finde a young man, which did demaund, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the Captaine Generall, whether he were a Moore or a
Chriſtian, they aunſwered him that hée was a chriſtian.
This he did as it was thought with feare, leaſt that they
ſhould haue killed him, forſomuch as in that place there
were no chriſtians. This young man did carrie our men
within a certeine riuer, &amp; ſhewed them moſt excellent wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

following there came from the land foure others in a ſmall
boate a boord the Captaine Generall, which brought with
them to ſell many gourds and Cowcombers, and they wer
demaunded by the Generall whether there were in that
Countrie any Cinamon or Pepper. They aunſwered that
there was nothing but Cinamon, and for that he was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
to ſée the ſame,<note place="margin">Cinamon grovving.</note> he ſent with them two of his men, the

that thereof, there was a great groue, howbeit the ſame

more then 20. of that Countrie men, which brought to ſell

before dinner, our men going a lande to cut woode ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

<pb facs="tcp:9295:68"/>
for then he thought to know the ſame. And being in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe

to go vp to the top, to ſée whether that he could diſcry any
other veſſels a ſea boord or not, who being there tolde him
that he had ſight of eight great ſhips which wer incalmed,
with this newes he left his going to ſée the others, &amp; put
himſelfe in a readineſſe, the winde was in ſuch ſort that it
might ſerue them both, &amp; as they came within two leagues
of our Fléete, the Captaine Generall made toward them.
The enimies perceiuing that, did immediatly flye toward
the ſhoare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And they bearing after this ſorte, was broken
the Rudder of one of the ſame, by reaſon whereof thoſe
that were within the ſhip were forced to go in their boats
toward the lande. <hi>Nicholas Coello</hi> who was next to this
ſhip, went immediatly and layde the ſame aboord, thinking
indéede to finde in it ſome greate ſhore of riches, howbeit
there was nothing els but <hi>Cocos</hi> and <hi>Melaſus,</hi> which is a
certeine kinde of Sugar made of Palmes or Date trées.
Alſo he founde therein manye bowes, arrowes, ſwoordes,
ſpeares and targats, and the other ſeauen ranne themſelues
a ground, and for that our men could not come néere vnto
them with their ſhips, they followed them in their boats,
and from thence did beate them with their ordinaunce, ſo
that their enimyes were driuen to leaue their ſhippes, and
béeing yet the next day at an Ankor, there came vnto him
ſeauen men of the country in an <hi>Almadias,</hi> who tolde him
that thoſe eight ſhips were of <hi>Calicut,</hi> the which the king

one that had ſéene him or knowen him before, and after the

he was a Chriſtian, and borne in <hi>Italy,</hi> and that hée was
brought into that Countrey of a childe, and that his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
was with a Noble man that was a Moore, called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bayo</hi>
the which was Lord of a certaine Iland called <hi>Goa,</hi>

thereof, and would giue both them and theirs ſufficient ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing,
with the which they ſhould liue very honourably.</p>
               <p>After that he had ended thus his talke, the Captaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
aſked him perticularly for the Countrey of <hi>Sabayo,</hi>

which remained in the firme Lande, for that it was agréed

that he woulde ſende vnto him a token in ſigne thereof.
This kinde of dealing made the Captaine generall ſuſpect

               <p>
                  <hi>Paulo de la Gama,</hi> which noted the ſame, aſked of
certaine countrey men what hée was, and they vp and
tolde him, that he was a Rouer, and that he had laide a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boorde
other Shippes, which had bene there brought a
grounde before that time. The Captaine Generall béeing
thereof informed, commaunded him to be carried aboorde
his ſhippe, which was then a grounde, and there he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
him to bee well whipped to confeſſe, whether
that all or anye parte of the ſame was true that hée had

and whether he were a Moore or a Chriſtian, who
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:9295:70"/>
aunſwered that he was a Chriſtian as he had ſaid before, al
the reſt he denied, &amp; therefore the General ſought one other
more cruell torment then whipping, which was by hanging
of him vp by his members by a pulley, to hoiſt him vp and
downe: and by the great paine which he ſuffered there, he
requeſted to be let downe, for that as their he would tell
him the truth:<note place="margin">A notable cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfait diſcouered</note> and being come downe, he declared that hée
was a ſpie, and was ſent thether, to diſcouer how manye

as he was ill beloued along all that Coaſt, becauſe
he was a Chriſtian.<note place="margin">A kinde of boates ſo called</note> And that there were manyr <hi>Atalayas</hi>

that he knewe not certainelye, when thoſe fortie ſayle
woulde come. This much he declared after that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
thrée or foure torments: all the reſt they vnderſtood
by coniectures, forſomuch as he did not perticularlye declare
the ſame.</p>
               <p>The Captaine generall ſéeing that he would declare no
more, was contented with the aduice he had giuen him,
and commaunded him to priſon vnder the hatches, for to
carrie with him vnto <hi>Portingale:</hi> alſo to be cured verye
well, and to giue him ſome refreſhing of victualles. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
he tolde him that he did not minde to kéepe him pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
to haue him as his Captiue, but to carie him vnto the
King his Maſter, to the ende he might tell him ſome newes
of the <hi>Indias,</hi> knowing verye well that he would rewarde
him. Now the Captaine generall hauing knowledge of the
comming of his enimies, would therefore tarrie no longer
then whileſt his ſhip was new dreſſing, the which was done
in ten dayes.</p>
               <p>At this inſtaunt the Captaine generall was offered for
the ſhippe, the which ſhippe he had taken of the eight, that

did ſet vpon him a thouſand Fanons, but he wold not take it,
ſaieng that he wold not ſell any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was his enimies,
but commaunded the ſame to be burnt. The Captaine Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls
ſhip being ready and the water being taken in, hée
immediately departed vpon the fifth daye of October, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a Sea boord, about a two hundred leagues from thaf I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
then the Moore which he caried with him as priſoner,
ſeeing there was no other remedie, ſaid, that now he would
tell him the truth how that indéede he did dwell with the
<hi>Sabayo,</hi> to whom word was brought that the Captain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
went wandring vpon the Seas, as one that knewe
not where he was, and therefore there was in preparing a
great Fléete for to take him. The <hi>Sabayo</hi> hauing notice
thereof, commaunded him to goe thether to viſite him, and
to marke how they went, and alſo to ſée whether that hée
could bring them to <hi>Goa,</hi> which if ſo be that he could bring
to paſſe, he would as then laye hand vpon them, for that the
fame went that they were valyaunt, and ſo meant to kéepe
them to make warres againſt other Kings his next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

of thirtie perſons. And after that they began once to die,
and had continued this kinde of weather vppon the Seas,
ther aroſe ſuch a feare amongſt thoſe that did remain aliue,
that they fared in the ſame, as it were men amazed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeued
verely that they ſhould neuer goe from thence, for
that as they thought this kinde of weather was alwayes
durable there, and that the ſame was the cauſe that it indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
ſo long. The Maſters and Pilots of the Fléete were of
the lyke opinion, which made the reſt beléeue it the ſooner,
that by this meanes the crye of all thoſe that were there, as
well of them that were ſicke as of the other, was great,
ſaieng that ſince the weather would not ſerue them to goe
from thence, yet they requeſted him not to be an occaſion
of their death, but rather conſent to retourne vnto <hi>Calycut,</hi>
or els to ſome other place in the <hi>Indias,</hi> and béeing ther, to
receiue what God ſhuld appoint them, rather then to dye in
thoſe ſeas of to terrible diſeaſes, for which ther was no like<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lihoode
of any remedie, in eſpeciall hauing lacke of all other
things, as of victuals and water, which as then they began
to want, by reaſon that by their long continuaunce in the
ſaid place was all ſpent. The Captaine generall ſéeing the
great feare that his men were in, and for to animate them
the more, ſayd vnto them all on this ſorte, requeſting them
to be content, and not to beléeue that ſuch weather as was
there courſed by them on that ſorte, was alwayes lyke to
continue, for if ſo bée that it were ſo, then there woulde
be no Nauigation from the Goulph to the Strayghtes of
<hi>Meca,</hi> nor to <hi>Mylynde,</hi> nor yet from anye other place,
by the which they ſhoulde paſſe: And that it was not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
but that they might ſomewhat digreſſe from

               <p>But for all this, the Marriners woulde not beléeue
him, for that in this trouble they had continued foure mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethes,
and alſo that there were dead of theyr fellowes,

that there was not to euery ſhip ſixtéene perſons left

they thought they ſhoulde goe no further, and as they doe

doe ſo.</p>
               <p>Béeing thus determined, vppon a ſodayne there
came a freſh gale of Winde, with the which the Fléete
might goe forwarde, and with the ſame in ſixteene dayes
they came within ſight of lande, béeing on a Wedneſday

came before a goodly great Citie, which was walled round
about and within the ſame, very faire and high houſes, and
in the midſt of the ſame there was a great Pallaice, which
ſtood very high, and ſéemed to be of a goodly building, all this
they ſaw very well out of their ſhips. This Citie is called

came amongſt all the Fléete ſuch a ſtorme from the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt,
that all the Fléete was faine to take in their ſayles,
hauing the Seas very high mingled with pretie ſhowers of

abated, they brought themſelues vnder their forefailes
againe, and at night the winde being altogether calme, ſuch
ſhips as wer left behind, did ſpred out alſo their ſprit ſaile, to
ouertake thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> went before. And going by after windes, &amp;
following their courſe by the South, the Sunday being the
xxiiii. of May, the winde beganne to increaſe, which was the
occaſion that the Captaine generall commanded their ſailes
to be taken in, and to fardle vp their ſprits ſailes, the which
being done, the like did all the other Captaines, and going
on this ſort on Sunday, betwéene x. and xi. of the clocke of
the day, did begin to ariue in the Northweſt a ſpowte, with
the which the winde calmed in ſuch ſorte, that the ſailes
did beate againſt the Maſt, and the Pilots being (not as yet
acquainted with the ſecret ſignification of a ſpowte) for that
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:9295:79"/>
they had not trauayled thoſe Seas, thought the ſame to bée
a ſigne of faire weather, and of great calmes: by reaſon
whereof, they neuer made any kinde of alteration in anye
thing, appertaining to their ſayles. Vpon this on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye,
there came ſuch a winde and ſo furious, that then
they had no time to amayne and take in theyr ſayles, by
reaſon whereof, there were foure Shippes ſunke without

               <p>And after that the winde verred to the Southweſt they
bare with the ſame, the which was ſo great that they were
driuen to roue all that daye and the next night following
without ſailes, ſo that the one could not ſée the other, &amp; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
as yet the returne of any other wind was not come,
they were driuen to ſuch daunger that they thought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they ſhould looſe their liues, forſomuch as the reſt of the
Fléete was ſo caſt away before their eyes, wherewith they
were ſtroken into a very great penſiueneſſe. The next day
the winde being ſomewhat incalmed, with the ſame the
Fléete did ioyne themſelues together againe, and immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
after, the winde came to the Eaſt and Northeaſt, which
was ſo great that it made the Seas to goe higher then euer
they did before,<note place="margin">A vvo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ful ſtorme and great Seas.</note> and ſo the ſame endured the ſpace of xx.
dayes: and all this time the ſhippes laye a hull, although
they proued fiue times to hoyſe vp their ſayles, as aforeſaid.
Now the Seas went ſo high to all theyr iudgements, they
thought it vnpoſſible for the ſhippes to eſcape: for ouer and
beſides that, by the working of them it was thought, that
ſometime they did hoyſe vp theyr ſhippes aboue the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and other times when the ſhippes began to deſcend,
they fell as it were downe a monſtrous hill, that they fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
they ſhould be all ſwallowed vp in the Intralles of the
Earth.</p>
               <p>In the daye the water was of the colour of pitch, and
<pb facs="tcp:9295:80"/>
in the night of fire. The tackling with the other furniture
of the Shippes, with the great force of the winde, made
ſuch a terrible noyſe, and was ſo fearefull to heare, that
the ſame is incredible to be beléeued, but by thoſe onelye
that endured and paſſed the ſame, with the force of this,
the Fléete was ſeparated into ſundry places. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

They doe apparell themſelues very richly, in eſpeciall the

The winter in this countrie doth begin in Aprill, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth

was for this cauſe, forſomuch as he was a Moore, and wée
were chriſtians, it gréeued him to haue any conuerſation or

to <hi>Alonſo Hurtado</hi> his requeſt, in giuing the pleadges
that were demaunded, which being come to the Captaine
Generalls knowledge, he began to make himſelfe in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe
to goe and ſpeake with the king, and to remaine a
land thrée or foure daies, apointing in his place <hi>Sancho de
Toar,</hi> to whom he gaue commaundement that there ſhuld
be made for thoſe pleadges at their comming aboord good
enterteinment, and to looke well vnto them, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
them to any that ſhould come to demaunde them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
they came in his name.</p>
               <p>On the xxviii. daye of December the Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
put himſelfe in his beſt apparell, and carryed with
him thirtie of the principall men of his Fléete, which
ſhoulde remaine with him a lande, with others that were
the kings ſeruauntes, which ſhoulde attende vppon him
as vpon the kings own perſon. Hée commanded alſo to bée
carryed with him all the furniture for his Chamber and
Kitchin, with his Cupboorde of Plate, in the which there
were many rich péeces of ſiluer gilted.</p>
               <p>Nowe béeing with all theſe thinges in a readyneſſe to
depart, there came from the Citie ſundry principall <hi>Nayres,</hi>
which were commaunded by the king to attende vppon
the Captaine Generall, accompanyed with manye
men, beſides others that came ſounding vppon Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:9295:85"/>
other vppon Sackbuts and other inſtrumentes.
The Captaine generall being informed that the King was
tarrieng for him in a certaine Galerie, which onelye for to
receiue him in, he had commaunded to be made harde by the
water ſide, tooke his boate and went toward the ſhore, bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
accompanied with all the other boats of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Fléete, which
went all in good order, and ſet out with manye flagges and
trumpets, which being ioyned together as wel theſe as thoſe
that came from the Citie, made a wonderfull noyſe. With
this came thoſe pledges aboord the Generalls ſhip,<note place="margin">Pleadges are ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boorde, vvhich feare to be taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue.</note> into the
which they were loath to enter, vntill ſuch time that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

to vnderſtand that they wer afeard that they being once
aboord, he would returne againe into the Fléete, and ſo take
them for captiues. They did ſtand ſo much vpon the ſame,
that <hi>Aries Correa</hi> was faine to tell them, that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuſpition they might enter into the ſhippe, forſomuch as
the Captaine generall was not come thether for to deceiue
the King, but onely for to get his good will, with this they
were contented, to goe aboorde, yet it was with ſome feare,
that he would take them captiues. In the meane while that
we were about this the Captaine generall landed, where
there was tarrieng for him ſundry <hi>Caymales</hi> and <hi>Pymaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,</hi>
and other principall <hi>Nayres,</hi> being accompanied with
many others. And before that the Captaine generall coulde
ſet his féete on the grounde, he was taken vp, and put in
an Andor or chaire, in the which he was carried to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rame,</hi>
accompanied with the multitude aboue ſaide. Being
come to this place, he entered into a certaine houſe where
the King was, whome he founde in this order. The
houſe was hanged ouer with Carpets, or as they call them
<hi>Alcatifas,</hi> at the ende whereof, there was a certaine place
where the King was ſitting,<note place="margin">The king of Caly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuts ſtate &amp; furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> made much lyke vnto a lyttle
Chappell, and ouer the Kings head did hang the cloth of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,
of vnſhorne Crimſon veluet, and vnder him and about
him, were twentie cuſhions of ſilke. The King himſelfe
was all naked, ſauing that about his middle he had a cloth
<pb facs="tcp:9295:86"/>
made of Cotten, which was white as ſnowe, and wrought
ouer with golde. On his head he had a night cap of cloath
of golde, which was made of the faſhion of an head péece or
ſkull. On his eares he had hanging certaine Iewelles, of
Diamonds, Saphyres and Pearles, of the which ther was
two bigger then Walnuts. On his armes from the elbow
to the hande he had ſundrye Bracelettes of Golde, in the
which there were precious Sones, and that without
number, and of a wonderfull valewe. Moreouer on his
legs from the knées downward, and on the fingers of his
handes, and the toes of his feete, and eſpecially on his great
toe, there was a ring, in the which there was a Rubie ſo
great and fine, that it gaue ſuch a light as was wonderfull:
amongſt al which ſtones, ther was a Diamond bigger then
a great Beane. But all this was nothing in compariſon of
his girdell, which was made of Golde and Stone that the
ſame was aboue all price, and out of it there came ſuch a
reſplendour or brightnes, that it blinded mens eyes to looke
vpon it.</p>
               <p>There ſtoode harde by him a Chaire of Eſtate of golde
and ſiluer, wrought in the beſt manner, full of precious
ſtone, and of the ſelfe ſame ſort was the Andor in the which
he was brought from his Pallaice, which alſo ſtood there,
Alſo there were twentie Trumpets, whereof ſeauentéene
were of ſiluer, and the other thrée of golde, the mouthes
whereof, were finely wrought and ſet with ſtone. Alſo ther
was a Baſon of golde in the which he did ſpit, and certaine
perfuming pans of ſiluer, out of the which, ther came an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ſmell. And for eſtate ſake ther wer lightned certain
Lampes of Oyle, which were after the Moores order, the
which were alſo made of ſiluer. Sixe paces from the
King, ſtood his two brethren, which were heires
vnto the Kingdome after him, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

the King was very glad, and tolde the Captaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall

goe to his ſhips, and come the next day againe, to make full

went before aboord in a ſmall Pinnace, and tolde them that
the Captaine generall did retourne aboorde, this meſſenger
was ſent by the commaundement of the Clearke and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troller
of the Kings houſe, as who ſhoulde ſaye, to giue
them counſayle to come their waye, which they did, as
ſoone as they heard what the ſlaue had tolde them in their

our men and the Citie, and they béeing in ſo
great a friendſhip and concord one with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
on the next ſaterday following there
did appeare to thoſe of <hi>Calycut,</hi> a greate
ſhip of the Moores, which was far off, going
from <hi>Coching</hi> toward <hi>Cambaya.</hi> And as ſoone as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
was diſcryed, the king ſent worde to the Captaine Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
requeſting him that for his ſake he would ſend to take
the ſame ſhip, for ouer and beſides that, there were in the
ſame certeine Elephantes, yet was there one which excée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
them all, the which he woulde haue bought. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
he had offred for him more then he was worth, yet
he would not ſell him. Albeit the owner was a dweller in
<hi>Coching,</hi> and therefore he moſt earneſtly requeſted him to
ſend to take the ſayd ſhippe, forſomuch as it did ſo highlye
touch his honour and credit: vnto his requeſt, the Captaine
Generall made aunſwere that he would doe it with a good
will, although that he was informed that the ſayd ſhippe
was great, and that there were within it very many men
both Marriners and ſouldiers, and that the ſame could not
bée taken without ſome loſſe of men, and therefore it was
requiſite that he conſented that his men might kill thoſe y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
were in the ſhip, wherevnto the king agréed. This béeing
concluded, the Captaine Generall commaunded that <hi>Pedro
de Tayde</hi> with his Caruell, ſhoulde goe take the foreſayd
ſhip, and that there ſhould goe with him a young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
called <hi>Edwarte Pacheco,</hi> which was thought to bée a
valiant ſouldier, and with theſe there was a 60. men.
The king alſo ſent certeine Moores in the Caruel, that they
alſo might view the order of their fighting. The Caruell
béeing vnder ſaile gaue chace vnto the ſhippe till it was
night, which being come, they loſt ſight of the ſame, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

commaunded to beare with him, and found thoſe Moores
<pb facs="tcp:9295:90"/>
with their weapons in a readineſſe to defend themſelues
withall, howbeit as they were hoiſing vp theyr Sayles,
they eaſily iudged the ſame to be of 600. tun,<note place="margin">This ſhip for one in thoſe coaſts ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vvel ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pointed.</note> and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

were bowe men, <hi>Edwarto Pacheco</hi> woulde not laye the
ſame a boorde, for that he was commaunded to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
but to ſinke him if it were poſſible. And hauing brought
him vnder his lye, he commaunded to amaine. The Moores
making as it were a mocke of the ſame, gaue a lowd crye
and plaide vppon their Inſtruments, and after this they
ſhotte off certeine Ordinaunce which they had, and manye
arrowes, making therewith a ſhew of readineſſe that they
were in. They were anſwered by our men with ſhot, of the
which there chaunced a Pellette to ſtrike harde vnder the
boſſome of the ſhippe betwéene winde and water, where
there was made a hole by the which there entered a great
quantitye of water. After this they ſhotte againe, with the
which there were many of them ſlaine &amp; hurt, &amp; the other
trembled with the feare they had of our Ordinaunce, with
this they bare toward the baye of <hi>Canonor,</hi> the which was
harde by, where there were riding at an Ankor foure ſhips
of the Moores, amongeſt them hée came to an Ankor. Now
béeing within the ſayd Baye, arriued alſo with the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
<hi>Edwarto Pacheco,</hi> who commaunded his Ordinaunce
to be ſhotte at them, and with the ſame had taken them
all, if ſo be that there had not come certeine <hi>Paraos</hi> of the
Moores to ſuccour them, the which were in the porte, and
as they were fighting the night came on, which was the
cauſe that al thoſe <hi>Paraos</hi> were not by him deſtroied. In al
theſe encounters there was no more then nine hurt of our
men, which was done by their arrowes.</p>
               <p>Night béeing come, <hi>Edwarto Pacheco</hi> brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
forth of the Baye and came to Ankor harde by an
Ilande, for that hée was there more ſurer then in the Bay,
whereas they might haue ſette his ſhippe on fire. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
that it were contrarye to his commiſſion, yet for
all that hée retourned in the morning, and ioyned himſelfe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:9295:90"/>
with his enimyes, who as ſoone as it was daye, woulde
haue ranne theyr waye, and as they beganne to make
ſayle, hée entered vppon them in the Baye, ſhooting of his
Ordinaunce, with the which hée ſtrake the ſaide
Shippe,<note place="margin">The Moores yeelded vnto our men.</note> and by this meanes they yéelded, with this thoſe
of <hi>Cananor</hi> that were ſtanding at the water ſide, were
verye ſore agréeued and woulde haue come to ſuccour
them, who after that <hi>Edwarto Pacheco</hi> beganne to diſpend
his Ordinaunce amongeſt them; ranne lykewiſe theyr
wayes.</p>
               <p>This béeing done, hée went towarde <hi>Calycut,</hi> to the
which harbour hée arriued the next daye, where the King
came to the water ſide to ſée the ſhippe, for that they tooke
the ſame for a miracle, and gaue our men great praiſes.
The Captaine Generall commaunded the ſhippe to bée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered
vnto the king with ſeauen Elephaunts that were
within the ſame, which were worth in <hi>Calycut</hi> thirtye
thouſand crownes, ouer and beſides this, there was found
in it great ſtore of merchaundiſe, beſides thoſe men whom
hée tooke captiues. Alſo hée ſent the king word that hée née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
not to meruaile that ſo ſmall a Caruell as that was
could take ſuch a great ſhippe, for that in matters of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
waight he woulde be at his commaundement, for the
which hée ſent him great thanks, and praied him to ſende
vnto him thoſe men that had done ſo notable an act, whom
he did receiue very well, and with great honour, and gaue
them great gifts, in eſpeciall to <hi>Edwarto Pacheco.</hi>
Some affirme that after that the king had ſéene this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
act that our men had done being ſo few, he had them
from thence forth in ſome feare, &amp; was deſirous to ſée them
diſpatched out of his countrie, &amp; therefore did conſent vnto

the king did gratifie them all very much, and tolde them
that he woulde haue a ſpeciall care of all that which they

that ſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was to ſee the experience of their valiant minds,
&amp; alſo why he did conſent to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lading of their ſhips, was to
the end there might remaine in the countrie their monye
which they brought to buie merchaundiſe withall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as he did to ſuch merchants as come into his port.
Alſo at the laſt he did promiſe that he woulde not forſake
them for any ſtraunger. Yet for all this, the Moores did not
remaine fully ſatiſfied, becauſe the king did not command
vs to depart out of the citie of <hi>Calycut,</hi> and not ſuffer our
men to trade ther any longer, for that was the principalleſt
thing that they did pretende. Howbeit they woulde not
let but entermeddle in all our matters, eſpeciall in the bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
of our Spices, which they did openly buye, and ſent
them ſecretly vnto other places. This was done with a
determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they could not away with our men, but
wold reſiſt them, our men béeing thus reſiſted might then
haue occaſion the better to defend themſelues, &amp; ſo by this

to deſtroy our men openly, for that they were manye
more in number then ours were, they hoped that when this

parts. Alſo they wrought by all meanes poſſible to haue

a great griefe to the Captaine Generall,
forſomuch as thereby he perceiued verye
well that the friendſhip of the king was not ſteadfaſt, but
that he was a lyar, and a man that vſed no truth at all.
And if ſo be that he had not tarried there ſo long time as

Howbeit the Captaine general was loath to deale therwith

taken the ſaid ſhippe, the Moores through the Kings fauour
would riſe againſt them. And this was the aunſwere that
was ſent to the Factor: yet for all that he did require him
once more to take that ſhip, ſaieng, that if he did not, that
then the King ſhuld be in hazarde to looſe ſuch Merchandize

as they made but little reckoning thereof he ſent the

After that this report came to the owner of the ſhips know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
they made the Moores priuie héereof, whereof they
were very glad, for that by this meanes there was offered
vnto them occaſion to fall out with our men. Héerevppon,
they began in a furious outrage,<note place="margin">The Moores moued a tumult a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our men.</note> running out of their dores
like madde men, complaining vpon vs and our people, by

King, with whom went the owner of the ſhip, complaining
alſo vpon our men for the detaining of his ſhip, ſaieng that
our men had bought and laden much more ſpices &amp; drugs,
then that the Merchaundize came vnto which they hadde

for taking of the ſhip in the which was the Elephant. And
further waying with himſelfe, how little or none occaſion
at all there was giuen to vſe ſuch treaſon againſt our men,
he did therefore determine to reuenge himſelfe vpon y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King
of <hi>Calycut,</hi> if ſo be that he did not vſe ſome excuſe for that

But the King of <hi>Calycut</hi> was farre off from the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for he was very glad of that which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Moores had done,
and commaunded all ſuch Merchaundize to be taken, as

thouſand duckets, &amp; alſo take all ſuch of ours as wer found
aliue for captiues, although they were hurt, of the which
there were foure that died. After all this, the Captaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
ſéeing that in all that daye the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> ſent no
meſſenger to excuſe himſelfe of the fact, he put the matter
in queſtion, wheras it was determined that he forthwith
ſhuld reuenge thoſe iniuries that were paſt, for feare leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>if
he ſhould delay ſo to doe, that then the King might haue
time to arme his Fléete, which would not then be ſo eaſelye
done. This being determined our men put themſelues in a

yet for all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> our men did ioyne with them, &amp; fought
with them ſo valyantly, that they brake their order, killing
many of them, and of thoſe that remained ſome leaped into
the water and were drowned, others hid themſelues in their
ſhips, and other were taken aliue, whom the Captaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
commaunded to priſon, that they might afterwarde
ſerue for Mariners in the Fléet. The ſhips being thus come
into our mens poſſeſſion, they found within the ſame ſome
Spices and other Merchaundize which were hidden within
them: alſo they found thrée Elephants, which the Captaine
generall commaunded to be killed and ſalted for their victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls,
he commaunded alſo thoſe Moores that were ſlaine to
be told, and there was found of them 600. The ſhips being
diſcharged of all that they had, they wer ſet a fire before all
the Citie, in the ſight of many that came to the water ſide
to ſuccor them, whom being Moores, as they were comming
in their <hi>Almadias,</hi> our men encountered and fought with
them, but they durſt not goe forward for feare of the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce.
This was a wonder to thoſe of the Citie, to ſée ten
ſhips burnt together. The King alſo was ſory therefore for
that he could not ſend to ſuccour them. But if that which
was done this day was a wonder to the enimies to behold,
then y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> next day was much more to be meruailed at, for the
Captaine generall not being contented with the burning of
theſe ſhips commaunded his ſhips in the night to be brought
<pb facs="tcp:9295:96"/>
as néere the ſhore as he could, the one ſomewhat ſeparated
from the other. They had alſo their boats before them, that
they might reach the moſt part of the Citie. As ſoone as the
morning began to appeare, immediately all the great Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
went off amongſt their houſes, which after that the
enimies had ſéene, and how néere our ſhips lay to the ſhore,
they began to ſhoote at the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with ſmal péeces which they had
without hurting any of our men, howbeit of our ordinance,
for that the enimies came running in flockes, there was no
péece that miſt, and by that meanes there were manye that
fell, and the others that drew towards the Citie, where our
ordinaunce alſo had made a great deſtruction, as well in the
Temples of their Gods, as in their dwelling houſes. The
feare was ſo great amongſt the Citizens,<note place="margin">The feare that the King of Calicut and the citizens were in.</note> that the King of
<hi>Calycut</hi> himſelfe was driuen to leaue his Pallaice, and to
goe out of the Citie, for that our men went thether to ſéeke
him out with their pellets, ſo that hard at his héeles they kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
a <hi>Nayre,</hi> which was a noble man, and ouerthrewe part
of the Kings Pallaice. This deſtruction dured no more but
this daye: and whileſt it was a doing, there appeared two

ſeuen néere to the land ready to ſuccour them, in which there
came a multitude of Moores to defend them, and for that our

And the Captaine generall contenting himſelfe with that
which he had done in <hi>Calycut,</hi> for that it was verye late to

This Citie is buylded much after the manner of <hi>Calycut,</hi>

               <p>In this Countrey is great ſtore of Pepper, and the moſt

of the behauiour and propertie of the King of <hi>Calycut:</hi>

               <p>The Kings of <hi>Coching</hi> are in great ſubiection to the

for ſuch commodities as there were in <hi>Coching,</hi> with the
which if ſo be that the King wer not contented, that then he
would buy the ſame for ready mony, wherof he had brought
with him great ſtore, and therefore his requeſt was that in
trucke of his merchandize, or for his ready money he would
giue him lading for foure ſhips. The anſwere that the king
made to this meſſenger, was, That he was very glad of his
comming to this his Port, for that he was wel informed of
his ſtrength and valiantneſſe, and therfore he eſtéemed them
all the better, as héereafter he ſhould well perceiue. And as
for ſuch Spices as he had there, he would giue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame
in trucke of his Merchaundize y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he had brought with him
from <hi>Portingale,</hi> or els for money as he ſhould thinke beſt.

he ſhould thinke good to prouide the ſaid lading, &amp; for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance

The Captaine Generall was well contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
who had the ſending of thoſe pleadges ſo quietly a
boord, for a good beginning, and therfore he ſent immediatly
for Factor of this lading <hi>Gonſallo Gilbarboſa,</hi> which

               <p>The king hauing notice of the comming of the Factor
a land, ſent to receiue him the Rogedor of the Citie, who
went accompanyed with many noble men of the Courte,
who brought them before the king. This king euen as his
rents did farre differ in value from the king of <hi>Calycuts,</hi>
ſo he did alſo differ very much in his eſtate, not onely for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
furniture of his perſon, but alſo of the place in the which
he was in. For there appeared nothing elſe but the verye
bare walls. The king himſelfe was ſitting within certeine

come before the king, did preſent vnto him a preſent which
the Captaine Generall ſent him, which was a Baſon of
ſiluer to waſh his hands in, full of Saforne, and a greate
Ewer of ſiluer full of roſe water, beſides certeine braun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches

for he iudged that the fewer ther remained a land, the few<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

it was apparaunt that they durſt not come to the place

where as then did remaine ſome of our men, and alſo
how the King of <hi>Cananor</hi> ſhewed himſelfe very curteous.
This as it appeared, was written by <hi>Pedro de Tayde,</hi> to
aduertiſe all ſuch Captaines as ſhould paſſe by to <hi>Calycut.</hi>
The Captaine generall with the other Captaines peruſing
this letter, did then determine, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it was not requiſit, to leaue
the Caruell in <hi>Sofala,</hi> for that they had but few men, which
was not aboue foure ſcore. And with this they thought it
conuenient to go to <hi>Quiloa,</hi> where they founde a baniſhed
man, whom <hi>Pedro Aluares</hi> had left there, who likewiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
the Generall, what <hi>Pedro Aluares</hi> had paſt in <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut,</hi>
the which he had learned of certaine Moores, and alſo of

where he thought conuenient to take in his water.
And being there arriued, there came in vpon a ſodaine, ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
great ſhippes of <hi>Cambaya,</hi> which were bounde into the
Straights. The Moores wold haue fought with our fléete,
but our ordinaunce was the cauſe that they durſt not laye
vs aboord, and ſo they went their way. After this, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
generall departed to <hi>Cananor:</hi> where he talked with
the King, which certified him of that which had likewiſe
paſt in <hi>Calycut</hi> with <hi>Pedro Aluares,</hi> and what he had done,
and how he offered him lading for thoſe ſhips which he had
brought with him. Alſo he certified him, how deſirous hée
was to be at the King of <hi>Portingales</hi> commaundement: yet
for all theſe faire words, the Captaine generall woulde not
take in there any lading, vntill ſuch time he had ben at <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>

from that time forwarde the <hi>Nayres</hi> to take a care of

giue lyttle for the ſame: and alſo aduiſed thoſe that ſell the

therefore they tolde him that if ſo be he had brought no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney

no reckoning of the ſame. And therefore for that the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
had brought none, he would tarrie there no longer,
but returned to <hi>Cananor,</hi> to take in there his lading, where
the King was ſo great a friend to the King of <hi>Portingale,</hi>
that when he vnderſtood, that he had brought no money, he
remained his ſuretie for a thouſand Quintall of Pepper, &amp;
for fiftie of Ginger,<note place="margin">Euerye Quintall is a 100. vvaight.</note> &amp; for foure hundred &amp; fiftie Quintall of

vntill ſuch time he had made ſales of all ſuch Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize
as he had brought with him, which he had lefte in

<pb facs="tcp:9295:104"/>
from thence he ſhould returne with the firſt winde, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which
as then did begin to blow, and therefore he would tarry no
longer. To the intent therefore they ſhuld not depart with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their lading, he ſhewed the Captaine generall this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.
The Captaine generall ſeeing this his curteous dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
did commend vnto his cuſtodie certaine of his men, the

taken in, then on the xv. of December, ther did appeare
in the Sea lxxx. <hi>Paraos,</hi> which were paſt the Mount <hi>Dely.</hi>
Whereof the King hauing knowledge, he ſent word imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to the Captaine generall, that thoſe were the Fléete
of <hi>Calycut,</hi> that came onely to ſet vpon him, and therefore
it were good he ſhuld command his men to diſimbark them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
&amp; their ordinance:<note place="margin">The king of Calicut ſent lxxx. Paraos to fight with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> captain generall</note> vnto which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> captain general made
aunſwere, that he would not ſo doe. For if ſo be that the
enimies came with that intent, he had a hope in God y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he
ſhould be able to defend himſelfe: and with that he put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
in a readineſſe. The next day following, which was the
xvi. day of December, before y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> dawning of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> day, ther was
come into the Bay to the number of 100. ſhips and <hi>Paraos,</hi>
which wer all full of Moores, béeing ſent of purpoſe, for that
the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> was informed, that they were there ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
in of their lading, ſo that he thought by that meanes
that neither ſhip nor man ſhould eſcape, and therefore they
lay as they did about the Baye. As ſoone as the Captaine
generall had viewed them, he remoued from the place wher
he was at an Ankor, and brought himſelfe into the middes
of the Baye, leauing order with his ſhips, that they ſhould
lay on loa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d with their ordinaunce which they had, with the
which he commaunded them foorthwith to begin to ſhoot off:
which was done in ſuch ſort, that they did neuer ceaſe. And
if ſo be that he had not done ſo, doubtleſſe the enimies wold
haue laid their ſhips aboord, by reaſon there were ſo manye:
So that it was vnpoſſible for him to eſcape, if God of his
goodneſſe had not fauoured him, and prouided by his mercie,
that the enimies brought no Ordinaunce with them.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:9295:104"/>
Wherefore they were the bolder to diſpend amongſt them
their ſhot, with the which there were many very ſore hurt,
ouer and beſides great numbers that were ſlaine, and their
ſhips and <hi>Paraos</hi> ſunke, for they durſt not venter to lay our
ſhips aboord, nor yet had killed or hurt any of our men. The
fight dured vntill ſuch time it was Sunne ſet, then the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
helde vp a flagge. But, for that he feared they meant
thereby ſome deceipt, he did not leaue off ſhooting: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
they might haue thought he had ſo done, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was
wearied, or els for feare. But it was nothing ſo, for they did
it for the deſire they had of peace, in reſpect of the hurt and
loſſe of their men,<note place="margin">This flag was a ſign &amp; requeſt of peace.</note> which they had receiued at our mens
hands, whereby they were driuen to ſuch neceſſitie, that if
ſo be that the winde had ſerued, they had hoyſed vp theyr
ſayles and gone theyr way, and therefore they kept vp their
flagge. The Captaine generall perceiuing their meaning,
(and for that the moſt part of his Ordinaunce was broken,
with the continuall ſhooting thereof, did anſwere them with
another flagge, which was done by the councell and conſent
of the other Captaines: and immediatelye vppon the ſame,
they ſent a Moore, which came in a ſmall Boate vnto him,
whoſe meſſage was, to demand peace till the next day, which
was by him graunted, with this condition, that they ſhould
tarrie no longer in the Baye, but go into the open Sea, &amp; ſo
they did. The generall (although y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wind was partly againſt
him) made likewiſe his courſe into the Sea, although it wer
troubleſome vnto him. The Moores could not doe the lyke,
for their ſhippes and <hi>Paraos</hi> can beare no ſayle but with a
forewinde. Yet for all the trouble that was paſt, the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
came to an Ankor hard by them, and for all that he vſed
in the night a great and vigilant watch, by the which they
hearde the enimies rowing in their boates towardes our
Fléete, yet before that they were knowen, they wer almoſt
vpon him: their intent as it was preſuppoſed, was to ſet our
Fléete a fire. The Captaine Generall fearing this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
to vyere more of the Cabells, that he might bée
the farther off from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9295:105"/>
And perceiuing that the enimies did yet followe them, he
then commanded a péece to be ſhot of at them, with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which

The reſt of the merchaundiſe which were of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

Generall ſéeing this, forthwith commaunded <hi>Steuen de la

Howbeit the Moores did defende themſelues as deſperate
men,<note place="margin">Deſperate minds in time of ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tremitie.</note> not fearing death. Some there were of them that
tooke firebrands and threw the ſame into one of the ſhips,
with determination to ſet the ſame a fire. Others y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> threw
the like at their heads. And for that the night drew on,
they left them there, becauſe the Captaine Generall was
not of that minde, they ſhould remaine there in the darke,
for feare leaſt the Moores ſhould kill ſome of our men.
Howbeit he gaue commaundement, that the foreſaid ſhippe
ſhoulde be watched, that the Moores ſhoulde not runne to
lande, which was hard by. The Moores all that night did
nothing elſe but crie out to <hi>Mahoma</hi> to ſuccour and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
them from vs. The dawning of the day béeing come,
the Captaine Generall commaunded once more that <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
de la Gama</hi> with ſome of the Marriners of his ſhippe
ſhould goe and lay the Moores ſhip a boord, and ſet the ſame
a fire againe, which was ſo done. Now after that he hadde
made the Moores to flie and to ioyne themſelues in the
poope of their ſhip, fighting alwaies with them, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the which, certeine of his Marriners and Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
would not leaue them vntill ſuch time the ſhip was
halfe burnt. When the Moores ſawe the fire, ſome there
were that leaped into the ſea with hatchets in their hands,
which they carried ſwimming, with determination to kill
all thoſe that did purſue them with boats, whom lyke wild
men deſperately bent they did ſet vppon. Yet for all that
there were many that were hurt, for that they came néere
to our boates ſide. Howebeit the moſt parte of them was
ſlaine, and thoſe that remained in the Shippe were drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
within the ſame, for that the ſhip did ſinke. There
were of them in all thrée hundred, whereof there was not

that for his ſake he woulde aduenture to looſe his

neuer forget that good will: and in his name he promiſed
to fauour and ſuccour him in ſuch ſort, that he ſhoulde not
onely haue his kingdome in great aſſuraunce, but alſo that
he would ayde him to conquere others. He willed him alſo
not to feare thoſe Letters that the King of <hi>Calicut</hi> hadde

               <p>Theſe wordes were ſpoken afore many of his <hi>Nayres,</hi>
of the which the King was verye gladde that they heard

ſorye that we had the Factory graunted in <hi>Coching.</hi>
Therefore the Captaine Generall promiſed vnto the King

<hi>Diego Pieres,</hi> for that theyr ſhips were great ſaylers, went
before them all, and theſe were the firſt that did giue the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet

with the one alone, and <hi>Pedro Raphael,</hi> and <hi>Diego Pieres</hi>
with the other. Their méeting was with ſuch a valyaunt

ſuch time the Captaine generall with the other ſhippes
drewe néere, who did alwayes ſhoote off at them. In the

could towarde the ſhoare. The Captaine generall for feare
of the loſſe of ſome of his ſhippes, would not followe, the
rather for that they were all laden: Howbeit, our men
leapte into theyr boates, and there fought with thoſe that
were ſwimming in the water, and ſlewe them all: the
which were néere to the number of thrée hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>After this the Captaine Generall commaunded to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge

All the noble men of the Court went as farre as

ſince he did the ſame vnto thoſe that are of his ſect, and

doe not vſe ſo to doe, nor yet paye ſo well, nor vſe ſo much

there was none that did complaine of them, but onely
the Moores, which they did, for that they are their enimies,
and being mooued with enuy to ſée them pertakers of their

of them, it is not to be iudged that it is to hinder thée:
<q>but he receiued them as he would anye other merchaunt

Theſe words were ſpoken by <hi>Nambeadarin,</hi> with ſuch
a ſtomacke and ſo lyberally to the King, that they were by
him well taken: In one reſpect, for that he was a very va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyaunt
Gentleman, and in another, for that he was with
him in great credit and authoritie. And for this cauſe they
hadde him in great reputation: Inſomuch, that if the
Moores and Caymayles had not ſhewed themſelues verye
ſtout againſt him, the King woulde not haue gone forward
with his enterpriſe to make wars againſt the King of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching.</hi>

Howbeit, they ſtood vppon their reputation ſo much,
that they thought it would be a great imbaſing to their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite,
in eſpecially hauing aſſembled ſo great a power as the
King had done, and not to goe forward, or at the leaſt to do
ſome what afore they did retourne. By meanes whereof, it
was poſſible, that the King of <hi>Coching</hi> hearing of theyr
comming, would now doe that for feare, which hée would
not otherwiſe doe before, béeing prayed. After all this,
the King of <hi>Calycut</hi> would néedes know of his Witches,
what daye was good to march forward in with his Armie,
who appointed him a fortunate one, and promiſed him the
victory againſt the King of <hi>Coching,</hi> and that as yet there
would come vnto him more men. With this certainetie,
which the Witches had comforted the King withall, which

in feare of him, for that he hadde not

as all thoſe that he hoped had fauoured him, were tourned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:9295:118"/>
him: yea, euen thoſe that were his owne ſubiectes,
whome if he hadde on his ſide, he had bene ſure to haue
giuen the King of <hi>Calycut</hi> the ouerthrow. Therefore, for
that he had but few men, he was greatly afeard thereof, and
the rather,<note place="margin">The very ſight of our men abhorred in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</note> for that of thoſe there, the moſt part ſerued him
againſt their will, in eſpecially they that were dwellers in
<hi>Coching,</hi> which did abhorre y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very ſight of our men, where
vpon they openly ſpake it, that it were good that the King
of <hi>Coching</hi> ſhould deliuer our men to the king of <hi>Calycut,</hi>
or els that he put them out of <hi>Coching,</hi> and ſo he might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
himſelfe of theſe warres. Moreouer, there were many
of the inhabitants of <hi>Coching,</hi> that ranne their wayes, and
left their houſes, and all for feare of this warre. Our men
alſo on the other parte were gretly afearde to ſée this tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult,
which gaue them occaſion to waye the daunger that
they wer in, for all that the king did warrant them. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Factor fearing the ſucceſſe thereof, procured ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
of the King to goe to <hi>Cananor,</hi> hoping that there, they
ſhould be very quiet, vntill ſuch time the fléete ſhould come

ſhould breake vp thoſe warres, that were pretended againſt
him, and alſo his Subiectes be the better contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>But at thoſe words the King ſéemed to be in heauines,<note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere vvhich the king of Coching made to the factor</note> &amp;
tolde the Factor, that now it appeared very well, that he had

to depart, and therfore he told him he would giue him none:
but rather requeſted him earneſtly not to haue any ſuch mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſt,
for he there gaue him his worde, and it ſtoode him ſo

would rather looſe his Kingdome and lyfe withall, then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyuer
them to the King of <hi>Calycut,</hi> or to other that ſhould
doe them any harme. And if ſo be that his euill Fortune
were ſo great that he ſhould looſe <hi>Coching,</hi> yet there would
not lacke a place of ſufficient ſtrength to ſende them vnto,

And although ſayd he, the king of <hi>Calycut</hi> ſhoulde come
with a great power, yet for all that he is not aſſured of the
victory: for it is ſéene many times that few with valyant
hearts,<note place="margin">Fevve ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the right on their ſide, preuayle moſt times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers that come in an euill cauſe.</note> doe giue the ouerthrowe vnto great numbers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

&amp; to pray vnto their God to giue him y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> victory. With theſe
words, knowing well that the King did ſpeake them with a
louing minde, our men remained ſomewhat eaſed of the
feare wherein they were, and would haue kiſſed his hands,
but he would not ſuffer them ſo to doe, nor yet woulde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée
that they ſhould helpe him in his warres, which they
did offer him to do, but aunſwered them, that he would not
place them in anye ſuch daungerous place, for that it ſtoode
vpon his credite ſo much to kéepe them alyue. And for that
they ſhould remaine as witneſſes, how much he did trauell
to ſaue their lyues, therefore from thencefoorth he committed
the kéeping of them vnto certayne <hi>Nayres,</hi> ſuch as he had a
confidence in.</p>
               <p>And that this mutenie might ceaſe, and they from thence

he commaunded to be called afore him all his Noble men,

               <p>I Cannot but be verye heauie,<note place="margin">The king of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to his noble men.</note> to ſée ſo lyttle truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne
in you: For I meruayle nothing at all at the

enforceth to vſe all kinde of villanye. But of you, I doe
greatlye meruayle that are <hi>Nayres,</hi> that haue bene alwaies
true in your dealyngs, that you now would haue me break
my worde and promiſe, <q>that I haue alreadye giuen to the
Captayne Generall, concerning theſe Chriſtians, which
was to kéepe his men to the vttermoſt of my power, and
to looke that no man ſhoulde doe them anye harme or
vyolence, but alwayes for to haue as good a regarde
<pb facs="tcp:9295:119"/>
vnto them as vnto mine owne naturall ſubiects. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he left them in this my Citie, which was done alſo by
your conſents. And ſince you doe perceiue, that the King of
<hi>Calycut</hi> hath a fewe more men then I, ye would perſwade
me to doe contarry to my promiſe: ſo that if I were of ſo
ill a nature as you would haue me to be, then ought you of
all other to abhorre me, and crye out vpon me. Be ye héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
your owne Iudges, If you remained with anye other
King vpon his word, would you allow that as well done in
him, which you would haue me doe, by theſe Chriſtians?
In eſpeciall, counting him as we account of this man, for
our enimy, hauing none occaſion ſo to be, as the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut:</hi>
and I your King, hauing no occaſion to deliuer you,
as I haue none to delyuer theſe Chriſtians? Which, ſince
it is ſo, what is the councell that ye minde to giue me héer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,</q>
that may not be reprhended in another? If it be for that
you are afeard of the King of <hi>Calycut,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">It is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to dye vvith ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, then to lyue vvith the infamous name of a rude and lieng Prince.</note> then know this, that
it were better to dye an honourable death then to liue with

then to be ſubiects to a ruſticall and a falſe King, in eſpeciall
againſt theſe Chriſtians, who haue brought me ſo great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite
as they haue done. And as for the King of <hi>Calycut,</hi> hée
well knoweth that if he wold haue conſented that the Fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
might haue bene ſetteled in his Citie, he might haue
<q>kept them in his Countrey. But now becauſe they are
gone he mooueth theſe warres, the rather, for that hée well
knoweth my power is but ſmall, and therfore mindeth to
reuenge on me the loſſe he hath receiued. If his meaning be
none other, then to hunt theſe Chriſtians out of the <hi>Indias,</hi>
and to fight with him, whoſoeuer receiueth them into his
Countrey, why then doth he not beginne his warres firſt
with the King of <hi>Cananor?</hi> But that is not the occaſion
onely, but the enuie which he hath to ſée me benefited, and
for that with his pride he ſuppoſeth, that I am not able to
reſiſt him. All this doe I very well vnderſtand, and moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
I doe receiue comfort in preſeruing of theſe Chriſtians,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:9295:119"/>
hoping in God, that he therefore will giue me the victory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him. And as touching you that are my friends, I
pray you therefore to ſtand to me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now all that were preſent héereby, ſéeing this his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
meruailed greatlye at his conſtancie, and craued

greate rewards, to the ende therby he might winne them to

how few people were left in <hi>Coching,</hi> &amp; what feare thoſe

which was a greate friend of ours,
as I haue before declared, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eng
that the king of <hi>Calicut</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to ſet vppon <hi>Coching,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:9295:134"/>
that he might defend the entering into the harbour, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer
armie ſhould come. And for the furtheraunce of this
enterpriſe, he had gotten the good will of all the nobilitye
of <hi>Malabar,</hi> and that alſo for certeintie it was bruited, that
the king of <hi>Cananor</hi> and the king of <hi>Coulan</hi> would ſecretly
aide him. Ouer and beſides all this, that the Merchauntes
Moores did offer him great helpes toward the ſame. After
the ſelfe ſame ſorte, did <hi>Franciſco Reynel</hi> write vnto him a
fewe dayes after, and how that the king of <hi>Calycut</hi> was
preparing of ſouldiers, beſides that hée had commanded much
ordinaunce to be made, and that the Moores of <hi>Coching</hi> were
greatly in his fauour, and therfore he did aduertiſe him not
to truſt much vnto them: within two daies after the receipt
of theſe letteres, the king of <hi>Coching</hi> we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to viſit <hi>Franciſco

him, how many daungers he had bene in for the maintei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
of our friendſhip, and for that cauſe his owne ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects
had riſen againſt him, and that nowe they minded to
doe the like. Yet notwithſtanding he had ſuch a hope in our
men, and our helpe, that he deſired none other ſuccour for to

                  <hi>Franciſco de Alburquerque,</hi> aunſwered him,
that if ſo be that he did well knowe whether hée hadde
gotten, by ſuch loſſes as hée hadde receiued, for the fauour
which he had ſhewed vnto our men, he would receiue other
greater loſſes if it were poſſible. For ſetting a ſide the great
renoune and fame which he hadde gotten of a true and
valiaunt Prince, <q>hée hadde alſo recouered for a friende the
king of <hi>Portingale,</hi> which is Lorde of ſuch ſubiects as hée
hath ſéene, who alſo are his to obeye and ſerue him in all
thing, when néede ſhould require.
<pb facs="tcp:9295:135"/>
And farther, that they would with ſmall trouble make him
Lord of greater cities then <hi>Coching,</hi> and that alſo he might
beléeue, that euen as they did reſtore him vnto his eſtate,
euen ſo they would conſerue him in the ſame. And although
that there were made with the King of <hi>Calycut</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
peace that could be, yet he ſayde he had ſo ſmall a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
in his dooings, that he would not leaue him without
an armie of ſhips, before that he departed from the <hi>Indias,</hi>
for that he did well know, how little truth that King vſed.
And if ſo be, that vntil this time he had diſſembled with him,
it was onely to ſée whether by this meanes he might lade
his ſhips, for otherwiſe he could not do it, in eſpeciall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> time
being as it is ſo néere ſpent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>With this aunſwere, the King was ſatiſfied: and ſince
that <hi>Franciſco de Alburquerque</hi> could haue no more Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
then that he had, which was but a ſmall quantitie, hée
determined to depart toward <hi>Portingale,</hi> but firſt he would
nominate him that ſhould remaine in the <hi>Indias</hi> for Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
generall, that the King of <hi>Coching</hi> ſhould vnderſtand
the ſame. And for that he knew, that he that was appoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
would thinke it very dangerous to remaine there, with
ſo few men as he was able to leaue him, he durſt commit
it to none of his Captaines. Howbeit after that he had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the ſame to them all, and they were not willing to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
it,<note place="margin">Edwarte Pacheco apointed Captaine generall for the Indias<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

hée ſhould get in remaining in the <hi>Indias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when it was once ſpread abroad &amp; knowne to the

appointed, he was well pleaſed therewith, for that he hadde
heard before of his valour. This being concluded vppon,
<hi>Franciſco de Alburquerque</hi> made ſaile, carrieng with him
all the reſt of the Fléete. But firſt he gaue the king to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
that he did carry the ſame no further then to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanor,</hi>
for becauſe of the Fléete of <hi>Calycut,</hi> which might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
with him, and ſo worke him ſome diſpleaſure in his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:9295:135"/>
Port, where he minded to ſtay (as he did) procuring the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
of <hi>Rodrigo Reynel</hi> and the others that were there.
This determination being knowen to the King of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lycut,</hi>
he ſent him word, that it were not requiſite that hée
ſhould haue him away, but rather offered him, if ſo be that
he would tarrie, to giue him the Pepper that he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to delyuer. But hearing this, he ſuppoſed that he gaue
the ſame out, that <hi>Rodrigo Reynel</hi> with the others, ſhould
be the more deſirous to remaine in the <hi>Indias.</hi> At this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaunt
came in <hi>Alonſo de Alburquerque</hi> which retourned
from <hi>Coulan,</hi> and the time being ſpent, he would not tarrye
there any longer, but with the reſt went toward <hi>Cananor.</hi>
And being there arriued, there came a letter from <hi>Rodrigo
Reynel,</hi> in the which he wrote vnto him, that the King of
<hi>Calycut</hi> was certainly bent to ſet vpon <hi>Coching,</hi> immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
after that he were gone. And that all thoſe diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which he did vſe in offering to giue him Pepper, was
but for feare he had conceiued that he would haue burnt his
ſhips, which were as then in his harbour. This newes the
Captaine generall kept cloſe to himſelfe, that the ſame ſhuld
not come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> eares of <hi>Edwarte Pacheco,</hi> vnto whom was
lefte the ſhippe in the which he went, and two Caruells, of
the which were Captaines <hi>Pedro Raphael</hi> and <hi>Diego Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eres,</hi>
beſides a ſhippe boate.</p>
               <p>Alſo they lefte him foure ſcore and tenne men, and thoſe
whole, that were néedfull, for all the reſt were ſicke. Alſo,
there was left him, the moſt parte of the Ordinaunce, with

Now being knowen to them all, of the great power that

that <hi>Edwarte Pacheco</hi> would accept the ſame, in eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,

                  <hi>FRanciſco de Alburquerque</hi> béeing departed towardes
<hi>Portingale, Edwarte Pacheco</hi> which remained for
Captaine Generall in the <hi>Indias,</hi> hauing a while ſtayed
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:9295:136"/>
in <hi>Cananor</hi> to take in there his victualles, brought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
vnder ſayle, and came to an Ankor without the point
of <hi>Cananor,</hi> and from thence hée ſent <hi>Pedro Raphaell</hi>
to goe a long the Coaſt, and to cauſe all ſuch Shippes as
he coulde diſcrye to beare with the Captaine, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
him for their Generall. At this inſtaunt was
<hi>Diego Pieres</hi> a newe rigging of his Caruell in <hi>Coching.</hi>
And all theſe Shippes that were brought before the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
gaue an account whether they were bounde, and
what they carryed, and alſo of whence they were. And if
ſo bee that hée founde anye Pepper, hée woulde take the
ſame, as hée did from ſome other ſhippes that were bound
to <hi>Calycut,</hi> in the which order hée vſed ſuch rigour, that
afterwarde hée was feared of all men.</p>
               <p>Whileſt hée was thus at an Ankor, there came vppon
him in the night a Fléete of twentye and fiue Saile of
Shippes, which vppon a ſodeine made him to coniecture
that they were of <hi>Calycut.</hi> And ſéeing himſelfe in ſuch
daunger, hée commaunded to let ſlippe their Gabells by
theyr Halſis, for that vppon ſuch a ſodeine they coulde not
weye theyr Ankors with theyr Capſteines, and with the
ſame he cut and made his courſe into the Sea, to bring
himſelfe in the winde of thoſe Sayles, vppon whome hee
commaunded to ſhoote off all his Ordinaunce. And as they
were ſhippes laden with Rice, ſo ranne they their waye as
faſt as they coulde. Some there were that ranne a grounde,
and more hurt had bene done, had it not béene for a greate
ſhip of the Moores that came in their company,<note place="margin">A valiant ſkirmiſh vvith an hot ſhip of the Moores.</note> in the which
were well néere to the number of 400. Moores, that were of
the kingdome of <hi>Cananor.</hi> Theſe thinking that they might
take our ſhippe, came ſodeinly vppon them, alwaies ſhooting
of their arrowes, and we aunſwering them likewiſe with
our Ordinaunce. This ſkirmiſh continued till it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
day, and then they tolde what they were. After that <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warte
Pacheco</hi> had thus well beaten him with his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce,
with the which were nine of his men ſlaine, beſides
many that were hurt, they tolde what they were.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9295:137"/>
And for that there durſt not paſſe anye Ship by for feare
that they ſhuld be taken, the Captaine Generall departed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<hi>Coching,</hi> and in the waye he fought with certeine
ſhips of the Moores, ſome he burnt, and others hée tooke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
thoſe that were ſunke. Thus with greate victorie hée
arriued at <hi>Coching,</hi> and landed at the Caſtle, where he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſtoode
by the Factour, that the newes of the preparation
that the king of <hi>Calycut</hi> had made for the warres was moſt
true, and that the king of <hi>Coching</hi> ſtood in greate feare
thereof, for that the Moores that were inhabitantes of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</hi>
were againſt their king for the mainteining of theſe
warres againſt the king of <hi>Calycut.</hi> The next day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Captaine Generall went to viſite the king of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</hi>
carrieng his boats with him well armed and fenced,
with certeine paueiſes made of Boordes, and ſette with
Flagges, beſides certeine Ordinaunce which they had in the
ſame, with the which he ſhewed himſelfe to be verye ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
the rather that the king might take occaſion to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:
who after that he vnderſtoode how ſmall a fleete there
was left to defend his countrie withall, he could not bée but
verye penſatiue,<note place="margin">What great feare y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Coching vvas put into by his traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects.</note> and ſayde vnto the Captaine Generall,
that the Moores of <hi>Coching</hi> hadde tolde him that hée did not
remaine in the <hi>Indias</hi> to defende him from the king of
<hi>Calycuts</hi> power, but to gather together the Merchaundiſe
that were in the Factorye in <hi>Coching,</hi> and in the Factors
cuſtodie, with all thoſe that were there, and ſo to carry them
all to <hi>Cananor</hi> and <hi>Coulan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore hée earneſtlye requeſted him to tell him
if it were ſo or not, for hée did thinke the ſame to be true,
by reaſon that there was lefte ſo ſmall a Fléete. Which
the rather alſo made him to doubt that hee would not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to fight with the king of <hi>Calycuts</hi> power, but woulde
doe as the Moores hadde tolde him, wherefore hée prayed
him to aduertiſe him of the truth thereof, for that if it were
ſo, hée might in time ſéeke his reuenge, although as then hée
ſhould hardlye finde the ſame, ſince he had no further
helpe.

The Captaine Generall perceiuing the diſtruſt that the
king had, was offended therewith, and aunſwered him,
ſaieng.</p>
               <p>I Doe much meruaile of thée (conſidering that thou haſt
ſo great experience of the fidelitie of the <hi>Portingales</hi>)
that thou doeſt aſke me whether I doe remaine for ſo trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
an act,<note place="margin">The aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere vvhich the Captaine Generall made to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> king of Coching.</note> as this is, that in ſuch a time I ſhould do as
the Moores haue told thée, &amp; thou wilt beléeue them, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that they are ſo greatly our enimies. Thinking that
thou vnderſtanding of this, ſhouldeſt not bring in queſtion
ſuch a matter out of all reaſon. <q>And if ſo be that <hi>Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co
de Alburquerque</hi> would haue done any ſuch thing, it
had bene a great deale better that he with all his Captains
had done it, and not haue left me alone to do the ſame, &amp; to
runne in daunger, and to méete on the ſeas with ſo great a
fléet of the kings of <hi>Calicut,</hi> for them to ſet vpon mée only.
And if it were ſo that I ſhould haue remained for to haue
done ſo foule a déede, yet I would haue tolde thée thereof,
that I had ſo meant to doe, for that I was afearde of the
king of <hi>Calycuts</hi> power. But for that I doe take thée to be
a man indued with reaſon, I did ſuppoſe that thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
not haue thought ill thereof. For otherwiſe thoſe bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
warned thereof, it might haue bene very profitable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thée, to haue remained frée from the enuie and mallice of
the king of <hi>Calicut.</hi> Which thing if ſo be that the Moores
had conſidered of, they would not haue tolde thée ſo great a
fable. Beleeue me, if they could haue done thée a greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie,
they would haue done it, for the good will thou doeſt
beare vnto vs. This I doe knowe very well, but let not
that trouble thée. For although thou doeſt looſe them, and
all the reſt of thy ſubiectes, yet thou doeſt recouer me, and
as many <hi>Portingales</hi> as héere remaine, who all will die in
thy ſeruice if it were néede, for that is the onely cauſe wée
did remaine in the <hi>Indias,</hi> and in eſpecially: for there was
no man that bound me therevnto, if ſo be y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> I wold not, but
only the fidelitye &amp; truth which thou haſt alwaies vſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

and diddeſt ſée the ſame burnt. For the which cauſe
thou oughteſt to eſtéeme the better of thy ſelfe, for thereby
thou haſt exalted thy fame through all the Countrie, and
therfore thy name wil remaine for euer, which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
treaſure that kings canne leaue behinde them, and the
onely thing that all men doe ſéeke for. And beléeue me, when
the king of <hi>Calycut</hi> did firſt ſet fire to <hi>Coching,</hi> the ſame
was his deſtruction, which was afterwarde well reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

thée, that very ſhortly we will ſéeme to bée verye ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

me to remaine, <q>beléeue certeinly that they did well knowe
they left him that ſhal excuſe thée of thy trauaile, and of the

Generall a while, howbeit to diſappoint them of their
ſuttle dealing, and that the ſame ſhoulde take no effect, hée
thought it neceſſarie to execute this principall Moore, that
the others might conceiue ſome feare thereof. This béeing
knowne to the king of <hi>Coching,</hi> he woulde not conſent

ſhuld be no victualls brought into the citie, for that thoſe did
prouide the citie therewith in trucke of their merchandiſe,

The Captaine Generall ſéeing that the king woulde not

Some there be that doe report that I do remaine to gather
together the Factorie, and ſo to carrie the ſame to <hi>Coulan,</hi>
and to <hi>Cananor:</hi> but that you may vnderſtand it is not ſo,
I will therefore tell you the truth. I doe remaine for no

                  <q>and if ſo be that
it were néedfull or requiſite, to die my ſelfe, and all thoſe

ſuch time, as you doe not ſée any thing to the contrarie, I

for that I heare that you are minded to goe from thence, &amp;
that you doe allure the reſidue of the inhabitants with you,
for as you are the chiefeſt and principalls, ſo all the common

you ſhall ſéeme in daunger, or elſe runne awaie, I woulde
not blame you, but to goe awaye before you haue ſeene
any of theſe daungers, or anye battaile fought, I account
the ſame, either cowardiſe, or elſe mallice. You doe well
know, that in a manner yeſterday, how few <hi>Portingales</hi> did
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:9295:139"/>
giue the ouerthrowe to thouſands of our enimies, <q>which
now alſo come to ſéeke vs out. And if ſo be that you will
alleadge, that we were more in number then we are now,
indéede it is ſo, for then we fought in open fielde, where it
was neceſſarie there ſhould be many: and nowe in a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe
waye, where a fewe ſhall doe as much as though
were many more. And ſince that I can fight, as you haue
well heard of the ſame, for that I haue bene he that haue
done moſt hurt to our enimies (as the king of <hi>Coching</hi> is
a good witneſſe thereof) I neuer meane to yéelde, who ſhall
looſe more then you all, if I be ouercome. Haue ye therfore
a ſure hope in me, and in thoſe that remaine with mée,
and tarrie vntill ſuch time you may ſée the ſucceſſe of all
things that we doe looke for, and ſince that your king doth
tarrie, why will ye goe your waie? Remember that I and
the others that doe remaine with me, doe ſoiourne in the
<hi>Indias</hi> ſo farre from our Countrie, to defend the king of
<hi>Coching,</hi> and you that are his ſubiects and naturally borne
in the Countrie. Will you then forſake him and your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie?
It were great ſhame for women ſo to doe, much more
for honeſt men as you are. I doe deſire you that you do not
diſhonour your ſelues, nor yet doe to me ſo great an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,
in hauing no confidence that I will defend you: for I
doe giue vnto you all my word, that I will defend you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a greater power then any the king of <hi>Calycut</hi> canne make.
For therefore and for this cauſe was I choſen, and thoſe
that did appoint me to remaine in the <hi>Indias,</hi> did know of
the warres that the king of <hi>Calycut</hi> intended, and what
power he had, in reſpect whereof I doe once againe requeſt

you doe remoue, for whoſoeuer doth otherwiſe ſhall well
vnderſtand, that if ſo be I may take him I will hang him,
and ſo I ſweare by my lawe. And moreouer I giue you to
vnderſtande, that none of you all ſhall eſcape, for héere in
this port I doe minde to tarrie, watching both day &amp; night.
Now therfore let euery one of you looke to that which ſhall
<pb facs="tcp:9295:140"/>
behoue him, and if ſo be you doe performe that which I
haue requeſted you, doe you then aſſure your ſelues to haue
me for your friend, and if not, for your mortall enimie, and
more cruell then you would wiſh me to bée to the king of

               <p>He had alſo many <hi>Paraos,</hi> which he hadde cauſed too bée

ſo many thouſands of men as there are of our enemies: ſo

this hope, although we were as many as the enemies are,
and they as few as wee bee, yet all our ſtrength were
nothing, and being in this hope, all the multitude of the
enemies will ſéeme vnto vs but few to ouer come: for
they doe iudge vs to be many more then wee are, their
feare is ſuch. And this alſo you may beleeue, that if their

for that they are many, hauing moſt aſſured hope to take vs,
yet they will haue a feare from hence forth, ſo that theyr
ſpirits will be broken, to ſet vpon vs any more, which thing
if they did, it would be more for feare of the king of <hi>Caly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut,</hi>
then for any good zeale they haue vnto him. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I pray you remember, that with this confidence you

king of <hi>Calycut</hi> himſelfe, who had a great number, which
for that they were many, I doe not rehearſe. The ſortes of
inſtruments that they had for the wars were ſo many and
diuerſe, that when they began to play vpon the ſame, it was
thought that heauen and earth woulde ioyne together.
Ouer &amp; beſides the great multitude of the people, the which
did couer the whole earth. Thoſe that went in the vangard,
as ſoone as they came to their ſetling, did giue fire to theyr
ordinance, which as they lay néere to the Caruel, ſo it appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
partly a miracle, that there was no péece that did hurt

amongſt the enimies, and killed many of them, although it
was before day, the which vntill Sunne did riſe, were in
diſcharging out of the Caruell, aboue xxx. péeces.</p>
               <p>After all this, the whole Fléete of the enimies beganne
to come out of the riuers of <hi>Repelyn,</hi> which were 169.
Foyſtes, that is to ſay, thrée ſcore and ſixe <hi>Paraos,</hi> the which
hadde theyr defence of ſackes of Cotten, which deuiſe was

               <p>Each of theyr boates or <hi>Paraos</hi> had two péeces of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce

               <p>Alſo there were twentie of theſe Foyſts, all cheined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb facs="tcp:9295:144"/>

Catures, beſide thirtie greate Barks, each of theſe hadde
his péece of Ordinaunce, and ſixtéene men, which ſerued

               <p>Beſides all theſe armed veſſells, there went other fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

the whole riuer was couered ouer, in the which Fléet were

<hi>Nabeadarin,</hi> and for Vice Admerall the Lorde of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelyn.</hi>
Certeinly to ſee them altogether vpon the water and

ſome of coulour blacke, and others of a darke Taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye.
And vppon their weapons the Sunne did ſo gliſter,
that they appeared as though they had béene ſwoordes, and
newly ground, and ſo lykewiſe did their targets, the which
were of ſundrie coulours, and ſhewed very gallant. And for
that our men ſhould ſtand in the more feare of them, they
gaue out great cries and laroms. After this they beganne
to ſound vppon their inſtrumentes of warre, which noyſe
contynued alwayes, nowe after one ſorte, and then after

               <p>Our men bearing amongſt ſuch a multitude, and bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſhould not cut them a ſunder. And after that they hadde
done this, commaundement was giuen, to giue fire to the

                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:9295:144"/>
The Ordinaunce went off ſo often, and lykewiſe the
ſmall ſhot, that there was none that coulde ſee one another,
for the ſmoake of the ſame. The Caruell and the Boates
did ſo flame in fire, and did ſo cruelly handle the enimyes
at the firſt entering, that there were torne in péeces ſome
of their <hi>Paraos,</hi> and manye of their men ſlaine and hurt,
without any of ours hurt, or ſtanding in any daunger ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
at all. By this time, the enimyes were come, within the
throwe of a Dart. Howbeit, as they were many, and that
without order, the one did hurt and hinder the other, ſo that
they could not fight. Yet notwithſtanding, the xxv. <hi>Paraos</hi>
that went before, did trouble our men very much with
theyr Ordinaunce which they had, for that they went chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
together.</p>
               <p>Our men being wearied and hurt, and the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
hauing endured a good while, the Captaine Generall
commaunded a Saker to bee ſhotte at them,<note place="margin">The eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies vtter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly diſcom<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fited, doe run their vvaye.</note> the which till
that time had not béene ſhot at the enimies. And after that
the ſame was twice diſcharged, they all fledde, and for that
they laye very thicke together, it did immediatlye ſinke
foure of them, and with that they were all ouercome, and
ſo they ran theyr waye. The reſidue of the <hi>Paraos</hi> which did
continue in the battaile, were eightéene ſunke, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>téene
fledde awaye, the reſidue gaue place, in the which
there were of the enimyes greate numbers ſlaine and
hurt.</p>
               <p>After all this came the Vize Admerall called the Lord of
<hi>Repelyn,</hi> with another ſquadron, and gaue a proud onſet,
ſo did the king of <hi>Calycut</hi> giue the lyke vpon the land.
This battaile was farre more vehement then the firſt,
in the which were manye more of the enimyes ſlaine,
then before, as appeared by the water which was of the
coulour of bloud. Yet for all this, the Lorde of <hi>Repelyn</hi>
made lowde outeryes, commaunding them to laye the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
aboorde, but for all that they durſt not venture to
doe it, but rather were deſirous to goe theyr waye, as they
alſo that were a land did the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:9295:145"/>
It was now at this preſent paſt Euenſong, from the time

ſlaine. And although theyr pellets were made of caſt yron,
yet they did no more hurt, then a ſtone béeing throwne.
Howbeit, our defences were all torne in péeces, and one of

with whom they reconcyled themſelues, and thoſe
that did thus were, one called <hi>Marugata, Muta Caymal,</hi>
and his brother, and Couſins, who immediatly after the
battaile, did ſo ſecretly depart from the kinge of <hi>Calicuts</hi>
Campe, from whence they went to the Iland of <hi>Vaypin,</hi>
to ſtay there, till they might ſee their time, as I haue ſayd.
But when the king of <hi>Calicut</hi> had knowledge that they
were gone,<note place="margin">The king of Calicut much bla<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>meth his captaines for being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throvvne by ſo fevv<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> and alſo vnderſtoode where they were become,
he was very ſory therefore, which alſo was the occaſion
that he renewed all his griefe, that hee had conceyued for
his ouerthrow, which he had receyued at our mens hands,
that were ſo few. Wherupon he tooke occaſion to rebuke
his captaines, ſaying, that they were good for nothing, and
that through their defaulte our men continued and kept
theſe paſſages. And if ſo he, that they had had any ſhame,
they would or this time haue dryuen them from thence, in
eſpecially hauing geuen ſo often the enterpriſe to paſſe the
ſame. Then thoſe two Italians that were preſente, did
replie vnto the king, that although our men had done moſt
valiantly, yet that which they did was like vnto the dedes
of deſperate men. Notwithſtanding, that they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to defende themſelues long, from ſuch a power as his
was, in eſpecially, not hoping to haue any ſuccour. And
therefore they willed him to ſet vpon them often times,
for by that meanes it was poſſible to take them. Some
alſo of thoſe kinges and noble men that came to ſuccoure
the king, and that were deſirous of warres, did confirme
that which the Italians had ſaide before, addinge moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
that God doth permitte his enemies ſometime to haue
the victorie, for a more greater loſſe vnto them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it were good ſaide they, that he followed his friends
counſell, and prooued their ſtedfaſtneſſe. And although it
were ſo, that he had not the victorie immediatelye, yet hee
ſhould not therefore diſpaire. The king finding himſelfe
ſomewhat vexed in minde with thoſe wordes, aunſwered
them ſaying. Although that eche of you is ſo valiant, that
<pb facs="tcp:9295:146"/>
it appeareth vnto you,<note place="margin">the kings aunſvvere vnto this aduice.</note> a ſmall matter to ouercome thoſe
Chriſtians, yet I am not ſo obſtinate to thinke the ſame.
Howbeit I ſuppoſe yet, that you doe ſée in me no ſuch a
feare, <q>that thereby you might iudge it néedefull, to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
me with thoſe words. For what can you tell me in
this caſe, that you may ſatiſfie me withall? For if ſo bee,
that you will conſider as much as I doe, you would ſoone
know, how great an acte this is, that you doe make ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
accompt off. I doe not take it in vs for ſo great a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
in ouercomming theſe Chriſtians, but rather in them,
in defending themſelues from vs, as they haue done. Wher
in it hath well appeared,</q>

                  </note> that their God did fight for them.</p>
               <p>And will you ſée how it is ſo? You maye well
conſider, that our men are many, and that they haue bene
valyant in the warres paſt, it hath well appeared in many

<q>as you do all well know. But ſince they haue fought
with theſe Chriſtians, they ſéeme to be (not as they were)
nor durſt giue the onſet vpon them, for the feare they haue
conceiued. And certainly, as farre as I can learne, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
all thoſe that are of a good iudgement, we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>léeue,
that thoſe workes are rather of God, then of man.
For who is he that would not be afeard of them, wel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing
that all others are? I meane not onely the King
of <hi>Cochings</hi> ſubiects which came to ſuccour vs, who haue
repented themſelues thereof, but alſo manye other of our

                  <q>And farther, I am enformed by ſome, that they haue
now offered their friendſhip vnto the King of <hi>Coching.</hi>
Which thing, if it be true, it is for that they haue loſt the

which is paſt, as alſo reputing how lyttle time there is

will commaund vs to doe that which they will haue vs,
ſo we ought to vnderſtande them, although therefore in
theſe warres it appeareth that it goeth very euill with vs,
and in this they doe ſhew how much they are our frends,
truely I doe beleue the ſame, the rather for that we ought
not to beleue them that would haue a matter done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reaſon, as it were to geue vs the victorie againſt thoſe
Chriſtians, and power to deſtroy the king of <hi>Coching,</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
whom we haue done very much hurt, killynge the laſte
yeare his Princes and almoſt all his men, ſetting of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>
a fire, and deſtroying his countrey, from whence
we hunted him away, with his great diſcredite, diſpoſſed
him of his kingdome &amp; ſubiects, ſo that al they for the feare
they had of vs did leaue him, yea his own frendes forſooke
him, &amp; went againſt him, &amp; all for our ſake. And aboue all
theſe euils the which he did not deſerue, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he was not in
any fault, we would yet procéed further, vtterly to deſtroy
him. What hath he done? Did hee procure to take anye
mans countrey from him? No. In friendſhip did he vſe
himſelfe traiterouſly? Neither. Did he commaunde the
Marchantes that they ſhould not come to <hi>Calicut?</hi> Neither,
Did he the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſome worſe thing ſince he did nothing of theſe?
Nothing at all. What then? forſooth for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he did receiue into
his countrey the Chriſtians which being driuen out of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licut,</hi>
went to ſéeke him out, as he was deſirous to encreaſe
and enpeople his Citie, and to augment hys eſtate and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
Shall we therefore deſtroy him being our friend, as
an enemie? With this right doe the Pagodes helpe vs to
take the honor, riches and credite from the right owner? It
cannot be ſo, for that they be righteous and iuſt, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they will not help vs agaynſt thoſe Chriſtians which
were ſlayne, robbed, and thruſt out of <hi>Calicut,</hi> and were
there receiued vnder ſafeconduct from the king, comminge
to his porte before any others, and not geuing cauſe wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they ſhould receiue ſo many iniuries. If wee doe it
for that they laide hande vpon a Shippe of the Moores,
there is no reaſon why, for that the Kinge commaunded
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:9295:147"/>
them to ſtay the ſame: And if he had ben aduiſed by al men
as he was by me, the Moores ſhould haue paid for that they
ha done &amp; that very well, for &amp; if they had ben puniſhed, it
wold wel haue appered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the king had ben in no fault of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
which they had done. And this had bene ſufficient to haue
confirmed the friendſhip of the Chriſtians with him, &amp; this
alſo would haue bene a cauſe ſufficient, to haue kept them
in <hi>Calicut</hi> from going to <hi>Coching,</hi> to haue there ſetteled a
trade, whom the King through euill councell hath trauay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

they doe receiue. For the receiuing of them as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> King
of <hi>Mylinde</hi> did, they gaue ouer two ſhips laden with gold,
the which they had taken from a Couſin of his. If theſe
men were Théeues, as the Moores doe ſay they are, thoſe
were prices not to be left. You know how rich a Preſent
they brought to the King, and what ritch merchandiſe they
brought, and how much golde and ſiluer. Thoſe fiſhermen
which they did carrie away naked, did retourne againe all
apparailed. If then we were friends, how ſurely ſhould we
liue: &amp; what profit ſhould the King haue, if we had amitie
with them. I do not ſpeak of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſhip y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> carried y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Elephants
which was giuen him: when all y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> priſes did paſſe by theſe

be thankfully receiued, giuing occaſion to vs to gratifie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
in like ſort, and to be glad to haue them for our friends, &amp;
ſince we did put them awaye when they had néede of vs,
now that we haue néede of them, let it not be thought euil,
to conclude a peace with them, for that the wars we make
againſt them, we make the ſame againſt our ſelues. They
are vpon the Sea of more power then we are, as you may
well ſée the ſame by the long time they haue defended this
paſſage, and with what power of men, and alſo what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
they haue brought vppon vs, and are like to doe,
ſince that our Countrey lyeth néere to the water ſide, and
that with our owne loſſe, we haue well ſéene the truth.

his enimies wold take his country from him. After this, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
of the inhabitants of <hi>Coching</hi> went to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Captaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
to aſke him whether he was able with his caruells

anſwere, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Coching</hi> were fully ſatiſfied, &amp; ſo

He brought with him great noiſes &amp; cries, with great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
and dauncing, the which the Captaine generall didde
heare, and went verie ſecretly a lande, and placed himſelfe
in the very point where the enimies ſhuld come, the which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:9295:151"/>
he did defend that the enimies ſhould not make there any
rampyers, about the which our men killed ſome of them.
This being knowne to the king of <hi>Calicut,</hi> that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

his ſouldiers with a ſtout ſtomacke to ſet vppon

and many of the enimies were ſlaine without taking of
the Captaine Generall, neither yet could they make theyr
rampiers. As the morning came on which was the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

multitude of the enimies which came vpon him: howbeit
he imbarked both himſelfe and his men without lacking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them, but there were of the enimies many ſlaine and
hurt. The point béeing now cléere &amp; vnfurniſhed, the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
came and placed themſelues there, and then they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to ſhoote off their Ordinaunce at vs, to the which wée
did aunſwere with ours, dooing them great hurt therewith,
for that all our ſhot went amongſt the enimies, where they
lay open, and our men were well fenced, therefore their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaunce
could doe vs no hurt.<note place="margin">The king of Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut being in danger ſendeth for ſuccor to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> reſt of his fleete.</note> The king of <hi>Calicut</hi> ſéeing

and come to helpe and deliuer him from the daunger and
feare that our men did put him in. The Fléete being come,
it was a fearefull ſight to beholde them, for that there was
driuen before them certeine raffes, the which went alwaies
burning, with intent to ſet the Caruells on fire, and after
them an hundred and ten <hi>Paraos</hi> full of men &amp; ordinance, &amp;

and the eight caſtles in kéeping of theſe, the which
ſtoode hard by the point, for that the ebbe was not as yet

<pb facs="tcp:9295:152"/>
accounting vs as ouercome already, and with this,

&amp; without all doubt they had cloſed with vs at this time,

great hurt, not onely in their <hi>Fregates</hi> that were torne

ſlaine and hurte. The Ebbe being come, the <hi>Paraos</hi> with
their Caſtles did put off from the poynt, and to the ende
they ſhould goe the ſwifter, they were rowed with boats.
Theſe came right towards the Caruells, and in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
of them all went fortie fighting men, and in the other
of the middle ſort in each of them fine and thirtie, and in
the leſſer ſort thirtie men. All theſe were bowmen &amp; ſhot,
and beſides that they did carrie Ordinaunce, and ſtoode all

as was fearful to be ſéene, the rather being ſo great a fléet,

vs, neither yet ſuch a Fléete, that was ſo great and
mightye, with the fearefull cryes that the Enimies did
make, nor the terrible thundering of the Ordinance, could

the Caſtles being come hard to this defence, did then ſhoote
off all his ordinance at the Caruels, &amp; the Captaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
commaunded to ſhoote at the ſame with a Saker, the
which cauſed the ſaid Caſtle to ſtand wauering, but yet did

<hi>Paraos,</hi> which did ſet themſelues right equal with the firſt,
&amp; with the comming of theſe, the battell did increaſe more
and more very ſtoutly on all parts. Their arrowes came
ſo thicke, which made ſo great a ſhadow, that ſometimes
ther appeared neither heauen nor earth, with y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> great ſmoke

with many more ſlaine and hurt, and the Ordinaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſhotte off againe, it was all torne in péeces in a ſmall
ſpace, and ſo the enimies went with their Caſtle further of,
but the others remayned there fighting very ſtoutly. And
after this, both parts endured more trouble all the day fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
then in all the battells that were paſt: but in the
ende, we did ſo much hurt vnto their Caſtles, and ſunke and
rent ſo many of their <hi>Paraos</hi> in péeces, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> the enimies could

Ordinaunce made them runne away, leauing behinde them
ſlaine thrée hundred and thirtie men. This béeing done, he
then returned to his Caruells, where that euening came to
viſit him the Prince of <hi>Coching</hi> in the behalfe of the king,
who ſent to excuſe himſelfe that he could not come to viſit
him in his owne perſon. But he ſent him againe word, that
he wold receiue no diſcharge, vntill ſuch time he knew his
heuines was paſt, but praied him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence forth to beléeue
better in God, for that the daungerous daye of the Caſtles
was paſt, and he remained in the paſſage as he did before,
all ſafe, and in readineſſe to ſerue him. The ſelfe ſame daie
came to viſit him certeine noble men, of thoſe that were of
the king of <hi>Cochings</hi> ſide, with whome there was made
great triumph for this victorie: and likewiſe there went to
ſée him many Moores Merchants which brought him great
preſents, ſuppoſing to get of him thereby great friendſhip.
He receiued them very gently, praieng them to be true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects

him aſſured at any time whenſoeuer he might ſtand them
in any ſtéede, wherevpon they faithfully promiſed ſo to do,
&amp; to binde them the more, he made them very great chéere.
Alſo the next day in the morning the king of <hi>Coching</hi> came
to viſit him, who imbraced him with as great gladneſſe as
could be deuiſed, ſaieng that he did wel performe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which

But vnto this he anſwered, that he had not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
all his promiſe, ſince that he did not put him on the
<hi>Caluete,</hi> but he was not in fault thereof, for that the king
kept himſelfe alwayes farre from him. He declared alſo to
the king diuerſe other matters of pleaſure, which the king
anſwered in like manner, praiſing very much his valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
&amp; that he had wel ſéene y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> God did fight for vs, aſking of

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:9295:153"/>

not ouerthrowe the Captaine Generall,

               <p>YOV doe well ſée how little our power profiteth vs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

them. The like account alſo they make of vs in their feaſts,
and paſtimes when we goe againſt them, <q>as though wee
were the fewer, and they the more, and as though the land
which they are in were theirs, &amp; we were the Chriſtians,
whereby it appeareth, they alwayes make account of the

bée otherwiſe, conſidering the great victories they haue had
<pb facs="tcp:9295:154"/>
againſt vs, and the greate hurt that we haue receiued of
them. Wherefore I ſuppoſe that God would it ſhould be ſo,
for the litle iuſtice y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is obſerued in theſe wars, as hath wel
appered in the beginning of the ſame. And if I had ben wel
aduiſed, it ſhuld not haue gone ſo farre forward, but in the

haue therin no right cauſe, neither canne gette any thing
by our ſtrength. Let vs therfore giue it ouer, &amp; deſire no more
to haue <hi>Coching,</hi> for that God doth fauour theſe men, ſince
wel you ſée, there is no power in the <hi>Indias</hi> that can offend
vs ſo long, we being ſo ſtrong, but theſe dogs, of whom I

Now y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> firſt that he aſked councell of what was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary

what he had told him of vs: &amp; ſince in time he woulde not

refuſed his councell, but now he willed him to do what he
ſhuld thinke good, for he could not do amiſſe. The king bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſomwhat broken of his pride, (calling him brother) ſaid
that now there was no time to aunſwere him after ſuch

were beſt therefore not to procure it, but to defer it, &amp; make

from <hi>Portingale,</hi> who conſidering howe little the wars
will profit him, <q>&amp; not being aſſured of good ſucceſſe therein,
will be the gladder to make peace with thée, &amp; therfore that

wel talke of peace, when poſſible the Captaine general wil
willingly accept the ſame, doubting that his good fortune
may chaunge. And to prouoke &amp; giue occaſion the rather to
haue his friendſhip, let vs giue him no more battels in the

loſſe and confuſion of our men.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This councell of <hi>Nabeadarin</hi> was reproued by the
kings and noble men which were there then aſſembled, &amp;
eſpecially of the Lord of <hi>Repelyn,</hi> which ſaid that the king
ought not to goe away, neither for the greatneſſe of the
winter that ſhould come, nor yet for the ioſſe of his men,
but rather to continue, giuing vs manye battailes, vntill
ſuch time he did take vs, and not onely procured the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of vs in <hi>Coching,</hi> but alſo of thoſe that were in
<hi>Cananor</hi> and <hi>Coulan.</hi> And that immediatly it were expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent

                  </note> and had alſo
ſlaine vs all, and taken our ſayd Caruells, and therefore
that they ſhould kill all thoſe that were there, as they had
promiſed. To the ſame effect therefore the king did write
immediatly and the Moores alſo, but there was no credite
giuen to the ſame, for that there was other newes ſent
before, and therefore the laſt was taken for falſe. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
for all that, by the induſtry of the Moores the which
did dwel in thoſe two towns, our men were in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
and durſt not come out of theyr Factoryes, and in
<hi>Coulan</hi> there was one ſlaine, but in the other places none,
<pb facs="tcp:9295:155"/>
for afterward meſſengers were ſent from <hi>Calycut</hi> to the
Gentiles, that our men were aliue, and what wée had done.
For which cauſe the king of <hi>Calycut</hi> was aunſwered that
they would not kill our men, vntill ſuch time the Captaine
Generall was taken, and that he had firſt giuen him the
ouerthrowe, which béeing done, they would conclude with
him. This béeing come to the knowledge of the Lorde of
<hi>Repelyn,</hi> both he and the Moores did perſwade the king
to fight another battell with the Captaine Generall, the
which he would willingly not haue done, for that he was
wearyed in his ſpirit, but he could not withſtand them, and
therefore commaunded the ſame to bée giuen both by Sea
and lande. But in it he had lyke ſucceſſe as before, ſo that
more through the importunate deſire of the Moores then of
his owne will, he gaue in his owne perſon another battell
with his Caſtles, with many more men and veſſells then
in the other before. This battell endured longer then the
other, in which alſo the enimyes were ouercome, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
farre greater loſſe then euer they did before. With
this victorye that we had gotten, the inhabitaunts of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi>
remained ſure from all their enimies, and ſo likewiſe
did the king, whom afterward came to viſite the Captaine
generall, being brought in a chaire, with farre greater eſtate
then euer he came before, ſince the firſt beginning of all the
warres. This being knowne in the campe of the enimies,
the kings and noble men that were with the king of <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut,</hi>
tooke occaſion to ſay vnto him that he ſhoulde not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
in eſpecially hauing ſuch a greate power as he hadde

                  </note> that the king of <hi>Coching</hi> ſhould haue him in
ſo ſmall reputation, as thereby to iudge himſelfe frée from
him, &amp; out of his danger. To the which the king of <hi>Calicut</hi>
made anſwere, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> the king of <hi>Coching</hi> had great reſon to do
that which he had done, in eſpecially knowing his greate
power and camp, and yet perceiuing that he could not giue
him the ouerthrowe. And ſince that his euill fortune was
ſuch, he deſired them not to wiſh him to go forward in theſe
wars, for that he knewe well and was fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:9295:155"/>
that continuing the ſame, he ſhoulde alwayes receiue
the loſſe, and run daily into greater danger, as by the feare
thereof it was apparaunt. And therefore he requeſted them
all to let him alone by himſelfe, who ſo béeing, did imagine
againe what courſe he might beſt take to reuenge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
               <p>And after that he came aboord, he called for certeine of his
Nayres, in whom he had repoſed all his truſt, commanding
them to go to <hi>Coching</hi> with ſome diſſimulation, and there
to trauaile all that they could to kill the Captaine general,
and all ſuch of our men as they could méete withall. And
as the Naires are men inconſtant, and cannot kéepe counſel
longer then they are bethinking themſelues therof, therfore
immediatly their intent was knowne to the Captaine ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
who from thence forward had a better regard to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
and vnto the reſt of his companye then he had before.
And the better to take thoſe Naires which came as Spyes
thether, he appointed thervnto two companies of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Naires
of <hi>Coching,</hi> commaunding the one to k<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>pe dilligentlye a
long the foord, and the other a long the riuer, who watched
by quarters both by day and night. Whileſt this dilligence
was vſed, the Captaine Generall had knowledge that this
ſpy was a Naire of <hi>Coching,</hi> and of the houſe or ſtocke of
the <hi>Leeros,</hi> who had attendant vppon him certeine Nayres
that were ſtraungers, which appeared to bée lyke thoſe of
<hi>Calicut.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nowe hauing certeine knowledge héereof, he ſo hande
the matter, and in ſuch order, that forthwith hée tooke
them all priſoners, and béeing brought before him, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded
them to bée cruellye whipped in the preſence of
thoſe Naires of <hi>Coching,</hi> and afterwarde to bée hanged.
The inhabitauntes of <hi>Coching</hi> ſéeing this, requeſted the
Captaine Generall to giue them ſome other puniſhment
ſince that they were Nayres, and not to ſhewe them ſo
great extremitie, but notwithſtanding hée wold not graunt
vnto anye other puniſhment, for that they had deſerued
the ſame.</p>
               <p>

               <p>Alſo it woulde giue an occaſion for ſuch noble men as
were with him, to ſaye that he is a king but for a while,
ſince that his iuriſdiction is nowe taken from him.
And foraſmuch as hetherto he had vſed him alwayes with
reuerence, they wiſhed that nowe at the ende he woulde

After all this, on Saterday in the Euening, which was
Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> euen, on which day they gaue out, that they
would giue the battaile, there appeared the whole army of

whether he did repent himſelfe of
that which he had done, or not: and
perceiuing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary, each of them
repaired toward their Countreyes, whereof the moſt part
of them laye there along the water ſide. And forſomuch as
the Winter began to increaſe, and they fearing leaſt the
Captaine generall would ouercome them all, hauing now
loſt the hope they had to defend themſelues now as before
time. Therefore they minded to procure as much as they
could,<note place="margin">the good<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of the King of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings na<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing a meane to procure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> to be friends and in peace with the Captaine gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.
For the which intent as Mediatour for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
they ſent to the King of <hi>Coching,</hi> whom for that his
condition and nature was very good; &amp; without calling to
remembraunce the iniuries that were paſt, which they had
done vnto him, did vndertake to do the ſame. Sending them
immediatly a ſafeconduct for their ſafe comming vnto <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,</hi>
from whence he went in their company to viſit the
Captaine generall, whom at their méeting, he earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:9295:158"/>
to receiue them as his friendes,<note place="margin">peace for his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</note> who aunſwered,
that for his ſake he would ſo doe. Diuers other Princes
alſo there were, that coulde not come, but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
they ſent vnto him their Embaſſadours to conclude
this peace likewiſe. Alſo ſundrye Moores of <hi>Calycut</hi> that
were great Merchants, to the ende they might quietly vſe
their trade, forſooke <hi>Calycut,</hi> &amp; came to dwell at <hi>Coching,</hi>
with the conſent of the Captaine generall. Others there
were that went to <hi>Cananor</hi> and <hi>Coulan,</hi> ſo that the great
Trade that was before in <hi>Calycut</hi> began ſodainly to fall.
And for that the Moores of <hi>Calycut</hi> began in this ſorte to
inhabite in <hi>Coching,</hi> therefore the Captaine generall wold
not leaue this paſſage, as alſo for that there came manye &amp;
ſundry times <hi>Paraos</hi> from <hi>Calycut</hi> into the riuers to kéep
the ſame, by <hi>Nabeadarins</hi> commaundement. Howbeit the
Captaine generall met with them and fought with them,
and hurt many of his enimies. Moreouer, he oftentimes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into the Lord of <hi>Repelyns</hi> Countrey to take Cattell
for his prouiſion, &amp; fought with many of his enimies, vpon
whom he made great ſlaughter. One daye by chaunce our
men met with certaine <hi>Tones</hi> of the enimies, the which
were in a certaine ſtanding water, and carried them away
into the riuers, and made with the enimies a valyant and
ſtout ſkirmiſh, in the which was ſlaine the greateſt parte
of them, and not one of our men hurt.</p>
               <p>After all this,<note place="margin">The Lord of Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, is alſo reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vnto the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rall.</note> the Lorde of <hi>Repelyn</hi> became the

by this diligence that was thus vſed, euery man had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

the month of Iune, and iudging themſelues ouer againſt
the Cape <hi>Buena ſpuransa,</hi> there fell vpon them a meruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
great ſtorme of winde, with the which all the Fléete

               <p>Theſe two dayes béeing paſt, they ſaw certaine ſignes
of lande, the which as it did appeare, could not bée farre
off, and for that cauſe was the weather ſo cloſe. After that
they had diſcryed y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame, &amp; were come néere thervnto, then
theſe ſignes appeared the greater. And therefore the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

The Captaine Generall thereby perceiuing the king to bée

generall, with whom he left a ſhip and two Caruels,
the one of <hi>Pedro Raphael,</hi> and the other of <hi>Diego Pieres.</hi>
This Captaine was a Gentleman called <hi>Manuel telez de

the King of <hi>Coching,</hi> who had a great deale more deſire,
that <hi>Edwarte Pacheco</hi> ſhould haue remained, for his good

way from <hi>Calycut</hi> as men deſperate for the loſſe of their
trade. Alſo that his going for <hi>Portingale</hi> was not but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne,
and then to ſerue him for a longer time, and more at

in recompence of the ſeruice he had done for him, in
conſideration that he was ſo poore, as he did well knowe.
Howbeit he intreated him, that of his Pepper which hée
had, he would take what he woulde.
But <hi>Edwarte Pacheco</hi> would haue nothing, ſaieng, that he
did truſt in God, that when he retourned to <hi>Coching,</hi> hée
ſhould finde him very rich, &amp; in his proſperitie, and then he
would receiue reward of him. And with this he departed,
the King with all his ſubiects remaining verye heauie for
his departure. Moreouer, the King wrote vnto the king of
<hi>Portingale</hi> of all <hi>Edwarte Pacheco</hi> ſucceſſes in the warres,
and what he had done for him. After this the Captain ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
departed toward <hi>Cananor,</hi> the xxvi. of September, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieng
in his companye thoſe Captaines which ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine
in the <hi>Indias.</hi> His good wil &amp; intent was, to come to
an Ankor in the harbour of <hi>Panane,</hi> and there to viſite the
King of <hi>Tanor.</hi> But by reaſon of the ill weather they had,
and their naughtie Pilots they could not reach y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſame, but
were driuen to <hi>Calycut</hi> and <hi>Pandarane.</hi> And from thence
he commaunded <hi>Pedro Raphael</hi> and <hi>Diego Pieres</hi> to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fléete, and to looke out, whether they could ſee any
ſhips of the Moores. Being ariued at <hi>Pandarane,</hi> &amp; bearing
along the Coaſt with a ſmall winde, there came vpon them
x. <hi>Paros</hi> of the xvii. ſhips that were ther a lading. Our men
hauing ſight of them, began forthwith to ſhoote at them
with their ordinaunce. The other Captayns being a Sea
boord, and hearing the ſound of the ordinance, did returne,
and bare as cloſe by the winde as they could.
<pb facs="tcp:9295:168"/>
And hauing ſight of the ſhips of the Moores to be a ground,
came to <hi>Cananor</hi> by the Captaine generalls commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
who immediately entered into counſaile, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
it was determined by the whole conſent of his Captains,
that they ſhuld fight with thoſe Moores, and that they ſhuld
goe in their boates, for that their ſhips could not come néere
vnto them, by reaſon they were within the Barre. And for
that the enimies were many, that therefore they ſhould do
what they could to cloſe with the ſhips, the which as ſoone
as they had done, they ſhuld ſet the ſame a fire. This being
appointed, the Captaine general with all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other Captains
of the Fléete, did imbarke themſelues in their boates, the
which were in all xv. in the which all the ſouldiers of the
Fléete did imbarke themſelues, and that with a great cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
for that they went to fight with their enimies.<note place="margin">The great prouiſion of the Moores a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo fevv ſmall boates.</note> Theſe
Moores as I ſayd, had their ſhips within the Barre, lyeng
one cloſe by another, with their ſtearnes toward the land,
and in the moſt part of them wer many ſouldiers, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which
were men of coulour white. Their weapon were bowes
and arrowes, and alſo they had much ordinaunce. And on
the land, at the entering of the barre were placed two pée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of ordinaunce vpon a ſmall bulwarke which they had
made. Our men bearing néere to this barre, had ſight of the
Captaine generall, and how the Caruells were ſomewhat
farre off the ſhore, and that they came not, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wind
was but ſmall, and therefore were perforce driuen to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
backe for them, &amp; to bring them by force of the oare
within the Barre, for to ſuccour their boates. The other
Captaines (although they ſaw him returne) went forward
by force of the oare, and at the entering of the Barre, the
Pellets fell as though it had rayned amongſt them. But
for all this they entered, ſhooting of all their Ordinaunce.
But as their enimies were farre more then they, ſo theyr
arrowes were without number. And for that our men by
reaſon they wer ſomwhat low vnder their ſhips, wer open
without any defence, therefore did they receiue great hurt,
not onely by their ordinance, but alſo by their arrowes.
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:9295:168"/>
Héere as it appeared, was all the force of the battaile: and
for all the ſtoutneſſe that was ſhewed by the enimies, yet
our men entred into the middes of all the multitude of the

ſhoote ſuch abundance of arrows &amp; threw ſo many ſtones, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
they made our men put off, who béeing off did immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cloſe with another, in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> which for that there wer not ſo
many, they boorded the ſame in deſpite of the Moores for all
their ſtoutnes, in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which wer ſome of them ſlaine, &amp; thoſe
that remained aliue leapt for feare into the water &amp; ſwam
away. About y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame time y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Triſtim de la Silua</hi> had layde

which he tooke to be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Admirall, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which a Turke
was Captaine with all his company, which were manye.
And at the boording of this ſhip, were throwen ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude

chaunced that before our men came to this ſhip, the eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
ſhooting at them with a péece, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> which was lieng vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the vpper decke, with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> recoyling it rent out a péece of the

not regarding it, thought it more néedfull to ſuccor y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> fore-part
of their ſhip. And when our boat came hard a boord y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
ſame ſide where this hole was, our men did enter by the
ſame. The firſt that entered, was <hi>Alonſo Lopes</hi> Maſter, &amp;
another <hi>Aluoro Lopes,</hi> who was y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> things ſeruant, &amp; is now

one <hi>Pero Alonſo de Aguylar</hi> layde another

immediately ſet the ſame a fire, and it tooke the ſame very
furiouſly, ſo that thereby their enemies were ſo excéedingly
afeard, that the moſt part of them leapt into the water and
drowned themſelues. While this was a doing, thether
came the Captayne generall, with the Caruells, and béeing
entered within the Barre, he lefte them. Then one of the
péeces that were on the lande was ſhot off with a pellet,
which ſtrake the Caruell of <hi>Pedro Raphael</hi> in ſuch ſort, &amp;
in ſuch a place, that with the ſame were thrée of his men
ſlaine and ten ſore hurt, and for lacke of winde, the floude
carried him vnder the forecaſtle of a ſhip, of thoſe that wer
not as yet layd aboord, the which had many men. And for
that the ſhippe was higher then the Caruell, who had the
ſame vnder his ſprit ſaile, therefore the enimies did enter,
and handeled our men very ill, for that they altogether did
ſet vpon them. Alſo there was another péece ſhot, with the
which the Maſter of the ſhip was ſlain, being at the helme
gouerning the Caruell, which being thus left at randon,
before that there came any other to the helme, the Caruell
fell vpon certaine Rockes, where ſhe remained till the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile
was ended. The Captaine generall viewing the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
that <hi>Pedro Raphael</hi> was in, commaunded him to bée
ſuccoured, and ſo it was done. Then our men entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Caruell, the which was full of Moores, they behaued
themſelues ſo valyantly,<note place="margin">Here vvas a great ſlaughter of the Por<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tingals in reſpect of other battailes ſought.</note> that they made them flye awaye,
but notwithſtanding all our men that were within y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell
were ſore hurt. In the meane ſpace, all the ſhips of the
enimies were burnt, and this alſo at the laſt, in the which
was burnt great ſtore of Merchaundiſe, for that the ſame
was laden. Which was done the rather, for that vpon the
land there were many of the enimies which wer aſſembled
together. And for that of our men there were many hurt,
the Captain generall came his way with all his Captains
toward their ſhips, where he found that there were ſlaine
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:9295:169"/>
of our men xxv. and hurt an hundred and xxvii. men. But
for all this the victorie was great. For ouer and beſides
the burning of the ſhippes with all their riches, the which
was much, the Captaine generall was giuen to vnderſtand
by the Moores of <hi>Cananor,</hi> (to the which place from thence
he went) that ther were ſlaine in this battell two thouſand
men. With this ſpoyle the king of <hi>Calicut</hi> remained ſo ill
