            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN these queasie and most dangerous times, wherein Truth is manacled by Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Imagination, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man making his owne thoughts a Comment vpon other mens labours, and by scrues or wrests winding euery designe to that which best suites with their fancies: I could not chuse but borrow so much time from the necessitie of mine occasions, as to acquaint you with some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar passages in our voyage: Which though in the value it may be much short both of what your selfe and others expect, because at this time our designe is but an Embrion, conceiued, and farre from that happy perfection to which I doubt not (the diuine will assisting vs) but wee shall, to the comfort of our noble and good friends, and the honour of our Nation, with all prosperitie of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10318:3"/>
bring to passe: Yet in as much as I know the malice of many enuious and euill disposed people,<note place="margin">Against Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters.</note> who build the ground-worke of their owne honors vpon other mens disgraces, and with the venome of their aspersions seeke (as much as in their malice lies) to poyson the worthy labours of the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attempters. To which our Voyage (being most hopefull to our friends, and most dreadfull to our contraries) is infinitely subiect, and that such ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour doth await and follow vs, as the great <hi>Leuia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> of the Sea pursueth the <hi>Bonittos,</hi> I doubt not but my present Relation shall giue you (whose vertue I seeke onely to satisfie) that assurance of good hope in our attemptings, as shall arme you against whatsoeuer slander or imputation shall be able (in misty thicke fogs of disdaine) to throw be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you.</p>
            <p>And albeit to the iudgement of euery vertuous good man, there needeth no other Apologie for the hope of our successe, then the wisdome, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and vndefatigable labors, in the like designes, of our Generall, who now setting all Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; nay, almost the whole world at gaze vpon him, if hee should not to such beholders giue a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned satisfaction, it were against all rules of worth and policie to imagine. Yet aboue all, this mee thinkes should satisfie euery reasonable soule, and make Enuy feede onely vpon his owne Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, when not alone the entyre wisdome of our Land, but the suffrage and allowance of our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne (who is the very soule of that wisdome)
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10318:3"/>
doth both giue way to our action, whose goodnes what man would be so ingratefull to abuse, or what folly could be so strong in any sencible soule, as to seeke to goe inuisible before God.</p>
            <p>But Sir, these arguments are needlesse against a slander of such weaknesse, nor will I trouble your eares with a confutation of them, who stand al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready confounded in all good mens opinions: suffice it, that hitherto our successe is answerable to our hopes, and our hope as strong as any that hath passed from our Kingdome since the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery, and no doubt but the end will bring forth as worthy, if not a much better issue: In as much as wee haue had both the cleare lights of all other mens experience, and the approued knowledge of a great part of our designe in our Generals no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and personall tryall.</p>
            <p>Besides, wee know that the tops of hye Scales, Mountaines, or Pyramides are not to be attained vnto by leaping or iumping at, but by flow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and by secure and safe steps, euen <hi>lento pede,</hi> as the Parrat climbes with both beake and feete: For if wee looke into the courses of all the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men of our Nation which haue made it as famous for sea-actions as any Nation in the world, we shall finde, how euen by little and little, as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibal</hi> with Vinegar wasted the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and made a passage (where neuer any before was discerned) for not himselfe alone, but a whole Army to passe ouer: So our famous and excellent Attempters haue by degrees, man after man, adding step vnto
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10318:4"/>
step, made such a way ouer the whole world, that except the very heart of all, (which as in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of mans body, it is not to be found out, or toucht, till a man haue past through first both all the exteriour and interiour members, and so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise of the braine: Nature as it were defending all her most excellent workes from euery ordinary as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sault and inuasion) so there is at this day not left any Climate vnsearcht or vndiscouered, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, which as for its site and place, being the middle of the world, and also for the excellency of it, may well be stiled <hi>The heart of the world,</hi> as the most principall and renowned part of it. At which if it be our fortunes to arriue, the worke will be worthy the Doer, and a fayre Iewell for his Crowne, who is the Royall Author and Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of so great an Attempt, by so many Kings and Princes attempted, and yet vnachiued.</p>
            <p>And that wee may walke vp this Scale, with as much ease and safety, as all mortall hope can allow vs, let vs turne backe our eyes and looke into the actions of most of the most famous &amp; noble Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen which haue gone before vs, and made those most fayre and large paths, through which we dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly walke: wee shall see that M. <hi>William Haukins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">M. <hi>William Haukins</hi> his trauell.</note> the Father of Sir <hi>Iohn Haukins</hi> a man of infinite vertue and great action made his first Discoueries but to the Southerne Ilands, called the <hi>Grand Canaria,</hi> and found there great Trade, and great Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie: which for the benefit might well haue taken vp the rest of any mans minde (whose end had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:10318:4"/>
beene wealth and no other) but the Gentleman hauing a more worthy ayme, (though then in the winter and last quarter of his age) from thence dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered some part of the small Ilands which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the West Indies, learnt intelligence of the maine and out of his iudgement saw what was fittest both for Traffique and other more materiall Discoueries. This (not able to furnish himselfe) hee imparted to his most worthy Sonne Sir <hi>Iohn Haukins,</hi>
               <note place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi> Trauell.</note> and making him rich with his knowledge, so armd him for the Enterprise, that in the yeare 1562. hee made a Voyage thither, with three small Ships, and but 100. men, and made Discouery of the Iland of <hi>Hispaniola, De Plata, Monte Christi,</hi> and the Ilands of <hi>Caicos,</hi> where by way of traffique hee made such merchandise that hee not onely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all his owne ships, but diuers other Hulkes which he there hyres, and so returned home with more wealth and honour then euer any had done before his time.</p>
            <p>Yet since he had gone not a steppe higher then his father had done before him, and made the scale no larger nor easier for others that should pursue him; out of the excellency of his disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and loue to his Country, in the yeare 1564. hee betooke himselfe to the Sea againe,<note place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohns</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Voyage.</note> and with a Fleet of foure Ships and 170. men, went againe to the West <hi>Indies,</hi> and in his way did discouer the Iland <hi>Sambula,</hi> and other partes of <hi>Affricke</hi>: thence to the Iland called <hi>Sancta Dominica,</hi> so to <hi>Margarita,</hi> thence to <hi>Tortuga,</hi> after to <hi>Barbarotta,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:10318:5"/>
then to the Ilands of <hi>Curasao, Ranchario, Rio de la H<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cha,</hi> and others, thence to Cape S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Anthony,</hi> and so to the sandy Ilands: and lastly by <hi>Florida,</hi> where he showned that excellency of good nature and rare humanity to certaine distressed French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that the remembrance will liue whilst there liues any record of goodnes, or any thankfulnesse in France: and thus hee returned home the second time, laden with as much wealth and honor, as euer any had done before him, and to his braue heroicall scale of Discouery, had now added di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers noble and spacious Stayres, which albeit might haue very well deterd him from any more trouble and vexation, both considering the goods and goodnes he had gotten, and the honourable places, with the fauour of his dearest Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne.</p>
            <p>Yet all this not valued with the debt hee owed his Country,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> third Voyage.</note> he went againe the third time to Sea with a Fleet of sixe faire Ships, and traded in all such places as he had traded in before: and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer discouered <hi>Carthagena,</hi> and diuers other Ilands about it, after went to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn Vllua,</hi> and other parts bordering vpon <hi>Mexico,</hi> where hee made him selfe Maister of twelue Ships, in value, worth two hundred thousand pounds, and seazed the Iland: But out of his noble nature (conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the amity at that time betwixt Spaine and England) restored all againe; which, had his ends tended as much to lucre as his enemies did to perfidie and trechery, he might not onely haue
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:10318:5"/>
brought home that, but sixe millions of treasure more, all which was at his commandement: thence he searched the whole Bay of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and thence went to <hi>Ponte Vedra,</hi> and so returned home.</p>
            <p>In this Discouery hee got great perfection of knowledge touching the wonderfull wealth and riches of those Southerne parts, and though hee had done more then any English man before his time, yet he saw there was a super excellence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayning as it were hidden, and possible to bee found out; at which, with all his endeauours, he aymed most earnestly, onely he found that a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter strength &amp; a greater industry: then either he was yet maister of, or had occasion to vse, must be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the same, and therefore the fourth time hee returned vnto the Sea with 27 tall Ships,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Iohns</hi> fourth Voyage.</note> and 2500. men: But it pleased God the designe should bee preserued either for some other man, or some other time, so that Sir <hi>Iohn Haukins,</hi> falling sicke, dyed at S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Iohn de Puertorico,</hi> and by that meanes the great end of the iourney failed, yet did hee leaue behind him such braue examples for imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so fayre a scale for others to ascend by; that many became his Schollers, and howsoeuer their renownes wanne to themselues particular names of particular eminence, yet they arriued not beyond him, or got a skill that was to him vnac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quianted.</p>
            <p>Onely that most famous and worthy Knight Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> trauell.</note> who had (as it is reported) taken

from him the most and greatest part of his bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, being (as some men say) for a long time his ordinary houshold Seruant, and one that had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him in the successe of some of his voyages, seeing and aquainting himselfe with the happy rules of such a happy maister, betooke himselfe to the Sea in the yeare of our Lord 1572. and disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered most of the hithermost parts of the small Ilands of <hi>America,</hi> and returned home with more knowledge then substance, and yet with more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance then might defray the charge of three times such a voyage, by the strength of which successe he made him selfe fit for the Sea the second time,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis</hi> se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Voyage.</note> in the yeare 1577. in which Voyage hee made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe more familiar with all the richest parts of the West <hi>Indies,</hi> and with some parts of the maine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the same: and so returned home with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent substance, yet farre inferior to the largenes of his mind, because these two first attempts still opened to his iudgement matters of much greater hope and renowned consequence, so that the third time againe he put to Sea, in the yeare of our Lord 1585. with a full resolution to doe somthing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the greatnes of his heart,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Francis</hi> 3.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:10318:6"/>
and infinite labour (not any mortall man hauing formerly done the like) the experience hee gained did so farre precede his riches, that hee made it of no value,and knew that there yet remained that vndiscouered (at least out of Christian commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) which would make all hee knew pittifully poore, &amp; of no reconing: and therfore to achiue this <hi>Magisteri</hi> or true Philosophers stone, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the mother of all mines and perfect treasure, he againe betooke himselfe to the Sca in the yeare of our Lord 1595. with a very goodly Nauy, and many most noble and worthy personages, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly well experienced both in Land and Sea serui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: But it was not the pleasure of the euerliuing God, that by him the worke should bee finished and therefore in this voyage he sickened, and in the West <hi>Indies</hi> died, so that the end of the Iourney being by a twofold way defeyted, as by his death, and the taking of a certaine surgeon which belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to a Ship, called the <hi>Salomon,</hi> as also by the taking of another Ship called the <hi>Francis,</hi> and by them the whole Voyage discouered to the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the rest of the Fleet was inforced to returne home altogether vnsatisfied.</p>
            <p>Now whilst these Gentlemen were thus search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the South and South-west parts of the world, and had almost brought their hopes within a step or two of the highest scale,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Hugh Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loughbies</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uells to the North.</note> an honorable emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion raised vp diuers other Gentlemen of like vertue and fitnes for action, to search into the North and North-west Seas, for the finding out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:10318:7"/>
of the easiest most safe wayes into the East <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> a place esteemed for riches equall with the former: but in merchandise by much far beyond it, and in this Discouery Sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi> was exceeding well deseruing, who made diuers faire steps to the Scale, and though he perished and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the action, yet hee left such excellent hopes behind him that many became pursuers of his proiect, amongst whom none is more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and exquisite then that famous worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, Sir <hi>Martin Forbisher</hi> Knight,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Martin Forbisher</hi> to China.</note> who by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny experiences and intelligences of the state, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Climate, and height, of <hi>China</hi>: knew that if a way might by any industry bee found out from the North-west to lead vnto the same, that then it must needs be most short, most easie, &amp; most safe, and that doubtlesse the wealth which would arise by rich Merchandise from thence, would exceed the whole trade of the world beside, nay that the mines, which was hopefull there to bee found, might goe neere to counteruayle the great hopes which were built on the South-west, if not exceed it. And therevpon hauing all those experiences, which Sir <hi>Hugh Willoughby</hi> had left behind, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with his owne knowledge, he betook himselfe to the Sea in the yeare 1576 with two good Ships, and hauing past the faire Iland, and <hi>Swinborne</hi> in Scotland, he came to <hi>Fowlay</hi> in Friesland, thence to <hi>Labrador,</hi> so to the Ilands <hi>Gabriels</hi> and <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,</hi> where he saw and conferred with many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Iland, being a Sauage people, much
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:10318:7"/>
like vnto the <hi>Tartars,</hi> with broad faces, flat noses, and long blacke hayres below their shoulders, their attire onely Seale skinnes, nor is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the men and women any difference, more then a few blew streakes downe their cheekes and about their eyes, these hee saw on the water, not on the land, in certaine small Boates which were made of Seale skinnes, being sharpe at each end and broad in the bottome, with small wooden keeles made of broad splinters, and in shape or proportion not much vnlike vnto the Spanish Shallops. With these people, whom he inticed to come to him by all faire and gentle meanes, and by giuing them certaine thrid poynts and other toyes, in which they infinitely delighted, hee had very much conference, both touching the nature of those Seas, and other occurrents meet for his Discouery, by whom he vnderstood that the yeare time being then spent, and the Ice in those places infinitely increasing, it was at that time impossible to attempt further, without most assured losse, which accordingly hee found by his owne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and therefore returned homeward by <hi>Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pets</hi> Iland, and other places which both for victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and fresh water he found of great consequence for the furthering of this Discouery hereafter.</p>
            <p>Now hauing thus erected these few steps to this much wisht for Scale, and finding great hope like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ensue vpon the attempt, hee betooke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe againe to the Sea,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Martins</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Voyage to Cataya.</note> in the yeare of our Lord 1577. and taking a better aduantage of the yeare

time, passed all the former places, which before he had discouered and from thence held his course euen vnto the maine of <hi>Cataia,</hi> though with many dangers and interruptions, for not any man that seeketh wayes vnknowne, but must of necessity many times erre, neither can the iudgement be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by the first superficiall sight of the eye, but by a more serious time to contemplate and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate vpon the same, discourse euer crowning all actions with perfection. And hence it came that making a longer stay vpon this Coast, then before hee imagined any necessity would haue drawne him, the yeare time so passed on, that hee could by no possible meanes proceed further in the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery, but was forced to approue what particular profits he could find in that place to recompence his trauell, finding by the Climat &amp; all other good likelihoods that of force there must bee somthing of great valuation, wherevpon after some curious search of many well experienst men in mynerall busines,<note place="margin">Gold Mynes in Cataya.</note> (which at that time attended vpon him) he found at length certaine strange mynes which yeelded a kind of black shining Ore, both massy and wealthy, which they called the blacke stone, and by such small triall as that place (with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of their Shipping) could afford them, they found it a very rich gold Ore, so that not being able to stay there to refine any great quantity thereof, as well for the necessity of the yeare time, as the want of other most necessary prouisions, hee presently laded all his Ships with
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:10318:8"/>
that Oare, being one tall Ship and two smaller Barks, and then taking a man, a woman, and a child of that Country into his Ship also, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with them home into England, to the much contentment of the Queenes Maiesty his Soueraigne, and all other aduenturers which had then shared in his fortunes; and still hee found an increase of his hopes and made his way larger and larger, so that the third time hee put forth to the Sea in the yeare of our Lord 1588.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>St. Martins</hi> third Voyage.</note> But it pleased God that he could not perfect his intent, onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home with much wealth and a great deale of knowledge, which hath since beene pursued by diuers worthy Aduenturers, and though not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in that exquisite height and perfection which the greatnes of their minds and wishes aymed at, yet still it gaue that lustre and strong hope of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in the action, that a very noble and worthy Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Thomas Cauendish</hi> led as well by their former attempts and experiences,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Thomas Cauendish</hi> Trauell.</note> as also by his owne knowledge, drawne from certaine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued assurances and intelligences,touching the wonderfull and almost vnexpressible wealth of <hi>China,</hi> with great iudgement and aduice of many most excellent Seamen, ingaged himselfe into this worthy discouery, and finding many hard difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the North-west passage, by good aduice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued to try the contrary, which is the South-west, knowing that of necessity those lines must in the end meet in one period: And therefore with all good accommodations he betooke himselfe to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10318:9"/>
the Sea in the yeare of our Lord 1586. and passing the <hi>Grand Canaries,</hi> came to <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> and thence to the Tropicke Line, discouering all the hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the East Indies; and from thence at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the very maine and body of <hi>China,</hi> where he fraught his Ships with that wealth (as Cloth of Gold, Tyssue, Veluets, Sattens, Damaskes, and a world of other commodities of no lesse value) that it is thought, excepting <hi>Drake,</hi> not any English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man euer returned with the like wealth, insomuch that it set a world of noble hearts on fire, to enter into the like action.</p>
            <p>But hee hauing compassed an end of his profit, (but not of his experience) refused to returne back againe by one and the same way, but keeping his course forward, went round about the whole Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of the earth; and in the end came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England without any abatement of the great substance hee had formerly attained, to the infinite ioy of all his friends, the great honour of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and the much admiration of all forraine Nations.</p>
            <p>But did this Experience giue him a full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or shew that end to his designes, that hee might with his honour or reputation say with <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules, Ne plus vltra</hi>? No surely, but after a cleane contrary manner, opened vnto him such a fayre way to greater glory and renowne, that he accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this neyther worthy of his beast, nor fit in any small degree to contayne the least part of his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: being in comparison of those things which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10318:9"/>
hee heard there related, (and indeede not farre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from that Continent) but poore, base and beggarly.</p>
            <p>The glory of which famous action so inticed him, that the second time he went to the Sea,<note place="margin">M. <hi>Cauendish</hi> his second Voyage</note> in the yeare of our Lord 1591. so accommodated with all necessary prouisions, both of men, munition, and victuals, that not any Gentleman euer went forth (in his owne particular) better or more brauely prouided. But it pleased God (who is the strength and guide of these actions) not to marke him out for this great worke: for in this Voyage hee sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and dyed, whose greatest directions liuing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed in his owne brest, the Voyage queld, and his ships returned home againe for England, but the infinite profit which hath sprung his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample may be beheld in our East Indian Trade, the like whereof I thinke no Nation in the world can boast, being of all other the wealthiest, the fruitfullest, and the most certaine, affording vs not onely a nurcery of Merchants and Sea-men, but such an inuincible strength of Shipping, and other warlike acoustrements, that any Nation vnder the Sunne may tremble to offend vs.</p>
            <p>To these Discoueries I could adde the Discouery of <hi>Virginia,</hi> by the euer memorable and valiant Knight Sir <hi>Richard Grinuile,</hi>

            <p>FIrst, because no action nor Enterprise can prosper (be it by Sea or Land) without the fauour and assistance of Almighty God, the Lord and strength of Hoasts and Armies, you shall not fayle to cause Diuine Seruice to be read in your Shippe morning and euening, in the morning before Dinner, and at night before Supper, or at least (if there be interruption by soule weather) once the day, praysing God euery night with singing of a Psalme at the setting of the Watch.</p>

And if in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of fire three pieces presently one after another.</p>
            <p>In foule weather euery man shall fit his Sailes to keepe company with the rest of the Fleet, and not run so farre a head by day, but that hee may

            <p>No man shall bord a Ship of the enemy without order, because the losse of a Ship to vs is of more importance, then of ten to the enemy, as also by one mans bording all our Fleet may be ingaged, it being a great dishonour to loose the least of our Fleet.

            <p>The Musketiers deuided into certaine quarters of the Ship shall not deliuer their shot but at such distances as their Commander shall direct them: you shall take a speciall care for the keeping of the Ship cleane betweene the Decks, to haue your Ordnance in order and not cloyd with trunkes, and chests.

            <p>No man shall keepe any feasting or drinking betweene meales, nor drinke any healths on the Ships prouision: Euery Captaine by his Purser, Steward, or other Officer shall take a weekely account how the Victualls wast: The Steward shall not deliuer any Candles to any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate man, or to any priuate vse.</p>
            <p>Whosoeuer shall steale from his fellowes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther apparrell or any thing else, shall be punished as a thiefe, or if any one steale any victualls, either by breaking into the hold, or otherwise, hee shall

            <p>No man shall play at Cards or Dice, either for his Apparill or Armes vpon paine of being disar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, &amp; made a Swabber; and whosoeuer shall shew himselfe a coward vpon any landing or otherwise, hee shall bee disarmed, and made a Labourer and carrier of victualls for the rest.</p>
            <p>No man shall land any men in any forraigne parts, without order from the Generall, the Serge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Mayor or other chiefe Officer, vpon paine of death; and wheresoeuer wee shall haue cause to land, no Man shall force any Woman, bee shee Christian or Heathen vpon paine of death: And you shall take especiall care when God shall suffer vs to land in the <hi>Indies,</hi> not to eat any fruits vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne, such fruits as you doe not find eaten by birds on the tree or beasts vnder the tree you shall auoyd.</p>

which otherwise, will breed a most dangerous fluxe, so will the eating of ouer fat hoggs or Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kies: you shall also haue a great care, that you swim not in any Riuers but where you see the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians swin, because most of the Riuers are full of <hi>Allegators</hi>: you shall not take any thing from any Indian by force, for from thenceforth we shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be releeued; but you must vse them with all courtesie. And for trading or exchanging with them it must be done by one or two of euery Ship for all the rest, and the price to be directed by the Cape Merchant, for otherwise all our commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will bee of small price, and greatly to our hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance.</p>
            <p>For other orders on the Land we will establish them (when God shall send vs thither) by generall consent, in the meane time I will value euery mans honor according to their degree and valor, and taking care for the seruice of God and prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our enterprise.</p>

            <p>Besides, there was seene in a certaine Iland neare the Emperours Court, a Garden of pleasure, in which was all kinde of Garden-hearbs, flowers and trees, of Gold and Siluer.

            <p>The rest I leaue to their iudgement which shall reade what hath beene formerly written of it, or else these few protestations which doe follow.</p>
            <p>First, Sir <hi>Walter Rauleigh</hi> himselfe protest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from his owne sight and knowledge,<note place="margin">Sir <hi>Walters</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the welth of <hi>Guyana.</hi>
               </note> that vpon this maine Riuer in which he sailed, whose branches doe runne and diuide into diuers Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Countries, aboue two thousand miles to the East and West, and eight hundred miles South and North, a man may see as many seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Kingdomes and Prouinces as may satisfie any industrious iudgement whatsoeuer; and of them, the most, eyther rich in Gold or in other Merchandise: that in this place the Souldier may fight for Gold, and pay himselfe in stead of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:10318:21"/>
pence with plates of gold a foot broad: that the Commanders which shoot at honor and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, may finde there more beautiful Cities, more Temples adorned with Golden Images, more Sepulchers filled with Treasure, the ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was found in <hi>Mexico</hi> or <hi>Peru</hi>: and that the shining glory of this Conquest would eclypse all the beames of the Spanish Nation.</p>
            <p>Also hee saith, there is no Country which yeeldeth more pleasure to the Inhabitants, for the delights of Hunting, Hawking, Fishing, Fowling, and the rest, then these Lands which hee saw did. They haue also so many plaines, cleare Riuers, abundance of Pheasants, Partrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Quailes, Rayles, Cranes, Herons, and all other Fowle: Deere of all sorts, Porkes, Hares, Lyons, Tygers, Leopards, and diuers other sorts of Beasts eyther for chase or foode, that no Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world can exceede them.</p>
            <p>And to conclude, hee saith, that both for health, good Ayre, pleasure and riches, it is not to be equald by any Region eyther in the East or West: and that there is in it great store of Brasill-wood, and diuers Berryes which dye a most perfect Crimson and Carnation; and for painting, not all France, Italy, nor the East-Indies yeeld any such, for the more the skinne is washed, the fairer the colour appeareth.</p>
            <p>Also there is great store of Cotton, of Silke, of Balsamum, and of those kindes most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and neuer knowne in <hi>Europe.</hi> There are

all sorts of Gummes, of Indian Pepper, besides what the Country may afford in wardly, which hee had not leasure to search, is yet vnknowne. Also the Soyle is so excellent and so full of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, that it will beare Sugar, Ginger, and all commodities that the West Indies hath.</p>
            <p>Now for the easinesse of the Nauigation, hee saith it may be sayled in sixe weekes thither,<note place="margin">Ensines for Nauigation.</note> and in sixe weekes backe againe: and by the way neyther be shoare, enemies coast, rockes, nor sands; all which other Voyages are subject vnto.</p>
            <p>Also hee saith, the best time to sayle from England thither, is in Iuly, because the Summer in <hi>Guiana</hi> is in October, Nouember, December, Ianuary, February, and March, and so shipping may returne from thence in Aprill, and arriue at home in England, in Iune; and by that means neuer be subiect to winter weather, eyther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, going, or staying, which no doubt is an excellent comfort to all men that shall vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the Action.</p>
            <p>And thus much touching his worthy and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Relation, who being an eye-witnesse, would not for his honour and vertues sake abuse his Soueraigne with vntruths.</p>
            <p>Now let vs see what the Spanyards say of this rich Kingdome. First, <hi>Alonso,</hi>
               <note place="margin">The testimony of the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards for the wealth of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</note> a chiefe Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in the <hi>Grand Canaria,</hi> saith; that there was a Land newly discouered, called <hi>Nueuo Dorado,</hi> in which was abundance of Gold, and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full riches aboue imagination: that the course
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:10318:23"/>
to fall with it, was fifty leagues to the winde-ward to the <hi>Marguarita.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Againe hee saith in another affirmation, that in <hi>Nueuo Dorado</hi> lately found out there was gold in that abundance, as the like hath neuer formerly beene heard of, nor was any part of the world to be compared with it; and the like affirmeth <hi>Domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go de Vera</hi> who was Campe Maister and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall for <hi>Anthony Bereo</hi> in this Discouery, and no lesse saith <hi>Rodrigo de Caranca</hi> Register for the Sea, and many others: So that to conclude your trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the tediousnes of my weary discourse,<note place="margin">The conclusion</note> this Empire is that rich <hi>Magazany</hi> which yet hath her Maidenhead neuer sackt, turn'd, nor wrought, the face of the earth hath not beene turnd nor the vertue and salt of the soyle spent by manurance, The graues haue not beene opened for Gold, the Mines not broken with the sledge or pickaxe, nor their Images puld downe out of their Temples. It hath neuer beene entred by any army of strength, and neuer conquered or possessed by any Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Prince: Besides by the report of all former Discouerers, especially our Generall, it is so defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and easie to bee kept from the assaults of any inuaders, that if two Forts bee builded in one of the Prouinces which he beheld and tooke especiall note of; the flood setteth in so neere the banke where the channell also lyeth that no Ship can passe vp, but within a pikes length, of the artillery, first of the one, and afterwards of the other, which two Forts he supposeth will bea sufficient guard,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10318:24"/>
both to the Empire of <hi>Inga,</hi> and to one hundred other seuerall Kingdomes, all lying within the great Riuer of <hi>Orenoque,</hi> euen to the Citty of <hi>Quito</hi> in <hi>Peru.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Empire if it shall please God to make the King our Maister Soueraigne, what honor and reward it will bring him and his Subiects may easily bee coniectured by what is before written; and since it is or may bee vndertaken by his owne vassaile, and one who is bound in extraordinary bonde more then euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Subiect, to spend the vttermost of his life in the same, no doubt but hee will effect it with that wisedome, diligence, and care which shall bee sutable to the greatnes of the action, and the trust reposed, being thus far forth further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by <hi>Anthonio Bereo</hi> the Spaniard, who in great earnestnes, and vpon his Soules health pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,<note place="margin">A strange Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie.</note> that hee had seene amongst diuers most an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Prophesies in <hi>Peru</hi> (at such time as that Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was reduced to the Spanish obedience) one that affirmed, that from <hi>Inglatierra</hi> (which is to say, England) those <hi>Ingas</hi> should bee againe in time to come restored and deliuered from the seruitude of the former Conquerors, and this hee auowed to haue seene in diuers or their most prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall and chiefest Temples, preserued with great reuerence and care, and till this day beleeued of all the Indians: Now an entrance in former yeares our Generall did make, as you haue read, with that successe that not any before or since hath euer e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10318:24"/>
&amp; displanted the first garrisons, if then now he succeed and haue fortune answerable to his rare wisedome, industry and direction, whether it bee in this nor any other to himselfe onely concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, there is no doubt but (God assisting) hee will with such honor and high thoughts, passe and go thorow the same, that his nation shall haue praise, his friendes comfort, and himselfe the true ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uancement of his merits.</p>
            <p>But to giue you a little tast of what hath succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in our present Iourney, you shall vnderstand that we departed from <hi>Plimouth</hi> to <hi>Corke</hi> in Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where after some refreshment wee set saile out of the riuer of <hi>Corke,</hi> and thence sailed more then three Moneths before we came to the Coast of <hi>Guiana,</hi> which albeit generally it bee euer run in seauen or eight weekes, yet were the windes so strangely crosse vnto vs, (a thing seldome seene in that passage) that in lesse time we could not effect our purpose: So that vpon the seaventh day of Nouember last past, 1617. wee discouered the Coast of <hi>Guiana,</hi> during which time of our being at Sea, we had a great visitation of Sicknesse, so that many were sicke, and some are dead, amongst which, the most eminent persons that dyed were these. Captaine <hi>Iohn Pygot</hi> our Lieftenant Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, worthy Captaine <hi>Hastings,</hi> my Lord of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington,</hi> brother, a Gentleman of so much fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward hope, and goodnes, that he was couerd with many tears, and much mourning; also there died Maister <hi>Talbot</hi> Scholler, which hath been long im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:10318:25"/>
by our Generall; M <hi>Newhall,</hi> the maister Chirurgeon of our Generalls Ship, and others, with which I will not trouble your eares.</p>
            <p>Vpon the discouering of the Coast, we came into the faire Riuer of <hi>Caltana,</hi> being (as it appeareth to me) a branch of <hi>Oerenoque,</hi> where my Lord, our Generall cast Anchor, and doth purpose to refresh his sick men, and to take in fresh water and other necessary prouisions, of which that Coast abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, and so to proceed in his enterprise which God in his mercy prosper, for our hopes euery day grow stronger and stronger. This part of <hi>Guiana</hi> in which we now are, is to me a very Paradise, and so excellent in all perfections and beauties, that Nature seemes only here to haue her Temple; we haue euen now (being the Month of Nouember) a much more delicate Sommer, then is in England at Mid-sommer, the Sun and Ayre so wholsome &amp; pleasant without offence or scorching, the trees &amp; ground so brauely flourishing, and euery thing in Generall so absolute and full of fruitfull promise, that more cannot be by man desired: for mine own part I dare assure you, that in my life time I neuer saw or tasted more strange, more delicate, &amp; more pleasant fruits, then heere we may continually ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in most infinite aboundance, being besides so wondrous wholsome and vnoffensiue, that I haue not heard any complaine either of surfet, or other accidentall sicknes, as wormes, fluxes &amp; such like, which commonly follow the much eating of sweet and pleasant fruit. To enter into a Description of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10318:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the beautifull prospect of this Country which wee now see, although it be but the out-borders and skirts of the Empire, so nearer a neighbour to the maine Ocean, that in reason it should promise the least fertilitie; yet I say againe, to describe the goodlinesse thereof, the brauery of the Hils, and comlinesse of the vallies, both shadowed and ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with goodly tall green trees; the pleasantnesse and coolnesse of the Riuers which runne and mixe themselues in the most conuenientest places, plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully stored with fish of seuerall natures; the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of rare coloured Birds which flie vp and down in euery place about vs, no colour almost vnder the Sun but being reuealed in their feathers: were to draw a Landskip of that excellent perfection, which no Art could better, hardly imitate. For truely hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto to mine eye this Country hath appeared a very earthly Paradise, and therefore doubtlesse is full of strong promises, that our attemptings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not returne without much honour and reward, a rent hopefully due to euery such noble action. But since it yet resteth in hope, I will leaue it to the will and direction of the great GOD of Heauen: To whose protection I refer you, with this assurance, that as our successe shall happen, and the action either decrease or diminish, so you shall by writing more amply vnderstand thereof.</p>
